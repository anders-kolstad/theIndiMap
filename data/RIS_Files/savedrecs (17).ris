AB  - The course of the research has been specified the regional list of Gherkin hybrid cucumber diseases. It is established that the dominant position in the pathogenic community of this vegeTable crop when growing under open ground conditions is occupied by the population of oomycetes representative (fungi-like organisms) - downy mildew or powdery mildew (Pseudoperonospora cubensis). In the research area, the nature of the dynamics of the primary disease's development and spread was actively changing, particularly downy mildew - from moderate to vigorous. Calculated correlation coefficients between the intensity of downy mildew spread and the main abiotic stress factors of June-July proved the direct dependence of this indicator on the decadal values of average daily and minimum air temperatures; the reverse dependence on the decadal maximum values of air temperatures, its relative humidity and "dew points". It is established that optimal for infection and reinfection of plants under conditions of the Left-Bank Forest-Steppe of Ukraine is a specific temperature regime of the first second decades of July - with a sharp fluctuation of maximum and minimum temperatures, which maximally activates the process of moisture condensation from the air and forms the duration of preservation of drop-liquid moisture on the plant's leaf

AB  - In this article, we examine the structure of the subjective well-being and its relation to objective well-being indicators using the data from the European Union's Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) from Serbia. This is one of the first papers to analyze a new module on subjective well-being from EU-SILC micro-dataset (with over 20,000 respondents). We investigate the factor structure of the items and the differences in the association of subjective well-being dimensions with objective indicators of well-being within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Better Life Initiative framework. Three factors emerge from the principal components analysis: general life satisfaction, affective well-being, and satisfaction with the local environment. The analysis further reveals that life satisfaction is more related to the material living conditions, such as income, unemployment, and housing conditions, while affective well-being is more related to non-material indicators of well-being such as perceived health, personal security, and social connections. On the other hand, positive and negative affect within the affective well-being are not clearly separable, nor is the eudaimonic indicator from either life satisfaction or affective well-being.

AB  - Organisms with different life histories are able to act as indicators of different characteristics of their environment. Here, we compared the precision of habitat indication by the vegetation and soil microbial communities in four salt-affected pastures: annual open salt sward, Pannonic Puccinellia limosa hollow, Artemisia saline puszta and grassy saline puszta. Dissimilarity of habitats was evaluated by standardized principal component analysis (PCA) based on four different datasets: catabolic profiles of microbial communities in June (a) and September (b), composition of vascular vegetation (c) and physical and chemical properties of the soil (d). Procrustes analysis was used to quantify the resemblance between pairs of PCA ordinations based on soil properties (d) and various biotic communities (a, b, c). PCA ordination based on vegetation most closely matched the soil data-based ordination, thus vegetation appears to better indicate habitat conditions than soil microbial communities do. For microbial communities, a better agreement with the soil data-based ordination was reached in September than in June. Most probably, the long-lived sedentary habit of perennial plants in these communities requires adaptation to long-term average habitat conditions. In contrast, short-lived soil microbes can quickly follow environmental changes, thus the composition of soil microbial communities better reflect actual soil conditions.

AB  - This work aims to determine the response of Hypogymnia physodes (L.) Nyl. (hooded tube lichen) collected in an unpolluted site (Yenice Forest in Karabiik, Turkey) to stress conditions. In the present study, the effect of exposure to different heavy metals (Cd+2, Pb+2, and Cr+6) for different durations and UV radiations dosages on lichen was examined at the physiological and molecular levels. The effects of stress conditions were determined in the case of different parameters concerning heavy metal, protein, chlorophyll, and carotenoid contents and changes in the DNA profiles. According to the results obtained that exposure to heavy metals and UV radiations leads to a physiological response in a concentration and dose-dependent manner through differences in chlorophyll, protein content in heavy metals and UV treated lichen specimen. Furthermore, changes in RAPD assay and DNA methylation analysis showed that homologous nucleotide sequences in the genome from untreated and stress conditions treated lichen specimen showed different band patterns and methylation under heavy metals and UV stress. The results determined that lichen specimen suggest as a possible bioindicator able to measure the biological effects of heavy metal pollution and damage to UV radiation.

AB  - Honest advertisement models posit that only individuals in good health can produce and/or maintain ornamental traits. Even though disease has profound effects on condition, few studies have experimentally tested its effects on trait expression and even fewer have identified a mechanistic basis for these effects. Recent evidence suggests that black and white, but not grey, plumage colors of black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) are sexually selected. We therefore hypothesized that birds afflicted with avian keratin disorder, a condition that affects the beak and other keratinized tissues, would show reduced expression of black and white, but not grey, color. UV-vis spectrometry of black-capped chickadees affected and unaffected by avian keratin disorder revealed spectral differences between them consistent with this hypothesis. To elucidate the mechanistic bases of these differences, we used scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and a feather cleaning experiment. SEM showed extreme feather soiling in affected birds, and EDX revealed that this was most likely from external sources. Experimentally cleaning the feathers increased color expression of ornamental feathers of affected, but not unaffected, birds. These data provide strong evidence that black and white color is an honest indicator in chickadees, and that variation in feather dirtiness, likely due to differences in preening behavior is a mechanism for this association.

AB  - We explore the sustainability of the small pelagics fishery in the northern Adriatic sea, northeastern Italy, by means of a bioeconomic Simulation model. This model reproduces the biological and economic conditions in which the fisheries Occur. Starting from an initial condition (2004), the simulation model incorporates the biological and economic processes of the resources and the fishing fleet and computes the most probable future trajectory of the system under different management conditions. We analysed the projection of selected indicators (biomass, recruitment, catches, profits) under four different management scenarios based on effort control, and we assessed the performance of these management measures against the Current Situation. The four scenarios were: i) increase in fuel price, ii) reduction in fuel price, iii) limiting the number of days at sea, and iv) extending the fishing period. Each management event was introduced in the third year of the Simulation. For each scenario a stochastic simulation was carried Out. Our results show that the impact of each management measure tested was not homogeneous across the fleet. In particular, comparatively smaller vessels generally display narrower profit margins and tend to be more sensitive to negative shocks, reinforcing the idea that management measures should be calibrated by stratifying the fleet before implementation.

AB  - Historically, desert mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus crooki) were distributed across the Chihuahuan Desert region in Mexico. Overgrazing and illegal hunting have been responsible for the dramatic reduction in the desert mule deer population. Through the introduction of hunting fees, desert mule deer could represent an important source of income for Mexican producers. In addition it could stimulate programs favoring sustainable management of Chihuahuan Desert ecosystems. Twenty sample units were established across Chihuahuan Desert regions in Coahuila and Nuevo Leon, Mexico. The deer population in each unit was surveyed using diurnal and nocturnal transects. Pellet group counts were conducted to provide an additional index to deer density. In each sampling unit, 50 2 X 5 in plots were established. Vegetation cover and diversity were also determined. We used range indicators to establish vegetation condition and trend. Correlation analyses were used to evaluate relationships between the deer population and habitat variables. Desert mule deer were present in only two of the sampling units. Range condition was at risk in 18 of the 20 sampled areas and poor in the other 2. Grass cover (%) (r = 0.56), ground cover (r = 0.53), range deterioration index (r = -0.29) and downward trend index (r = -0.42) were the highest correlated variables with mule deer occurrence.

AB  - The purpose of the study is to check the relationship between the occurrence of Harris lines and the morphological differentiation of the long bones of the human skeleton as an indicator of living conditions. The bone material (233 adult individuals, including 120 males and 113 females) was collected at a mediaeval burial ground in Cedvriia, Poland. Recommended methods were applied to estimate the sex and age of the individuals (Ferembach et al 1979; Buikstra & Ubelaker 1994). The results obtained indicate that there is no clear relationship between metric characteristics of the Studied long bones and the Occurrence of Harris lines. Adverse environmental factors, which triggered the occurrence of Harris lines did not strongly affect the growth of long bones and did not change their morphology. Regardless of the phase of ontogenetic development in which the arrested growth lines (HL) formed, no effect of this fact oil the final length of bones was observed. Similarly, no statistically significant differences were found in the proportions of bones between individuals reacting to adverse living conditions with the formation of Harris lines and those, whose bones ere free of Harris lines. One may assume that Harris lines are of significance in epidemiological research and when assessing the general health profile of a population, but they are less useful in research on morphological reactions of individuals to living conditions.

AB  - In animal farming, an automatic and precise control of environmental conditions needs information from variables derived from the animals themselves, i.e. they act as biosensors. Rectal temperature (RT) and respiratory rate (RR) are good indicators of thermoregulation in pigs. Since there is a growing concern on animal welfare, the search for alternatives to measure RT has become even more necessary. This research aimed to identify the most adequate body surface areas, on nursery-phase pigs, to take temperature measurements that best represent the correlation of RT and RR. The main experiment was carried out in a climate chamber with five 30-day-old littermate female Landrace x Large White piglets. Temperature conditions inside chamber were varied from 14 degrees C up to 35.5 degrees C. The measurements were taken each 30 minutes, over six different skin regions, using a temperature data logger Thermochron iButton (R) - DS1921G (Tb) and an infrared thermometer (Ti). As shown by the results, the tympanic region is the best one for RT and RR monitoring using an infrared thermometer (TiF). In contrast, when using temperature sensors, the ear (TbE) is preferred to be used for RT predictions and the loin region (TbC) for RR.

AB  - The handicap principle proposes that sexual signals must be costly to be honest. Honesty may be maintained by the costs paid by honest signallers or by the potential costs of cheating. In the latter, handicaps should emerge as a consequence of specific biological constraints, such as life-history trade-offs. Nuptial prey-giving arthropods are good systems to investigate the honesty of sexual signals taking into account trade-offs between self-maintenance and mating effort. We experimentally evaluated if prolonged food shortage during early adulthood imposes long-term negative effects on gift construction by males of the spider Paratrechalea ornata. We also evaluated whether a burst of food availability improved body condition of poorly fed males, increasing their frequency of gift construction. Poorly fed males hardly constructed gifts, even after a marked increase in feeding rate, which clearly improved their body condition. Moreover, initially poorly fed males that latter received high food intake constructed lighter gifts than continuously well fed males. The long-term effects of prolonged dietary restriction on male propensity to construct a gift and on the size of this gift may increase the honesty of this sexually selected signal. From the female's perspective the offer of a gift may bring information on male quality.

AB  - Using a refined quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay, we compared surface and bottom water concentrations of Vibrio vulnificus with total Vibrio spp. concentrations, fecal indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli and Enterococcus sp.), and environmental parameters (salinity, temperature, chlorophyll a, and turbidity) over 4 years at a mesohaline site in the Neuse River Estuary in North Carolina. V. vulnificus was not detected when water temperature was below 20 A degrees C and 93 % of positive samples were from salinities 10-20 psu. V. vulnificus was detected in 50 % of summer samples with peak concentrations in summer bottom waters. Significant positive correlations for V. vulnificus and temperature, salinity, and bacterial group abundance were found. Significant negative correlations with chlorophyll a were also observed. Interannual comparisons indicated a significant decrease in mean V. vulnificus since 2005, corresponding with increasing salinity due to severe drought conditions in 2007 and 2008. Total Vibrio spp. abundance also decreased in 2007 but returned to the previously observed abundance by 2008. Although a significant positive relationship between total Vibrio spp. and V. vulnificus was documented, interannual comparisons indicate that total Vibrio spp. densities may not be indicative of V. vulnificus in all environmental conditions and that long-term drought conditions may alter community composition.

AB  - Vegetation cover in catchments in semi-arid environments with distinct rain seasons is important in influencing water quality and availability through its effect on runoff and groundwater recharge. This study assessed catchment-scale vegetation cover and condition, indicated by land degradation and vegetation vigour, using recent rain season Landsat TM/ETM+ images supplemented by dry season images for comparison. Image classification into vegetation density categories was used in mapping land degradation, the bare land category used as indicator. Vegetation vigour indicates vegetation productivity levels, and has been shown to correlate with the NDVI in similar previous studies. The 30 savanna biome vegetation types in the catchment were used as strata for assessing relative vigour using NDVI values. The NDVI frequency distributions per vegetation stratum were normal (Gaussian), the location of whose peaks enabled comparisons. Land degradation could be mapped with certainty mainly in the vicinity of settlements. Rivers draining through degraded areas had elevated colour and turbidity values. As the NDVI profiles per vegetation type could be explained by the land use and landscape position context of the vegetation types, NDVI profiling proved useful for assessing vegetation condition. NDVI profiling of vegetation types is potentially useful in monitoring savanna vegetation condition using remotely sensed images.

AB  - Aims: To investigate the survival of cultivable bacteria in the tropical Bangpakong estuary (Eastern Thailand) under different salinities and light conditions.
   Methods and Results: Dark and light microcosm experiments using membrane diffusion chambers were carried out under three different experimental conditions, namely (i) low salinity, (ii) progressive mixing with brackish water and (iii) fast mixing with high salinity water spiked with raw urban sewage. Faecal coliforms declined faster than faecal enterococci, as shown by survival T-90 values ranging from 82.2 +/- 4.2 to 14.5 +/- 0.8 h and 97.5 +/- 0.4-20.6 +/- 1.2 h, respectively. The survival of freshwater heterotrophic bacteria was higher but variable (121 2 +/- 5.0-30.1 +/- 14.3 h), whereas that of heterotrophic marine bacteria was rather stable (81.5 +/- 4.2-44.6 +/- 2.5 h).
   Conclusions: Overall survival was higher in low salinities. Light had a further deleterious effect, since it accelerated the decay of faecal indicators, particularly in high salinities. Faecal enterococci had a higher resistance to environmental conditions compared with faecal coliforms.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: This study is relevant to the understanding of the behaviour of different faecal indicator bacteria and the optimization of sewage treatment plants aimed at the reduction and or elimination of faecal load discharged into estuarine waters submitted to salinity variations.

AB  - In plant ecology, site is a central concept. A site is the place where a plant species or plant community grows, and the site provides the set of conditions in which it lives. Within an initially homogeneous parent material, gravity-driven groundwater flow influences the site conditions through the spatial distribution of nutrients and other relevant chemical agents. Especially upward seepage may produce and maintain site conditions that are essential for various relatively rare plant species and communities. Increased attention to upward seepage among ecologists has resulted in cooperation with hydrologists and the emergence of a discipline of its own - eco-hydrology - on the boundary of two scientific fields, linked by the site concept.
   n the Netherlands, a simple classification of water types, based on the groundwater's subsurface history, was applied for compiling a nationwide geographical database on ecologically relevant upward seepage, Correspondence analyses of this database with data on plant-species occurrence demonstrate that in poor Pleistocene sandy soils upward seepage explains the occurrence of some species and communities quite well, whereas in fluvial plains and polder areas with richer clay soils the influence of seepage is blurred by the importance of soil characteristics. It is concluded, there fore, that plant species may be used as seepage indicators in rapid assessments and surveys, but that constant awareness of the limitations is required.

TI  - Interpolation Method for Visual Simulation of Engine Exhaust Flame

AB  - Propulsive force and exhaust fluid temperature are important indicators in the performance of an engine. An investigation of the effects of propellant composition, plane flight conditions, and engine operating environment on rocket thrust and the range of smoke plume temperature can provide references in the design of engine mechanics at the optimization of propellant composition, in monitoring of target identification and in the evolving of stealth of stealth technology. In order to understand the characteristics of the engine tail flame, a visual simulation of the engine tail flame was carried out by combining the engine operating conditions with the tail flame conditions. Based on the advantages of the bicubic spline interpolation algorithm and the Kriging interpolation algorithm, this paper proposes a hybrid interpolation algorithm, which performs color mapping and three-dimensional space separation in the engine plume data set and model, and visualizes the engine and engine plume. The simulation realizes real-time monitoring of the functions of various engine components through characteristic colors. The research results show that the hybrid interpolation method can effectively visualize the engine exhaust flame. The simulated plume has a relatively obvious temperature peak at 0.7 m, and the temperature of the plume flow field is significantly higher than that of the frozen plume flow field by about 200 similar to 1000 K. This shows that the algorithm in this paper helps to visualize the expression of engine tail flame information.

AB  - This study demonstrated that it is possible to differentiate wild boars living in habitats with different animal densities by the measurement of oxidative stress markers. Therefore, reactive oxygen metabolites, the antioxidant barrier, i.e., the biological antioxidant potential and the antioxidative power (OXY-Adsorbent), as well as cortisol were measured in freely ranging wild boars. In two different areas of a State Forest in the Campania Region (Italy), 42 freely ranging, managed wild boars were captured with a corral trap, and blood samples were collected. The wild boars were divided by age (>1 year old and <1 year old) and sex (male and female). Animals in one area showed significantly higher values of oxidative stress parameters than those living in the other area. The annual boar censuses of areas highlighted a higher population density in the first area than in the second one, and this would explain the results obtained. Since the health or nutritional status of animals is reflected by oxidative stress, wild boars in areas with higher animal densities may live under worse conditions than animals in areas with lower densities which becomes evident by measuring oxidative stress markers. As cortisol in blood is only reflecting a short period, the measurement of oxidative stress level may be a better indicator to evaluate the living conditions of wild boars.

AB  - Identifiability and equifinality are two interrelated concepts in mathematical modeling. The derivation of the Hessian matrix becomes crucial when the condition number is used as a diagnostic indicator for identifiability. The covariance-inverse (CI) method was proposed to derive the Hessian matrix via the inverse matrix of covariance. The covariance matrix is calculated directly from the posterior parameter samples. Compared with two existing methods, i.e., difference quotients (DQ) and quasi-analytical (QA), CI is more efficient and reliable. The CI method was then used for identifiability diagnosis on a soil greenhouse gas emission (SoilGHG) model. The model as a whole was poorly identified, but a reduced model with fewer parameters could become identifiable, which is called "conditionally identifiable" in this paper. The geometric mean condition numbers in terms of sorted singular values of the full Hessian matrix could be adopted as criteria to determine at most how many undetermined parameters might be included in an identifiable or weakly identifiable model. The combinations of parameters that made the model identifiable were also determined by the proposed diagnosis method. We addressed the importance of understanding both identifiability and equifinality in ecosystem modeling. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many species respond to risks and benefits of dispersal that vary over the short term through condition-dependent dispersal. We used wind tunnels to investigate how abiotic factors, spiderling age, and indicators of environmental quality affect aerial dispersal behaviour of spiderlings in Dolomedes triton (Walckenaer) (Araneae: Pisauridae), a denizen of temporary habitats. More than half of all spiderlings exhibited preballooning, ballooning, or spanning behaviours. Warm temperatures (>22.5 degrees C) and low wind speeds (<2.0 m/second) increased aerial dispersal. Aerial dispersal behaviour increased significantly until 5 days after hatch, after which it decreased, coinciding with the onset of active hunting by spiderlings. In contrast, cues about ambient food availability (egg sac number and food limitation of the mother) and potential resource competition or risk of cannibalism (conspecific density) did not affect aerial dispersal propensity. Offspring from different females ballooned in different proportions, except at the peak of dispersal, but a female's reproductive output and propensity of her offspring to balloon were uncorrelated. Thus, it appears that spiderlings of D. triton adopt a fixed strategy of high dispersal rate under optimal abiotic conditions, rather than reducing dispersal in response to cues about local food availability or conspecific density.

AB  - The successful implementation of habitat conservation measures demands regular and spatially explicit monitoring and reporting on conservation status at a range of scales, based on indicators of both habitat range and condition (structure and functions required for long-term maintenance). Such is the case with the Natura 2000 protected areas in Europe. Focusing on the cork oak (Quercus suber) forests of one such area, the Serra de Monchique in southern Portugal, we test the complementarity and joint effectiveness of airborne multispectral and laser scanning (lidar) in providing robust indicators of conservation status. Principal forest types and other land covers are mapped to an accuracy of up to 70% (11 land cover classes) and 81% (5 classes) by fusing the two remote sensing datasets, results that are superior to using either one alone. Using previously tested relationships between lidar height metrics, forest vegetation structure and species diversity, we develop a map predicting areas of high (22% of area), medium (25%) and low (53%) condition. We recommend the further development and testing of remotely sensed range and condition indicators of conservation status for their application in important forested sites across Europe and beyond.

AB  - The occurrence of azurocytes (AZ), a type of leukocyte unique to voles and previously described for three Microtus species, is now reported in Microtus agrestis. The goal of this study was to shed new light on the possible function and significance of these cells and on how they play a role in the natural history of rodent species. Individuals from three vole populations were sampled monthly for 2 years. A hemogram was produced for each individual, and AZ counts estimated. The counts of AZ were much higher in pregnant females, and these levels were higher the higher the past vole density. Males had low prevalences and counts, both for breeding and nonbreeding individuals, but they showed a seasonality that varied with age, body condition, and current and past vole density. Also, the occurrence of AZ in males was more likely after they had had low levels of indicators of condition, suggesting that azurocytes may result from a response to infection. Hence, overall our results suggest that, in females, these cells may be important for reproduction and may have a role in inducing abortion when conditions are not favorable, while in males they might be a response to infection.

AB  - Elaborate male and female plumage can be maintained by mutual sexual selection and function as a mate-choice or status signal in both sexes. Both male and female Turquoise-browed Motmot (Eumomota superciliosa) have long tails that terminate in widened blue-and-black rackets that appear to hang, unattached, below the body of the bird. I tested whether mutual sexual selection maintains the Turquoise-browed Motmot's elaborate tail plumage by testing the prediction that mating occurs in an assortative manner for tail plumage. I also tested whether assortative mating occurs for body size, a potential measure of dominance, and for phenotypic condition, a measure of individual quality. Assortative mating was measured (1) within all pairs in the study population, (2) within newly formed pairs, and (3) within experimentally induced pairs that formed after removal of females from stable pairs. Assortative mating was not found for tail plumage, body size, or phenotypic condition in any of these samples. Therefore, there was no support for the "mutual sexual selection" hypothesis. I discuss the hypothesis that the tail is sexually selected in males only, and that natural selection accounts for the evolutionary maintenance of the elaborate female tail.

KW  - IDENTIFICATION
AB  - Sweet fortified wines, traditionally aged under strong oxidation conditions, have a characteristic aroma. An experimental study investigated the aging of white sweet fortified wines under various conditions. The development of various molecules, previously identified as characteristic of the aroma of this type of wine, was monitored by analysis. The development of these compounds during accelerated aging was affected by oxidation and the color of the wine. Aging in oak containers, variable storage temperatures, and variable modes of oxidation affect the formation of many of the volatile compounds responsible for the aging aroma of vins doux naturels (fortified wines). Furfural (1), 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (2), and sotolon (3) always reach concentrations above their perception thresholds in wood-aged wines, especially when new oak is used. The isomers of methyl-gamma-octalactone (4 and 5) are reliable indicators of aging in oak. Among the many identifiable volatile phenols, only the vanillin (7) content increases with aging, particularly if the container is made of wood and there is a high degree of oxidation. This molecule frequently reaches and even exceeds its perception threshold. We show here that vanillin and isomers of methyl-gamma-octalactone have a major impact on the aromas of fortified wines.

AB  - The feasibility of using Buzzards found dead as indicators of environmental contamination was tested. Liver, kidney, and tibia specimens were examined for the presence of Cd, Cu, Pb, Mn, and Fe, which were used as markers. All buzzards submitted to the Veterinary Institute in 1992 were examined for cause of death and condition. Results showed that more than half had been poisoned or shot. As the condition of the birds worsened, fat reserves were depleted before protein reserves. Concentrations of the heavy metals rose in liver and kidney as nutrient reserves fell. Since the content of heavy metal per organ was not related to body condition, content was considered a better measure for biomonitoring. The concentrations of Cd, Cu, Pb, Mn, or Fe measured in buzzards were not toxic. In several places buzzards had recently ingested relatively large amounts Cd and/or Pb. Buzzards with high contents of Cd, Cu, Pb, and Mn were found in areas having more than average contamination. The North-South gradient in aerosol deposition and soil content of heavy metals (especially Cd & Pb) was reflected in the Buzzard. We concluded that the Buzzard is a suitable and cost-effective biomonitor, to investigate the bioavailability of ecocontaminants in large areas, to signal gross changes in food webs, and to monitor raptor persecution.

AB  - Population structures of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) isolated from catch basins, a constructed wetland, and feces from a beef cattle feedlot were compared over a two-year period. Enterococcus hirae accounted for 92% of the fecal isolates, whereas secondary environments were characterized by greater relative abundance of environmentally adapted species including Enterococcus casseliflavus. While enterococci densities in the catch basins and wetland were similar under wet and drought conditions, E. hirae predominated during rainy periods, while E. casseliflavus predominated during drought conditions. Environmentally adapted species accounted for almost half of the erythromycin resistant enterococci isolated from the wetland. Densities of Escherichia coli were also comparable during wet versus drought conditions, and the relative abundance of strains from environmentally adapted Glades was greater in secondary environments compared to feces. Unlike enterococci, fewer environmentally adapted E. coli strains were isolated on selective media containing ceftriaxone from the wetland compared to feces, suggesting resistance to this antibiotic may not be well maintained in the absence of selective pressure. Overall, these findings suggest that secondary environments select for environmentally adapted FIB. While these species and Glades tend to be of limited clinical relevance, they could potentially serve as reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance.

AB  - Here we sought to determine whether a nonsocial cage enrichment program, identical to one we previously used with male rats, was effective in reducing heart rate or systolic blood pressure (SBP) in female Sprague Dawley rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Young adult rats, each instrumented with a radiotelemetry pressure transmitter, were housed individually under enriched or nonenriched conditions. Heart rate and SBP were monitored at 5- and 1-min intervals, respectively, when the rats were undisturbed or after several different types of experimental manipulations some of which are considered stressful. Cage enrichment did not significantly alter heart rate or SBP of undisturbed rats in either strain at any time during the day or night. However, activity of female SHR was increased in the afternoon and at night under enriched conditions compared with nonenriched conditions. The enrichment program did not significantly reduce heart rate or SBP responses to most acute manipulations in either strain. However, cage enrichment increased the responses to some procedures (Sprague-Dawley: handling, 1-h restraint; SHR: subcutaneous injection, tail-vein injection, handling). We conclude that a nonsocial cage enrichment program did not reduce physiologic indicators of stress in female Sprague Dawley rats or SHR.

AB  - A research was developed during 2003 - 2004 at an avocado (Persea americana Mill.) orchard cv. Hass grafted on Mexicola rootstock. The orchard was located in the V-th Region of Chile (32 degrees 53' lat. S; 71 degrees 16' long. W). The orchard was under optimal water and nutritional condition. Several experiences were carried out to optimize midday stem water potential (psi xmin) measurements, effected by means of pressure chamber techniques: effect of vapor pressure deficit (DVP), leaf age, time of equilibrium of leaf and stem water potential after leaf envelopment, minimum time between leaf detachment and stem water potential measurement in the pressure chamber, leaf location on the tree and the effect of high humidity conditions on detached leaves prior to measurements. The results showed that in avocado trees psi xmin were stable between 12:30 and 17:30 h. The less variability of measurements was obtained using 10 to 12 months old leaves, under exposure to sunlight. The pressure chamber measurements should be carried out 15 min after the leaf was enveloped. psi x should be measured no longer than 1 min after the leaf is detached from the tree; however, this time could be longer if the leaves are kept in high humidity conditions before measurements.

AB  - Cat (Felis silvestris catus) shelter practices may have important implications for cats' health and well-being. This study explored the relationship between husbandry practices and cat health in Hong Kong's shelters which are unregulated. Cat health was measured via body condition score (BCS), coat condition and signs of oculo-nasal discharge. A total of 314 cats in 24 cat shelters were assessed. A satisfactory BCS was associated with regular veterinary input, more than once per day disinfection and more than once per day change of water. The presence of oculo-nasal discharge - as a marker for upper respiratory tract infection - was associated with a lack of regular veterinary input and less frequent change of water within the shelter. A lack of regular feeding was the only factor associated with a dull coat. In summary, this study showed that certain husbandry practices had important associations with different aspects of cats' health for cats housed in an unregulated shelter environment in Hong Kong. These findings provide evidence-based support for husbandry guidelines or regulations for cat shelters which could have a positive impact on shelter cats' health and welfare.

AB  - Water resources, especially riverine ecosystems, are globally under qualitative and quantitative degradation due to human-imposed pressures. High-temporal-resolution data obtained from automatic stations can provide insights into the processes that link catchment hydrology and streamwater chemistry. The scope of this paper was to investigate the statistical behavior of high-frequency measurements at sites with known hydromorphological and pollution pressures. For this purpose, hourly time series of water levels and key water quality indicators (temperature, electric conductivity, and dissolved oxygen concentrations) collected from four automatic monitoring stations under different hydromorphological conditions and pollution pressures were statistically elaborated. Based on the results, the hydromorphological conditions and pollution pressures of each station were confirmed to be reflected in the results of the statistical analysis performed. It was proven that the comparative use of the statistics and patterns of the water level and quality high-frequency time series could be used in the interpretation of the current site status as well as allowing the detection of possible changes. This approach can be used as a tool for the definition of thresholds, and will contribute to the design of management and restoration measures for the most impacted areas.

AB  - In order to assess the influence of atmospheric conditions and particulate matter (PM) on the seasonally varying incidence of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) in the capital of Poland-Warsaw, we analysed time series of ILI reported for the about 1.75 million residents in total and for different age groups in 288 approximately weekly periods, covering 6 years 2013-2018. Using Poisson regression, we predicted ILI by the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) as biometeorological indicator, and by PM2.5 and PM10, respectively, as air quality measures accounting for lagged effects spanning up to 3 weeks. Excess ILI incidence after adjusting for seasonal and annual trends was calculated by fitting generalized additive models. ILI morbidity increased with rising PM concentrations, for both PM2.5 and PM10, and with cooler atmospheric conditions as indicated by decreasing UTCI. While the PM effect focused on the actual reporting period, the atmospheric influence exhibited a more evenly distributed lagged effect pattern over the considered 3-week period. Though ILI incidence adjusted for population size significantly declined with age, age did not significantly modify the effect sizes of both PM and UTCI. These findings contribute to better understanding environmental conditionings of influenza seasonality in a temperate climate. This will be beneficial to forecasting future dynamics of ILI and to planning clinical and public health resources under climate change scenarios.

AB  - The relationship between water loss via transpiration and stem sap flow in young apricot trees was studied under different environmental conditions and different levels of soil water status. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse over a 2-week period (November 2-14, 1997) using three-year-old apricot trees (Prunus armeniaca cv. Bulida) growing in pots. Diurnal courses of leaf water potential, leaf conductance and leaf turgor potential also were recorded throughout the experiment. Data from four days of different enviromental conditions and soil water availability have been selected for analysis. On each of the selected days the leaf water potential and the mean transpiration rates were well correlated. The slope of the linear regression of this correlation, taken to indicate the total hydraulic resistance of the tree, confirmed an increasing hydraulic resistance under drought conditions. When the trees were not drought stressed the diurnal courses of sap flow and transpiration were very similar. However, when the trees were droughted, measured of sap flow slightly underestimated actual transpiration. Our heat-pulse measurements suggest the amount of readily available water stored in the stem and leaf tissues of young apricot trees is sufficient to sustain the peak transpiration rates for about 1 hour.

AB  - In this study, we present the findings of a sediment core retrieved from Klisova lagoon, Western Greece, an area with a long record of documented human presence. The recovered deposits were subjected to sedimentological, XRF, and micropaleontological analyses. For the last 4700 cal BP, the freshwater influx, the progradation of the Evinos river delta and related geomorphological changes control the environmental conditions in the lagoon. Considering the centennial temporal resolution of our analyses, small offsets of c.a. 50 years due to lack of regional reservoir correction do not considerably impact the reported radiocarbon ages. Prior to 4000 cal BP, a relatively shallow water depth, significant terrestrial/freshwater input and increased weathering in the lagoon area are inferred. Elemental proxies and increased dinoflagellate cyst and foraminiferal abundances, which indicate marine conditions with prominent freshwater influxes, point to the gradual deepening of the lagoon up to 2000 cal BP. The marine and freshwater condition equilibrium sets at 1300 cal BP, with the lagoonal system reaching its present state. Maxima of anthropogenic pollen indicators during the Mycenaean (3200 cal BP), Hellenistic (2200 cal BP), and Late Byzantine (800 cal BP) periods suggest intervals of increased anthropogenic activities in the area.

AB  - Intervention and rescue activity in special conditions may be conducted only by trained and authorized personnel using individual protective breathing equipment. While working with the insulating respiratory device, there are a number of factors that make work stressful. As a rule, those working under protection of the insulating respiratory devices, besides carrying on their back a device weighing 14-18 kg, are also subject to great difficulty, in terms of securing their own safety, saving lives, quick-acting under heavy microclimate conditions (high heat and humidity). For interventions demanding predominantly physical effort, in high temperature and humidity environments, where work processes involve large muscle groups, changes in physiological indicators, during or immediately after effort, have been observed, especially in the cardiovascular system and respiratory system. In this respect, the paper presents a research on changes in physiological parameters (pulse and blood oxygen saturation) of intervention and rescue personnel in situations where they have to intervene in high temperature and humidity environments. To that effect, several teams of mine rescue brigadesmen were monitored throughout their training within the National Institute for Research and Development in Mine Safety and Protection to Explosion INSEMEX Petrosani training facility, which may generate the most unfavourable conditions that can be encountered in various emergency situations.

KW  - DESIGN
AB  - Natural factors significantly affect the reliability of overhead transmission lines (OHTLs) as the operating conditions change with a change in natural conditions. As such, OHTLs in new natural conditions should be reconstructed optimally so that the number of failures would be less than the standard value. This paper considers the optimal option for 110 kV OHTL reconstruction in a sharply continental climate. Such option should reduce the power supply interruptions without changing the permissible overall dimensions and mechanical properties of the existing OHTLs with minimal economic costs. Mathematical modeling was thus performed using the specially developed Matlab/Simulink software, and the most common types of wires for OHTLs were considered. The calculation of the expected mechanical loads under the influence of natural factors showed that all the considered options for 110 kV high-voltage power line reconstruction satisfy the specified degrees of reliability. The article presents the developed methods for analyzing the functional reliability of the power system and proposes reliability indicators and a criterion for the efficiency of the operation of the 110 kV OHTL that reflect the systemic effect of the implementation of measures for improving the reliability of such line. These indicators, in contrast to the existing ones, take into account the cumulative impact of natural and operational factors.

AB  - This paper presents an extended finite element method applied to solve phase change problems taking into account natural convection in the liquid phase. It is assumed that the transition from one state to another, e.g., during the solidification of pure metals, is discontinuous and that the physical properties of the phases vary across the interface. According to the classical Stefan condition, the location, topology and rate of the interface changes are determined by the jump in the heat flux. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with the Boussinesq approximation of the natural convection flow are solved for the liquid phase. The no-slip condition for velocity and the melting/freezing condition for temperature are imposed on the interface using penalty method. The fractional four-step method is employed for analysing conjugate heat transfer and unsteady viscous flow. The phase interface is tracked by the level set method defined on the same finite element mesh. A new combination of extended basis functions is proposed to approximate the discontinuity in the derivative of the temperature, velocity and the pressure fields. The single-mesh approach is demonstrated using three two-dimensional benchmark problems. The results are compared with the numerical and experimental data obtained by other authors.

AB  - Road transport networks are essential for the sustainability of mining activities as well as the liveability of mining communities. This paper examined the impacts of mining activity on road travel conditions in the Bowen Basin region. A pressure-state-impact-response (PSIR) framework was used to identify the impacts of mining activity. Pressure (i.e., development), state (i.e., change) and impacts (i.e., effects) were identified by reviewing environmental impact assessments of selected coal mines' travel trips and commodities flow modelling. Following this a household travel survey was distributed to residents of the Moranbah and Emerald townships in order to explore mining communities' level of satisfaction with their road travel experiences. The study found that the poor pavement condition, safety and congestion was associated with over-dimensional vehicles. Other issues raised included perceptions of poor driver behaviour, particularly in regard to speed, inattention and fatigue. The research identified road user's support for confining the movement of wide loads to low-traffic periods (such as overnight), and introducing carpooling arrangements to reduce congestion and addressing the issues of accidents and driver fatigue. These findings have planning implications to future transport planning in the Bowen Basin region as well as other inland and intensive mining regions.

AB  - Biomarker distributions based on GC and GC-RIS data supplemented by stable carbon isotopic compositions based on irm (isotope ratio monitoring) GC-MS data have been used to investigate changes in depositional conditions in a number of samples from a 2 m core (Rheinberger Heide) covering the entire deposition of the Penmian Kupferschiefer (Lower Rhine Basin, northwest Germany). Compound classes investigated are aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons and maleimides (1H-pyrrole-2,5-diones). The core has been previously divided into four sections: TI, TIIA, TIIB and TIII based on lithology. The biomarker distributions and the delta(13)C values of components indicate contributions from cyanobacteria, algae, green sulphur bacteria and higher plants (minor) throughout Kupferschiefer deposition. All of the phytoplanktonic components show C-13 enrichment in the lowest section, suggesting a greater productivity. The occurrence of components derived from green sulphur bacteria (Chlorobiaceae) indicates that the entire deposition was characterised by periods of photic zone anoxia. Such conditions were rapidly established after the initial transgression of the Zechstein Sea and may have been productivity-driven, but were less prevalent during deposition of the upper core sections.

AB  - Plant species which grow at particular habitats may point out at specific abiotic characteristics of these habitats. There is a need for a more generic approach to link soil and vegetation responses. An alternative approach is to use Ellenberg indicator values as a means of assessing the likely competitive advantage between different species as projected by dynamic soil models. The way of utilization and maintenance, and different environmental influences change the specific soil conditions at their locations by human-induced and natural stresses. Different ecotypes of red clover registered at surveyed locations are adapting to such environmental changes, and may represent the breeding pool for red clover breeding to abiotic stresses.

AB  - The aim of the study was to analyse the relationships between conventional production as well as subjectively scored welfare assessment traits with longitudinal sensor measurements (i.e., behavioural activity traits) of dualpurpose cattle kept In grazing systems. Such aim implies getting knowledge into dual-purpose cow grazing behaviour, and inferring behaviour trait thresholds from a management perspective (e.g., development of an early-warning system for clinical mastitis). In this regard, 49 native black and white dual-purpose cows from the breed Deutsches Schwarzbuntes Niederungsrind (DSN) were equipped with electronic sensor ear tags (accelerometer attached to radio frequency identification tag). Over a period of twelve months including two grazing seasons, ear sensors recorded individual cow behaviour for rumination, feeding, lying, active, and highly active, as well as ear surface temperature. Data for all traits were transformed into the measurement unit "percent per day". Additionally, a trained classifier subjectively scored welfare assessment traits (body condition score, locomotion score, udder/ leg hygiene score) and temperament traits (intra-herd rank order, aggressiveness and general temperament during milking). A third trait category included official test-day records for milk-kg, fat-kg and somatic cell count. Association analyses focussed on trait correlations, and on mixed model applications (i.e. defining fixed effect classes for explanatory sensor traits). Sensor ear temperature was significantly negatively correlated with feeding behaviour (r= -0.17, P < 0.01), but significantly positively correlated with walking activity (r = 0.20, P < 0.001). Regarding subjectively cow welfare and temperament scoring, we found positive correlations between the level of aggressiveness towards other herd mates and the intra herd rank order (r = 0.36, P < 0.001), indicating that cows with a higher intra-herd rank showed increased aggressive behaviour. Mixed model analysis revealed that DSN cows spending more time lying down (> 7 h/d) had reduced daily milk and fat yields. Oppositely, high yielding cows showed intensive feeding and rumination behaviour. A substantial decrease in rumination and feeding time was observed for cows with elevated somatic cells (> 700,000 cells/mL), suggesting utilisation of sensor behaviour as an indicator for udder health. We identified significantly higher body condition scores for cows with increased lying times, whereas active cows with high daily feeding and rumination times had quite low body conditions scores. Hence, optimal health and behaviour monitoring for cows in grazing systems implies consideration of both trait components objectively recorded longitudinal sensor traits and subjectively scored behaviour and health indicators. Overall, individual behaviour pattern variation was detected, via sensor technology for dual-purpose cows kept in grazing systems. Hence, automatically recorded longitudinal sensor data is a proper alternative for cow phenotyping in extensive grassland systems, aiming on an accurate data basis for genetic evaluations.

AB  - Although natural riparian woodlands are an important feature that affects the quality of aquatic conditions in streams and rivers, surveying riparian zone flora is rarely implemented in the Mediterranean countries. We developed a rapid assessment method for gathering standardized plot-based woody flora and vegetation data from riparian woodlands. In 2005 we surveyed 218 streamside vegetation plots at 109 sites in upland areas of four major rivers in mainland Greece (Alfios, Acheloos, Arachthos, and Aoos). Here we describe the survey method and provide selected results from its initial implementation. The simplicity and effectiveness of this survey procedure supports the use of rapid site-based biodiversity surveys for riparian zones alongside aquatic status assessments.

AB  - The preparation process of natural earthquakes is still difficult to quantify and remains a subject of debate even with modern observational techniques. Here, we show that foreshock activity can shed light on understanding the earthquake preparation process based on results of meter-scale rock friction experiments. Experiments were conducted under two different fault surface conditions before each run: less heterogeneous fault without pre-existing gouge and more heterogeneous fault with pre-existing gouge. The results show that fewer foreshocks occurred along the less heterogeneous fault and were driven by preslip; in contrast, more foreshocks with a lower b value occurred along the more heterogeneous fault and showed features of cascade-up. We suggest that the fault surface condition and the stress redistribution caused by the ongoing fault slip mode control the earthquake preparation process, including the behavior of foreshock activity. Our findings imply that foreshock activity can be a key indicator for probing the fault conditions at present and in the future, and therefore useful for assessing earthquake hazard. By tuning fault surface heterogeneity, the authors report earthquake preparation processes respectively driven by preslip and cascade-up on a meter-scale laboratory fault. The findings suggest that foreshock activity can be useful for predicting when and how the impending mainshock will occur.

AB  - Different kinds of thermal indices have been applied in several decades as essential tools to investigate thermal perception, environmentally thermal conditions, occupant thermal risk, public health, tourist attractiveness, and urban climate. Physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) has been proved as a relatively wide applicable thermal indicator above other thermal indices. However, the current practical PET performs a slight variation influenced by changing the humidity and clothing insulation. The improvement of the PET has potentiality for further multi-application as a general and consistent standard to estimate thermal perception and tolerance for different studies. To achieve the above purpose, modified physiologically equivalent temperature (mPET) is proposed as an appropriate indicator according to the new structure and requirements of the thermally environmental ergonomics. The modifications to formulate the mPET are considerably interpreted in the principle of the heat transfer inside body, thermo-physiological model, clothing model, and human-environmental interaction in this study. Specifically, the mPET-model has adopted a semi-steady-state approach to calculate an equivalent temperature refer to an indoor condition as the mPET. Finally, the sensitivity test of the biometeorological variables and clothing impact proves that the mPET has better performance on the humidity and clothing insulation than the original PET.

AB  - In the Brazilian savannas (Cerrado biome) fires are natural and a tool for shifting land use; therefore, temporal and spatial patterns result from the interaction of climate, vegetation condition and human activities. Moreover, orbital sensors are the most effective approach to establish patterns in the biome. We aimed to characterize fire, precipitation and vegetation condition regimes and to establish spatial patterns of fire occurrence and their correlation with precipitation and vegetation condition in the Cerrado. The Cerrado was first and second biome for the occurrence of burned areas (BA) and hotspots, respectively. Occurrences are higher during the dry season and in the savanna land use. Hotspots and BA tend to decrease, and concentrate in the north, but more intense hotspots are not necessarily located where concentration is higher. Spatial analysis showed that averaged and summed values can hide patterns, such as for precipitation, which has the lowest average in August, but minimum precipitation in August was found in 7% of the Cerrado. Usually, there is a 2-3-month lag between minimum precipitation and maximum hotspots and BA, while minimum VCI and maximum hotspots and BA occur in the same month. Hotspots and BA are better correlated with VCI than precipitation, qualifying VCI as an indicator of the susceptibility of vegetation to ignition.

AB  - As part of a large hydroelectric project in northern Quebec (Canada), a portion of the flow of the Rupert River was diverted toward the existing La Grande hydroelectric complex. As a result of the partial diversion, the discharge of the Rupert River at its mouth is reduced by an average of 50% annually. This corresponds to an 18% decrease in the total freshwater inflow into the bay and, thus, to a shift of the upstream limit of the saltwater intrusion in Rupert Bay. Changes in saltwater intrusion had been predicted numerically as part of the project's environmental impact assessment (EIA). In the project's conditions of authorization, monitoring the hydraulic conditions and the extent of saltwater intrusion in the Rupert Bay was required by government authorities. The objective of this paper is to present the results of this environmental monitoring and, more specifically, to validate the modifications predicted in the EIA in terms of both saltwater intrusion limit and hydraulic conditions in the Rupert Bay. Results obtained during 2 years of monitoring are within the predicted trends and order of magnitude of changes anticipated in the EIA. The results, thus, confirm that the shift of the upstream limit of the saltwater front along the channels of the bay was conservatively predicted by numerical modeling.

AB  - Background: Steep environmental gradients, coupled with predicted high temperature rises in the Arctic make arctic mountain vegetation highly suitable for surveillance of changes related to global warming. However, guidelines and baselines for such a purpose are widely lacking since arctic mountain vegetation has been little explored.
   Aims: We explore options for long-term surveillance on the basis of a detailed analysis of extant plant community patterns and their underlying environmental conditions in the mountainous inland of West Greenland.
   Methods: Distribution, abundance and site conditions of vegetation types were analysed, using 664 vegetation samples and detailed vegetation maps in four altitudinal belts.
   Results: Most plant communities had a restricted elevation distribution and were confined to special habitats predominantly defined by mesotopography and soil moisture.
   Conclusions: Based on the strong linkage to habitat conditions, horizontal and vertical changes of species distribution and vegetation pattern are excellent indicators for inferring underlying environmental changes on three different scales. The recommendations given concerning climate sensitive species and plant communities, ecotones for setting up observation sites as well as stratification of analysis by habitats can be the basis for establishing long-term surveillance programmes on arctic mountain vegetation.

AB  - The Taoudeni Basin is a large intracratonic trough located in the West African craton, with more than 2 km of Neoproterozoic-lower Palaeozoic sedimentary thickness. The occurrence of late Ediacaran-Cambrian sabkha deposits, in which playa-lake evaporites are bounded by proximal braided-fluvial and distal shoal complexes, is easily distinguishable in the field by their variegated colour banding. The diagenetic processes recorded in the sabkha substrates were largely facies-controlled, associated with microbial development and mat-decay mineralization. Due to anaerobic decay of mat microorganisms, chemical conditions beneath mats and biofilms tended to be strongly reducing. As a result, precipitation of authigenic indicators of anoxic conditions, such as pyritic crusts, led to variegated colours parallel to stratification. Reworking of microbial mats and structures by ephemeral streams also generated isolated reduction spots around their microbial clasts leading to the formation of pyritic haloes. The subsequent alteration of pyrite to amorphous (reddish) hematite and subsequent recrystallization to (brownish to yellow) goethite contributed to the variegated aspect of the unit. Final reddening of the sediment took place irregularly as a result of dehydration of ferric hydroxides, a process relatively common in desert environments. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Visitors' perceptions of impacts and acceptable standards for environmental conditions can provide essential information for the sustainable management of tourist destinations, especially protected areas. To this end, visitor surveys were administered during the peak visitor season in Cape Range National Park, on the northwest coast of Western Australia and adjacent to the iconic Ningaloo Reef. The central focus was visitors' perceptions regarding environmental conditions and standards for potential indicators. Conditions considered of greatest importance in determining visitors' quality of experience included litter, inadequate disposal of human waste, presence of wildlife, levels of noise, and access to beach and ocean. Standards were determined, based on visitors' perceptions, for a range of site-specific and non-site-specific indicators, with standards for facilities (e.g., acceptable number of parking bays, signs) and for negative environmental impacts (e.g., levels of littering, erosion) sought. The proposed standards varied significantly between sites for the facilities indicators; however, there was no significant difference between sites for environmental impacts. For the facilities, the standards proposed by visitors were closely related to the existing situation, suggesting that they were satisfied with the status quo. These results are considered in the context of current research interest in the efficacy of visitor-derived standards as a basis for protected area management.

AB  - The Middle Late Jurassic greenhouse conditions included CO2 levels that have been estimated to be four to five times higher than they are presently. By analysing the pattern of selected trace elements as redox proxies (V, U, and Mo) and the variations in the chemical state of iron using Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy, we demonstrate the occurrence of major changes in sediment redox conditions from the Late Bajocian through the Late Oxfordian in the pelagic environment of the Alpine Tethys in its Carpathian domain. Our interpretation is based on analysis of siliceous limestones rich in radiolarians intercalated with red nodular limestones of Ammonitico Rosso-type facies from the Krizna Nappe in the eastern part of the Tatra Mountains, Poland. The presented redox potential (Eh values) shows its changeable pattern along the section (from -0.74 V to 0.16 V). The low values of Eh (from -0.74 V to 0.4 V) create the long-term (ca. 7 Myr) trend of the medium-scale fluctuations comprising the Upper Bajocian through the Lower Oxfordian interval of predominately grey and green radiolarian siliceous limestones. This interval comprises the three short-term (less than 0.5 Myr) periods of slightly increasing Eh (from -0.35 V to -0.17 V) observed in the uppermost Bajocian, Lower Bathonian, and Lower Callovian, as well as the significant changes in sediment redox conditions from oxic to dysoxic in the Upper Bajocian. The overlying succession corresponding to the Middle-Upper Oxfordian (ca. 4 Myr) is characterized by red radiolarian siliceous limestones with positive Eh values that indicate deposition under more oxic conditions than those during any other period in the study section. The negative values of Eh, attributed to the upwelling periods, coincide with the decreasing sea surface water temperature (SST) and increasing organic matter flux. The largest negative shift is noted in the Upper Callovian, which coincided with the cool climatic phase. The positive Eh values indicate oxic conditions due to the lowering of organic matter input, coinciding with an increased SST caused by surface water stratification. Based on the observed long-term variation in the redox, we postulate thermally driven east west atmospheric circulation along the equatorial Tethys Ocean, caused by the sharp contrast in sea surface temperature, similar to the Walker Circulation operating across the modern Pacific. This phenomenon would have been the dominant periodical mode over the tropics and subtropics regions of the NW Tethys during the Middle Late Jurassic. Global warming reduces the long-term strength of the mean tropical atmospheric circulation, leading to sea water stratification near the surface and consequently lowering the organic matter flux. However, additional seaways of heat transport could also exist, as they are associated with the opening/closing of the Hispanic Corridor.

AB  - The concept of hydric soils evolved over time with advances in soil science and wetland resource management. Hydric soils are identified in the field by examining morphological characteristics, including organic matter accumulation and redoximorphic features that form in response to prolonged periods of saturation and anaerobic conditions. The Hydric Soil Technical Standard (HSTS) was developed to provide a quantitative procedure for evaluating the hydric status of a soil based upon direct measurements of saturation, anaerobic conditions, and precipitation normality. In practice, the HSTS is used for (a) identifying hydric soils when a field indicator of hydric soils may not be present (e.g., naturally problematic or disturbed soils); (b) evaluating the current functional hydric status of a soil; (c) developing new field indicators of hydric soils; and (d) proposing changes to existing field indicators of hydric soils. The HSTS procedures have progressed over several decades with new approaches to soil analysis, including novel methods to document anaerobic conditions. The following review describes the development of the hydric soils concept and provides guidance for measuring each HSTS component. Practical approaches for collection and submission of HSTS data to the National Technical Committee for Hydric Soils, the group responsible for approving approaches to hydric soil identification in the United States, are also discussed. Expanding the understanding and application of the HSTS promotes technical accuracy, transparency, and efficient decision making in support of hydric soil and wetland resource management.

AB  - In the North American Prairie Pothole Region (PPR), agricultural and developed land uses may affect wetland condition by influencing contaminant inputs and invasions by fishes. To improve understanding of human impacts on wetlands, we quantified relationships between land use, physical attributes (herbicides, chloride, turbidity, wetland size), and biological attributes (tiger salamander [Ambystoma tigrinum] abundance; fish, plant, and invertebrate assemblages) of 45 permanently-ponded Iowa wetlands. Wetland area and water-column chloride concentration increased as cropped and developed land-covers increased in the watershed. However, we did not find strong relationships between land-cover type and biological attributes, with the exception of plant cover, which declined as water-column herbicide concentration increased. Fish abundance was an especially important determinant of wetland condition. As fish abundance increased, turbidity increased, and plant cover declined. Tiger salamander abundance and macroinvertebrate taxon richness also declined as fish abundance increased. Our findings suggest that in Iowa PPR wetlands, chloride concentration is an indicator of land-use intensity, and plant abundance can be predicted to some extent by herbicide concentrations. However, wetlands with low macroinvertebrate diversity, plant abundance, and salamander abundance tend to be those with high fish abundance.

AB  - We developed a wireless monitoring system to monitor fish condition by tracking the change in whole cholesterol concentration. The whole cholesterol concentration of fish is a source of steroid hormones or indicator of immunity level, which makes its detection important for tracking physiological condition of fish. Wireless monitoring system comprises of mediator-type biosensor and wireless transmission device. Biosensor is implantable to fish body, and transmission device is so light, in that fish is allowed to swim freely during monitoring. Cholesterol esterase and oxidase were fixated on to the detection site of biosensor and used to detect the whole cholesterol concentration. However, cholesterol oxidase incorporates oxidation-reduction reaction of oxygen for detection, which concentration fluctuates easily due to change in environmental condition. Meanwhile, mediator-type biosensor enables monitoring of whole cholesterol concentration by using mediator to substitute that oxidation-reduction reaction of oxygen. Characteristic of fabricated mediator-type biosensor was tested. The sensor output current of mediator-type biosensor remained stable compared to output current of non-mediator-type biosensor under fluctuating oxygen concentration of 0-8 ppm, which implied that this sensor is less affected by change in dissolved oxygen concentration. That biosensor was then implanted into fish for wireless monitoring. As a result, approximately 48 h of real-time monitoring was successful.

AB  - Background: The psychosocial climate of inpatient units has proved to be related to both patient satisfaction and outcome.
   Aims: The aims of the study were twofold: to study the relationship between patient and staff satisfaction, and to study the relationship between the patients' perception of the treatment environment and the perceived working conditions of the staff.
   Method: A total of 129 different patients completed the Ward Atmosphere Scale ( WAS) and a General Satisfaction Index (GSI) at 11 time points between 1981 and 2000. Staff members completed the Working Environment Scale-10 (WES-10) and the GSI. Z-scores were calculated to describe the fluctuations in the WAS, WES-10 and the GSI subscale scores.
   Results: The study revealed a strong correlation between patient satisfaction and staff satisfaction. Staff satisfaction correlated significantly with the WAS subscales of Practical orientation and Staff control. Furthermore, the study revealed a significant correlation between patient satisfaction and staff members' perception on the WES-10 subscale of Self-realization.
   Conclusion: This exploratory study revealed that the working conditions of staff are related to both patient satisfaction and the patients' perceptions of the treatment environment. A satisfactory working environment for psychiatric staff members seems important for the quality of care perceived by patients.

AB  - The Range of Variability Approach (RVA) is used to investigate the hydrologic impacts of a diversion weir on Chou-Shui Creek, Taiwan. Thirty-two hydrologic parameters, called Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA), are used to evaluate the flow conditions before and after weir construction. One standard deviation from the mean for each of the pre-construction hydrologic parameters is set as the management target range. Under the prevailing diversion rules, large hydrologic alterations are observed, especially for low flows. The means of 19 hydrologic parameters presently fall outside of the targets and the average non-attainment rate for the 32 indicators is 73.2%. Increasing the instream flow release or reducing diversions could mitigate the hydrologic impacts of weir construction. Increasing the instream flow to 40 m 3 A and reducing monthly water demands by variable percentages significantly improves the altered flow conditions. Under the proposed water release and diversion scheme, 29 hydrologic parameters will fall within the management targets and the average non-attainment rate will be reduced to 35.6%, much closer to the pre-construction value of 25.3%. Restoring the natural flow variability is expected to promote the natural stream biota. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Biodiversity monitoring is increasingly assessed through citizenscience volunteer programs. Standardized protocols are proposed by scientists to naturalist or non-naturalist volunteers who collect data in a consultative approach. Biodiversity indicators can then be assessed and communicated to inform decision-making at local to international policy levels.
   Citizen-science can, however, go beyond such top-down approaches and become more transformative, if citizens were to become involved at different stages of observatory construction. On the condition that ecological scientists adopt a reflexive approach on their values and approaches, citizen-science programs could help to transform science-society-politics relationships. In particular, we consider options to combine consultative and transformative approaches, some of which are already experimented. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Here, the nature of intergranular corrosion features and mechanisms for commercial 5083-H111, 6082-T6 and 6005A-T6 Al alloys are investigated comprehensively, supporting foundations for their management and maintenances under environmental conditions. It is found that the localized corrosions including the pitting, intergranular corrosion (IGC), exfoliation together with their coupling effects tend to the follow the direction and the morphology of precipitations and the elongated rolling/extrusion directions, suggesting grain refinement would be an effective approach to enhance the strength and IGC resistance. The microstructure characterizations and orientation statistics reveal the indicators improving durability and damage tolerance properties in the development of advanced Al alloys.<bold> </bold>

Previously accumulated information about the genetic nature of morphological abnormalities in gymnosperms, induced by acute and chronic irradiation in the exclusion zone of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, are briefly considered in this review. Since an additional number of important research results appeared in the last decade that are dedicated to the analysis of molecular biological and molecular genetic effects of chronic irradiation on the coniferous plants growing in the exclusion zone of the Chernobyl disaster, all these data are also analyzed in the current review.

AB  - Native grasslands are one of the most endangered ecosystems in south eastern Australia. Conservation of grassland remnants and development of effective indicator groups to monitor their quality is a high priority. Recent surveys of epigaeic invertebrates have revealed several candidate groups for this. Ants are a popular focal group for invertebrate surveys in the region. The ant species richness and functional groups on four series of grassland sites in Victoria suggest that small scale heterogeneity is sufficiently high that the predictive indicator values of ants are limited, and that ants may not be sufficiently sensitive to floristic change to employ them alone in monitoring grassland condition in the region.

AB  - Soil quality assessment is based on the concept of soil functions. The performances of three soil functions, crop production, biological decomposition and matter exchange with the atmosphere and groundwater, are used as quality criteria. Soil properties that can be used as indicators for the degree of functional performance were identified. Each soil property selected was graded into five classes - from best (class 1) to worst (class 5). Grading was based biological on boundary conditions as well as on statistical distribution. The system outlined can be used to interpret the quality state of agricultural soils, provides for a relative comparison between soils, and may be helpful in an environmental monitoring program to assess trends in data.

AB  - The causes and physiological-biochemical mechanisms of migration of marine species of hydrobionts to fresh waters of the Dnieper River and the cascade of its reservoirs have been investigated. The possible adaptation of marine fish species and invertebrates is related to the economic human activity: regulation of river runoff, creation of a cascade of reservoirs with large water-surface area, anthropogenic pollution of natural water, and also changes of climate conditions on the Earth (global warming). It is presumed that these processes result in significant change of physicochemical indicators of aquatic medium. One can observe the rise of mineralization, increase of the number of biogenic compounds, variation of their ratio in fresh water that, in turn, allows the marine species of hydrobionts to adapt to new conditions and advance upstream.

AB  - This research investigates the impact that macro-economic conditions and social control policies have on changes in crime and imprisonment rates for the period 1962 to 1988 in Canada. Informed by the theories of political economy, I contend that in the context of debilitating economic conditions, government policy becomes enmeshed in law and order and welfare strategies that stress greater policing, greater incarceration, and the increased use of placative forms of control. Based on time-series auto-correlation analysis, the results generally support the hypotheses that both coercive and placative forms of control and fiscal distress occasion greater rates of crime and imprisonment. The analysis illustrates that such social indicator models of crime rates vary according to the nature and seriousness of the crime.

We use birds as indicators of environmental quality and demonstrate huge differences between coastal and inland, mountain, sites separated by less than 150 km. We conclude that the Gibraltar sites represented locations of repeated occupation by Neanderthals over tens of millennia whereas Zafarraya represents a site of sporadic visits for particular prey. This is in response to very different climatic conditions. Our results show how important ecological quality is in understanding Palaeolithic sites and meta-populations and how birds are particularly informative in our understanding of the ecology of such sites.

AB  - Aquatic hyphomycetes are microscopic imperfect fungi and they are the principal decomposers of the submerged organic matter in rivers, making it possible to be used by other organisms present in the ecosystem. These fungi are of ecological and biotechnological importance,. given their enzymatic makeup, and are also considered as indicators of water quality. In Venezuela, there are few records in these fungi; therefore we carried out monthly records of the species present in the headwaters of the Chirgua river, Carabobo State. Foam samples were taken during one year from the river channels under sterile conditions and fungi species are identified. We identified a total of 44 species, Tricladiospora brunnea and Trinacrium incurvum being new records for the country.

AB  - It is alleged that the causal inertness of abstract objects and the causal conditions of certain naturalized epistemologies precludes the possibility of mathematical knowledge. This paper rejects this alleged incompatibility, while also maintaining that the objects of mathematical beliefs are abstract objects, by incorporating a naturalistically acceptable account of 'rational intuition. On this view, rational intuition consists in a non-inferential belief-forming process where the entertaining of propositions or certain contemplations results in true beliefs. This view is free of any conditions incompatible with abstract objects, for the reason that it is not necessary that S stand in some causal relation to the entities in virtue of which p is true. Mathematical intuition is simply one kind of reliable process type, whose inputs are not abstract numbers, but rather, contemplations of abstract numbers.

AB  - Pristane (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane), frequently the most abundant biomarker hydrocarbon in crude oils and rock extracts, was thought originally to be derived directly from phytol or, later, from thermal degradation of tocopherols. We present new evidence supporting the hypothesis that pristane, under certain conditions, may result from the catagenic decomposition of methyltrimethyltridecylchromans (MTTCs) derived during diagenesis from condensation reactions between chlorophyll and alkylphenols. We show that phytol can condense, under mild conditions, with phenolic systems (in free or polymeric form) to produce free or bound structures that generate pristenes on flash pyrolysis. We suggest straightforward tests of this hypothesis.

AB  - This paper reports specific mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of deposits from the local depressions of the Derugin Basin. They were formed in an environment with periodic changes from oxic to anoxic conditions and show evidence for the presence of hydrogen sulfide in bottom waters. The deposits of this type can be considered as a modern model for ancient ore-bearing black shale associations. Compared with typical metalliferous black shale sequences, which are characterized by high contents of organic matter, the sediments described here are depleted in the elements of the organophilic association (Mo, Ni, Cu, Zn, V, and U) but have higher Mn contents.

Forty-seven specimens of P. falkneri were analyzed between March 2005 and September 2006. Statistical analysis showed that the Kn was positively correlated with the abundance of Acanthobothrium regoi and Rhinebothrium paratrygoni; only the abundance of A. regoi was positively correlated to the HSR, whereas R. paratrygoni did not present correlation and there was no influence of the host's sex on the abundance and prevalence of parasites. This is the first study concerning the ecology of parasites of potamotrygonids.

AB  - This work demonstrates that scratch test techniques can be used to provide a quick and cost effective evaluation of cutting fluids. Apparent coefficient of friction and specific energy for the scratch steel samples under several lubrication conditions provides a good indicator of cutting fluid performance. This is followed by evaluation of the surface finish and the cutting force of the ABNT NB 8640 steel with emulsion and synthetic cutting fluids, at 5% of concentrations, and neat mineral oil in the turning process. Comparative tests were carried out under dry and wet conditions. Results show that the linear scratch test was not efficient while the pendular scratch test was efficient tool in the classification of cutting fluids. The results can be transferred to conventional machining due to its dynamic nature.

AB  - Sensing of biologically relevant anionic substrates in physiological conditions, employing the strategy of the chemosensing ensembles, is reported. Coordination of a fluorescent indicator to a dicopper(II) polyazamacrocyclic receptor ([Cu-2(L)]) results in the collapse of its fluorescence emission. Competitive binding of substrates for the receptor releases the indicator in solution, with full emission recovery. The spectral changes obtained for some indicators and substrates were analysed to determine their respective association constants for the receptor. Discrimination of micromolar ATP quantities from other interferents (small inorganic anions and well-known neurotransmitters) is improved by a judicious choice of the indicator, the resulting ATP sensor promising interesting biological applications.

Uneven spatial development has long been a characteristic feature of the economic and social fabric of the UK. The north-south divide has become something of a hegemonic narrative in the UK and this has served to mask an 'archipelago' of variegated spatial development in housing and locality conditions at sub-national and sub-regional scales. This paper explores the changing nature of sub-regional housing and locality conditions across the UK and evidence is found of significant spatial variation in the way that places responded to the effects of the most recent economic recession.

AB  - Human activities have changed and shaped landscape conditions of the Yucatan Peninsula for more than 4000 years. Several paleoecological studies showed the oldest pollen record of corn-based agriculture is from northern Belize, with an estimated age of 3300 BC.
   Several other studies report maize between 1500 and 3000 BC from northern Guatemala and the Mexican part of the Yucatan Peninsula. After 3500 cal yr BP several paleoecological studies showed a marked tendency to drier climatic conditions. In pollen records, increased drought is expressed as a reduced presence of fossil arboreal pollen. Pollen records with the presence of Zea mays also show other taxa, which are indicators of disturbance in different vegetation types.

AB  - Cladonia verticillaris (Raddi) Fr. collected on sandy soils of Alhandra municipality, Paraiba, Brazil, was submitted, under laboratory conditions, to spray's of 4ml of styren, ciclohexane and deionized water. Organic extracts of samples with 3, 5, 10 and 15 days, were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and thin layer chromatography (TLC). Samples were also analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for the observation of morphological damage. The results evidenced the production of some of the intermediary substances and reduction of the fumaroprotocetraric acid and atranotin. The analysis of the external surface of the lichen showed morphological alterations and appearance of cortical hiphae. This study ratifies data obtained in the environment and characterized the potential of C. verticillaris as a rapid bioindicator of air pollution.

AB  - A solution culture experiment was conducted to study the tolerance and phosphorus uptake efficiency of different maize genotypes (Jidan 180, Simi 25, Benyu 9) at seedling stage under the condition of phosphorus (P) deficiency. Results showed that the biological indicators of dry matter weight, root length, root density, root radius, total root absorption area, active absorption area of all the genotypes were reduced under the stress of P deficiency. However, compared with other genotypes, Jidan 180 was less affected. At P deficiency, the K-m and C-min of Jidan 180 decreased significantly, I-max increased significantly. It indicated that Jidan 180 had the higher P affinity and tolerance to P dificiency, whereas Benyu 9 had lower P affinity and weak tolerance to low P condition.

AB  - How well are industrialised nations doing in terms of energy policy? Without a standardised set of metrics to evaluate national energy systems, it is difficult to determine the extent to which energy resources, technologies and infrastructure are truly keeping up with emerging challenges related to climate change, the environment, population growth and economic wellbeing. In response, we propose the creation of an energy sustainability index (ESI) to inform policymakers, investors and analysts about the status of energy conditions. Using the United States as an example, the ESI shows that the country has failed to truly progress on solving some of its most pressing energy problems, and that in many respects conditions have deteriorated. The proposed ESI builds on the substantial body of literature on 'sustainability', and draws on past efforts to measure progress in environmental and energy systems.

AB  - Many of today's environmental problems are regional in scope and their effects overlap and interact. We developed a simple method to provide an integrated assessment of environmental conditions and estimate cumulative impacts across a large region, by combining data on land-cover, population, roads, streams, air pollution, and topography. The integrated assessment technique identified nine distinct groups of watersheds. Relative cumulative impact scores were highest around major urban centers, but there was not a simple or predictable spatial pattern overall. We also point out the potential applications of this approach that include distinguishing between areas in relatively poor versus good condition, identifying areas that may be more vulnerable to future environmental degradation, and identifying areas for restoration.

AB  - Comparative analysis of the composition of lipid biomarkers (n-alkanes and n-alkan-2-ones) in sphagnum mosses, herbaceous plants, heather dwarf shrubs, and peats of high bogs of Western Siberia was carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. It was shown that different marsh plant species differ in ratios between long-chain n-alkanes, and this fact makes it possible to diagnose the source of these compounds in peat. It was found that sphagnum peats occurring in high bogs formed in different natural and climatic conditions differ in the distribution of n-alkan-2-ones, which can be used for the reconstruction of paleoclimatic conditions.

AB  - Analysis of the intraspecific coupling and use of the graph theory in the vegetation cover of the landscapes of the upper and middle courses of the Pechora River were used to distinguish seven groups of species of vascular plants. With the help of ecological scales of H. Ellenberg and participation coefficient of V. S. Ipatov we showed that these groups occupy different positions in the ecological space and are characterized by clear cenotic role in certain vegetation communities. The Pleiades of coupled species, the majority of which are interpreted as ecological-cenotic groups of species, can be used as indicators of eco- and biotopic conditions.

AB  - In the area and environs of the municipal waste dump Barycz in Krakow, all analyzed groundwater samples, taken from piezometers C-1, P-3, P-6, P-8 and G revealed occurrence of bacteria - indicators of bad sanitary conditions. Even periodical pollution of groundwater results in its bad quality. Presence of fecal Coliform bacteria indicates on anthropogenic origin of the groundwater contamination. The number of cfu of fecal Coliform bacteria in water samples taken from piezometers was decreasing with growing distance from the waste dump borders. However, even in a 1230 m distance north from borders of the waste dump in the piezometer G, in spite of the absence of fecal Coliform bacteria, bad sanitary condition was ascertained, according to other microbiological indicators.

AB  - The results of a biomonitoring survey carried out in the town of Arezzo (central Italy) using the biodiversity of epiphytic lichens as indicator of environmental quality are reported. Lichen biodiversity counts raised progressively with distance from the old town centre, with concentric zones extending from the central parts towards the edge of town. Compared with the situation of 1994, ameliorating conditions were found, with higher biodiversity values and new colonizing species at all stations. This trend was confirmed by analytical measurements, which showed decreasing values for the most common phytotoxic gaseous pollutants (SO2, NOX). Increasing use of unleaded fuel and catalytic vehicles, as well as areas of the town closed to traffic and conversion to methane for domestic heating are probable reasons for this improvement.

AB  - Tissue level of nitrate and nitrite are established indicators of altered nitric oxide metabolism under various pathological conditions. Determination of these anions in biological samples, in the presence of high chloride concentration, using capillary zone electrophoresis suffers from poor detection sensitivity. Separation conditions providing excellent resolution and submicromolar detection sensitivity of nitrate and nitrite have been developed and validated. Simple sample preparation was applied that maintains nitrite stability in tissue extracts and at the same time allows transient isotachophoresis stacking of the analytes. Nitrate and nitrite concentrations in rat brain and liver tissue samples were determined in control and lipopolysaccharide treated animals. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We studied the effects of weather conditions, temporal factors and distance to coast on the flight altitude of migrating waterbirds in Western Estonia. We used a laser range finder and marine surveillance radar to measure flight altitudes, and identified significant effects on avian flight altitude by several weather components, particularly wind conditions, visibility and cloud covet Wind components played a particularly significant role. Tailwinds were generally associated with elevated flight altitude, and reductions in flight altitude were usually associated with high wind speed, possibly because of enhanced energetic costs or risk of being blown off course. Behavioural and physical adaptations to the environment also contributed to specific flight-altitude selection. The results provide new insights into factors determining flight altitude and useful information to support environmental impact assessments.

AB  - Plasma sterilization has attracted attention as a safe and low cost sterilization method compared to conventional sterilization methods such as EOG (ethylene oxide gas) sterilization and high-pressure steam sterilization. In this research, a plasma is generated by irradiating air with microwaves. Sterilization is caused by O-radicals and NO-radicals. In order to carry out sterilization efficiently, optimal setting of equipment conditions is required. The pressure required for optimal conditions of the equipment, the microwave output, and the equipment used have been examined. A biological indicator (BI), Geobacillus stearothermophilus (ATCC7953), was used. It was found that sterilization was successful when the pressure in the vacuum chamber for microwave output of 280 W was 60 Pa. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The electrical conductivity test indirectly evaluates cell membrane disorganization by quantifying the electrolytes released into the water after tissue imbibing. The objective of this work was to evaluate methodological variations in the electrical conductivity test, for it to serve as an indicator of low temperature-induced damages and estimate the cold tolerance of bean plants. Cultivar IPR Uirapuru plants were subjected to minimum temperatures of 4 degrees C, 2 degrees C, 0 degrees C, -1 degrees C, -2 degrees C, -3 degrees C, and -4 degrees C for 1 h in a growth chamber under controlled conditions. After the treatment period, the response of plants to cold stress was evaluated by determination of the total protein content, and catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) enzymatic activities, and evaluation of photosystem II (Fm/Fv) efficiency and leaf anatomy. These results were compared with those obtained in the electrical conductivity test, which was performed in plants under cold stress as well as under a non-stress environment, with 2, 4, 6, and 8 leaf discs immersed in 30 mL of distilled water for 24 h in BOD, at temperatures of 25 degrees C, 30 degrees C, and 35 degrees C. Analysis of variance was performed using a completely randomized design, and for electrical conductivity, a number of discs x cold stress temperature combinations were used for each soak temperature. The averages were compared using the Turkey's test at 5% and 10% probability. Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between the conductivity averages and other cold stress evaluation data was also performed. The results showed a marked reduction in the ratio (Fv/Fm) only in the treatments at -3 degrees C and -4 degrees C, which indicated tissue death. At temperatures below 0 degrees C, there was a collapse of the leaf blade tissues, and it was not possible to differentiate the palisade parenchyma from the spongy parenchyma in the treatments at -2 degrees C, -3 degrees C, and -4 degrees C. There was an increase in the protein content since the temperature -3 degrees C. The enzyme activity of CAT decrease at -4 degrees C whereas that of APX increased. In the electrical conductivity test, there was a significant interaction between soak temperature and the number of discs, and an increase in conductivity of the solution with a decrease in temperature was verified in several treatments, among which, the combination that best correlated with the other tests was 25 degrees C with six leaf discs. It was concluded that the electrical conductivity test presents results similar to those obtained from other physiological, biochemical, and anatomical tests, and therefore, it can be used to evaluate the damage caused by low temperatures in bean plants.

AB  - The ecosystem exergy theory is an ecosystem succession theory based on thermodynamics and hypothesizes that energy dissipation increases with ecosystem maturity. It was developed along with a number of specially designed dissipation indicators, derived from thermal remote sensing. The theory provides an interesting method for the rapid evaluation of the degree of naturalness and/or the maturity of an ecosystem, e.g. in land use impact assessment studies. However, lack of proof of the validity of the ecosystem exergy theory has limited its application. In addition, it remains unsolved whether the dissipation indicators are influenced by meteorological conditions, how they are related with each other and which dissipation indicator has the largest discriminative power.
   In this study, the ecosystem exergy theory and the dissipation indicators have been evaluated using theoretical simulations and observational data. A theoretical model was applied to assess the influence of ecosystem properties and of meteorological conditions on the dissipation indicators. With respect to the observations, the dissipation indicators were calculated with two series of DAIS-imagery, obtained during the summers of 1998 and 2001 in the sandy and sandy loam regions of Flanders (Belgium), respectively. For all dissipation indicators, differences between major land use types, between different forest tree species and age classes and between agricultural crop types were analysed.
   Simulations and observations showed that the dissipation indicators are highly correlated with each other. Solar exergy dissipation (SED) had the highest discriminative power and can be recommended when all land uses or ecosystems are measured simultaneously, possibly complemented with the standard deviation of surface temperature within the considered land unit. If data are not measured simultaneously, the Evaporative fraction (EF), which we suggest as a new dissipation indicator in this study, can be recommended because of its robustness to meteorological conditions and its high discriminative power.
   The simulations and observations elicited that dissipation indicators are very suitable for the detection of differences in energy dissipation between agricultural crops, less so for the detection of differences in forest management. The simulations supported to a large extent the main hypothesis of the ecosystem exergy theory. Higher energy dissipation is obtained through increased evapotranspiration or increased surface roughness, two aspects generally related with succession in terrestrial ecosystems from non-vegetated land to forest. This was confirmed by the observations. The energy dissipation increased with an increasing degree of naturalness of the major land use and with increasing forest stand age. However, the ecosystem exergy theory was not confirmed for forest succession from the pioneer to the climax phase. Poplar plantations, which are equivalent to the early successional aggradation phase, showed higher energy dissipation than forests equivalent to late successional stages, in contrast with the ecosystem exergy theory.

AB  - Territorial self-government is an independent entity that has a certain scope of freedom in deciding on the path of development of the subordinate area, common property, and implementation of public tasks. The aim of the study is to assess the intra-regional diagnosis of the level of the poviat's financial situation relative to the development potential. The data used to conduct the study refer to the years of 2009 and 2016; they come from the Local Data Bank and cover 101 poviats of Eastern Poland. The poviat can carry out its tasks when it is equipped with stable and efficient sources of income. The level and structure of budget revenues determine investment activity. The socio-economic space of the poviat's activity is a multi-element system. It achieves different levels of development depending on the structure, equipment elements, as well as the quality and complexity of the links between them. The ability of a poviat to operate can be seen as a set of factors that are mutually related to each other. These factors include: technical infrastructure, knowledge, innovation, regional product, eco-development, geographical location, finances. These factors depend on the potential inherent in the region, activity in the sphere of planning and implementation of regional policy by regional self-government authorities, the state's economic policy, and the standards of structural policy and EU cohesion policy. These factors are not unchangeable over time; therefore, they should be subjected to continuous and ongoing analysis. The synthetic measure of the financial situation according to the average value of the 2007-2016 years was in the range from 0.24 to 0.49. Poviats with a higher rate of the synthetic financial situation are better in terms of the measure of development. The level of the indicator is influenced by: the economic character of the entity and the function of the area, economic potential, financial situation, quality of the natural environment and infrastructure. The management of financial resources is of special importance in the functioning of poviats. They affect the economic situation of the local government, the conditions for the implementation of tasks. Financial resources are the basis for the operation of individuals and a condition for the implementation of the tasks imposed on them, they determine development and are an expression of the potential for economic development. The situation of the surveyed units varied. The ranking of cities in the ranking did not change substantially in the subsequent years. It was confirmed that financial resources are the basis for the operation of individuals and a condition for carrying out the tasks imposed on them, determine development, and reflect the potential for economic development.

AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition in streams reflects the dynamic interplay between DOM sources, mobilization mechanisms, and biogeochemical transformations within soils and receiving water bodies. The information regarding DOM sources being mobilized during baseflow can improve our ability to predict hydrological and biogeochemical responses to environmental changes, with implications for catchment management strategies. The objective of this study was to characterize the spatial changes in DOM composition along a headwater stream in a small mountainous catchment during baseflow and to link the findings in-stream with possible DOM sources in the catchment. DOM was monitored over 1.5 years at three sites in the GroBe Ohe catchment (Bavarian Forest National Park, Southeast Germany) which strongly varied in slope between upper and lower part of the catchment, using UV-Vis absorption indicators of aromaticity (SUVA) and molecular weight (E-2:E-3) from high-frequency probe measurements. Additionally, discrete samples were collected and analyzed by ultrahigh-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). At baseflow conditions, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, a proxy of DOM amount, ranged from 1.5 to 4.7 mg L-1 but were similar along the stream. However, DOM quality exhibited clear spatial patterns, with overall high aromatic and low molecular weight DOM in the lower part of the catchment, which has a higher proportion of hydromorphic soils. Moreover, molecular data revealed that oxygen-rich, aromatic compounds increased in their abundance at high DOC concentrations in both the steep upper and the flatter lower part of the catchment, with also additional input of oxygen-depleted aromatic compounds identified in the lower part. In contrast, nitrogen-rich aliphatic compounds were negatively correlated with DOC concentration, indicating a higher contribution of deep groundwater at low DOC concentrations.
   Plain Language Summary Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a complex and heterogeneous mixture of substances present in water. Due to its complexity, the concentration of DOM is estimated based on the concentration of dissolved organic carbon. Monitoring DOM composition and concentration is important because of its impact on the aquatic ecosystem and in the treatment of drinking water from surface water reservoirs. In this study, we examined spatial changes in DOM chemical composition and dissolved organic carbon concentration along a headwater stream in the Bavarian Forest National Park (Southeast Germany), focusing on baseflow conditions. For this purpose, in-stream sensors were used to record changes in dissolved organic carbon concentration and discrete water samples were collected along the stream for molecular analysis of DOM. The analyses revealed that at comparatively high dissolved organic carbon concentrations, the composition of DOM in-stream reflects the composition of DOM stored in the superficial soil layers. Whereas at low concentrations, the DOM composition points to greater contribution from deep groundwater flows.

AB  - Numerous facts of birds breeding time advancement on the background of climate warming have been accumulated over the past decades. Most studies note a correlation between the population laying date and the temperature of a certain period, but the reasons and mechanism of this relationship remain uncertain. Individual-based genetic studies, despite significant success, are too complex and time-consuming, and their resolution is still insufficient to prove directed genetic changes associated with climate warming. We have implemented a population-based approach to the analysis of laying dates in 6054 nests of most abundant species in the poorly studied natural region for the period from 1974 to 2016. In search for the strongest climatic relationship, we iteratively sorted out three weather indicators, different dates of influence, and all successive fractions of the population entering into reproduction. In search for maximum climatic dependence, we checked the influence of three weather indicators, different exposure dates, and the response of each fraction of the population that successively enters breeding. We have found that the maximum response is associated with a phenological indicator based on the sum of the active temperatures. The greatest influence fell on the 35% quantile of the laying dates in the season, which coincided with the modal day in the population. The phenological peculiarity of the situation at the beginning of nesting was maintained for a long time and thus could serve as a reliable source of information on the timing of prospective food abundance. This should increase the efficiency of selection for an optimal laying date according to the results of reproduction, thereby explaining the mechanism of reaction to climate. We decomposed the observed laying dates and the dates of achievement of the necessary phenological conditions into components associated with a long-term trend and annual fluctuations. Comparing these data series, we obtained an independent assessment of the environmental influence on annual deviations and long-term displacement of breeding dates. The annual deviations of the conditions caused a proportional response: the short-distance migrants compensated for the environmental change by about half, the long-distance migrants by nearly 1/3, and the eastern ones did it poorer than the western ones. Under extreme phenological conditions, the response of some species was less than proportional, which indicated the limit of phenotypic plasticity. In years separated by a long interval, but similar in spring phenology, egg laying occurred significantly earlier. During the whole observation period, the spring phenology has shifted for more than 12 days and caused the same advance in the nesting time in shortdistance migrants, while long-distance migrants compensated for the shift by less than 2/3. The long-term shift in the laying dates has exceeded their standard deviation in populations by the average of 2.7 times. Thus, the described phenomena go well beyond phenotypic plasticity and suggest significant evolutionary change of the laying dates.

AB  - Microorganisms form the basis of soil food webs and represent key control points of carbon cycling and sequestration. Virtually all central European forests are managed and land-use regimes likely impact microbial abundance and community composition. Consequently, knowledge on how land-use intensity and abiotic variables, such as pH, C-to-N ratios, moisture regimes and concomitantly different stress levels, affect microbial communities is needed. We investigated phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles of leaf litter and soil from four forest types differing in foliage, age and management intensity, replicated in three regions across Germany. To account for temporal variation, samples were taken twice in the same season, but with an interval of three years. Total microbial biomass and microbial community composition differed between years, presumably due to between year variations in weather conditions. The litter layer was more prone to effects of drying, with a reduction of almost 30% of total PLFAs in the drier year. In soil effects of weather conditions depended on soil type and therefore differed between regions, with microorganisms in the sandy soils of the Schorfheide being more susceptible to water-stress, as evidenced by a ten-fold increase of the stress indicator cy/pre ratio in the drier year. Despite temporal variations in microbial biomass and community composition, the balance between the fungal and bacterial energy channel, as measured by fungal-to-bacterial ratios, remained rather constant in particular in soil. While total microbial biomass did not differ between forest types, microbial community composition differed significantly between beech and coniferous forests. Despite more acidic conditions, the fungal energy channel was less pronounced in leaf litter of coniferous forests than in broad-leaved forests, whereas the proportion of bacterial fatty acids was the highest in coniferous forests. Increasing management intensity presumably fosters the bacterial energy channel in the exposed litter layer. Supporting this assumption coniferous forests featured significantly higher values of the stress indicators cy/pre and SAT/MONO ratio. Bacterial community structure and biomass closely correlated with pH, with particular PLFAs dominating at high and low pH, respectively, indicating pH-specific microbial communities. In contrast, fungal abundance in leaf litter was correlated with C-to-N ratio. The results suggest that leaf litter and soil need to be considered separately when investigating changes in microbial community composition, since susceptibility of microorganisms to environmental stressors differs markedly between these layers. This, and repeated sampling events, may be particularly important when investigating subtle effects such as those related to climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary Light is an important environmental factor in many aspects for broiler chickens, such as behaviour and physiology, and welfare may be compromised when they are reared under low illuminance. We aimed to investigate what broiler chickens prefer when given free choice between a barn side with artificial lighting only as opposed to the other barn side with natural light through glass windows and artificial light. Environmental indicators and external conditions were monitored inside and outside the experimental barn, as well as chickens' preference regarding location in each side of the barn and their behavioural repertoire. Chickens preferred the barn side with natural and artificial light from 18 days onwards, after the heating light was removed. Chickens' behavioural repertoire changed according to barn side and their ages, expressing more natural behaviours and activity in the barn side with natural light. In summary, the birds indicated that natural light from windows makes a relevant difference in their lives, as it is what they choose when the only other option is the same in-barn environment with only artificial lighting. We aimed to investigate what broiler chickens prefer when given free choice between a barn side with artificial lighting only as opposed to the other barn side with natural light through glass windows and artificial light. Eighty-five 1 day-old male Cobb 500 broiler chickens were divided into 10 pens; half of each pen area was provided with only artificial light (OAL) and the other half with natural and artificial light (NAL), and birds were free to move across sides. Environmental indicators and external conditions such as temperature, relative humidity, air velocity, ammonia and illuminance were monitored inside and outside the barn. Chickens' preference was registered each three days, divided in categories: I (at 9, 12, and 15 days), II (at 18, 21, 24, and 27 days), and III (at 30, 33 and 36 days). The effect of the interaction between environmental indicators and week was statistically different only for illuminance. Chickens preferred NAL to OAL from 18 days onwards (II p < 0.001; III p = 0.016). Drinking (p = 0.034) and exploration or locomotion (p = 0.042) behaviours were more frequent, and "not visible" behaviours (p < 0.001) were less frequent, in NAL. Foraging was the only behaviour with an interaction effect between age category and light treatment, as birds during period II expressed this behaviour more frequently in NAL than OAL (p = 0.003). For our experimental conditions, the chickens preferred NAL from 18 days of age onwards, when the confounding effect of the heating light was removed, and their behavioural repertoire was also different according to each side of the barn and to their ages.

AB  - Purpose. The analysis of theoretical concepts of sustainable competitive advantage, the assessment of the competitive advantages of the agricultural sector in the region and identification of the opportunities to provide competitive advantages under conditions of instability as well as a changeable business environment. Results. Two opposite concepts of sustainable competitive advantages' sources are analyzed. The first one is resource-oriented, the second one - based on the influence of the external environment on the competitive position of the company. It is found out that in modern conditions, the concept based on the resource approach is more adequate for the agrarian sector as the business features in agriculture predetermine the considerable resources' immobility. In agriculture, due to the specificity of rural settlements, the combination of the basic resources (land, machinery, people) causes a quite rigid configuration that cannot be changed quickly enough. But the resources themselves are not a source of competitive advantage; the ability to use available resources effectively is important. The authors propose a method for comparing the security and efficiency of the basic resources' usage in agriculture by region. Under the framework of the methods, it was put the index method that allows comparing individual indicators and defining the integral index. The authors used such indicators as energy capacity, tractors and labour resources per one hectare of agricultural land to estimate resource availability. Resource efficiency is characterized by labour productivity indicators (gross production per one average annual employee) and land productivity (gross production per one hectare of agricultural land). The integral indices were calculated based on the geometric mean. There was done the comparative analysis of the provisions of basic resources and the efficiency of their usage by agricultural enterprises of Sumy region, neighbouring regions as well as the average industry indicators based on the proposed methodology. The analysis confirmed the existence of sustainable competitive advantages in the regional context and found that the leading resource is not natural characteristics, but effective management, which provides the highest efficiency of management. Conclusions. Taking into account the rapid changes in the business environment, any competitive advantage can quickly turn from sustainable to unstable. An assessment of the competitive advantages of the agrarian sector in the region has shown that to provide a sustainable position, it is first and foremost necessary to focus on reducing the costs and use innovations. Under conditions of rapid technological change, the main resource is human ones that can produce certain knowledge and innovative solutions. The proposed method of calculation of the integral indicators of resource availability and efficiency of their usage allows evaluating the existence of competitive advantages objectively and can be used both for the development of competitive strategies of agricultural enterprises and the preparation and decision-making at the level of central and regional authorities.

AB  - In this ecological risk assessment we evaluated potential climate-induced vegetation changes in mountain forests of Central Europe and possible impacts on species richness. The analysis was performed on all 1 km grid points of the Swiss forest inventory (c. 11,500 points) as well as on two subsets representing the forested points within the geographical limits of two inventories of legally protected reserve areas. The core of the approach is (a) a conceptual model of the movement of climatic ranges along altitudinal gradients as a result of global warming and (b) a spatially explicit forest community simulator that predicts a potential natural vegetation unit for any given 1 km grid point of the Swiss forest inventory for both current climate and for altered climate regimes, The model is derived from empirical data featuring the relationships between quasi-natural vegetation types and measured site variables. Species richness for any modelled forest community is estimated on the basis of phytosociological releves.
   The conceptual model showed that out of 109 legally protected landscapes, sites and natural monuments of national importance (minimum area > 1 km(2)) about 40-50% have an altitudinal or degree-day range that is able to host migrating species within the reserve limits if climate is warming in a moderate way (increase of mean annual temperature between +1.0 and + 1.4 degrees C). In the case of strong warming (increase of mean annual temperature between + 2.0 and + 2.8 degrees C) only 20-30% fulfil this criterion. The spatially explicit forest simulator showed that under a temperature increase without simultaneous increase in precipitation (warmer and more xeric due to increased evapotranspiration, Fagus-dominated communities in the colline-submontane belt might eventually be replaced by oak-hornbeam (Carpinion) communities. In the montane belt, the dominance of conifers will be seriously threatened by an invasion of deciduous species from the low montane and submontane belt. Under warmer and wetter conditions the vegetation shifts might not be as drastic as under warmer and more xeric conditions and the shift towards oak and oak-hornbeam communities on the Plateau is not supported. Concerning species richness, the models showed that in the case of warmer temperatures and constant precipitation (warmer and more xeric due to increased evapotranspiration) overall species richness is increasing on all I km points of the Swiss Forest Inventory, as well as on all selected subsets representing the forested points within legally protected reserve areas, In the case of warmer and wetter conditions the risk assessment does not show any drastic changes in the long-term species richness.

AB  - Using a light microscope, the morphological features of pollen grains of woody and shrubby plants (Trans Baikal Territory, Chita), located in the zone of increased technogenic load in the conditions of pollution by transport exhausts, were studied. The pollen of Malus baccata (L.) Borkh., Taraxacum officinale (L.) Webb ex F.H. Wigg., Clausia aprica (Stephan ex Willd.), Oxytropis miriophylla (Pall.) DC., Iris lactea Pall. According to the results of the morphological features of 1050 pollen grains of five plants, it was found that the anthers of all plants, with the exception of Clausia, contained teratomorphic (with developmental deviations) grains. Teratomorphic manifestations related mainly to changes in the sculpture of the upper shell of pollen - exina, the structure of which under normal natural conditions is a stable sign, allowing grains to be classified as taxa of a specific family, genus or species. The identified deviations in the development of pollen are grouped into 6 groups: - flattened; - crumpled; - with a thickened shell; - with fused apertures; - torn; - filled with air. Statistical processing of the obtained data showed that the largest number of deviations in the morphological features of the pollen of the studied plants was found in the pollen grains of Taraxacum officinale (41%) and Oxytropis miriophylla (33%). Among teratomorphic pollen of Oxytropis, flattened pollen grains predominated without internal contents (protoplasm), not providing the plant with the possibility of fertilization and reproduction. An Malus baccata and a Iris lacteal were characterized by the smallest amount of disturbed pollen, while Clausia aprica was characterized by its complete absence. The sizes of pollen grains (the presence of very fine and very large pollen) are not included in the number of signs of teratomorphosis, because often the level of natural polymorphism of the studied plants is quite high. This is especially true for Taraxacum officinale pollen, which even in conditions of ecological wellbeing is characterized by significant variations in the size of pollen grains and the number of apertures. The greatest variety of identified teratomorphic deviations regarding violations of shell sculptures was characterized by Taraxacum pollen samples and the complete absence of those, Clausia pollen. Among the disturbed Taraxacum pollen, grains with fused apertures predominated. The results of a study of its pollen grains showed a direct correlation of the content of pollen in its anthers with deviations, the volumes of which increase as we approach the source of pollution - the road. Since Taraxacum officinale is usually widespread in urban areas and is characterized by the greatest variety of identified teratomorphic deviations, bioindication with the help of its pollen in combination with geochemical testing could serve as an integral part of monitoring the state of soils and plants in Chita, and, based on its results, the development of measures to reduce pollution.

AB  - An increase in environmental temperature is one of the most common stress factors for plant organisms. The study of the plants' adaptation to stress factors remains extremely important and relevant. This article presents the results of a acute short-term influence of hyperthermia on species of two subgenera of the genus Haworthia Duval. We investigated the different levels of antioxidant protection and damage degree of the members of two subgenera of the genus Haworthia at the biochemical level, measuring the lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activities, total flavonoid content and content of photosynthetic pigments with a spectrophotometer. To determine the drought tolerance of plants, the water supply of tissues, water shortage and loss of water after an hour of wilting were measured. The values for different groups were compared by ANOVA followed by the Tukey multiple comparison test. The studied plants were warmed in a thermostat at temperatures of 40 degrees C and 50 degrees C for three hours under the conditions of natural light. The control group of plants was kept at 25 degrees C. The research has shown that H. attenuata, H. limifolia and H. cymbiformis are characterized with the increase of concentration of malonic dialdehyde at 40 degrees C and 50 degrees C, but a significant difference of values wasn't received, which indicates the relative resistance of these plants to the influence of high temperatures. The sharp increase of temperature causes the highest level of lipid peroxidation in H. parksiana plants, along with which, warming to 50 degrees C launches a mechanism of activation and synthesis of superoxide dismutase and flavonoids for the plants. The studied species of the subgenus Haworthia have a photosynthetic system relatively resistant to thermal stress in comparison to the subgenus Hexangulares. H. limifolia plants have a slight inhibition of photosynthesis. The adaptation of H. cymbiformis to thermal stress is due to the strategy of accumulation of a pool of active enzymes, superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, flavonoids under normal conditions and the activation of new peroxidase enzymes as a result of stress. H. attenuata is characterized by activation of new enzymes of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase under stress. It was found that H. cymbiformis and H. attenuata are more heat resistant in comparison with the other two species. Acute short-term hyperthermia has a different influence on the antioxidant system of different species of Haworthia. H. limifolia has the highest drought tolerance, H. cymbiformis has the lowest, the other two species from different subgenera have similar drought tolerance indicators. We did not find any dependence of the mechanisms of action of the antioxidant system under hyperthermia on the type of adaptation to arid conditions at the anatomical level in plants of different subgenera of the genus Haworthia.

AB  - This paper introduces the Nearly-Zero Exergy Airport (nZEXAP) concept that brings an energy, environment, and economy nexus to a common basis using the Second-Law of Thermodynamics. An nZEXAP airport has a district energy plant of its own, which receives at least 70% of the total exergy input at winter design conditions and 60% at summer design conditions, from onsite renewable energy resources and sustainable systems. These numerical criteria are consistent with the fact that especially ground heat, and solar heat have low exergy, compared to fossil fuels, and solar and wind energy applications in airports are limited. This definition is the basis of the new optimum plant design model for satisfying these new conditions with the least cost that is attributed to the cogeneration (aka CHP) system using an optimum mix of fossil and alternative fuels, such as on site-produced biogas. The main renewable exergy inputs are biogas, ground heat, building integrated or attached PV, and waste heat. Extensive use of on site wind and roof-top or on-land type of solar applications are limited in compliance to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations against glint and glare to pilots and air traffic controllers besides potential electromagnetic hazards on avionics. The exergetic performance of the airport district plant is defined and analyzed with the use of the Rational Exergy Management Model (REMM). New exergy metrics for the performance analysis and rating of nZEXAP airports, based energy, economy, and environment nexus were also developed. The optimization problem has three primary design variables, namely the ratio of the optimum cogeneration engine capacity to the peak power load, the split of the generated power supply between the airport and the groundsource heat pumps, and the natural gas to biogas mixing ratio. The objective function solves the primary design variables by a simple search method. The new tool was applied to a conceptual study for the Amsterdam Schiphol Airport in order to compare the impact of an nZEXAP design with the ongoing deep retrofit work. Amsterdam Schiphol Airport aims to make its own activities climate neutral and to generate 10% of its own energy sustainably by 2020. In this comparison, the relative impact of the biogas share, solar input, size and performance of the ground-source heat pumps, and the power-to-heat ratio of cogeneration and absorption cooling were investigated. The results indicate that with the new optimization model, nZEXAP objectives may be satisfied, if techno-economic constraints are also satisfied. Further refinements in the definition may be needed.

AB  - Remobilization of chemicals from contaminated sediments is a major risk associated with dredging and disposal operations in harbour areas. In this work caged mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis, were chosen as bioindicator organisms to reveal the impact and recovery of organisms from these activities in the harbour of Piombino (Tuscany, Italy) where approximately 100,000 m(3) of sediments were removed and disposed in a local confined disposal facility (CDF). Organisms were deployed before, during and after the end of operations, selecting sites differently impacted by these activities. Temporal changes in environmental bioavailability and biological effects of pollutants were assessed by integrating analyses of trace metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) accumulated in tissues of caged mussels with a wide array of biomarkers reflecting exposure to specific classes of pollutants and different levels of cellular unbalance or toxicity. Such biological responses included levels of metallothioneins, activity of acyl CoA oxidase (AOX) as a marker of peroxisome proliferation, oxidative stress biomarkers (content of glutathione, enzymatic activities of catalase, glutathione S-transferases, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidases), total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC) toward peroxyl and hydroxyl radicals, lysosomal membrane stability and genotoxic effects measured as DNA strand breaks and frequency of micronuclei. Obtained results indicated that a general disturbance was already present in the whole harbour area and especially in the inner site before the beginning of operations, when caged mussels exhibited a significant accumulation of PAHs and Pb, lower TOSC values and higher levels of both lysosomal and genotoxic damages. Bioavailability of trace metals and PAHs markedly increased during dredging activities with values up to 40 mu g/g for Pb and up to 2200 ng/g for PAHs in tissues of caged mussels, a significant inhibition of antioxidant efficiency and increase of oxidative damages. While bioavailability, of trace metals returned to the pre-dredging values after the end of operations, the accumulation of PAHs, oxidative effects and genotoxic damages remained elevated in mussels caged in the inner area and in front of CDF. Overall this study confirmed the utility of caged mussels to assess the remobilization of chemicals from dredged sediments and the onset of potentially harmful biological effects.

AB  - Aim Anthropogenic climate change is expected to result in the complete loss of glaciers from the high mountains of tropical Africa, with profound impacts on the hydrology and ecology of unique tropical cold-water lakes located downstream from them. This study examines the biodiversity of Chironomidae (Insecta: Diptera) communities in these scarce Afroalpine lake systems, in order to determine their uniqueness in relation to lowland African lakes and alpine lakes in temperate regions, and to evaluate the potential of Afroalpine Chironomidae as biological indicators to monitor future changes in the ecological integrity of their habitat.
   Location Mount Kenya (Kenya) and Rwenzori Mountains (Uganda).
   Methods The species composition of Afroalpine chironomid communities was assessed using recent larval death assemblages extracted from the surface sediments of 11 high-mountain lakes between 2900 and 4575 m. Results were compared with similar faunal data from 68 East African lakes at low and middle elevation (750-2760 m), and with literature records of Chironomidae species distribution in sub-Saharan Africa, the Palaearctic region and elsewhere. All recovered taxa were fully described and illustrated.
   Results The 11-lake analysis yielded 1744 subfossil chironomid larvae belonging to 16 distinct taxa of full-grown larvae, and three taxa of less differentiated juveniles. Eleven of these 16 are not known to occur in African lakes at lower elevation, and eight taxa (or 50% of total species richness) appear restricted to the specific habitat of cold lakes above 3900 m, where night-time freezing is frequent year-round. The faunal transition zone coincides broadly with the Ericaceous zone of terrestrial vegetation (c. 3000-4000 m). Snowline depression during the Quaternary ice ages must have facilitated dispersion of cold-stenothermous species among the high mountains of equatorial East Africa, but less so from or to the Palaearctic region via the Ethiopian highlands.
   Main conclusions Chironomid communities in glacier-fed lakes on Africa's highest mountains are highly distinct from those of lowland African lakes, and potentially unique on a continental scale. By virtue of excellent preservation and their spatial and temporal integration of local community dynamics, chironomid larval death assemblages extracted from surface sediments are powerful biological indicators for monitoring the hydrological and ecological changes associated with the current retreat and loss of Africa's glaciers.

AB  - The need to integrate stakeholders' views into environmental policy is increasingly gaining attention because this offers the opportunity to design sustainable and synergistic environmental strategies. Understanding and integrating the views of resource users into policy design and implementation could help address the most important challenges, gain community support, enhance project ownership, and avoid policies being rejected by local people. As a result, research in environmental management has focussed on stakeholders' perceptions of river water quality and how to integrate such views into policy. While existing studies offer insights into the different ways in which stakeholders evaluate river water quality and potential factors influencing judgements, they appear to be limited in a number of ways. First, most of these studies focus on developed countries and may have limited contextual relevance to the developing world. Moreover, past studies focus on segments of society such as farmers and mainly on wastewater for agriculture. These shortcomings may limit our understanding of the topic and our ability to design effective policies to address water quality problems. Drawing on survey data from the Wenchi municipality in Ghana, we examine public perceptions of what constitute important measures of river water quality as well as factors influencing such judgements. Results suggest that while variables such as taste, colour, smell and litter are important, the presence of faecal matter in and/or around the river was rated the most important measure of river water quality while depth of river was the least important. Results further suggest that education, age, number of years a person had lived in a community, depth of river and the presence of aquatic vegetation influence water quality judgements. The findings of this research provide insights into what policymakers and regulators need to consider when attempting to influence behaviours in relation to water resources. We note, however, that while public perceptions of river water quality could guide water management policies, scientific measurements of water quality must not be replaced with stakeholder perceptions. This is because aspects such as ecological integrity may not be important to segments of the public but are an important aspect of water management. This is reinforced in the present study as there seems to be a lack of concern among the participants regarding river depth - an important factor for habitat provision and pollution dilution.

AB  - Information on silver nanoparticle (AgNP) phytotoxicity on seagrasses is provided for the first time. Toxic effects of environmentally relevant AgNP concentrations on Halophila stipulacea were assessed to identify sensitive biomarkers, to determine threshold effect concentrations and to evaluate potential risks. Potential alterations in the cytoskeleton, endoplasmic reticulum, cell ultrastructure and viability, oxidative stress parameters and elongation in H. stipulacea leaves exposed to AgNP concentrations ranging from 0.0002 to 0.2 mg L-1 for 8 days were examined. The first signs of actin filament (AF) response in differentiating cells, exhibiting disorientation and slight bundling, were observed on the 4th day at 0.0002 mg L-1, while at the end of the experiment and at the higher concentrations, AFs were extremely bundled. Endoplasmic reticulum was affected in meristematic and differentiating cells; massive aggregations and loss of the "grainy" structure were observed, initially on the 6th day at 0.002 mg L-1. Effects on microtubules were detected on the last day at 0.2 mg L-1. An increase in H2O2 levels on the 4th and/or 6th day even at 0.0002 mg L-1 was followed by a decrease on, or up to the last day. On the 6th day at the lowest concentration, elevated malondialdehyde content, and superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activity were detected, indicating oxidative damage and antioxidant defense mechanism activation. Dead epidermal cells mainly occurred at 0.02 and 0.2 mg L-1, while no dead vein cells were detected. A significant inhibition in leaf elongation was observed only at 0.2 mg L-1. Therefore, AF disturbance in differentiating leaf cells, being a susceptible response parameter, could be regarded as an early warning indicator of risk posed by AgNPs to H. stipulacea meadows, while most of the remaining parameters examined also constitute useful biomarkers. The lowest observed effect concentration (0.0002 mg L-1), being within the range of environmentally relevant AgNPs concentrations, suggests the possibility of negative impacts of AgNPs on seagrass health. A risk quotient of 1.33 was calculated, indicating that AgNPs may pose a significant potential risk to the coastal environment. The data presented highlight the importance of future research to further investigate the seagrass-AgNP interactions, stress the need for a refinement of the environmental risk assessment of AgNPs and could be utilized for the design of biomonitoring programs for rational management of the coastal environment.

AB  - Biodiversity information is an important basis for ecological research and environmental assessment, and can be impacted by choices made in the manipulation and analysis of taxonomic data. Such choices include methods for resolving multiple redundant levels of taxonomic resolution, as typically arise with morphological identification of damaged or immature aquatic macro-invertebrates. In particular, the effects of these processing choices on number of rare taxa are poorly understood yet potentially significant to the estimation of projected taxa richness and related evaluations such as biodiversity conservation value and survey sufficiency. Using aquatic macro invertebrate data collected for two nearshore areas of Lake Superior, we determined how multiple methods of resolving taxonomic redundancies influence two commonly-used estimates of projected richness, Chaol and Chao2, which hinge on the ratio of taxa that are singletons to doubletons (i.e., just one versus two individuals found) or uniques versus duplicates (i.e., just one versus two occurrences). We also determined how choice of ambiguous taxa method, including some modified specifically to retain rare taxa and others taken from the literature, influenced effort to reach 95% of projected richness, site-level richness and abundance, and representative invertebrate IBI scores. We found that Chaol was more sensitive to method choice than Chao2, because singleton and doubleton status was more frequently affected when taxa were deleted, merged, or reassigned in the process of resolving taxonomic redundancies than was unique and duplicate status. Methods that eliminated redundant taxa at the site scale but not the study-area scale tended to overinflate study area and projected richness, and resulted in a significant loss of abundance. The method that aggregated or deleted redundant taxa depending on abundance resulted in a decrease in site and study area richness, abundance, and an underestimation of projected richness. Methods which re-assigned parents to common children retained a majority of richness and abundance information and a more realistic estimate of projected taxa richness; however, the identity of poorly-identified parents was imputed. All methods resulted in little effect to typical IBI scores. Overall, no one method is fully capable of removing spurious richness at the study-area scale while preserving all taxa occurrence, abundance and rarity patterns. Therefore, the most appropriate method for making comparisons among sites may be different than the most appropriate method for comparing among surveys or among study areas, or if a goal is to estimate projected taxa richness or retain rare taxa information.

AB  - An objective, quantifiable index of structural biodiversity that could be rapidly obtained with reduced or no field effort is essential for the use of structure as universal ecological indicator for ecosystem management. Active remote sensing provides a rapid assessment tool to potentially guide land managers in highly dynamic and spatially complex landscapes. These landscapes are often dependent on frequent disturbance regimes and characterized by high endemism.
   We propose a modified Shannon-Wiener Index and modified Evenness Index as stand structural complexity indices for surrogates of ecosystem health. These structural indices are validated at Tall Timbers Research Station the site of one of the longest running fire ecology studies in southeastern U.S. This site is dominated by highly dynamic pine-grassland woodlands maintained with frequent fire. Once the dominant ecosystem in the Southeast, this woodland complex has been cleared for agriculture or converted to other cover types, and depends on a frequent (1- to 3-year fire return interval) low- to moderate-intensity fire regime to prevent succession to mixed hardwood forests and maintain understory species diversity. Structural evaluation of the impact of multiple disturbance regimes included height profiles and derived metrics for five different fire interval treatments; 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, mixed fire frequency (a combination of 2- and 4-year fire returns), and fire exclusion. The 3-dimensional spatial arrangement of structural elements was used to assess hardwood encroachment and changes in structural complexity. In agreement with other research, 3-year fire return interval was considered to be the best fire interval treatment for maintaining the pine-grassland woodlands, because canopy cover and vertical diversity indices were shown to be statistically higher in fire excluded and less frequently burned plots than in 1- and 2-year fire interval treatments. We developed a LiDAR-derived structural diversity index, LHDI, and propose that an ecosystem-specific threshold target for management intervention can be developed, based on significant shifts in structure and composition using this new index.
   Structural diversity indices can be valuable surrogates of ecosystem biodiversity, and ecosystem-specific target values can be developed as objective quantifiable goals for conservation and ecosystem integrity, particularly in remote areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Social interactions are central to the health and psychological well-being of domestic animals. Until now, research has overwhelmingly focused on negative social behaviours such as aggression or the lack of social interactions such as social separation and isolation. This contradicts the fact that social animals derive benefits from living in a group, and observations that positive forms of social behaviour are the predominant type in stable groups. In particular, prosocial behaviours have been overlooked. As a result, we know little about the breadth of the prosocial behavioural repertoire, the motivation of animals to act prosocially, its modulation by individual and contextual factors, and its ultimate welfare implications.
   Prosocial behaviours are generally defined as actions that an individual engages in to benefit others, and more specifically actions "expected to produce or maintain the physical and psychological well-being and integrity of others" (Wispe 1972), hence giving animals a stake in the welfare of others. The prosocial behavioural repertoire is diverse, englobing various forms of social behaviours: parental care, affiliation, sharing, social teaching, cooperation and other types of caring and helping behaviours toward others. Prosocial behaviour differs from empathy in that empathy infers relating to another's state whereas prosocial behaviour refers to an action, and not all prosocial behaviours may require the capacity for empathy. Nevertheless, the mechanisms that motivate an animal to act prosocially are still poorly understood. Prosocial behaviours can be modulated by a number of factors, amongst which individual characteristics (ontogeny, previous experience, dominance relationships, sociality level, emotional state, gender), the recipient (relationship to the donor, need and benefit), and the context (social and physical environments, resource availability).
   To date, research on prosocial behaviour in domestic animals has mostly been limited to parental and affiliative behaviours. Evidence of other prosocial behaviours in domestic animals is sparse, but this is due to a lack of research rather than null findings. A better understanding of the social and husbandry factors modulating prosocial behaviours has implications in practice. Most importantly, the implications of prosocial behaviours for animal welfare remain to be elucidated. The link between social behaviour and affective states offers opportunities to use prosocial behaviour to promote positive mental states and well-being in social animals. Prosocial behaviours could be positive welfare indicators of bilateral nature, beneficial to the recipient and inherently rewarding to the donor.

AB  - Urban green infrastructures (UGIs) are being increasingly recognized as key providers of ecosystem services (ES) in cities. However, many developing countries still lack the public awareness of the concepts of UGIs and their ES, including the benefit & monetary value of the UGIs' services, the willingness to pay (WTP) for the UGIs' services. The relationship between the benefits & monetary value of and the WTP for the services of UGIs has not been extensively investigated. These two aspects were respectively defined as ES supply and as ES demand in the current study, in which their relationship was scientifically described. Meanwhile, the influential factors of the deviation between ES supply and ES demand were explored. Adopting Guangzhou City (China) as a case, the main ES supply of UGIs in three public green spaces including air pollutant removal, daytime temperature reduction, rainwater runoff regulation, and noise abatement was first assessed with field measurements. Further, the main ES demand including people's preferences, satisfaction, and WTP for the UGIs' ES was analyzed with survey and statistical analysis. In total, 405 valid questionnaires were distributed to collect the data of ES demand and were analyzed by the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis H test and a binary logistic regression model. The monetary valuation was used to unify the benefit valuation standards provided by different ESs, so as to more intuitively reflect the contribution of different ESs and compare these with ESs demand which uses WTP as one of the indicators. The results showed significant differences between ES supply and ES demand. The major evidence was that the regulation services could supply most of the ES benefits, while the cultural services were the most demanded by respondents. People had diverse sensitivity to the different types of ES provided by the UGIs. Cultural services were the most easily perceived by the respondents and considered as the top one, followed by regulation services. In addition, the outcome of the survey revealed different criteria regarding ES demand by people, and varying influencing factors for people's satisfaction and WTP. Benefits, such as education opportunities, entertainment, and health values provided by UGIs in cultural services were more favored by respondents. Last, the statistical analysis confirmed that sociodemographic factors significantly influence people's WTP. This study suggests that UGIs should be oriented towards multifunctional construction, thereby emphasizing the relationship and balance between ecological integrity and social perception.

AB  - Adults of the sandhopper Talitrus saltator were fed with dry fish food mixed with polyethylene microspheres (diameter 10-45 mu m). Observations of homogenized guts revealed the presence of microspheres independently of their dimensions. The gut resident time (GRT) was recorded and most of the microspheres are expelled in 24 h. Microspheres are totally expelled in one week. Preliminary investigations did not show any consequence of microsphere ingestion on the survival capacity in the laboratory. FT-IR analyses carried out on faeces of freshly collected individuals revealed the presence of polyethylene and polypropylene. This confirms that microplastic debris could be swallowed by T. saltator in natural conditions. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cuffney and Qian (2013) performed numerous simulations to demonstrate potential flaws in Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN), a method for interpreting taxon contributions to community change along novel environmental gradients. Based on their simulations, they concluded that: 1) TITAN is not an effective method for detecting different types of statistical thresholds in trend lines, 2) permutation results in highly significant p-values even for splits that are not thresholds, and 3) coincident change points may arise as an artifact of inaccuracies, imprecision, and systematic bias in both change-point estimation and TITAN's bootstrap. The critique raises some important concerns, but because of significant misunderstanding, it is based on analyses that violate basic assumptions of both TITAN and indicator species analysis (IndVal), and thus, constitutes a straw man that cannot be used to evaluate their performance. We demonstrate that the critique: 1) fundamentally misrepresents TITAN's primary goals; 2) simulates taxon abundances based on unrealistic statistical models that fail to represent important empirical patterns present in Cuffney and Qian's own published data sets (i.e., negative binomial distributions, frequent absences a function of the predictor); 3) tests TITAN's ability to identify breaks in trend lines distorted by log-transformation that do not match the greatest change in the simulated response, leading to misinterpretation of expected and previously documented behavior by TITAN as errors; 4) misinterprets TITAN's use of p-values while ignoring diagnostic indices of purity and reliability for identifying robust indicator taxa; and 5) asserts that bootstrapped change-point quantiles in TITAN are too narrow despite published results to the contrary. Last, in contrast to the claim that change-point synchrony may be an artifact of the technique, we show that: 6) analysis of published data using completely independent methods (i.e., scatterplots of abundance data or generalized additive models) also reveals synchrony in the nonlinear decline of numerous taxa in corroboration of TITAN and its underlying conceptual model. Thus, Cuffney and Qian have not identified any serious limitations of TITAN because their critique is based on misinterpretation of TITAN's assumptions and primary objectives. However, their critique does highlight the need for clarification of the appropriate uses, potential misuses, and limitations of TITAN and other methods for ecological analysis.

AB  - Subarctic water bodies are extremely vulnerable with respect to changes in the environmental characteristics, including an increase in temperature. The thermal effect of spent waters of power plants in water bodies of the Kola Peninsula was found to cause changes in communities comparable, within certain limits, with the effect of eutrophication. The most informative indices, characterizing the response of zooplankton community to the thermal impact of spent waters of the Kola NPP are determined for the case of Lake Imandra, the Kola Peninsula. The qualitative and quantitative characteristics of zooplankton are shown to have some specific features depending on the extent of the thermal pollution of the water body and to adequately reflect the difference between the conditions of zooplankton existence in its individual parts. The indicator role of zooplankton is evaluated, and the possibility to incorporate it in the monitoring system of water bodies is substantiated.

AB  - In contrast to the blood lead level, which is an effective indicator of current exposure, the concentration of lead in the teeth is a measure of internal exposure in the past and low-level chronic exposure. Our measurements show that lead concentrations depend in a complex manner on both the part and the type of tooth. We highlight a variety of risk factors of long-term lead exposure: involuntary smoking (including by expecting mothers), the type and duration of the way to school (the effect of traffic), how children play, the individual environment (housing conditions), and other factors.

AB  - Archive data analysis shows that during the different periods of anthropogenic impact phytoplankton production reaches pathologically high levels. Thus, phytoplankton is assumed as an indicator of marine water quality and ecological health. Its long-term excess in the Black Sea suggests the steps forward for better understanding and management of the existing process.
   Phytoplankton surplus production exhausts the ecosystem and leads to blooms with respective consequences-changes in water color (red, brown), bad smell, shining of the body, indigestion after consumption of sea foods.
   Blooms may last from 10 to 20 days which Is disastrous for the bottom coenoses and tourist business.
   The article presents the main phytoplankton species dynamics during the period 1991-2003 which has led to the above mentioned conditions.

AB  - The delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) is an endangered pelagic fish species endemic to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Estuary in Northern California, which acts as an indicator of ecosystem health in its habitat range. Interrogative tools are required to successfully monitor effects of contaminants upon the delta smelt, and to research potential causes of population decline in this species. We used microarray technology to investigate genome-wide effects in fish exposed to ammonia; one of multiple contaminants arising from wastewater treatment plants and agricultural runoff. A 4-day exposure of 57-day old juveniles resulted in a total ammonium (NH4+-N) median lethal concentration (LC50) of 13 mg/L, and a corresponding un-ionized ammonia (NH3) LC50 of 147 mu g/L.. Using the previously designed delta smelt microarray we assessed altered gene transcription in juveniles exposed to 10 mg/L NH4+-N from this 4-day exposure. Over half of the responding genes were associated with membrane integrity and function, however, neurological and muscular function was also affected. Amongst the notable pathways affected by ammonium exposure, directly associated with cellular membranes, are energy metabolism through oxidative phosphorylation, cellular responses to environmental stimuli, highlighted through signal transduction and molecular interactions, cellular processes encompassing transport and catabolism, along with cell motility, development, communication and cell death. To assess these impacts further, key genes were selected as potential biomarkers and investigated using quantitative PCR analysis on fish exposed to 2.5, 5, 10,20 and 40 mg/L NH4+-N. Quantitative PCR results indicate biphasic responses, pivoting around the estimated no-observed effect concentration (NOEC; 5.0 mg/L NH4+-N) and below. Genes significantly affected by ammonia exposure include claudin-10, Keratin-15, Septin-3, Transmembrane protein 4,superfamily 4 (membrane), Tropomyosin, Myosin light chain, Calmodulin (muscular), Tubulin cofactor beta (neurological), Sirtuin-6 (development), and Rhesus associated type C glycoprotein 1 (gill- and skin-specific ammonium transporter). The quantitation of the ammonium transporter may highlight the capacity of delta smelt to contend with elevated levels of ammonia, the peak response of which may be indicative of short-term thresholds of tolerance. Our study supports the notion that exposure to ammonia results in cell membrane destabilization, potentially affecting membrane permeability, enhancing uptake and thus synergistic effects of multiple-contaminant exposure.

AB  - Identifying the key drivers of aquatic fauna structuring at multiple spatial scales is critical in reducing biodiversity loss. Macroinvertebrates are the most sensitive indicators of disturbance and they are used as a cost-effective tool for bioassessment at catchment and site scales. The focus of our study was to identify the key drivers from three classes of environmental variables (geophysical landscape, land use, and site habitat) that influence macroinvertebrate richness in different aquatic ecological function regions (AEFRs) of the Liaohe River Basin. We sampled macroinvertebrate assemblages, extracted geophysical and climate variables from geospatial data, and quantified physical and chemical habitats from 407 randomly distributed sites that belong to the three level-I AEFRs. We analyzed our data through multiple linear regression models by using the three classes of predicted variables alone and in combination. The models that were constructed in the first level-I AEFR explained similar amounts of macroinvertebrate richness and had the maximum ability to explain how macroinvertebrate richness distributed (denoted explaining ability; geophysical landscape: R-GL(2) approximate to 60%, land use and site habitat: R-LU(2) and R-SH(2) approximate to 50%, and combined: R-CB(2) approximate to 75%). The explaining abilities for the third level-I AEFR were as follows: R-GL(2) approximate to 11%, R-LU(2) approximate to 14%, R-SH(2) approximate to 25%, and R-CB(2) approximate to 38%. The explaining abilities for the 4th level-I AEFR were as follows: R-GL(2) approximate to 30%, R-LU(2) approximate to 7%, R-SH(2) approximate to 40%, and R-CB(2) approximate to 55%. We conclude that: (1) all of the combined models explained more interaction as compared with the single models; (2) the environmental variables differed among different level-I AEFRs; and, (3) variables in the site habitat scale were the most robust explainers when analyzing the relationship between environmental variables and macroinvertebrate richness and they can be recommended as the optimal candidate explainer. These results may provide cost-effective tools for distinguishing and identifying the drivers of sensitive aquatic organisms at regional scales.

AB  - This article contributes to emerging critiques of UK creative economy policy by challenging the unremitting celebration of "growth" as the primary indicator of economic success. The ecological fallacies of "exclusive" growth and the social and environmental injustices that "creative growth" has occasioned are initially discussed - and a range of possible other understandings of growth introduced. The article concludes that under conditions of real economic stagnation and incipient environmental crisis, growth needs to be made limited, but also more fully socialised in a dual sense; made more evenly and equitably redistributed in terms of benefits and rewards, as well as re-conceived in terms that afford greater priority to non-economic values and human prosperity indicators.

AB  - Animal welfare in dairy farming is characterised by avoiding health hazards for the animals and feeding of natural feedstuff which are given in amounts according to actual nutritional demands. The housing environment facilitates normal behaviour, avoids stress and lets animals arrive at a high age with high and stable performance. To achieve this, nutritional demands must be met and the housing elements must be kept in continuous function and in hygienically perfect condition. Only the farmer can make sure that the keeping of his animals is in total ethologically adequate. A combination of animal related, technical (including building) and management specific indicators is necessary on the farm level for comprehensive evaluation of whether animal welfare demands are met in the specific housing system.

AB  - Four simple quick test methods were evaluated for their ability to predict the N mineralisation potential of six pastoral soils under controlled glasshouse or incubation conditions. Soil samples were taken to determine N mineralisation potential and extractable NH4+ by different extractants. The relationships between N mineralisation potential and extractable NH4+ were assessed. Autoclave extracted-NH4+ (R-2 = 0.70; P < 0.001), HCl extracted-NH4+ (R-2 = 0.83; P < 0.001) and NaHCO3 (R-2 = 0.81; P < 0.001) methods were the best indicators of N mineralisation rate. The potential of these simple quick tests to be used as rapid, simple indices of N mineralisation rate in pastoral soils need to be further evaluated under field conditions where inputs of N fertiliser and farm effluents occur.

Impetus for the research was a need to inform planning and policy decisions in the Detroit metropolitan area. The study also addresses theoretical concerns about relationships between objective conditions in cities, towns and rural areas and people's subjective and behavioral responses to the conditions. In addition to-measuring subjective well being of Detroit area residents, issues explored in the study include travel and transportation, neighborhoods and neighboring, parks and recreation behavior, housing and residential mobility, and sprawl and open space preservation. The program of research also involves parallel studies in other world cities. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The approaches for coffee production in Colombia are diverse in response to the environmental offer of the regions where they are established as the main rural productive activity. Sustainability conditions in economic, environmental, social, and technical dimensions of an agroforestry system in association with other crops and monoculture were analyzed in one municipality of Santander and five municipalities of the department of Caldas. The information was obtained from direct interviews with 81 producers and processed through descriptive statistical and cluster analyses to define the sustainability assessment scale. The results indicate that the agroforestry model impacts the profitability and productivity of the crop compared to the other two models, showing that even being less sustainable in technical and economic terms, it has favorable sustainability conditions in environmental indicators, strategic for climate change adaptation and mitigation in the regions.

AB  - Managing ecosystems to provide ecosystem services in the face of global change is a pressing challenge for policy and science. Predicting how alternative management actions and changing future conditions will alter services is complicated by interactions among components in ecological and socioeconomic systems. Failure to understand those interactions can lead to detrimental outcomes from management decisions. Network theory that integrates ecological and socioeconomic systems may provide a path to meeting this challenge. While network theory offers promising approaches to examine ecosystem services, few studies have identified how to operationalize networks for managing and assessing diverse ecosystem services. We propose a framework for how to use networks to assess how drivers and management actions will directly and indirectly alter ecosystem services.

AB  - Egg abundance of Maurolicus japonicus, a dominant mesopelagic fish in the Japan Sea, was analyzed during 1981-2005 as an index of the spawning-adult abundance. There was a major change in egg abundance around 1988/1989, with negative anomalies occurring during 1981-1988 and positive anomalies occurring from 1989. At about the same time (1986/1987), the Tsushima Current shifted from cold to warm conditions. Environmental indices were found to be positively correlated with egg abundance two years later. Our results suggest that the abundance of M. japonicus is affected by climatic regime shifts, and that it could be used as an indicator species.

AB  - Measuring interfacial tension parameter between hydrocarbon injecting gas and live reservoir oil samples is really a good indicator for predicting optimum miscible gas injection scenarios at reservoir condition. Conducting an experimental miscible gas injection project for one of the Iranian oil fields, natural liquefied gas (NGL) and Naphtha was candidate to enrich injecting gas in order to investigate gas composition effects on efficiency of miscibility process. As a result, injecting gas was enriched by NGL and Naphtha samples with predefined ratios. This study aimed to measure and compare interfacial tension parameters between reservoir oil and five synthesized gas samples at different depleting pressures and reservoir temperature. The results showed optimum miscible gas enrichment candidates with minimum interfacial tension parameters at depletion pressure steps. (C) 2020 INT TRANS J ENG MANAG SCI TECH.

AB  - Confidence in the use of macroalgae as an indicator of estuarine eutrophication is limited by the lack of quantitative data on the thresholds of its adverse effects on benthic habitat quality. In the present study, we utilized sediment profile imagery (SPI) to identify thresholds of adverse effects of macroalgal biomass, sediment organic carbon (% OC) and sediment nitrogen (% N) concentrations on the apparent Redox Potential Discontinuity (aRPD), the depth that marks the boundary between oxic near-surface sediment and the underlying suboxic or anoxic sediment. At 16 sites in eight California estuaries, SPI, macroalgal biomass, sediment percent fines, % OC, and % N were analyzed at 20 locations along an intertidal transect. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis was used to identify step thresholds associated with a transition from "reference" or natural background levels of macroalgae, defined as that range in which no effect on aRPD was detected. Ranges of 3-15 g dw macroalgae m(-2), 0.4-0.7 % OC and 0.05-0.07 % N were identified as transition zones from reference conditions across these estuaries. Piecewise regression analysis was used to identify exhaustion thresholds, defined as a region along the stress-response curve where severe adverse effects occur; levels of 175 g dw macroalgae m(-2), 1.1 % OC and 0.1 % N were identified as thresholds associated with a shallowing of aRPD to near zero depths. As an indicator of ecosystem condition, shallow aRPD has been related to reduced volume and quality for benthic infauna and alteration in community structure. These effects have been linked to reduced availability of forage for fish, birds and other invertebrates, as well as to undesirable changes in biogeochemical cycling.

AB  - Water content of the vegetation canopy or individual leaves is an important variable in physiological plant processes. In Mediterranean regions where water availability is an important production limiting factor, it is a strong indicator of vegetation stress. Spectroscopic earth-observation techniques in the solar part of the electromagnetic spectrum provide opportunities to determine leaf and canopy-water content due to the presence of water-absorption bands around 970 and 1200 nm. We investigated the possibilities to predict leaf-water content of three dominant tree species in a study area in Mediterranean France using spectral indices. During a field campaign leaf-water content (EWT) was determined and high-resolution spectra were measured of the same leaves. The spectra were measured in two ways: using an optical cable with a field of view of 25 and using a leaf clip with its own artificial illumination source. The spectra were analyzed and related to leaf-water content as original reflectance spectra and as continuum-removed spectra using eight spectral leaf-water indices. Next, reflectance spectra were simulated to explore their sensitivity to environmental conditions like leaf area index and illumination angle using a radiative transfer model. Results show that a good correlation (0.70) exists between leaf-water content and spectral indices using the right slope of the 970 nm water-absorption band. Continuum-removal correction of the spectra improved the relations. The model sensitivity analysis illustrated that from a set of five environmental variables leaf area index has, as may be expected, an important impact on leaf-water estimates. This field and model study illustrates that it is feasible to determine foliar water content on the basis of spectral indices located around the minor water-absorption bands with a limited effect of environmental conditions.

AB  - Successful conservation planning for the Canadian boreal forest requires biodiversity data that are both accessible and reliable. Spatially exhaustive data is required to inform on conditions, trends and context, with context enabling consideration of conservation opportunities and related trade-offs. However, conventional methods for measuring biodiversity, while useful, are spatially constrained, making it difficult to apply over wide geographic regions. Increasingly, remotely sensed imagery and methods are seen as a viable approach for acquiring explicit, repeatable and multi-scale biodiversity data over large areas. To identify relevant remotely derived environmental indicators specific to biodiversity within the Canadian boreal forest, we assessed indicators of the physical environment such as seasonal snow cover, topography and vegetation production. Specifically, we determined if the indicators provided distinct information and whether they were useful predictors of species richness (tree, mammal, bird and butterfly species). Using cluster analysis, we also assessed the applicability of these indicators for broad ecosystem classification of the Canadian boreal forest and the subsequent attribution of these stratified regions (i.e. clusters). Our results reveal that the indicators used in the cluster creation provided unique information and explained much of the variance in tree (92.6%), bird (84.07%), butterfly (61.4%) and mammal (22.6%) species richness. Spring snow cover explained the most variance in species richness. Results further show that the 15 clusters produced using cluster analysis were principally stratified along a latitudinal gradient and, while varied in size, captured a range of different environmental conditions across the Canadian boreal forest. The most important indicators for discriminating between the different cluster groups were seasonal greenness, a multipart measure of climate, topography and land use, and wetland cover, a measure of the percentage of wetland within a 1 km(2) cell.

AB  - Dendrochemical and biochemical markers link stress in apparently healthy red spruce trees (Picea rubens) to acidic deposition. Acidic deposition to spruce forests of the northeastern USA increased sharply during the 1960s. Previous reports related visible damage of trees at high elevations to root and soil processes. In this report, dendrochemical and foliar biochemical markers indicate perturbations in biological processes in healthy red spruce trees across the northeastern USA. Previous research on the dendrochemistry of red spruce stemwood indicated that under uniform environmental conditions, stemwood concentrations of Ca and Mg decreased with increasing radial distance from the pith. For nine forest locations, frequency analysis shows that 28 and 52% of samples of red spruce stemwood formed in the 1960s are enriched in Ca and Mg, respectively, relative to wood formed prior to and after the 1960s. This enrichment in trees throughout the northeastern USA may be interpretable as a signal of increased availability of essential cations in forest soils. Such a temporary increase in the availability of Ca and Mg could be caused by cation mobilization, a consequence of increased acidic deposition. During cation mobilization, essential Ca and Mg as well as potentially harmful Al become more available for interaction with binding sites in the soil and absorbing roots. As conditions which favor cation mobilization continue, Ca and Mg can be leached or displaced from the soil. A measure of the interaction between Ca and Al is the Al/Ca binding ratio (molar charge ratio of exchangeable Al to exchangeable Ca). As the Al/Ca binding ratio in the root zone increased from 0.3 to 1.9, the foliar concentration of the biochemical stress marker putrescine also increased from 45 to 145 nm g(-1). The correlation of the putrescine concentration to the Al/Ca binding ratio (adj. r(2) = 0.68, P < 0.027) suggests that foliar stress may be linked to soil chemistry.

AB  - In this paper, the authors divide Slovenia's countryside on the basis of selected indicators combined in eight different content complexes, which they call "partial syntheses": Natural Limitation Factors, Land and Agricultural Systems, Property Conditions, Population Characteristics, Characteristics of Economic Efficiency, Personal Infrastructure, Frontier Status, and Agricultural Burdening of the Environment. The partial syntheses are the basis of an integral synthesis with five distinct levels of countryside development.
   In the second part of the paper, the importance of the division of the countryside is presented from the viewpoint of providing diverse forms of assistance to ensure its coordinated development, as well as from the viewpoint of monitoring indicators of deviations from the desired impacts of regional development to which the term "regional disparities" refers.

AB  - Ecosystem changes caused by anthropogenic activities have modified the environment in ways that at times promote the emergence of vector-borne diseases. Here, we study the effects of combined sewage overflows (CSOs) from urban streams in Atlanta, GA, on oviposition site selection by Culex quinquefasciatus under seminatural field conditions. Counting egg rafts was a reliable indicator of oviposition preferences, and CSO water quality, especially when enriched, was a more attractive oviposition substrate than nonenriched water. Therefore, environmentally sound management of municipal waste water systems has the potential to diminish the risk of Culex-borne diseases in urban areas.

AB  - Since 1982, Stephen J. Gould and Elisabeth Vrba's concept of exaptation has been adopted, to varying degrees, by a number of biological and social science disciplines. However, it remains a missing term in the study of archaeologically recovered insect remains and entomologically related artefacts. Exaptation refers to the process by which a characteristic acquires a function for which it was not originally adapted. The application of Gould and Vrba's concept to the field of archaeoentomology could enhance our perception of past social, environmental, and climatic conditions as well as interactions. Herein, biological and technological examples of the enduring relationship between synanthropic insects and humans are explored using the concept of exaptation.

AB  - Prey capture is a fundamental process for the success of copepods in food-diluted environments. This process is influenced by several factors, including swimming and predatory habits. This work is aimed at characterising the kinematic and fractal properties of the swimming trajectories and reconstructing the predatory horizon of the small calanoid copepod Clausocalanus furcatus. Results indicate that the motion of C. furcatus resembles a random process, mainly evolving in one direction, whereas its predatory horizon is confined to a small region frontal to the anterior end of the copepod. These outcomes are discussed in terms of specific adaptation taking into account the natural conditions experienced by C. furcatus in its environment.

AB  - Aim. To highlight the peculiarities of transformational changes in land use in agrarian production in terms of soil fertility and farming efficiency in Ukraine. To carry out a comparative analysis of the efficiency of use of land resources in different European countries. To substantiate approaches to farming biologization in conditions of intensification of agrarian production and climate change. Methods. Observation, comparison, analysis and synthesis, system analysis and forecast. Results. The results of long-term fundamental and applied researches on the effect of intensification of agriculture on the productivity level of agrarian production have been analyzed. A benchmarking analysis of the efficiency of use of land resources in Ukraine and European countries has been carried out. It has been established that as a result of economic activity the basic principle of interaction between the agriculture and livestock sector was violated, which does not allow to combine effectively and use the intensification factors, the principle of fruit variability is not applied when introducing short crop rotations of the market crops. Conclusions. The effectiveness of agrarian production in conditions of transformational changes depends on the biological farming, which should be targeted at the rational use of land resources, prevention of degradation, preservation and enhancement of soil fertility and sustainable land use in time, use of life factors of agricultural plants taking into account their biological requirements.

AB  - Soil pollution delineation is a difficult task because there may be multiple pollution sources and complex transport schemes. In this study, four heavy-metal concentrations, namely Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn, were collected at 1082 sampling sites in central Taiwan. Conditioned Latin Hypercube Sampling (cLHS) is used to determine the most cost-effective sampling strategies for long-term monitoring of multiple heavy metals. Then, the study estimates the probability of multiple hazardous heavy metals using multiple-variable indicator kriging (MVIK) based on sufficient cLHS samples.
   The results suggest that heavy-metal sampling patterns, including the size and configuration, affect the spatial distribution of probable hazards, especially when the sample size is small. Unlikely random sampling, the cLHS method replicates the variability and distribution of variables. In this study, an area is defined as a hazard zone if the amount of any heavy metal exceeds the corresponding regulatory threshold. The heavy-metal delineations (e.g., where the MVIK hazard probability exceeds 0.85) cover over 20% of the study area and correlate highly with the locations of industrial plants and irrigation systems in the area. Hence, MVIK coupled with cLHS provides a way to assess the presence of multiple hazards efficiently and effectively in future monitoring and environmental management projects. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Benthic communities are highly relevant in the study of aquatic ecosystems, both for their role in the functioning of the ecosystem and also as markers or indicators of paleo-conditions. Their distribution, as in other communities, is conditioned by abiotic and biotic factors and to their interactions, which determine the structure of the community that is established. The aim of this study was to determine the taxonomic composition, abundance and spatial distribution of the benthic community, by collecting at 20 sampling sites in Caco Lake (State of Maranhao, Brazil). Seasonal variation in these community parameters was analysed and related to the seasonal displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The results indicated that changes occur in the taxa richness, diversity and density of the benthic species of this lake that are mainly related to seasonality. All those parameters were higher in the dry than in the rainy period. The family Chironomidae (Diptera, Insecta) was the most important component of the community, representing approximately 50% of the total benthic fauna of the lake. The identification of the Chironomidae currently occurring in Lake Caco is relevant, even at the genus level, considering the fact that this group produces fossilizing remains and could perhaps be good paleolimnological and paleoclimatic tracers that could be used to make inferences on past lake and climate conditions.

AB  - With the deepening of ocean development and utilization, marine ecology and marine environment have also been greatly influenced by human activities. Because the traditional comprehensive assessment method or theory of marine ecological environment is difficult to reveal and reflect the complex relationship between the influencing factors of marine ecological conditions, this paper adopts a more objective and practical comprehensive assessment method of marine ecological environment based on neural network algorithm. This paper first studies the method of marine ecological environment comprehensive assessment based on neural network algorithm, then analyzes the comparison between neural network model and other methods, and finally verifies the application effect of the model based on neural network algorithm in marine ecological environment comprehensive assessment.

This study was a two year hydrochemical and biological survey in five areas of the Lagoon of Venice, each with different environmental conditions due to pollution from urban, industrial, thermal and agricultural wastes. Phytoplankton associations did not show any promising species. In the different lagoonal areas, this community was differentiated into its major groups. In contrast, the copepod Acartia tonsa Dana could be considered as a target species in highly eutrophic areas. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Retail saturation has become a prevalent theme of discussions within the retailing and shopping center development sectors. The concept also has recently begun to attract the attention of the academic community. This paper begins by considering the definition of retail saturation and some of the problematic issues in determining if the condition exists. Causes of the rapid growth in retail supply are discussed, including the availability of capital, the competitiveness of key players, and the dynamic nature of the retailing and shopping center development sectors. Indicators of saturation are reviewed and a number of escape mechanisms are noted. The paper concludes by considering avenues for further research, the impact of Internet retailing, public policy issues related to saturation, and the appropriateness of the saturation concept for describing the retail environment.

AB  - The distribution of epiphytic lichens on Quercus pubescens in Tuscany, central Italy, was studied by means of multivariate techniques along an altitudinal gradient from 0 to 900 m. Great differences in community structure were found and the altitude of 500 m was identified as an ecotone. Epiphytic lichen vegetation on trees below the ecotone varied significantly in relation to bark pH. Climatic parameters (temperature and rainfall) were probably related to altitude. Dust was probably responsible for the rise in bark pH. The distribution of lichen species in the sampling belts fitted the core-satellite hypothesis. The use of core and satellite species as biomonitors of air pollution and bioindicators of environmental conditions is discussed.

AB  - A continuous solid-solution series between the end-members eskolaite (98 wt.% Cr2O3) and karelianite (93 wt.% V2O3) has been revealed in Cr-V-bearing rocks of the Slyudyanka metamorphic complex. Chromium and vanadium oxides crystallized as karelianite-eskolaite minerals during regional high-temperature prograde (granulite facies) metamorphism and participated in the formation of other Cr-V and Cr-V-bearing phases. Ferrian karelianite (up to 12 wt.% Fe2O3) and three-component solid solutions Esk(12-50)Kar(45-60)Hem(6-30) occur in metamorphic rocks that have particular protolith compositions (Fe-Kar) and in later metasomatic rocks ((Cr, V, Fe)(2)O-3). Natural eskolaite and karelianite are discussed in terms of paragenesis, and their crystallization conditions are compared with the conditions of their laboratory synthesis.

AB  - Assessment of the effects of the control of grazing system in grazed arid steppic rangelands in Algeria. Facing the degradation that the steppe in Algeria suffered, the grazing system using deferred grazing, introduced recently, is an effective means to control and manage the grazed ecosystems of steppic rangelands. Three sites have been studied to assess in each of them, the effects of the managed grazing on ecosystem in comparison to the free grazed ones. The composition and plant species diversity, surface soil conditions and forage quality in controlled areas, showed improvement compared with the freely grazed land. In the present work and usually regarding similar assessment tasks, conditions and sampling design are dictated by a request made much later after the grazing management set-up. The need of such a management in the arid rangelands and the sampling method are discussed.

AB  - A dichotomy in the natural stable carbon isotope abundance measured in tissues of obligate freshwater and marine fishes from the Alaskan Arctic coastal plain suggested that the methodology can be used to differentiate recent freshwater from marine feeding in migratory fishes. Natural stable carbon isotope ratio of migratory fishes reflected differences of feeding habitat in relation to known life-history patterns. Use of the stable isotope methodology as a tool for proxy analysis of fish behavior in present and future Arctic environmental monitoring studies is suggested from analysis of age-specific isotopic ratio differences in broad whitefish (Coregonus nasus) and Arctic cisco (Coregonus autumnalis).

AB  - Various studies have shown that minorities bear a disproportionate exposure to environmental pollution. To understand the causes of this environmental inequality, it is important to analyse which structural conditions foster environmental inequality. This study uses an original dataset by combining the German 2011 census with georeferenced pollution data to analyse the variation in environmental inequality between German cities. While structural characteristics derived from standard theories of environmental inequality do a rather poor job of explaining regional differences, an overlooked indicator correlates strongly with environmental inequality: the geographic centrality of polluting facilities within the urban space. Including this structural measure into the city-fixed effects multilevel analysis accounts for more than 25% of the variation between cities. This highlights the importance of taking geographic conditions into account when analysing environmental inequality.

AB  - A forward-looking approach to forest restoration is advocated with the emphasis on restoring ecosystem health. This approach, called functional restoration, uses indicators of ecosystem health such as mortality, regeneration, reproduction, and productivity, as well as surrogates such as structural diversity, age class distribution, and species diversity, to characterize ecosystem health. Although restoring ecosystem health is the primary emphasis, manipulating species composition and forest structure are the means for accomplishing functional restoration. Managers have experience in measuring most indicators of ecosystem health and, for the most part, cost effective methods for measuring them exist. Instead of using the composition and structure from the historic record as the benchmark, ecosystem health as measured from the time of treatment-i.e., the initial conditions, and changes in these conditions with time-becomes the measure of success. By applying this approach, restoration becomes an investment in the future.

AB  - Spatial assessment of environmental phenomena at regional/global scale involves the analysis and fusion of multiple, complex, multidisciplinary, and large-scale information. Since very often reliable models of such phenomena are lacking, the "syndrome approach" has been adapted to this purpose. In this context, there is a strong need for frameworks capable of handling data from heterogeneous sources in order to fuse them into synthetic indicators by modelling the uncertain and incomplete knowledge of the phenomenon.
   The approach here proposed models a syndrome by soft revision of bipolar information having heterogeneous role: a set of contextual conditions constraining the flourishing of the syndrome (negative information), identified on the basis of the expert's knowledge, and a typical pattern of notable symptoms (positive information) that are indeed proxies of observations of the syndrome occurrence. Specifically, three soft revision strategies are defined in the paper to combine negative and positive information whose overall aim is to define indicators of occurrence of an environmental syndrome with distinct objectives. The main concern of the first two revisions is to reduce the incoherence of bipolar information by taking into account the information reliability: the first strategy models a cautious decision attitude by eliminating incoherence and by modelling priorities of either negative or positive information and their partial trust, while the second strategy models a cautious and precautionary decision attitude giving credit to observations by taking into account False Negatives and False Positives. Finally, the third strategy models decision attitudes characterized by distinct level of risk. The proposed methodology is exemplified by a real case study whose objective is to define an indicator of the Rural Exodus syndrome for the Mediterranean region. In this case the method fuses biophysical related variables derived from Earth Observation (EC) data with geophysical and socioeconomic conditions based on the proposed strategies.

AB  - A key challenge of land-use modelling for supporting sustainable land management is to understand how environmental feedback that emerges from land-use actions can reshape land-use decisions in the long term. To investigate this issue, we apply the Human-Environment System framework formulated by Scholz (2011) as a conceptual guide to read typical feedback loops in land-use systems. We use an agent-based land-use change model (LUDAS) developed by Le et al. (2008, 2010) to test the sensitivity of long-term land-use dynamics to the inclusion of secondary feedback loop learning with respect to different system performance indicators at different levels of aggregation. Simulation experiments were based on a case study that was carried out in the Hong Ha watershed (Vietnam). We specified two model versions that represent two mechanisms of human adaptation in land-use decisions to environmental changes that emerged from land-use actions. The first mechanism includes only primary feedback loop learning, i.e. households adapt to the annual change in socio-ecological conditions and direct environmental response to land-use activities. The second mechanism includes the first one and secondary feedback loop learning, in which households can change their behavioural model in response to changes in socio-ecological conditions at the landscape-community level in the longer term. Spatial-temporal patterns of land-use and interrelated community income changes driven from the two feedback mechanisms are compared in order to evaluate the added value of the inclusion of secondary feedback loop learning. The results demonstrate that the effect of the added secondary feedback loop learning on land-use dynamics depends on domain type, time scale, and aggregation level of the impact indicators.

AB  - Declining water quality associated with changes in land use over the past century is considered a significant environmental threat to the health of coral platforms of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, in particular for those situated in nearshore areas of the wet tropics. Of these reefs, perhaps the most well known is Low Isles Reef, which has been studied since 1928. Decline in scleractinian coral cover and increased abundances of soft-bodied corals and macroalgae since the 1950's have led researchers to speculate that the reef is being affected by increased nutrient and sediment fluxes from nearby rivers. The Foraminifera in Assessment and Monitoring (FORAM) Index (Hallock and others, 2003) is a numerical indicator of the suitability of water quality to support reef growth based on foraminiferal assemblages. To assess whether nutrification is an issue near Low Isles Reef, FORAM Index (FI) values were calculated from a suite of 50 samples collected from the reef top. Results were compared to FI values from Heron Reef, a mid-shelf platform in the southern Great Barrier Reef Province known for its lush scleractinian coral population. FI values from both reefs indicate that, overall, conditions favor coral growth. A Student's t test indicates the FI values between the two reefs are similar. Principal components analysis shows that the FI values are not being constrained by water depth or depositional environment. Lower FI values, which indicate conditions unsuitable to marginal for coral growth, are restricted to particular locations on Low Isles Reef and can be explained in the context of local processes associated with the long-term geomorphological evolution of the reef. Results (1) do not support the notion that agricultural activities in nearby coastal catchments have adversely affected coral populations on Low Isles Reef and (2) demonstrate the applicability of the FI for regions outside of the western Atlantic and Caribbean, for which the index was originally created.

AB  - The Oregon Coast Range, rich in natural resources, is under increasing pressure from rapid development. The purpose of this study was to examine diatom species patterns in relation to environmental variables in streams of this region. Diatoms, water quality, physical habitat and watershed characteristics were assessed for 33 randomly selected stream sites. Watershed size, elevation, geology, vegetation and stream morphology varied substantially among sites. Streams were characterized by dilute water chemistry and a low percent of fine substrate. A total of 80 diatom taxa were identified. Taxa richness was low throughout the region (median 15, range 10-26). Assemblages were dominated by two adnate species, Achnanthidium minutissimum and Achnanthes pyrenaicum. Diatoms sensitive to organic pollution dominated the assemblages at all sites (median 85%). Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and correlational analysis showed quantitative relationships between diatom assemblages and environmental variables. NMDS axes were significantly correlated with watershed area, watershed geology, conductivity, total nitrogen, total solids and stream width. Diatom-based site classification (Two-way Indicators Species Analysis, (TWINSPAN)) yielded 4 discrete groups that displayed weak correlations with environmental variables. When stream sites were classified by dominant watershed geology, overall diatom assemblages between groups were significantly different (Analysis of Similarity (ANOSIM) global R = 0.19, p < 0.05). Our results suggest that streams in the coastal region are in relatively good condition. High natural variability in stream conditions in the Oregon Coast Range ecoregion may obscure quantitative relationships between environmental variables and diatom assemblages. A bioassessment protocol that classifies sites by major landscape variables and selects streams along the major human disturbance gradient might allow for detection of early signs of human disturbance in environmentally heterogeneous regions, such as the Pacific Northwest.

AB  - Holocene sediments from Lake Barrine on the Atherton Tableland in tropical north-east Queensland, Australia (17degrees-15'S, 145degrees38'E, 721 m asl) reveal 10 assemblage shifts in subfossil aquatic immature Chironomidae remains over the past 9000 years. Using the program CANOCO 3.12 and ordination analyses we examined relationships between the physico-chemistry of multiple local and regional water bodies and their chironomid fauna to assess the relative importance of various environmental and climatic parameters on the distribution of Australian chironomids. To derive palaeoclimates we used an extant assemblage to test reconstructions, over 50 calibrated radiocarbon dates from a 7.5-m sediment record, and the correlative distribution modelling programs DOMAIN and BIOCLIM to construct and overlap climate envelopes of species. In comparison with contemporary climate, reconstructed conditions were warmer annually by similar to 2.5degreesC from 4650 calendar years before present (cal yr BP) to more recent times. Annual temperatures were slightly cooler between 5130 to 4650 cal yr BP and may have been cooler in the warmest quarter by similar to6.6degreesC between 6890 and 6090 cal yr BP. Precipitation estimates, although subject to greater errors, were reconstructed in the wettest quarter to be drier by around 500 mm at 5130-4650 and 6890-6090 cal yr BP. The inferred sensitivity of Chironomidae to climatic and environmental conditions at Lake Barrine suggests that Australian midges are reliable and informative biological indicators. Faunal changes were correlated with fluctuations in water levels, sediment influx, organic material, oxygen availability and nutrient status mediated by changes in the local climate and a shift from dry sclerophyll vegetation to rainforest within the catchment.

AB  - As a result of the widespread use of camera-traps, the analysis of the daily activity of animals based on field data has become a common practice, which is addressed in ecological studies. The more frequent consideration of this issue in ecological research, however, has not led to any advancement in the techniques of analysis of these activity patterns. In this work, we have two main aims: ecological and methodological. Firstly, using camera-traps in the winter period, we examine the differences in the daily activity of wild small mammal populations, which are affected or unaffected by urbanization; we treated changes in daily activity as indicators of species adaptation to urban conditions. Secondly, we test four different approaches to data analysis regarding the determination and comparison of activity patterns, which are not based on the traditional methods that have been used to date, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), neural networks, decision trees and cluster analysis. We found that the urbanized environment modifies the daily activity patterns of the mammals studied. Animals from the urban population have a longer active period than their rural counterparts and can forage under more favourable thermal conditions, so that the energetic cost of foraging is lower. PSO and neural networks allow for a more detailed analysis of patterns of daily activity than traditional methods, and their results correspond well with each other. Daily activity analysis shows great potential in the application of new statistical approaches that could supplement and enrich the traditionally used methods (e.g. the kernel density estimation). Our approach may help researchers to gain a broader perspective during their analysis of daily activity patterns and lead to a better description of the ecology of the species or even to more balanced wildlife management decisions.

AB  - We adapted the approach used for the integral assessment of the status of ecosystems in order to assess population status. Classic theoretical concepts of fish population dynamics are the basis of this approach. The convolution of information about changes in several structural and functional characteristics into one integral index was performed using the analytical function of desirability. The index varied 0 to 1 and quantitatively characterizes the state of the population. This approach was tested on the example of the European grayling Thymallus thymallus (Linnaeus, 1758), inhabiting the Vym River (basin of the Northern Dvina River, North of the European part of Russia). The materials were collected during the environmental monitoring carried out by the Institute of Biology of Komi Science Centre of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IB FRC Komi SC UB RAS) in 2002, 2005-2019. The population parameters used in the calculations (relative abundance; average and maximum age of fish; the proportion of matured individuals in the 4+ age group; average specific growth rate of fish at the age of 6+; body weight of fish in the age group 6+) were characterized on the basis of the control net catches. Compared with the period 2005-2006, the value of the integral index in 20152018 decreased by almost two times. This indicates deterioration in the condition of the grayling group in the study area. There were no serious disturbances in the fish habitat in this area. The main hydrochemical and hydrobiological indicators have not changed significantly. The main reason for the observed changes is likely the significant increase in the impact of recreational anglers. The proposed integral index may be useful both for assessing the state of fish populations and for developing measures for the rational management of fish stocks.

AB  - At waterlogged archaeological sites paleolimnological approaches can provide important supporting information about conditions and processes of past human life and human impact on environments around former settlements. In this study, subfossil Cladocera and Chironomidae assemblages were analysed from Neolithic lakeside sediments uncovered at Zurich-Parkhaus Opera (OP), Switzerland. Our main objectives were to assess how periodic settlement phases altered lakeshore environments and aquatic invertebrate communities during the Neolithic. Aquatic invertebrates occurred in considerable numbers throughout the investigated sediment sections, supporting that Neolithic settlements at site OP were established above the lake surface and sedimentation occurred mostly under water. Two separate aquatic invertebrate communities were distinguished: an impacted community within cultural layers and a pre- and post-impacted community in sediments above, below and in between cultural layers. Aquatic invertebrates indicated that human impact likely resulted in surplus organic material load and nutrient input into the water during the cultural periods. This substantially increased biological oxygen demand of the sediments and overall nutrient concentrations of the near-shore water and thereby led to hypoxic conditions. Chironomids showed generally higher amplitude assemblage changes than cladocerans. This could be explained by the very local influence of humans and higher susceptibility of the less mobile chironomids to local hypoxia in and above the sediment. After settlements were abandoned invertebrate assemblages rapidly recovered to pre-impacted states, suggesting their considerable resilience to local human impact. Our results confirm that cladoceran and chironomid remains can trace localised environmental changes associated with human presence and provide important information for the interpretation of prehistoric human activities.

AB  - Seawater pH is among the environmental factors controlling the performance of marine organisms, especially in calcifying marine invertebrates. However, changes in non-calcifying organisms (including polychaetes) may also occur due to pH decrease. Polychaetes are often the most abundant group of organisms in estuarine systems, representing an important ecological and economic resource. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the impacts of seawater acidification in the polychaete Hediste diversicolor, a species commonly used as bioindicator. For this, organisms were exposed to different pH levels (7.9, 7.6 and 7.3) during 28 days and several biochemical markers were measured. The results obtained demonstrated that pH decrease negatively affected osmotic regulation and polychaetes metabolism, with individuals under low pH (7.6 and 7.3) presenting higher carbonic anhydrase activity, lower energy reserves (protein and glycogen content) and higher metabolic rate (measured as Electron transport system activity). The increase on CA activity was associated to organisms osmoregulation capacity while the increase on ETS and decrease on energy reserves was associated to the polychaetes capacity to develop defense mechanisms (e.g. antioxidant defenses). In fact, despite having observed higher lipid peroxidation at pH 7.6, in polychaetes at the lowest tested pH (7.3) LPO levels were similar to values recorded in individuals under control pH (7.9). Such findings may result from higher antioxidant enzyme activity at the lowest tested pH, which prevented organisms from higher oxidative stress levels. Overall, our study demonstrated how polychaetes may respond to near-future ocean acidification conditions, exhibiting the capacity to develop biochemical strategies which will prevent organisms from lethal injuries. Such defense strategies will contribute for polychaetes populations maintenance and survival under predicted seawater acidification scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fossil data show that the recovery of life after the end-Permian mass extinction occurred in the Anisian (early Middle Triassic). The process by which oceanic environments recovered from anoxia after the end-Permian event is uncertain. To determine the timing of known recovery stages, the nature of oceanic redox conditions and the health of cyanobacterial plankton populations, this study analyses conodonts and organic molecules from siliceous claystones and cherts from accretionary complexes in Japan that span the upper Lower Triassic to the lowermost Middle Triassic. Conodonts indicate that the study section ranges from upper Olenekian to Anisian, and includes the Olenekian/Anisian boundary. An increase in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (probably derived from algae dominated organic matter) and a decrease in methylhopane index (2 alpha-methylhopane/hopane, a measure of cyanobacterial activity) are present in end-Olenekian black chert. Pristane/phytane ratios (a measure of redox conditions) in all stratigraphic units are lower than 1, indicating the prevalence of deep-sea anoxia during the late Olenekian to Anisian. High concentrations of dibenzothiophene (an index of anoxic depositional environments), high sulphur/carbon ratios, and high organic carbon contents are present in two upper Olenekian intervals and at the end of the upper Olenekian, suggesting development of anoxic deep water. One of the anoxic events in the end of the upper Olenekian coincided with decreased radiolarian diversity. This implies that anoxic deep water in the Panthalassic Ocean reached intermediate water depths at the end of the Early Triassic, killing marine organisms including radiolaria. This event may be related to the delay in the recovery of life and environments after the end-Permian mass extinction. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Weeds are an emerging constraint on crop production, as a result of population pressure and more intensive use of cultivated land. A diagnostic study was carried out from June through August 2002 in the five agro-ecological zones of Benin (i) to identify the relative importance of weeds among major production constraints, (2) to better understand farmers' perceptions of weed problems, and (3) to take cognizance of their reactions and the different actors involved in weed management technology development. The study also aimed at suggesting the development of weed management strategies that work and are acceptable under small-scale farmers' conditions. Data were collected through semi-structured and unstructured group and/or individual interviews, and through participant observation, transect studies and weed identification during field visits. The results show considerable diversity in biophysical constraints and socio-economic conditions. Population density has led to high pressure on arable land, resulting in land degradation and weed problems. in all situations, pernicious (Imperata cylindrica, Cyperus spp., Commelina spp.) and parasitic (Striga spp.) weeds are difficult to eradicate, causing substantial food crop yield losses and threatening the livelihood of people. Land and labour shortage, low commodity prices and lack of credit were the main constraints hindering weed management. Causes, effects and consequences were analysed, taking into account the socio-economic context. The study's findings with respect to weed management measures, and their adaptation and constraints in using them, suggest that effective and acceptable weed management strategies should be developed, taking into account both biological and social science perspectives with a focus on adding value to indigenous knowledge. Promising strategies for discovery learning about weed management were identified, in order to foster sustainable crop production in Benin.

AB  - In natural and man-made environments microorganisms encounter a number of positive (growth) and negative (toxic and predatory) influences which affect their survival. Understanding microbial survival and potential for regrowth is important for risk assessment in a variety of water types and settings. However, the behaviour of microorganisms in fluvial systems cannot be completely simulated in the laboratory. We have previously studied the survival of several microorganisms in river water in the laboratory and in situ. Frequently our results were variable when sampling sites were separated temporally and spatially. In order to further understand why such differences may occur, we examined the effect of transient nutrient plugs on microbial survival and regrowth in parallel in two model systems with different characteristics: a flow-through hollow fibre diffusion (HFD) system and static diffusion chambers (DC). We focused on the behaviour of Escherichia coli because of its widespread use as an indicator. Results showed a different response of E. coli to transient presence of nutrients in the two systems; both systems responded to nutrient spikes but the HFD system responded more rapidly. For Ih and 2h nutrient spikes, the peak populations in the HFD system were seen 5h (62% net increase) and 8h (650% net increase) after nutrient addition, respectively. In the DC the corresponding figures were 7h (18.5% net increase) and 12h (300% net increase) hours. However, decline in microbial numbers was more rapid in the HFD than the DC system. When this was tested further with repeated short nutrient plugs (10min), the net growth in the CD system was higher than in the HFD. The main question that arises from these studies is under what conditions, if any, does the rapid response HFD model become more relevant for field conditions? (C) 1997 IAWQ.

AB  - A maceral-based method of interpretation of ancient peat-forming ecosystems (mires) is proposed, based on criteria used in classification of modern peatlands (groundwater influence, nutrient and ionic supply, pH and vegetation type).  This method relies heavily upon an index of groundwater influence (GWI), supported by a vegetation index (VI).  The degree of biochemical gelification of plant tissues and the abundance of mineral matter were used as variables in the calculation of GWI; caution is advised in the use of inertinite as an indicator of paleomire type.  VI contrasts lignin-derived forest products against macerals of herbaceous and aquatic affinity; paleobotanical verification is recommended for fuller reconstruction of floral community.  The No. 3 seam of the rapidly subsiding Westphalian B Cumberland Basin, Nova Scotia, was chosen as a case study.  Profiles were studied from each of the piedmont, inner mire and riverine zones of the seam.  The inner mire zone is marked by overall upward decreasing trends of gelocolinite, ash and sulphur contents and an upward increasing trend of telinite and telocollinite which reflect temporal change to more acidic and less groundwater influenced conditions.  The piedmont zone profile is petrographically similar to the base of the inner mire profile.  The inner mire evolved through terrestrialization from swamp through swamp forest to fen and questionably, to bog/bog forest, recording evolution from rheotrophic to mesotrophic or ombrotrophic conditions.  The piedmont margin, subject to periodic, fan-derived sheetflood, developed through a cogenic mechanism of paludification, whereas the evolution of the mire at the riverine margin experienced allogenic influences (e.g. differential compaction).  Although the mire may have ultimately achieved an ombrotrophic status, the seam developed primarily as a rheotrophic (and mesotrophic) ecosystem.

AB  - The effect of the population density on humoral adaptive immunity in bank (Clethrionomys glareolus) and gray-sided (C. rufocanus) voles has been studied. We used 20-, 40-, and 60-day-old voles born in a vivarium from females captured in the field (May-August). The rearing of voles in the brood groups after the end of lactation modeled a high population density without the possibility of dispersal. The low density was modeled by isolated rearing of the animals after weaning. The number of spleen antibody-forming cells, formed in response to the administration of sheep erythrocytes, was considered an indicator of humoral immunity. We studied animals at the age of 20, 40, and 60 days. Regardless of the population density, the humoral immunity was higher in the bank vole. There were no sex differences in either species. The effect of the density of the social environment on the immunity depended on the species and birth dates of individuals. Without taking into account the birth dates, this indicator was higher for red voles kept in brood groups. The sensitivity of the immune system to social stimuli depended on the birth date of individuals. Regardless of the rearing conditions, voles born in May had a similar level of immunity in all age groups. These differences appeared at the age of 60 days in individuals born in June and at the age of 40 days in individuals born in July and August. The immunity of the gray-sided vole depended on the population density only indirectly, through thermoregulation conditions. In isolated two-month-old individuals of this species born in August, low ambient temperatures caused immunosuppression. The formation of the immune system of both vole species competed with growth processes without influencing maturation.

AB  - The paper presents a method for environmental vulnerability assessment with a case study of the Mid-Atlantic region. The method is based on the concept of "self-/peer-appraisal" of a watershed in term of vulnerability. The self-/peer-appraisal process is facilitated by two separate linear optimization programs. The analysis provided insights on the environmental conditions, in general, and the relative vulnerability pattern, in particular, of the Mid-Atlantic region. The suggested method offers a simple but effective and objective way to perform a regional environmental vulnerability assessment. Consequently the method can be used in various steps in environmental assessment and planning. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Functional Feeding Groups (FFGs) of ciliates responded the fluctuations of food resources, since these vary according to seasonality and types of environments, reinforcing that the FFGs can be a great indicator of the responses to environmental fluctuations, helping to understand the structure communities in freshwater environments.
   Functional diversity approaches have been an efficient tool in gaining a better understanding of how environmental conditions selected species in a given environment and how they share resources, linking ecological processes to biodiversity patterns. Although most of the protist ciliates are not highly specialized, functional feeding groups with species which ingest similar food can be identified. Thus, this study aimed to compare the abundance of different Functional Feeding Groups (FFG) of ciliates in environments with different hydrodynamic conditions (lotic and lentic) in different hydrological periods (high and low water) in a neotropical flood plain. The samples for analysis of the community of ciliates were taken in March and September of 2010 and 2011, at the subsurface of 12 different hydrodynamic environments. The results of an RDA showed a spatial and temporal segregation of the sampling units, based on the abundance and occurrence of the FFG. In addition, a clear influence of food resources on the structuring of functional ciliate guilds was evidenced. Thus, there were both temporal (hydrological periods) and spatial (different hydrodynamic environments) differences in the distribution of the FFG, with a clear separation of the FFGs between the years studied. In summary, the results of the categorization of species of ciliates in FFG responded satisfactorily suggesting fluctuations in different food resources, which reinforces the idea that the grouping of species by functional characteristics can be a good indicator of the responses of organisms to environmental fluctuations.

AB  - The privatization of collectively used rangelands results in fragmentation of land use in pastoral areas. This affects pastoralists' grazing strategies and results in new institutional arrangements for addressing changing social-ecological systems. Two main systems of grazing management have emerged in the pastoral regions of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau that offer new perspectives on addressing rangeland fragmentation. One allows the renting of parcels of allocated grazing land to or from others (RTS) and is based on having fenced contracted parcels for each household. The other is a community-based grazing quota system (GQS) in which a grazing use quota is allocated to each household, while the community maintains collective use of the rangeland. We compare two case study villages implementing these two different management systems, operating across household and community scales, and analyze vegetation composition, above-ground biomass, and soil properties as indicators of impacts. Transects reveal that above-ground biomass was higher under the RTS than under the GQS, but species composition shifted to dominance by non-palatable forbs and graminoids. The RTS grasslands had lower carbon and nitrogen density compared to GQS-managed grasslands. These differences are consistent with the herder's perceptions of ecological changes. The general improvement of rangeland conditions under the GQS may be linked to greater herd mobility and the control of livestock numbers through the establishment of community-enforced grazing quotas. Mobility under the RTS is limited to a few parcels, and local regulation of stocking rates is minimal because the system relies on external intervention. The case of GQS suggests that addressing rangeland fragmentation with improved vegetation conditions requires institutions operating at both household and community scales allowing for mobility and regulation of stocking rates.

AB  - Global warming is limiting availability of water resources in arid and semi-arid regions, and so understanding water use efficiency (WUE) is increasingly important for agricultural production in those areas. As China is the largest cotton producing area, the problem of balancing WUE and efficient cotton production is a major issue. In this study, we used a natural population of 517 Upland cotton accessions to conduct a water-controlled trial in south and north of Xinjiang over two years. A total of 18 traits including agronomic traits, fiber yield indices and fiber quality indices, were investigated for broad-sense heritability and coefficient of variation. Appropriate water limitation was found to promote the establishment of favorable agronomic traits in cotton, associated with an increased cotton yield of 8.46% in Xinjiang, at the expense of a certain degree of fiber quality, such as decreased fiber length and an over-higher micronaire value. We detected 33 QTL related to response to water limitation using a drought resistance coefficient (DRC), and 6 QTL were found using a comprehensive indicator of CIDT (comprehensive index of drought tolerance) at the genetic level by integrating resequencing data. Two novel QTL-hotspots including six differentially expressed genes (DECs) were further identified related to the drought response of cotton. These findings not only suggested a new approach to irrigation of cotton fields in Xinjiang, but also provided abundant genetic evidence for genetic breeders to study drought improvement of crops.

AB  - Great attention has been given to freshwater ecosystems worldwide due to the increased exploitation of water resources and the degradation of water quality. This study was aimed to demonstrate the phytoplankton-stressor interactions using multivariate approaches and assess the ecological conditions of 28 sampling stations of 12 lentic ecosystems (five lakes and seven reservoirs) in the western Mediterranean basin using phytoplankton indices in dry and rainy seasons 2018. Freshwater and brackish water systems were separately ordinated by canonical correspondence analysis. The brackish ecosystems were under pressures of Ar (arsenic), N-NO2-(nitrite), Ca (calcium), EC (electrical conductivity), Cl (chloride), B (boron), etc., whereas shallow freshwater ecosystems were associated with total organic carbon. These factors had significant effects on phytoplankton distribution among lentic ecosystems on the basin. Ecological associations of phytoplankton assemblages varied in the western Mediterranean basin during the study.Pseudanabaena catenataandPalatinus apiculatus, considered tolerant taxa, are associated with higher Ar, EC, and V (vanadium) whileDesmodesmus abundansandMicrocystis flos-aquaeare related to total organic carbon. The modified PTI (phytoplankton trophic index) had the highest correlation coefficient value. Scores of the PTI varied from 2.02 in cavdir Reservoir to 2.59 in Lake Kocagol. Results of phytoplankton indices indicated that two (Golhisar and Yazir) lakes and two (Yaprakli and cavdir) reservoirs were classified as Good, and three lakes and five reservoirs were classified as Moderate condition. Other predicted classifications (high, poor, and bad) by phytoplankton metrics were not represented. The modified PTI could be a suitable phytoplankton metric for assessing the ecological status of lentic ecosystems in the Mediterranean system according to its highest correlation coefficient value. Overall, the results of this limno-ecological study demonstrated that responses of phytoplankton taxa to explanatory factors provide crucial ecological information about their ecology and to estimate the ecological status of lentic ecosystems.

AB  - Sedimentary black shale-hosted manganese carbonate and oxide ores were studied by high-resolution in situ detailed optical and cathodoluminescence microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and FTIR spectroscopy to determine microbial contribution in metallogenesis. This study of the Urucum Mn deposit in Brazil is included as a case study for microbially mediated ore-forming processes. The results were compared and interpreted in a comparative way, and the data were elaborated by a complex, structural hierarchical method. The first syngenetic products of microbial enzymatic oxidation were ferrihydrite and lepidocrocite on the Fe side, and vernadite, todorokite, birnessite, and manganite on the Mn side, formed under obligatory oxic (Mn) and suboxic (Fe) conditions and close to neutral pH. Fe- and Mn-oxidizing bacteria played a basic role in metallogenesis based on microtextural features, bioindicator minerals, and embedded variable organic matter. Trace element content is determined by source of elements and microbial activity. The present Urucum (Brazil), Datangpo (China), and urkut (Hungary) deposits are the result of complex diagenetic processes, which include the decomposition and mineralization of cell and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) of Fe and Mn bacteria and cyanobacteria. Heterotrophic cell colonies activated randomly in the microbialite sediment after burial in suboxic neutral/alkaline conditions, forming Mn carbonates and variable cation-bearing oxides side by side with lithification and stabilization of minerals. Deposits of variable geological ages and geographical occurrences show strong similarities and indicate two-step microbial metallogenesis: a primary chemolithoautotrophic, and a diagenetic heterotrophic microbial cycle, influenced strongly by mineralization of cells and EPSs. These processes perform a basic role in controlling major and trace element distribution in sedimentary environments on a global level and place biogeochemical constraints on the element content of natural waters, precipitation of minerals, and water contaminants.

AB  - This study is the first report to evaluate (8 years data) the contamination degree and distribution characteristics of metals in the surface water and sediments of four Korean rivers (Nakdong, Yeongsan, Geum, and Han). Eight years of data were evaluated, and metal concentrations in the river water were found to be below permissible limits but high enough to cause detrimental effects (under chronic exposure) to aquatic organisms. The analysis of metals in the river sediments showed the following trend: Zn > Cu > Cd > Pb > Ni > As > Cr > Hg. The concentrations of metals in sediments (especially in the Geum and Han rivers) were above the permissible limits reported by international agencies. Concentrations of Cu, Ni, and Zn were high enough to pose risks to aquatic communities. In sediments, metals pollutionwas also evaluated using different indices, such as enrichment factor (EF), geoaccumulation index (I-geo), contamination factor (CF), degree of contamination (C-d), modified degree of contamination (mC(d)), and pollution load index (PLI). The CF, EF, and I-geo indices demonstrated that most of the river sediment samples were moderately to heavily contaminated by Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn. The PLI values were above one in the Geum and Han river sediments, which indicated polluted conditions. Similarly, C-d indicated a considerable to very high degree of contamination, while mC(d) indicated a low to moderate degree of contamination in all four river sediments. Finally, it was found that the extent of metals pollution in the Korean rivers reached a critical condition, which could be detrimental to the biota of the rivers, as well as to humans in the long term.

AB  - Aims: We hypothesize that the community response to disturbances can be interpreted as a large-scale dynamic equilibrium between multiple alternate states stemming from different species pools within a regional meta-pool and being limited by species' multi-dimensional niches. We explore this hypothesis by examining the re-assembly of an acidophilous lichen community in response to long-term alkaline dust pollution, assuming understorey as a potential side-factor.
   Location: Around a cement factory in Kunda, Estonia.
   Methods: Lichen communities on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) trunks in 40 stands around a cement factory and in nine distant limestone habitats were assessed.
   Results: The formed bark pH gradient from pH 2.4 to 8.1 was reflected in a continuum of lichen communities on pines from acidophilous to basidophilous communities. Besides suppressing species richness, understorey density more evidently caused the compositional divergence from neutral bark conditions. The effect of hidden interactions among drivers was explained through reactions of individual species - almost all species across the pollution gradient were pH-limited, whereas species adapted to neutral or alkaline substrate were additionally sensitive to understorey conditions. The hump-shaped distribution of pH niche ranges along the observed niche optima, rather than ecological indicator values, showed that the shape of species' multi-dimensional niche-space still needs to be quantified.
   Conclusions: Each alternative community state along the disturbance gradient represents a realization of its specific species pool within the meta-pool. Degradation can be defined if the community state is not supported by a meta-pool. Species infiltration during community re-assembly can be predicted using species source communities as cost-efficient proxies.

AB  - The vegetation structure surrounding nest sites is a crucial component of habitat quality and may have large effects on avian breeding performance. Habitat quality reflects the extent to which the environmental characteristics of an area correspond to the preferred habitat characteristics of the species. The concentration of haemoglobin is considered a simple biochemical indicator of nestling body condition. We present results concerning the effects of variation in habitat characteristics on the concentration of haemoglobin in the blood of 14-day-old nestlings and breeding success of European Pied Flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) in a mature mixed deciduous forest in central Poland. The haemoglobin concentration of nestlings was higher when there were more native oaks and deciduous, native trees on the territory. Breeding success was reduced by the number of alien oak (the Red Oak, Quercus rubra) and other alien deciduous trees, but increased by the number of native oaks in the territory. This study was conducted on only one site so further research is needed to examine the broader applicability of our results. Our data support the idea that haemoglobin concentration may serve as a simple indicator of body condition in nestlings and is useful in field ecophysiology studies of European Pied Flycatchers.

AB  - Depression is strongly associated with the circadian system, disruption of the circadian system leads to increased propensity to disease and to mood disorders including depression. The present study explored in rats the effects of circadian disruption by constant light on behavioral and hormonal indicators of a depressive-like condition and on the biological clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Exposure to constant light for 8 weeks resulted in loss of circadian patterns of spontaneous general activity, melatonin and corticosterone. Moreover these rats exhibited anhedonia in a sucrose consumption test, and increased grooming in the open-field test, which reflects an anxiety-like condition. In the SCN decreased cellular activation was observed by c-Fos immunohistochemistry. In rats exposed to constant darkness, circadian behavioral and hormonal patterns remained conserved, however mild depresive-like indicators were observed in the anhedonia test and mild anxiety-like behaviors were observed in the open field test. Data indicate that chronic conditions of LL or DD are both disruptive for the activity of the SCN leading to depression- and anxiety-like behavior. Present results point out the main role played by the biological clock and the risk of altered photoperiods on affective behavior. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In Italy, National Law (281/1991) prohibits euthanasia of shelter dogs if they are not dangerous or suffering seriously. Adoption rates in rescue shelters are often lower than entrance rates, leading inevitably to overcrowded facilities where animals are likely to spend the rest of their lives in kennels. In this situation, housing conditions (i.e. space provided, environmental, and social stimulation) may have an impact on canine welfare. In this research project, the effects of two different forms of housing (group-and pair housing) on long-term shelter dogs were compared using behavioural and physiological parameters. Observational data and saliva samples were collected from dogs exposed to both experimental settings; behaviour and cortisol concentration levels were used as welfare indicators. Pair housing offered fewer social and environmental stimuli and behavioural analysis showed a significant decrease in locomotor, exploratory, and social behaviour. Cortisol levels show that this parameter varied independently of housing conditions. Although this study found no evidence suggesting that one form of confinement reduced animal welfare more than the other (e.g. in terms of abnormal behaviour, or higher cortisol concentrations), the type of confinement did affect the expression of a variety of behaviours and these variations should not be ignored with respect to housing decisions for long-term shelter dogs.

AB  - River flow alterations, caused by climate variability/change and intense anthropogenic uses (e.g., flow regulation by dams) are considered among the main global challenges of which hydrologists should be dealing with. For the purpose of this study, environmental flow and potential hydrological alterations are made for the extended Drin river basin, with limited historical hydrological information available. To overcome this limitation environmental flow assessment is made using simulated streamflow data from a watershed hydrological model. Descriptive statistics applied to streamflow values indicate that median monthly flows with no anthropogenic uses are consistently greater than those with anthropogenic uses by 0-37.4 m(3)/s in all subbasins. Moreover, an investigation of potential climate variability/change impact on river flow regime is made using streamflow simulations from a global hydrological model. Results indicate that hydrologic alteration is intense between nonregulated and regulated streamflow conditions. More specifically, for all Global Circulation Models and Regional Climate Models combinations, and both regulated and unregulated streamflow conditions, the minimum discharge values had statistically significant decreasing trends, except one combination (RCP 4.5-RCA4/ECEARTH) for unregulated conditions. Finally, results from this preliminary analysis could enhance the necessary conversations among all relevant stakeholders to discuss and decide on sustainable water resources management issues for the development of a Drin Basin Management Plan in the future.

AB  - This work presents an environmental and techno-economic study of an inverter air conditioner simultaneously powered by photovoltaic panels and the grid, without batteries. The unit provides the thermal demand to an office in an administrative building located in Alicante (South East Spain).
   In comparison with other systems which also use renewable energy for air conditioning, this one presents significant advantages. It is comparatively simple, reliable, has low maintenance needs and its renewable energy production is entirely self-consumed, which avoids problematic interaction with the grid.
   The system has been monitored during one year to measure the thermal energy provided to the room, the electrical consumption of the device and the photovoltaic and grid contribution to it.
   Experimental results of some Key Performance Indicators are presented as a result of a one year data collection campaign. The measurements show a solar contribution of 54% to the electricity consumed by the system. As a result, the ratio between the thermal energy and grid electricity consumption during one year is SPFsys = 9.6. Consequently, the primary non renewable energy consumption is drastically reduced to a 26% of the reference system (SPFref = 2.5).
   Furthermore, the techno-economic study concludes that in spite of requiring a higher initial investment in the system, the saving produced by the lower electricity consumption, results in an annualized cost of 84% of the reference system cost.

AB  - Seasonal flooding of riverine waterbodies is important in maintaining habitat diversity of aquatic ecosystems. This study was aimed at the assessment of habitat status of 161 floodplain lakes adjacent to the Biebrza River in NE Poland in relation to flood frequency within the period 1966-2013, based on remote sensing data from the IKONOS satellite. The parameters of floodplain lakes such as morphometry, hydrological connectivity, water transparency and degree of vegetation cover were selected as the most important descriptors of trophic conditions of floodplain lakes. The results were analysed in relation to the daily flood extent and water depth obtained from 1D hydrodynamic model. The layer of digitalized oxbow lakes and mean flood frequency map were overlaid in ArcGIS 10.1.
   The results showed that habitat conditions of oxbow lakes are strongly correlated with inundation frequency and hydrological connectivity with the river channel. The lakes properties were ordinated using Principal Components Analysis (PCA). The ordination showed a strong adverse relationship appeared between the degree of aquatic vegetation cover and water transparency. The inference drawn from our study indicates that both inundation frequency and lateral connectivity of lakes with the Biebrza River channel are the main factors determining the floodplain lakes development. The use of satellite remote sensing appeared as a cost-effective way to obtain generalized information needed for aquatic ecosystems assessments.

AB  - Increasing human population and intensive land use combined with a warming climate and chronically diminished snowpacks are putting more strain on water resources in the western United States. Properly functioning riparian systems slow runoff and store water, thus regulating extreme flows; however, riparian areas across the west are in a degraded condition with a majority of riparian systems not in proper functioning condition, and with widespread catastrophic erosion of water-storing peat and organic soils. Headcuts are the leading edge of catastrophic channel erosion. We used aerial imagery (1.4-3.3-cm pixel) to locate 163 headcuts in riparian areas in the Sweetwater subbasin of central Wyoming. We found 1-m-the generally available standard resolution for land management-and 30-cm pixel imagery to be inadequate for headcut identification. We also used Structure-from-Motion models built from ground-acquired imagery to model 18 headcuts from which we measured soil loss of 425-720 m(3). Normalized by channel length, this represents a loss of 1.1-1.8 m(3) m(-1) channel. Monitoring headcuts, either from ground or aerial imagery, provides an objective indicator of sustainable riparian land management and identifies priority disturbance-mitigation areas. Image-based headcut monitoring must use data on the order of 3.3 cm ground sample distance, or greater resolution, to effectively capture the information needed for accurate assessments of riparian conditions.

AB  - Seed transfer and introduction risks can be reduced by setting up provenance tests and studying the elements of genotypic, phenotypic, physiological, and anatomical structure. Forest tree increment and productivity depend on photosynthesis and the concentrations of nitrogen and carbon in the needles. With the aim of introducing Douglas-fir into Serbia, the Institute of Forestry in Belgrade established several experimental provenance tests to assess the genetic ability of Douglas-fir to adapt to new environmental conditions in Serbia. The provenance tests included fourteen different Douglas-fir provenances originating from Canada. All the trees of the study provenances were of the same age and grown in the same conditions, but on two different soil types: eutric cambisol and vertisol. There was considerable variability of nitrogen and carbon contents in the needles of all tested provenances on both locations. This variability was used as the basis for the study of the intensity and dynamics of the physiological processes of Douglas-fir mineral nutrition as indicators of its capacity to adapt to the sites in Serbia. All Douglas-fir provenances planted on eutric cambisol had higher contents of nitrogen and lower contents of carbon, i.e. narrower C/N ratios than the provenances planted on vertisol. The differences resulted from different conditions for Douglas-fir physiological activity and nutrition in the two types of soil.

AB  - We develop an evolutionary model that predicts that characters selected to signal individual identity will have properties differing from those expected for indicator signals of quality. Traits signaling identity should be highly variable, often display polymodal distributions, not be condition dependent (i.e., be cheap to produce and/or maintain), not be associated with fitness differences, exhibit independent assortment of component characters, and often occur as fixed phenotypes with a high degree of genetic determination. We illustrate the existence of traits with precisely these attributes in the ornamental, conspicuously variable, and sexually dimorphic breeding plumages of ruff sandpipers Philomachus pugnax and red-billed queleas Quelea quelea. Although ruffs lek and queleas are monogamous, both species breed in high-density aggregations with high rates of social interactions (e.g., aggression and territory defense). Under these socioecological conditions, individual recognition based on visual cues may be unusually important. In contrast to these species, we also review plumage characteristics in house finches Carpodacus mexicanus, a nonterritorial, dispersed-breeding species in which plumage ornamentation is thought to signal quality. In keeping with expectations for quality signals, house finch plumage is relatively less variable, unimodally distributed, condition dependent, correlated with fitness measures, has positively correlated component characters, and is a plastic, environmentally determined trait. We briefly discuss signals of identity in other animals.

AB  - The rotifer Ascomorpha ovalis (Bergendal, 1892) was found for the first time in Glubokoe Lake (Moscow Region) in June 2010. Long-term observations of zooplankton dating back to 1897, including our own studies starting in 2004 and carried out on a yearly basis, had never recorded this species before 2010. The density of the population was 25 ind./L in the 0-10 m water layer. In 2011-2012, the species did not disappear but was naturalized in the lake. A. ovalis is an indicator of oligotrophic conditions. The tendency for ongoing oligotrophication of the pelagial of Glubokoe Lake is supported by the penetration and naturalization of Ascomorpha ovalis during recent years and the presence of the oligotrophic rotifer Gastropus hyptopus (Ehrenberg, 1838) detected in the lake earlier.

AB  - Agricultural recycling of biosolids is coming under increasing regulatory and non-regulatory pressure. The UK Government and the European Commission are introducing new microbiological standards for (a) sludge, (b) expanded nitrate vulnerable zones, and (c) more stringent maximum potentially toxic element concentrations in soils. Public perception continues to play an important and unpredictable role in the acceptability of biosolids agricultural recycling. Sludge phytoconditioning is a low-technology process, growing grass on sewage sludge to produce a pleasant/low-odour compost-like material and reducing bacterial indicators to below detectable levels, whilst retaining the beneficial energy-recovery aspects of anaerobic digestion.
   This paper describes the process stream and discusses the benefits for the operator, including treatment to 'enhanced' status and reduction in volume. The process is batch in nature and results in a high-quality soil conditioner.

AB  - Simple Summary The diet of Adelie penguins, Pygoscelis adeliae, in the Ross Sea was studied applying quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) protocols to their feces. Two krill species (Euphausia superba and Euphausia crystallorophias) and notothenioid fish (mainly Pleuragramma antarctica and Pagothenia borchgrevinki) were among the most abundant components of the diet. The composition of the two krill species and notothenioid fish was found to be strongly related to the geographic characteristics of the Ross Sea. The diet of Adelie penguins, Pygoscelis adeliae, is a useful indicator in understanding the ecological conditions of their habitats. The diets of Adelie penguins were studied using metabarcoding and quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses of fecal DNA from seven habitats along the Ross Sea region. Using metabarcoding analysis with dual universal primers (18Sv9 and miniFish), the overall diet composition and detailed information about piscine prey were clearly elucidated. It was found that two krill species (Euphausia superba and Euphausia crystallorophias) and notothenioid fish were the most abundant in the diets of Adelie penguins. Among the notothenioid prey, Pleuragramma antarctica (56.50%) and Pagothenia borchgrevinki (18.21%) were the two most abundant species. qPCR analysis showed a significant geographic difference in the composition of main prey. Penguins inhabiting outbound parts of the Ross Sea (Capes Adare (CA) and Duke of York Island (DY)) mainly preyed on E. superba, without any significant changes in prey composition. By contrast, those inhabiting the inbound parts of the Ross Sea (Edmonson Point (EP) and Inexpressible Island (II)) preyed on E. crystallorophias and notothenioid fish rather than E. superba. Compared with the outbound habitats, prey compositions for penguins inhabiting the inbound regions were significantly different year to year, which was presumably due to the food availability based on the annual environmental and meteorological conditions of the coastal region along with the inbound parts of the Ross Sea.

AB  - Mycotoxins accumulation in grain is one of the most widely analyzed problem nowadays, as soon as these metabolites are of high danger to health of warm-blooded animals and humans. Producing mycotoxins with Fusarium fungi beaing causal agents of Fusarium head blight, depends on range of factors, and among measures for their accumulation decrease, chemical method is one of the most effective ones. The paper presents the results of study on factors affecting mycotoxins accumulation under the field conditions. During the experiment with artificial inoculation of winter wheat heads by F. culmorum fungi, the influence of triazole fungicides on Fusarium head blight and mycotoxins content had been estimated. Higher biological efficiency (83,2-79,2 %) for disease severity decrease was higher with fungicide Osiris, EC. Use of fungicides led to increase in indicators of economic efficiency in comparison with the option with no treatment, including the yield, by 12.3-12.8%. In the variants with head protection, the DON content was 2.0-2.1 times lower than in the control. Under conditions of natural damage to various varieties of grain crops (winter wheat and triticale, spring barley) by Fusarium head blight, its depressive manifestation had been determined. It had been determined that spring barley, regardless of the variety, was more resistant to accumulation of mycotoxins, in particular ZEN. Level of mycotoxins in winter wheat and triticale grain varied depending on variety and storage duration. The data obtained will serve as the basis for substantiating measures to reduce the level of mycotoxins in grain. Acknowledgments. The research was carried out with the financial support of the Belarusian Republican Foundation for Fundamental Research as a part of the scientific research project "Comprehensive assessment of mycotoxins accumulation during foodstuff storage" (treaty N (SIC)-009).

AB  - Highly fertile soils are considered to harbor low diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), since plants might not depend on the mycorrhizal symbiosis to efficiently assimilate soil nutrients. 'Black steppe soils' classified as Chernozems are counted among the soil types with highest natural fertility and productivity. However, information on AMF diversity from highly productive Chernozems used as croplands are extremely rare to non-existent. Our objective was to study the impact of soil tillage and fertilization intensity on AMF communities in a long-term field trial established on a silty-loamy Calcic Chernozem in the Magdeburger Borde (Central Europe). Samples were taken at harvest of maize that grew in a rotation with winter wheat, winter barley, winter oil seed rape and again winter wheat. AMF species were characterized by spore morphology. Astonishingly high spore densities (up to 41 spores g(-1) soil) and species richness (19-33 species) of AMF were found in this highly productive Chernozem cropland, even under high-input conditions, which were, however, higher in reduced tillage than in regularly ploughed plots. AMF diversity decreased with increasing fertilizer input concerning N and P. These findings might re-stimulate the discussion about the significance of AM fungi in highly productive croplands, which was so far thought to be low. Several indicator AMF species were identified for reduced tillage (e.g. Ambispora fennica and Dominikia bernensis) or reduced fertilizer inputs (e.g. Dominikia aurea) or both (e.g. Diversispora celata and Scutellospora calospora), but only a few for tillage (e.g. Funneliformis fragilistratus and Pacispora dominikii). AMF indicators have to be, however, identified for each soil type and climatic condition separately, as they should be completely different from those species for instance in nutrient-poor or in acidic soils, in warmer or colder as well as in more humid or arid climates.

AB  - In the aquatic environment, organisms are exposed to complex mixtures of contaminants which may alter the toxicity profile of each compound, compared to its toxicity alone. Pharmaceutical drugs (e.g. carbamazepine (CBZ) and cetirizine (CTZ)) and metals (e.g. cadmium (Cd)) are among those contaminants that co-occur in the environment. However, most studies concerning their toxicity towards aquatic species are based on single exposure experiments. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate single and combined effects of Cd and CBZ or CTZ (single conditions: Cd, CTZ, CBZ; combined conditions: CTZ + Cd, CBZ + Cd) on biomarkers related to oxidative stress and energy metabolism in the edible clam Ruditapes philippinarum, by exposing the organisms for 28 days to environmentally relevant concentrations of these contaminants. The biomarkers studied were: i) the electron transport system activity, protein and glycogen contents (indicators of organisms' metabolic status and energy reserves); ii) lipid peroxidation and the ratio between reduced and oxidized glutathione (indicators of oxidative stress); iii) superoxide dismutase and catalase activities (enzymes indicators of antioxidant defence) and iv) activity of glutathione S-transferases (family of enzymes indicators of biotransformation capacity). Results obtained showed that the uptake of Cd and CBZ was not affected by the combined presence of the contaminants. However, for CTZ, the uptake was higher in the presence than in the absence of Cd. Concerning toxicity data, in general, the combined exposures (CTZ + Cd, CBZ + Cd) had lower biological effects than the contaminants alone. Nevertheless, our data showed that despite the low concentrations tested, they were enough to exert biological effects that differed between single and combined treatments, evidencing the need to conduct more co-exposure studies to increase the environmental relevance of the gathered data.

AB  - High concentration of heavy metals in the soils represents an important factor of physiological stress that influences the normal functioning of plants through oxidation processes, and negatively affects insect performance and leaf consumption by herbivorous insects. One useful indicator to evaluate environmental stress in plants by heavy metals and herbivory is the fluctuating asymmetry, which describes the random differences in size or shape between the two sides of a bilateral character in organisms and it is a widely used measure of developmental instability in plants. We evaluated under natural conditions, the effects of variation of heavy metals in the soils on herbivore patterns, fluctuating asymmetry and arthropod abundance in Tibouchina heteromalla in rupestrian grasslands along the Espinha double dagger o chain in Brazil. We selected two study areas, the first characterized by the presence of soils with low concentration of heavy metals (quartzite soils). In the second area, the soils are characterized by the presence of high concentration of heavy metals such as iron (ferric soils). We found that leaf thickness was higher in ferric soils than in quartzite soils. Conversely, total leaf area was greater in quartzite soils in comparison to ferric soils. Plants in soils with heavy metals had both lower herbivory levels and arthropod abundance than plants in soils with low concentrations of heavy metals. Fluctuating asymmetry levels were significantly greater in individuals from quartzite soils compared to individuals from ferric soils. Herbivory was positively related with individual fluctuating asymmetry in quartzite soils. Our results suggest that T. heteromalla presents tolerance to soils with heavy metals suggesting an acclimatization to these environmental conditions, and therefore, ferric soils may not represent a factor of environmental stress.

AB  - A photochemical UVC/H2O2 oxidation system was applied for the decolourisation of two real textile wastewaters, textile wastewater A - TWA and textile wastewater B - TWB - collected after biological oxidation from two different textile wastewater treatment plants. The photochemical oxidation assays were performed in a lab-scale photo-reactor, where a borosilicate tube is associated to an internal concentric quartz tube filled with a UVC lamp (6 W). Photochemical reaction rates were determined under different operational conditions: H2O2 dosage (0-40 mM), pH (3, 5 and 9) and temperature (15, 23 and 35 degrees C). For both TWA and TWB, it was observed a positive influence on the UVC/H2O2 efficiency at higher hydrogen peroxide dosages and wastewater temperature. However, the pH conditions differently affected each wastewater. Although the dissolved organic content remained almost similar during the UVC/H2O2 reaction period, the biodegradable organic fraction increased for values higher than 40%. To achieve the colour discharge limits imposed by the Brazilian regulations, it was necessary 180/75 min of UVC irradiation (8.3/3.4 kJ(UVC) L-1) using an H2O2 dose of 25.0 mM, natural pH of 8.1/7.7 and T = 23 degrees C, respectively for the TWA/TWB. The photochemical-treated textile wastewater - PTWB was used as bathwater during bleaching and dyeing of cotton fibres in order to assess its onsite reuse in the textile manufacturing process. Compared with the same bleaching process made with distilled water, all quality indicators monitored showed small differences, which demonstrate the possible reuse of PTWB in this process. Finally, reuse of PTWB mixed with 50% distilled water as bathwater in the dyeing process with Direct Blue 71 resulted in similar samples (Delta E* = 0.76) when compared with standard dyeing process.

AB  - Rapid bioassessment indices based on macroinvertebrates are the most commonly used tools for assessing stream condition. However, once stream degradation has been detected, it is often difficult to identify which environmental stressors are most important because of changes in multiple correlated factors. In this study, we examined eight sites in an urban river watershed using a field-based microcosm experiment and the rapid bioassessment-based biotic index, SIGNAL. The experiment assessed the effects of polluted river sediment by examining the macroinvertebrate taxa that colonized sediments at an unpolluted wetland. Results were compared with an assessment of field-collected macroinvertebrates using SIGNAL, a biotic index that assigns pollution sensitivity scores to macroinvertebrate families, and environmental data, to determine whether sediment pollution or other factors such as habitat deterioration were likely to be influencing riverine macroinvertebrate communities. The microcosm results indicated that common species (Tanytarsus fuscithorax, Procladius paludicola, and Ablabesmyia notabilis) and the overall macroinvertebrate assemblage did not significantly change among sediments from different sites, with the exception of local effects on a few uncommon taxa (Chironomus pseudoppositus, Kiefferulus martini, Cladotanytarsus australomancus, Chaoboridae, Polypedilum "SI,'' and Tanytarsus belairensis). In contrast, SIGNAL showed a gradual trend of deterioration from upstream to downstream, decreasing from a score of 6.5 in upstream areas (unimpacted) to a score of 4.4 in the downstream sites (moderately impacted). This result combined with a significant correlation of SIGNAL scores to habitat data suggested that habitat deterioration rather than polluted sediment was likely to be responsible for the declining stream condition detected with the rapid bioassessment approach. The addition of the microcosms to other monitoring approaches could be useful for determining whether sediment pollution is influencing degraded urban streams. Environ. Toxicol.

AB  - Since Hardin's (1968) paper on the "Tragedy of the Commons," property rights of common-pool resources have been a central concern for natural resource management scholars. Matsutake, a common-pool resource, is an economically important mushroom in several locations around the world. Driven by growing international demand over the last few decades, matsutake management is a relatively new practice both for local communities and government agencies. In Northwest Yunnan, China, one of the most productive areas for matsutake globally, numerous local practices and systems have emerged in the last two to three decades. In this study, we investigate the differences between management systems in eight communities and the factors associated with them. The methods used for field research included key-informant interviews, household surveys, and questionnaires. Three main management patterns were identified through use of statistical clustering based on indicators such as physical environment, resource characteristics, tenure arrangements, regulations and implementation, harvesting behavior, income, and market regulation. It was found that private access-the principal characteristic of which is the exclusive use of resources-results in more income at lower labor cost per household than either of the other open-access management patterns. Even though under the context of ongoing Second Forest Tenure Reform in China-in which collective forest privatization is the key task-application of private-access regimes is limited because of site conditions including physical, institutional, and market environments. Common-access management systems have advantages in terms of managing conflict and balancing equity needs. No matter the type of access right, the key issue for wise matsutake management is institutional. Locally rooted innovative strategies should be encouraged, and institutional capacity building should be carried out to support innovations in matsutake management.

AB  - The objective of this research was to identify the dissolved species or solid phase mineral fraction(s) best correlated with rates of carbon tetrachloride (CT) reductive transformation in systems modeling sulfate-reducing and iron oxide-rich soils and sediments. We used sulfide (S(-II))-treated goethite as our model system, but also studied Fe(II) and S(-II)-treated goethite, Fe(II)-treated goethite, pure FeS, and Fe(Il)-treated FeS in order to isolate and evaluate the influence of different mineral fractions on reaction rates. Initial rates of CT transformation were measured for different pH values and concentrations of added Fe(II), as well as different aging times and conditions. The following dissolved species and iron and sulfur mineral fractions were quantified and compared with CT transformation rates: aqueous Fe2 divided by and S(41), Surface associated Fe(II) (including weakly and strongly bound Fe(II)), FeS(s), and Cr(II) reducible solid phase S. Over the pH range of 6-10, CT transformation rates were correlated with surface associated Fe(II), while at pH 8, rates were correlated with weakly bound Fe(II). Aging of S(-II)-treated goethite led to oxidation of surface sulfur and a change in the concentration of weakly bound Fe(II), but did not change the relationship between initial rates and weakly bound Fe(II). The results of this research suggest that surface associated Fe(II) and weakly bound Fe(II) could serve as indicators of the potential for abiotic CT dechlorination in natural soils under sulfate-reducing conditions.

AB  - Regeneration of forest stands through the preservation of existing advance regeneration has gained considerable interest in various regions of North America. The effectiveness of this approach relies on the capacity of regeneration to respond positively to overstory removal. Responses of advance regeneration to release is dependent on tree characteristics and site conditions interacting with the degree of physiological shock caused by the sudden change in environmental conditions This paper presents a review of the literature describing the relationships between morphological indicators and the advance regeneration response to canopy removal. It focus es primarily on the following species: jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. var. latifolia Engelm.), black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.), interior spruce (Picea glauca x engelmannii), white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss), balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.), and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt). Pre release height growth has been found to be a good indicator of post-release response for many species. Live-crown ratio also appears to be a good indicator of vigour for shade-tolerant species. The ratio of leader length to length of the longest lateral at the last whorl could serve to describe the degree of suppression before harvest for shade-tolerant species. Number of nodal and internodal branches or buds has been found to be related with vigour for many species. Logging damage has been shown to be an important determinant of seedling response to overstory removal. In contrast. height/diameter ratio has limited value for predicting response to release since it varies with site, species and other factors. No clear relationship between age, height at release and response to release could be demonstrated. This paper also suggests the use of combined indicators and critical threshold values for these indicators.

AB  - Stress is a known contributor to several life-threatening medical conditions and a risk factor for triggering acute cardiovascular events, as well as a root cause of several social problems. The burden of stress is increasing globally and, with that, is the interest in developing effective stress-monitoring solutions for preventive and connected health, particularly with the help of wearable sensing technologies. The recent development of miniaturized and flexible biosensors has enabled the development of connected wearable solutions to monitor stress and intervene in time to prevent the progression of stress-induced medical conditions. This paper presents a review of the literature on different physiological and chemical indicators of stress, which are commonly used for quantitative assessment of stress, and the associated sensing technologies.

AB  - This article presents an analysis of the different theoretical models for the relationship between elections and economics, as well as econometric tests applied to GDP and employment trends in Latin American democracies from 1979 to 1998. Considering that a government's possibilities for pushing its policy objectives forward depends on its agenda power, the article analyzes the majority versus minority nature of governments, seeking to define the political conditions that favor a level of macroeconomic evolution in keeping with the objective of maintaining power. On the one hand, the results of empirical tests show a post-electoral deterioration of target indicators, as predicted by theoretical models. On the other hand, greater economic dynamism in election years is observed more frequently in governments with a majority in the legislature, a characteristic of the political system generally associated with greater macroeconomic policy efficiency, but also a condition favoring electoral manipulation of policy.

LA  - English
AB  - The Rural Access Index is a measure of access developed by the World Bank and has been incorporated into the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as indicator 9.1.1. This measures the proportion of the rural population living within 2 km of an all-season road, using GIS layers and relying on three data sources: population, road network location and condition. Open GIS data are used for population and road location, but there are challenges to define the all-season status of roads. Every country measures road condition differently and against different parameters, which makes consistency of the all-season status between countries difficult. This article reports on research to refine the GIS methodology for assessing SDG 9.1.1 to make it more sustainable, repeatable and consistent by using geospatial data and tools, based on trials in four countries-Ghana, Malawi, Myanmar and Nepal-which were selected for their diversity of environment and data.

AB  - Cybernetic Transportation System (CTS) is a relatively new branch of the Intelligent Transportation System, which can provide flexible transportation services for university campuses, resorts, and industrial parks. The proposed simulation approach is suitable for a preliminary assessment of CTS-related environmental impact in real-world driving conditions. The model is built to allow performance prediction of a single cybercar or the whole CTS in a wide range of operational conditions. A simple formula is proposed to compare the environmental impact of CTS with that of conventional vehicles. Calculation techniques are developed to evaluate the effect of the relative receptor density and different fuel resources used for electricity generation on the environmental impact of the transportation system based on battery-electric vehicles.

AB  - Methods for evaluating the impact of fires within tropical forests are needed as fires become more frequent and human populations and demands on forests increase. Short- and long-term fire effects on soils are determined by the prefire, fire, and postfire environments. We placed these components within a fire-disturbance continuum to guide our literature synthesis and develop an integrated soil burn severity index. The soil burn severity index provides a set of indicators that reflect the range of conditions present after a fire. The index consists of seven levels, an unburned level and six other levels that describe a range of postfire soil conditions. We view this index as a tool for understanding the effects of fires on the forest floor, with the realization that as new information is gained, the index may be modified as warranted.

KW  - FURNISHED CAGES
AB  - Council Directive 1999/74/EC (1999) defines three major categories of housing system: alternative (non-cage), unenriched'(conventional) cage and enriched (furnished) cage. Conventional cages are to be phased out by 1st January 2012, leaving only two categories of housing system. Both categories however comprise a wide variety of different designs and models, making it hard to draw conclusions on bird welfare in these systems. Thus, it is deemed important to gather information on the comparative welfare of hens in various egg production systems. The objective of this study is to provide information about the comparative welfare of laying hens housed in a variety of egg production systems, using evaluation criteria based on the Swedish poultry welfare monitoring system. The study involves assessments on flocks in conventional and furnished cages, single and multi-tier aviaries (barns) with and without verandas as well as fixed and mobile house free-range systems. Production assessments are measured throughout the laying period. Physical condition assessments are carried out on hens at about 35 and 60 weeks of age looking at feather cover on the back and wing area, feather hygiene, comb wounds, rear and back wounds, keel bone deformity, bumblefoot and broken claws. Environmental assessments are taken at about 35 and 60 weeks of age. The basics of the evaluation programme are results obtained on production, mortality and physical condition in relation to stipulated minimum requirements given as percentages of defect birds. Each physical condition assessment parameter is scored from I to 4, where 1 means a serious defect and 4 means very good condition. For the physical condition assessments, only scores of 1 and 2 are included in the minimum requirements. Only those hens are counted in the total percentage of defect hens.
   Early indications show that feed usage of hens in cage systems (both conventional and furnished) is lower than in non-cage systems, even though the bodyweight and egg production of hens is higher in cage systems than in non-cage systems. Interim results suggest that mortality is probably low or very low in conventional and furnished cages, moderate in barns/aviaries and highest in the free-range system. This may be one indication of poorer welfare in free-range systems, and taken together with the apparent lower production, it may be an important one that warrants further investigation. To date, all systems studied have met the Swedish welfare standards for rear and back wounds, feather hygiene and broken claws. The most favourable housing systems for laying hens in terms of comb wounds, keel bone deformity and bumblefoot are conventional and fumished cages.

AB  - Genetic-based neural networks (GNNs) for the assessment of the condition of power transformers are presented. The GNNs automatically tune the network parameters, connection weights and bias terms of the neural networks, to yield the best model according to the proposed genetic algorithm. Due to the global search capabilities of the genetic algorithm and the highly nonlinear mapping nature of the neural networks, the GNNs can identify complicated relationships among the dissolved gas contents in the transformers insulation oil and hence the corresponding fault types. The proposed GNNs have been tested on the diagnostic records of the Taipower Company and compared with a fuzzy logic diagnosis system, artificial neural networks and a conventional method. The test results show that the proposed GNNs improve the diagnostic accuracy and the learning speed of the existing approaches.

AB  - To complement physical measures or indices of river health a social benchmarking instrument has been developed to measure community dispositions and behaviour regarding river health. This instrument seeks to achieve three outcomes. First, to provide a benchmark of the social condition of communities' attitudes, values, understanding and behaviours in relation to river health; second, to provide information for developing management and educational priorities; and third, to provide an assessment of the long-term effectiveness of community education and engagement activities in achieving changes in attitudes, understanding and behaviours in relation to river health. In this paper the development of the social benchmarking instrument is described and results are presented from the first state-wide benchmark study in Victoria, Australia, in which the social dimensions of river health, community behaviours related to rivers, and community understanding of human impacts on rivers were assessed.

AB  - In dynamic dryland regions, accounting for spatiotemporal landscape dynamics is essential to understanding how ecological habitat networks are affected by hydroclimatic variability at regional or sub-continental scales. Here we assess how changes in the distribution and availability of surface water influence potential landscape connectivity for water-dependent organisms by combining graph theory network analysis with a Landsat-derived, seasonally continuous 25-year surface-water time-series. We focused on Australia's Murray Darling Basin (MDB), a globally significant and ecologically stressed 1 million km(2) semi-arid region recently affected by two unprecedented hydroclimatic extremes: the 1997-2010 Millennium Drought and 2010-2012 La Nina floods. We constructed potential habitat networks for two dispersal abilities using circuit theory resistance distances, and used 'habitat availability' graph theory metrics as indicators of regional-scale connectivity. We analysed 792 unique potential habitat networks containing over 6.6 million nodes, making our study one of the largest spatially explicit ecological network analyses yet conducted. Our indicators of connectivity revealed consistently positive but spatially heterogeneous relationships between flooded habitat area and landscape connectivity. Connectivity increased by over two orders of magnitude along the spectrum from severe drought to flood, associated with a transition from connectivity driven by intra-habitat or short-distance dispersal during drought to long-distance dispersal during wet conditions. Reductions in connectivity during drought were lower than expected given equivalent decreases in surface water habitat area, suggesting habitat network structure provides a degree of resistance to dry conditions. By providing insights into the processes driving connectivity during different phases along the drought-flood spectrum, our approach may assist in guiding conservation management aimed at maintaining or improving landscape connectivity within dynamic environments faced with increasing hydroclimatic variability.

AB  - Ecological stoichiometry is a powerful indicator for understanding the adaptation of plants to environment. However, understanding of stoichiometric characteristics of leaf carbon (C%), nitrogen (N%), and phosphorus (P%) for aquatic macrophytes remains limited. In this study, 707 samples from 146 sites were collected to study the variations in leaf C%, N%, and P%, and tried to explore how different environmental conditions affect leaf C, N, and P stoichiometry. Results showed that the mean values of leaf C%, N%, P%, and N:P ratios were 39.95%, 2.12%, 0.14%, and 16.60% of macrophytes across the arid zone of northwestern China, respectively. And the mean values of leaf P% were lower than those from the Tibetan Plateau and eastern China, which maybe due to an adaptation strategy of the plants to the unique conditions in the arid zone in the long-term evolutionary process. The higher N:P ratios suggested that P was established as the limiting factor of the macrophytes communities in the arid zone of northwestern China. There were significant differences in leaf C%, N%, P%, and their ratios among different life forms. Our results also showed strong relationships between leaf N% and N:P ratios and longitude, leaf N%, P%, and N:P ratios and latitude, and leaf N% and P% and altitude, respectively. In addition, the results showed that pH can significantly influence leaf C%. Our results supported the temperature-plant physiology hypothesis owing to a negative relationship between leaf N% and P% of macrophytes and mean annual temperature in the arid zone of northwestern China. The different patterns of leaf stoichiometry between the arid zone of northwestern China and eastern China indicated that there were different physiological and ecological adaptability of macrophytes to environmental gradients in different climatic zones.

AB  - In many natural environments, organisms get exposed to low temperature and/or to strong temperature shifts. Also, standard preservation protocols for live cells or tissues involve ultradeep freezing in or above liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees C or -150 degrees C, respectively). To which extent these conditions cause cold- or cryostress has rarely been investigated systematically. Using ATP content as an indicator of the physiological state of cells, we found that representatives of bacteria, fungi, algae, plant tissue, as well as plant and human cell lines exhibited similar responses during freezing and thawing. Compared to optimum growth conditions, the cellular ATP content of most model organisms decreased significantly upon treatment with cryoprotectant and cooling to up to -196 degrees C. After thawing and a longer period of regeneration, the initial ATP content was restored or even exceeded the initial ATP levels. To assess the implications of cellular ATP concentration for the physiology of cryostress, cell viability was determined in parallel using independent approaches. A significantly positive correlation of ATP content and viability was detected only in the cryosensitive algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii SAG 11-32b and Chlorella variabilis NC64A, and in plant cell lines of Solanum tuberosum. When comparing mesophilic with psychrophilic bacteria of the same genera, and cryosensitive with cryotolerant algae, ATP levels of actively growing cells were generally higher in the psychrophilic and cryotolerant representatives. During exposure to ultralow temperatures, however, psychrophilic and cryotolerant species showed a decline in ATP content similar to their mesophilic or cryosensitive counterparts. Nevertheless, psychrophilic and cryotolerant species attained better culturability after freezing. Cellular ATP concentrations and viability measurements thus monitor different features of live cells during their exposure to ultralow temperatures and cryostress.

AB  - Long chain alkyl diols (LCDs) are widespread in sediments and are synthesized, among others, by microalgae of the genus Nannochloropsis. The factors regulating the synthesis of LCDs and their biological function are, however, unclear. We investigated the changes in abundance of free + ester-bound LCDs, extracted by saponification and acid hydrolysis, during the growth of three Nannochloropsis species and incubated the species having the highest LCD abundance (Nannochloropsis oceanica) under different conditions known to affect the fatty acid content (i.e. light irradiance, salinity, nitrogen depletion, desiccation, cold shock) in order to evaluate their impact on LCD production. LCD abundances were relatively stable suggesting that they are not used as storage lipids, and supporting the assumption that LCDs are building blocks of an aliphatic biopolymer located in the outer cell wall (algaenan). Oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide led to a decrease in the C-32:1 diol, as well as other algaenan-associated compounds such as 15-OH-C-32:0 fatty acid and C-32: 2 alkenol suggesting that algaenans can play a role in the protection of Nannochloropsis cells. The relatively constant amount of LCDs per cell suggests that the abundance of LCDs in aquatic environments may be used as an indicator for the abundance of diol-producing algae. Interestingly, the abundance of C-30:0 13-hydroxy and C-32 0 15-hydroxy fatty acids, potential precursors for LCDs, correlate with those of the major C-14:0 and C-16:0 fatty acids. This supports the idea that the biosynthesis of LCHFAs might proceed by hydroxylation and elongation of shorter C-14-C-16 fatty acids. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Internally-consistent scenarios are increasingly used in social-ecological systems modelling to explore how a complex system might be influenced by deeply uncertain future conditions such as climate, population, and demand and supply of resources and energy. The presence of deep uncertainty requires model diagnostic techniques such as global sensitivity analysis to provide reliable diagnostic insights that are robust to highly uncertain future conditions. We extended the elementary effects method of Morris, which is widely used to screen important model input factors at low computational cost, by incorporating deep uncertainty via the use of scenarios, and evaluated its potential as a robust global sensitivity analysis approach. We applied this robust elementary effects (rEE) method to the highly-parameterised Australian continental Land Use Trade-Offs (LUTO) model a complex, non-linear model with strong interactions between parameters. We compared rEE sensitivity indicators with robust global sensitivity analysis (RGSA) indicators based on the variance-based eFAST method that imposes relatively high computational demand. We found that the rEE method provided a good approximation of the main effects and was effective in screening the most influential model parameters under deep uncertainty at a greatly reduced computational cost. However, the rEE method was not able to match the accuracy of the eFAST-based method in identifying the most influential parameters in the complex LUTO model based on their total effects. We conclude that the rEE method is well-suited for screening complex models, and possibly for efficient RGSA of models with weak interaction effects, but not for RGSA of complex models. Despite its limitations, rEE is a valuable addition to the robust global sensitivity analysis toolbox, helping to provide insights into model performance under deep uncertainty.

AB  - Benthic macroinvertebrates have been used widely as bioindicators to assess the condition of riverine ecosystems. However, understanding and modelling the spatial distribution of benthic macroinvertebrates within these ecosystems remain significant challenges for research and management. Statistical analyses of multivariate data sets offer opportunities to explore the ecological systems controlling the distribution of biota. This article reports a novel statistical analysis of a national-scale data set from England and Wales using the structural equation modelling (SEM) framework. Relationships between water quality, physical habitat structure and indices reflecting benthic macroinvertebrate community structure were analysed using SEM. On the basis of data from 219 monitoring sites, structural equation models were built. These models explained 87% of the spatial variation in the average score per taxon index and 76% of the spatial variation in the Lotic Invertebrate Index for Flow Evaluation. Significant direct and indirect effects on these indices were exerted by water quality variables, particularly the concentrations of dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand and orthophosphate. Independent of water quality conditions, both biotic indices were directly affected by variables describing the structure and the degradation of physical habitat. The strengths of the SEM framework include (i) direct evaluation of a priori models against observed data, thereby supporting confirmatory analysis of theoretical models of ecological systems; (ii) specification of latent variables representing unmeasured constructs; and (iii) simultaneous assessment of multiple direct and indirect paths between variables within a model. These strengths define a framework with the potential to be applied widely in the development and testing of hypotheses regarding the processes operating within riverine ecosystems.

AB  - We evaluated the northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus griseifrons), a known associate of key habitat features and processes of old-growth forest, for its capacity as a broad-scale ecological indicator of temperate rainforest ecosystem condition in southeastern Alaska, USA. We utilized a spatially explicit, resource-selection function to evaluate its distribution relative to landscape composition and structure at local (within home-range) and broad (home-range selection) spatial scales, followed by a moving-window analysis to model patch occupancy across this landscape. We found strong support for the influence of type, size, and compositional elements: large, old-growth patches were selected at both spatial scales, and regenerating forest patches <= 40 yrs old were selected against at the broader scale. More importantly, we found that occupancy was related to critical thresholds in composition: patches required >= 73% old-growth forest cover or a minimum total area of 73 ha of old-growth forest to be occupied by flying squirrels. A non-uniform pattern of selection for patches with higher structural connectivity at the local scale, but not at the broader scale, was likely a result of the "empty forest" phenomenon, in which remnant patches were inaccessible in this fragmented landscape. These results are consistent with recent studies of this and related species and suggest that occurrence of northern flying squirrels in southeastern Alaska is influenced by a number of landscape structure and compositional variables that relate critically to late-seral forest conditions. These findings shed new light on the utility of this species as an ecological indicator and its functional relevance to the resilience of fragmented forest ecosystems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Thymosin beta-4 (T beta 4) is an actin-binding intracellular peptide that promotes wound healing, tissue remodeling, and angiogenesis. The mechanism of T beta 4 secretion to the extracellular environment is not understood. The macrophage is a rich source of T beta 4 which also participates in wound healing process. The objective of this study was to find how T beta 4 may be externalized. Using activation of macrophage through their toll-like receptors (TLR), the changes in cellular T beta 4 was studied. A naturally transformed chicken macrophage cell line HTC was treated with different TLR agonists and the cellular T beta 4 changes was determined at 6 and 24 h after stimulations using stable isotope labelling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and mass spectrometry. Real time PCR was used to determine changes in gene expression. The results showed that TLR agonists such as peptidoglycan (PGN) or lipopolysacharide (LPS) caused depletions in cellular T beta 4 peptide along with its detection in the cell culture supernatant at 24 h. These TLR agonists also induced the expression of interleukins-1 beta, -6, and nitric oxide synthase genes at 6 h but failed to modulate T beta 4 gene at that time point indicating that the T beta 4 externalization was not associated with its production. To find whether T beta 4 externalization was associated with cell death, we measured the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity of the conditioned media as an indicator of cell damage. The results showed that the TLR agonists which induced depletion of intracellular T beta 4 at 24 h also increased the LDH content of the conditioned media, suggesting that the T beta 4 in the extracellular media most likely originated from dying macrophages.

AB  - Following the European Commission's Water Framework Directive all surface waters in EU's Member States must reach a good status by 2015. The evaluation of this status will be partly based on ecological criteria, such as the hydro-morphological quality criteria which also evaluate the structure and condition of the riparian zone. Riparian zones with undisturbed or nearly undisturbed condition are given high-ecological status. The agri-environmental measures in the EU promote an extensive use of land to protect the farmed environment and its biodiversity. Recent studies in Andalusia and elsewhere suggest that extensification leads to riparian zones with higher ecological status compared to intensively used areas. We suggest that extensification and thus better ecological status of the riparian zone can be partly approximated by the amount of vegetation permanently present on the area. For this the so-called permanent vegetation fraction was derived from a multi-temporal advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) dataset and was used (1) to classify the ecological status of the riparian zone into two classes, favourable and unfavourable, and (2) to assess the effect of agricultural practices on these areas. The classification was validated by field observations in the Guadalquivir river basin while detailed information on farming practices helped to assess the effect of agriculture on the riparian zone. The assessment was carried out in olive land cover because erosion control in olive cultivations is the most widely implemented measure in Andalusia. Results suggest that the remotely sensed permanent vegetation fraction is a good indicator of the favourable and unfavourable ecological status of the riparian zone. Furthermore, extensification of agricultural practices expressed in terms of increasing permanent vegetation cover was shown to have positive effect on the riparian zone as opposed to areas where no measures were implemented.

AB  - The objective of the current study was to identify hydromorphological variables that are suitable to define and describe hydromorphological degradation. Stream type-specific and spatial scale-dependent multivariate analysis (Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling, NMS) of 106 hydromorphological variables derived from 275 samples at 147 sites and indicator value analysis (IndVal) resulted in the identification of key factors describing hydromorphological differences in Central European lowland streams. Sample sites represented six European stream types from Sweden (1 stream type), The Netherlands (2 stream types), and Germany (3 stream types). The four large-scale hydro(geo)morphological variables: catchment size, geology ('% moraines', '% alluvial deposits'), and natural land use ('% natural forest') explained inter-stream type differences best. On the smaller site scale, riparian vegetation described inter-stream type differences best.
   On catchment scale, '% natural forest', and 'agricultural land use' illustrated inter-stream type hydromorphological degradation of all six stream types very well. Four site related variables ('% wooded riparian vegetation', '% shading', 'average stream width', and '% macrolithal (cobbles, 20 to 40 cm long) account for hydromorphological degradation on the smaller reach-scale. An analysis of indicator variables restricted to German stream types only resulted in four factors, namely '% xylal' (tree trunks, branches, roots, etc.), 'no of debris dams >0.3 m(3,), 'no of logs >10 cm 0', and '% fixed banks' as important descriptors of hydromorphological degradation. Intra-stream type hydromorphological degradation is illustrated for 'mid-sized sand bottom streams in the German lowlands'. For this stream type, a clear gradient of degradation was revealed, and 25 variables were identified to entirely characterize reference conditions and degradation. The variables that described the degradation gradient best were combined to the new German Structure Index (GSI), which can be implemented to continuously measure hydromorphological degradation.

AB  - Stomatal conductance is central for the trades-off between hydraulics and photosynthesis. We aimed at deciphering its genetic control and that of its responses to evaporative demand and water deficit, a nearly impossible task with gas exchanges measurements. Whole-plant stomatal conductance was estimated via inversion of the Penman-Monteith equation from data of transpiration and plant architecture collected in a phenotyping platform. We have analysed jointly 4 experiments with contrasting environmental conditions imposed to a panel of 254 maize hybrids. Estimated whole-plant stomatal conductance closely correlated with gas-exchange measurements and biomass accumulation rate. Sixteen robust quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified by genome wide association studies and co-located with QTLs of transpiration and biomass. Light, vapour pressure deficit, or soil water potential largely accounted for the differences in allelic effects between experiments, thereby providing strong hypotheses for mechanisms of stomatal control and a way to select relevant candidate genes among the 1-19 genes harboured by QTLs. The combination of allelic effects, as affected by environmental conditions, accounted for the variability of stomatal conductance across a range of hybrids and environmental conditions. This approach may therefore contribute to genetic analysis and prediction of stomatal control in diverse environments.

AB  - Farming of native carnivore fish species has drawn attention due to their promising use in aquaculture. Among these species, tucunare of the genus Cichla stand out, them being of high economical interest for sport fishing and Amazon's industry of ornamental fish. The present study describes the weight-length relationship (WLR), relative condition factor (Kn), red blood cell parameters, thrombocytes and leukocytes count of Cichla temensis Humboldt, 1821, farmed in central Amazon. Fish that underwent food training during fingerling culture received extruded ration containing 45% of crude protein during fattening, and had Kn with values from 0.925-1.199, which indicated good health condition during the culture. The equation obtained from the WLR was W = 0.0073Lt(3.1435), indicating an isometric growth, which is the desirable for fish of fish farm. Red blood cell counts, total thrombocyte and leukocyte counts, hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), concentration of mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCHC), lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils had intra-specific variation. A significant (p<0.001) positive correlation of the red blood cells number with the hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit was found. These are the first sets of blood parameters for C. temensis and could be used as reference for comparison in further studies to evaluate the health status of this fish in different environments, because assessment of these parameters may be used as quick tool for diagnosing diseases, stress and malnutrition.

AB  - Observed increases in the Earth's surface temperature bring with them associated changes in precipitation and atmospheric moisture that consequentially alter river flow regimes. Climate-induced flow regime changes are examined using the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration. This article uses observed daily streamflow data to examine the flow regime alteration and how these changes might potentially affect freshwater ecosystems. Flow data from 23 gauging stations throughout Taiwan show that the annual extreme water conditions (1-, 3-, 7-, 30-, 90-day annual minima or maxima) have increased alteration compared to baseline periods (1961-1990). Specifically, more severe flood and drought events occur in the period after 1991 than the period from 1961 to 1990. The frequency and duration of flood and drought events also show increased fluctuation. Flow regimes are currently being altered by stressors that will continue into the foreseeable future and it is also happing elsewhere in the world. Aquatic organisms not only need to defend themselves from anthropogenic damage to the river system, but also face the on-going threat from climate change-induced thermal and flow regime alteration. This article raises this issue so that water resources managers may identify precautionary measures that reduce the cumulative effects of both anthropogenic flow alteration and changing climate conditions.

AB  - Genetic and early environmental factors interact to influence ethanol's motivational effects. To explore these issues, a reciprocal cross-fostering paradigm was applied to Fischer and Lewis rats. The adult female offspring received vehicle or the kappa opioid antagonist nor-BNI (1 mg/kg) followed by assessments of conditioned taste aversion (CTA), blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) and hypothermia induced by 1.25 g/kg intraperitoneal ethanol. CTA acquisition in the in-fostered Fischer and Lewis animals did not differ; however, the Fischer maternal environment produced stronger acquisition in the cross-fostered Lewis rats versus their in-fostered counterparts. CTAs in the Fischer rats were not affected by cross-fostering. in extinction, the in-fostered Lewis animals displayed stronger aversions than the Fischer groups on two trials (of 12) whereas the cross-fostered Lewis differed from the Fischer groups on nine trials. Despite these CTA effects, Lewis rats exhibited higher BACs and stronger hypothermic responses than Fischer with no cross-fostering effects in either strain. No phenotypes were affected by nor-BNI. These data extend previous findings dissociating the aversive and peripheral physiological effects of ethanol in female Fischer and Lewis rats, and highlight the importance of genetic and early environmental factors in shaping subsequent responses to alcohol's motivational effects in adulthood.

AB  - The Rio Las Piedras basin in the Biosphere Reserve Cinturon Andino (Colombia) serves as a laboratory for initiatives directed towards sustainable agricultural techniques adapted to climate change conditions. Building on an improved social capital, the strategies applied aim at the improvement of the livelihood of the rural population and at the conservation of biodiversity and other ecosystem services. The present paper identifies the indicators of climate change experienced by the local population and tries to evaluate the success of the strategies applied in order to assess the applicability of such strategies to other mountain areas. The results indicate that the strategies applied are largely successful in ensuring the agricultural production and the ecosystem services also under changing climatic conditions. However, further improvement of the livelihood and social security are impeded by limited financial resources.

AB  - In order to assess the impact of bacterial input loads in Bizerte lagoon (Northern Tunisia), a seasonal survey was done for total coliform bacteria covering the whole lagoon area, to reproduce and prevent dispersion of input loads of terrestrial discharges in the lagoon. Effect of solar radiation on Escherichia coli strains was investigated using seawater microcosms comparatively exposed to sunlight and dark conditions. The results revealed (i) high charges of coliforms in the sediment rather than in the water column, (ii) total coliforms increased periodically with season in both compartments, (iii) anthropogenic discharges influence coastal areas of the lagoon, and (iv) solar radiation has an effect on decay rate of E. coli maintained in microcosm experiments.

AB  - The environmental impact of deposit development can be indirect and can cause combined geochemical processes in ecosystems. These must be taken into consideration under environmental forecasting and environmental risk assessment. Soil degradation in the Taiga Forest is considered, within the area of Verkhnekamskoye potash deposit (Russia), as an example of such environmental transformation. Here, the mechanism and characteristics of the anthropogenic salinisation of alluvial soils under potash deposit development are newly described. It was found that there is a strong anthropogenic impact of the potash industry on valley soils where the contaminated Na-Cl groundwater discharges or is close to the surface. The valley soils are characterised by high salinity, and the sum of toxic salts in soils has reached 26%. Alluvial gley humic clay chloride saline soil (Gleyic Fluvisols (Salic, Loamic, Technic)) and secondary solonchak on alluvial humic clay soil sulphate-chloride gypsum-containing surface-gleyed (Chloridic Gleyic Fluvic Solonchak (Hypersalic, Loamic, Technic)) were formed in hydromorphic conditions. Morphological, physicochemical and mineralogical analyses were carried out. Under hydromorphic conditions, Chloridic Gleyic Fluvic Solonchak (Hypersalic, Loamic) was described to show a hydrotroillite layer and reddish-yellow iron-rich precipitates on its surface. The top soil horizon has the highest content of iron minerals (up to 84.9%) and Fe-bearing plant residues (up to 20%). Additionally, the spongy and gel-like organic materials, as well as the siliceous remains of diatoms, are enriched in Ca, Fe, Cl, K, Na, S and P. The lower soil horizon consists of black gel-like phases and hydrogen sulphide settings with a high content of plant residues. The insoluble part of the samples contains up to 84% hydrogoethite. The sources of iron in soils and bottom sediments include the iron-enriched Sheshma sediments speckled rocks, slurry material, halite wastes and soil minerals of alluvial gley soils.

AB  - Aims
   Functional traits have emerged as an important tool to evaluate plant performance. However, the environmental conditions and ecological pressures that plants face change with their size, and the relationship between traits and plant performance should therefore be size-dependent, which has rarely been tested.
   Methods
   Here, we evaluated over a broad range of tree sizes the interspecific relationship between tree growth and mortality and eight functional stem, leaf and seed traits. We did so across 59 tree species in Brazilian dry forests and evaluated whether the relationships found for wet forest types in the literature also hold for dry forests, where water rather than light might limit tree performance.
   Important Findings
   We indeed found a strong size-dependent relationship between demographic rates and functional traits. At small sizes, when trees are in the shaded understory, species with functional trait values that enhance light capture or shade tolerance (i.e. higher maximum adult stature, taller heights, wider crowns, higher seed mass) have higher growth and/or lower mortality rates (MR). This relationship disappears at larger sizes when trees attain better light conditions in the canopy. Drought adaptations play only a role at larger tree sizes; once trees are in the dry and exposed canopy, species with higher wood density (an indicator of cavitation resistance) have lower MRs. Our study shows that both drought and shade adaptations are important in this dry forest, and that the relationships between functional traits and plant performance changes with plant size. Plant size should therefore explicitly be included as an axis of variation in functional analyses, to better understand the relationship between functional traits and demographic rates.

AB  - AimThe ecological niche of a species is dynamic at a variety of spatial and temporal scales; embracing this complexity is required for accurate assessment of species' niche requirements and to forecast how species will respond to novel and dynamic climates. In the context of recent advances in species distribution modelling, however, both the environment and the ecological niche of a species have often been treated and quantified as static entities. Here, our aim was to explore how species' realized niches and geographical ranges are dynamically shaped by the decoupled spatio-temporal availability of different environmental conditions, using the migration of Sylvia warblers as an example.
   LocationPalaearctic, Afrotropical and Indo-Malay ecozones.
   MethodsWe used a species distribution modelling approach to evaluate the niche characteristics of Sylvia warblers under their actual migration strategies as well as null models assuming resident behaviour. We focused on climate and land cover as niche dimensions, taking into account the spatial availability of environmental conditions during the peak breeding and non-breeding season for each Sylvia species.
   ResultsMigration did not increase the overlap between breeding and non-breeding niches compared with breeding and non-breeding niche overlap in resident null models. Sylvia warblers did not compensate for the costs of a longer migratory journey by tracking their climatic niche or land-cover niche more closely. Instead, Sylvia warblers migrated further than the closest available area with suitable climate and land cover.
   Main conclusionsClimatic niche tracking is unlikely to be the main driver of migration in Sylvia warblers. We suggest that taking dynamic environments into account and comparing actual niche characteristics to those resulting from alternative possible range dynamics enhances our understanding of the drivers behind organisms' movements and distributions.

AB  - Carbon and oxygen isotope compositions of the needle fibre calcite (NFC) from two soils observed in quarries (Villiers and Savagnier) in the Swiss Jura Mountains are used to investigate the processes involved in the formation of these calcite crystals in pedogenic environments. NFC occurs in soils with different macroscopic and microscopic morphologies. Three groups of microscopic morphologies are distinguished: simple needles (SN), simple needles with overgrowths (SNO), and simple needles with nanofibres (SNN), nanofibres being either organic or mineral in nature. These groups correspond to different stages in the formation and evolution of NFC. Evaluation of the delta C-13 and delta O-18 values of NFC and late calcite cements (LCC) in relationship to the composition of the carbonate host rock (CHR), and delta C-13(DIC) from the soil waters, indicate that both NFC and LCC are precipitated in isotopic equilibrium with the soil waters. Similar delta C-13 and delta O-18 values of the elongated NFC and the rhombohedral calcite crystals of the LCC suggest that the precipitation of these different calcite habits is not due to changes in physicochemical conditions. The growth of NFC crystals inside an organic mould formed by the fungal hyphae could explain the formation of calcite crystals in the shape of a needle in isotopic equilibrium with the local environment. The comparison of the delta C-13 and delta O-18 signatures of the various NFC morphological groups suggests that they likely evolve in the soil solution from calcite crystals liberated during the degradation of fungal hyphae walls. The NFC may be a proxy of the soil conditions (temperature and vegetation) during its precipitation, and also an indicator of biogenic (fungal) activity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In many organisms, a female's environment provides a reliable indicator of the environmental conditions that her progeny will encounter. In such cases, maternal effects may evolve as mechanisms for transgenerational phenotypic plasticity whereby, in response to a predictive environmental cue, a mother can change the type of eggs that she makes or can program a developmental switch in her offspring, which produces offspring prepared for the environmental conditions predicted by the cue. One potentially common mechanism by which females manipulate the phenotype of their progeny is egg size plasticity, in which females vary egg size in response to environmental cues. We describe an experiment in which we quantify genetic variation in egg size and egg size plasticity in a. seed beetle, Stator limbatus, and measure the genetic constraints on the evolution of egg size plasticity, quantified as the genetic correlation between the size of eggs laid across host plants. We found that genetic variation is present within populations for the size of eggs laid an seeds of two host plants (Acacia greggii and Cercidium floridum; h(2) ranged between 0.217 and 0.908), and that the heritability of egg size differed between populations and hosts (higher on A. greggii than on C. floridum). We also found that the evolution of egg size plasticity (the maternal effect) is in part constrained by a high genetic correlation across host plants (r(G) > 0.6). However, the cross-environment genetic correlation is less than 1.0, which indicates that the size of eggs laid on these two hosts can diverge in response to natural selection and that egg size plasticity is thus capable of evolving in response to natural selection.

AB  - The postembryonic development, and life table parameters of the Neoseiulus californicus were studied under laboratory conditions in order to evaluate the potentiality of this depredator for feeding on two phytophages mites Tetranychus desertorum (desert spider mite) and Panonychus citri (red spider mite). Tetranychus desertorum and P. citri may be considered as optimal food for N. californicus, which obtained survival rates of 100 %, on them. The time of the postembryonic development was significantly different (p < 0.05) between both diets. The periods of ovoposition, postoviposition and longevity of the N. californicus were 17.17; 4.37 and 22.53 days, respectively, fed with T. desertorum, and 14.84; 5.23 and 21.06 days, respectively, fed with P. citri. The demographic parameters of N. californicus obtained fed with T. desertorum and P. citri were: intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) = 0.269 +/- 0.004 and 0.307 +/- 0.004, mean generation time (T) = 12.847 +/- 0.185 and 10.791 +/- 0.142, net reproductive rate (Ro) = 31.792 +/- 1.478 and 27.352 +/- 1.187, finite rate of increase (lambda) = 1.309 +/- 0.006 and 1.359 +/- 0.006, respectively. The high values of r(m) and lambda registered for N. californicus under experimental conditions are indicators of control potential that this phytoseiid presented as a predator over these phytophages mites.

AB  - New biomarker evidence is presented that constrains the conditions of deposition and preservation of sediments rich in extractable organic matter from the Aptian-Albian sedimentary record of the Ionian Zone in NW Greece. Analyses were specifically carried out on total lipid extracts from 12 organic rich samples from the Vigla Shale Member, two of which represent the regional record for the early Albian Paquier Event of OAE1b. In the aliphatic fractions, compound groups such as n-alkanes, isoprenoid alkanes, steroids, hopanoids and terpenoids were recognized, pointing to a mixed origin from algae and prokaryotes with an additional measurable contribution from terrigenous plant matter. These compounds suggest deposition of the primary organic sediments under conditions of decreased bottom water oxygen concentrations. Mass spectral evidence from the aromatic fractions of most samples reveal the variable presence of diagenetic and catagenetic derivatives of carotenoid pigments ( including some with bound sulfur) that are characteristic of photoautotrophic sulfur bacteria. The presence of specific biomarkers originating from photosynthetic anaerobic microorganisms, similar to those in ancient and contemporary euxinic basins such as the Black Sea, suggest that photic zone euxinic conditions were intermittently operative in the Aptian- Albian stages of the Ionian Basin, but were not exclusively characteristic of the black shale representing the Paquier Event itself.

AB  - Recently, a new technology known as indicator of reduction in soils (IRIS) has emerged for documenting reducing conditions in soils. An iron (Fe) oxide paint is applied to polyvinyl chloride tubing that is subsequently placed within the soil. Under reducing conditions, the Fe oxides gain electrons, become soluble, and are stripped from the tubing. This study was initiated to address two questions that have emerged regarding the manufacture and use of IRIS tubes: (i) Why is a mixture of goethite (Gt) and ferrihydrite (minimum 30%-40% Gt) required for the Fe oxide paint to adhere and remain durable when applied to polyvinyl chloride tubing? and (ii) What is represented by the development of pale yellow areas that sometimes are observed on the IRIS tubes? To address these questions, Fe oxide coatings were examined using X-ray diffraction and Mossbauer techniques, by differential chemical extractions, and using scanning electron microscopy. Based on X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, we conclude that the transformation of ferrihydrite to Gt during paint synthesis results in large Gt crystals with an elongated lath-shaped habit that appear to produce an interlocking network of particles that enhances the durability of the paint. Differential extractions and Mossbauer data indicate that the development of pale yellow zones on the IRIS tubes represents a preferential dissolution of ferrihydrite over Gt, which is consistent with thermodynamic predictions of the relative stability of these two minerals in wetland soil environments.

AB  - Vitamin D deficiency in adults is referred to as osteomalacia, and this condition has multiple causes related to factors such as environment, living conditions and cultural practices. Therefore, understanding the types and range of expression of osteomalacia in archaeological bone, using a number of investigative techniques, will have significant implications for interpretations made about past communities. This study aimed to understand the expression of vitamin D deficiency in the skeletons of adults through detailed analysis of human bone from the late 18th and 19th century churchyard of St. Martin's, Birmingham, England, at a gross, radiological and histological level. The collection from St. Martin's is unusual for the period as this central burial ground in Birmingham was used by a wide cross section of society rather than a narrow socio-economic group as at other sites of this date. Macroscopic and radiological analysis of 291 adults identified seven individuals with osteomalacia, and histological analysis using back-scattered scanning electron microscopy confirmed the findings. Detailed description of the range of pathological alterations observed in the archaeological skeletons are presented, and possible interpretations of the patterns seen considered. The results of this investigation will enable clear diagnosis and interpretation of this vitamin D deficiency disease, an important socio-economic indicator, to take place in the future.

AB  - Direct, practical means of assessing undernutrition in deer (Odocoileus spp.) and other ungulates during winter are needed in areas of research and management, We examined the relationship between mass loss and serum urea nitrogen (SUN) and urinary urea nitrogen: creatinine (U:C) in captive white-tailed deer (O. virginianus), During 4 February-5 May 1988, we maintained 7 adult white-tailed deer on various feeding regimes to simulate natural nutritional restriction during winter. Mass loss was greater (P = 0.037) in deer (17.0-32.2%) fed restricted amounts of a low protein-low energy diet versus control deer (7.0-17.4%) fed the same diet ad libitum. Serum triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations did not differ (P = 0.191) between groups, but declined (P = 0.001) as nutrition declined. Slopes of percent mass loss-SUN and -urinary U:C relationships were positive (P = 0.008 and 0.055) in 7 and 6 deer, respectively. Mean U:C was directly related (r2 = 0.52, P = 0.040) to mean cumulative mass loss, whereas mean SUN was not (r2 = 0.29, P = 0.125). Data presented support the potential of urinary U:C as an index of winter nutritional condition of white-tailed deer; however, additional research is required to provide a complete understanding of this index's utility under field conditions.

AB  - Climate change will alter the balance between frozen and thawed conditions in Arctic systems. Increased temperatures will make the extensive northern permafrost carbon stock vulnerable to decomposition and translocation. Production, cycling, and transport of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) are crucial processes for high-latitude ecosystem carbon loss that result in considerable export off the Arctic landscape. To identify where and under what conditions permafrost DOC is mobilized in an Arctic headwater catchment, we measured radiocarbon (C-14) of DOC and assessed DOC composition with ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) of surface waters and shallow and deep subsurface porewaters from 17 drainages in the Barrow Environmental Observatory in Alaska. Samples were collected in July and September 2013 to assess changes in age and chemistry of DOC over time. DOC age was highly variable ranging from modern (19 parts per thousand Delta C-14) to approximately 7000 BP (-583 parts per thousand Delta C-14). DOC age increased with depth, over the summer as the active layer deepened, and with increasing drainage size. DOC quality indicators reflected a DOC source rich in high molecular-weight and aromatic compounds, characteristics consistent with vegetation-derived organic matter that had undergone little microbial processing, throughout the summer and a weak relationship with DOC age. In deep porewaters, DOC age was also correlated with several biogeochemical indicators (including dissolved methane concentration, delta C-13, and the apparent fractionation factor), suggesting a coupling between carbon and redox biogeochemistry influencing methane production. In the drained thawed lake basins included in this study, DOC concentrations and contributions of vegetation-derived organic matter declined with increasing basin age. The weak relationship between DOC age and chemistry and consistency in DOC chemical indicators over the summer suggest a high lability of old DOC released by thawing permafrost.

AB  - Campus building was a place to accommodate various educational activities, which were both carried out indoors and outdoors. The environment, including the building and its exterior, provided thermal comfort that was influenced by the context, such as the mass of the facility, vegetation, and constructing envelope materials. The microclimate also influenced the environment, such as temperature, wind speed, and humidity. This study aimed to investigate the outdoor thermal comfort of campus building in urban area during summer, while also identifying the influential factors. This research referred to a case study, examining the thermal quality of the educational building environment using ENVI-met software, based on the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) index as an indicator of outdoor thermal comfort, in Universitas Kebangsaan (UK). The results showed that the outdoor environment had low thermal comfort conditions during the day, as it also had different thermal satisfactory situations, due to differences in physical characteristics in each zone. This characteristics included, (1) The SVF determinant as indicators of the shading factor should be supported by the presence of vegetation and the use of pavement material, (2) Although the wind speed factor does not really affect the thermal comfort in the outdoor space, the interconnection between open gaps is likely to make breeze distribution in the area better. This study offered direction for campus planning, in order to maintain the optimal capacity of the natural environment, such as (1) Strategizing to create a better shadowing factor in the outer space, which was supported by controlling the use of pavement materials, (2) Directing the density of buildings by making open spaces more permeable, in order for better wind distribution in the area. From this study, the campus current conditions and future design development potential was also observed.

AB  - Determining inorganic nutrient profiles to support understanding of nitrogen transformations in stream sediments is challenging, due to nitrification and denitrification being confined to particular conditions in potentially heterogeneous sediment influenced by benthic microalgae, rooted aquatic plants and/or diel light cycles. The diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) and diffusive equilibration in thin films (DET) techniques allow in situ determination of porewater concentration profiles, and distributions for some solutes. In this study, DGT, DET and conventional porewater extraction (sectioning and centrifugation) methods were compared for ammonium and nitrate in stream sediments under light and dark conditions. Two-dimensional distributions of Fe(ii) and PO4-P were also provided to indicate the degree of spatial and temporal heterogeneity in sediment porewater, which can explain the sources and sinks of ammonium at various depths in the sediments. Although the conventional porewater extraction method consistently measured higher NH4-N concentrations than the DGT and DET techniques, the study showed that the DET measurements were the most reliable indicator of porewater NH4-N concentrations, with the DGT data being usefully supplementary. However, a large proportion of the NO3-N concentrations measured by DGT and DET were close to or below the method detection limits. Therefore, further development of these techniques is required to reduce the blanks and detection limits to allow natural low sediment porewater NO3-N concentrations to be accurately monitored using DGT and DET. The study indicated that benthic microalgae had direct and indirect influences on porewater nutrient distributions over light-dark cycles. Overall, DGT and DET techniques can be useful for monitoring porewater nutrient concentrations and profiles and for determining how biological processes drive changes in sediment nutrient concentrations and distributions.

AB  - In this paper, the performance, economic, and environmental aspects of integrating a flat plate solar collectors (FPSC)-based system with conventional heating equipment fueled by natural gas are evaluated for a residential building, located in Urmia city, Iran. The main component of the conventional domestic heating equipment is a hot water boiler, powered by a burner. Generally, the present analysis is divided into two parts. The first part is based on analyzing the system for 12 daylight hours in which solar radiation is available, while the second part evaluates it for 12 night hours. To provide the heating load of the building during daylight hours, the solar-based system is used, and the conventional equipment is utilized at night hours. The real heating load of the building constituted of the total load relevant to hot consumed water and the building thermal loss rate in cold months and the available solar radiation are calculated and employed in the simulations. Also, the monthly average total solar radiation, applied in the simulations, is between 7.63 MJ/m(2)/day and 25.39 MJ/m2/day throughout a year. The results revealed that the highest heating load for air conditioning purposes in warm and cold days are 37.52 kW and 91.05 kW, respectively. Furthermore, the highest heating load is provided using 63.3m(2) and 443.8m(2) of FPSCs for hot and cold air conditioning, correspondingly. Besides, the maximum payback period of coupling the FPSCs with the conventional equipment is found to be 3.1 years. Also, the employment of FPSCs contributes to reductions in CO2 emission rate with values of 84.67 kg/MWh and 84.71 kg/MWh for cold and warm days, respectively.

AB  - A new late-Holocene high-resolution pollen record is presented from Lago Patria with the aim of investigating past vegetation and environmental dynamics in a still under-investigated coastal sector of the Campania region (Italy). Our results show the evolution of a mixed deciduous and evergreen oak-dominated lowland forest, rich in both xeric and mesic woody taxa, under the influence of climate, human impact, geomorphic processes and their interplay. Between 4800 and 2800 cal BP, the pollen record highlights only slight vegetation changes, featured by a modest forest decline around 4200 cal BP, consistent with the deforestation pattern produced by the 4.2 ka arid climate event in southern and central Italy. This event was followed, between 3900 and 3300 cal BP, by a forest recovery with a remarkable development of mesic trees, notably Fagus, influenced by wet climate conditions. While Bronze Age and Iron Age settlements are missing from this coastal area, which suggests a marginal role of human activity in the environmental changes of this period, the continuous presence of anthropogenic pollen indicators in the pollen record stimulates new archeological investigations. Between 2800 and 2200 cal BP, the area experienced successive domination by Greek, Etruscan, Italic and Roman populations, culminating with the foundation and expansion of cities like Cumae, Capua, and Dicearchia/Puteoli, which determined major impact on the natural forest through intense agricultural practices. After a sedimentation hiatus between 2200 and 180 BP, the pollen record documents a few tens of years, during the Bourbon domination, when the vegetational landscape, characterized by cultivations and pasturelands, appears almost completely treeless. Pollen and other palynomorphs of aquatic taxa evidence a change from freshwater to brackish conditions, consistent with the transition from cat's eye freshwater ponds to open lagoon.

AB  - Modern agriculture rapidly improves productivity, yet it also pays high price for overconsumption of natural resources and energy use which is not environmentally friendly. To shape a sustainable agricultural future, the Western Balkans countries (NBC) need to tackle key challenges such as pollution, climate change and biodiversity threats. Circular agriculture is a concept that promotes the sustainable use of existing agricultural inputs and products, thus representing a driver of the future agri-food system. The paper considers basic drivers, moving from linear to circular agriculture, and summarises the implications of various performance indicators that drive circular agriculture development in Albania, Macedonia and Serbia. Based on the performance indicators, selected WBC have favourable conditions for switching from linear to circular agriculture and approach the EU level. Besides the indicators relevant to the northern part of Serbia, where "agrokombinats" are changing the general picture of input consumption, all other indicators illustrate favourable conditions for circularity.
   Technologically, Macedonia is leading in its use of ICTs for circular agriculture. The adoption of sustainable technologies for precision agriculture in the region will optimise the input use and increase productivity. The promotion of smart farming, based on the ongoing debate on the future design of the national agriculture policy to CAP harmonisation and use of EU funds to support farmers who have already taken steps towards digitalisation for circular agriculture, is a must for the region.
   Serbia has positive trends in organic agriculture, which is a wider accepted concept of the circular approach. However, there is still a need for an integrated farming system to minimise the use of direct energy from harmful resources, as well as fertilisers and pesticides for crop production.
   Albania shows the best performance in terms of circular agriculture, yet there is a space for improvement regarding socioeconomic aspects. Shifting from extensive labour to autonomous force is needed.

AB  - Conversion of a natural condition to agricultural use can impose changes in soil properties and processes and bring environmental consequences to the region this agricultural use encompasses. The aim of this study was to evaluate the physical quality of the soil in agricultural areas of municipalities around Sobradinho Lake, a semiarid region in the State of Bahia, using multivariate analysis statistical techniques as a tool. Initially, descriptive statistical analysis and correlation analysis techniques and the normality test were applied, which served as prerequisites for performing factor analysis and estimation of factor scores. Based on that, we determined the soil physical quality index for soil depths of 0.00-0.10, 0.10-0.20, and 0.20-0.40 m, the main objective being to classify soils as good, fair, and poor, according to the performance of their physical properties. Discriminant analysis was then carried out with the objective of validating the results obtained from the indices constructed with the results of factor analysis, as well as determining the physical soil properties that influence and are associated with soil quality in the agricultural areas of the region. Soil bulk density (Ds), macroporosity (Ma), and microporosity (Mi) were the properties that stood out as quality indicators, because they showed greater relative weight in the discrimination models of the sites sampled: Ds, Ma, and Mi in the 0.00-0.10 and 0.10-0.20 m layers, and Mi and Ds in the 0.20-0.40 m layer, suggesting that under the conditions studied, these variables are primarily responsible for the physical quality of the soil. Overall, the physical quality of the soil is not considered ideal, which may be attributed to the management practices adopted and, especially, to low levels of organic matter and the extremely sandy texture of the soil, rendering fragility to soils of the region.

AB  - Accurate sonar performance prediction modelling depends on a good knowledge of the local environment, including bathymetry, oceanography and seabed properties. The function of rapid environmental assessment (REA) is to obtain relevant environmental data in a tactically relevant time frame, with REA methods categorized by the nature and immediacy of their application, from historical databases through remotely sensed data to in situ acquisition. However, each REA approach is subject to its own set of uncertainties, which are in turn transferred to uncertainty in sonar performance prediction. An approach to quantify and manage this uncertainty has been developed through the definition of sensitivity metrics and Monte Carlo simulations of acoustic propagation using multiple realizations of the marine environment. This approach can be simplified by using a linearized two-point sensitivity measure based on the statistics of the environmental parameters used by acoustic propagation models. The statistical properties of the environmental parameters may be obtained from compilations of historical data, forecast conditions or in situ measurements. During a field trial off the coast of Nova Scotia, a set of environmental data, including oceanographic and geoacoustic parameters, were collected together with acoustic transmission loss data. At the same time, several numerical models to forecast the oceanographic conditions were run for the area, including 5- and 1-day forecasts as well as nowcasts. Data from the model runs are compared to each other and to in situ environmental sampling, and estimates of the environmental uncertainties are calculated. The forecast and in situ data are used with historical geoacoustic databases and geoacoustic parameters collected using REA techniques, respectively, to perform acoustic transmission loss predictions, which are then compared to measured transmission loss. The progression of uncertainties in the marine environment, within and between different REA categories, and the consequences on acoustic propagation are examined.

AB  - The present paper investigates rank and composition of coal as well as depositional and hydrogeological settings persisting during the stage of peat accumulation and evaluates taphonomy and conditions for the in-situ preservation of outstanding fossilized stump and trunks, using coal petrological and xylotomical analyses. The obtained results are further interpreted and compared with existing literature records. Lignite samples and fossil wood specimens were collected from the 2nd MPH (2nd Miocene Seam Horizon) or its equivalent present at Meuro, Piskowitz, and Welzow-Siid open-cast mines located in Lusatia, Germany. The examined lignite samples indicate low rank coals at lignite or subbituminous rank stage and are characterised by slight dominance of attrinite over textinite, ulminite, suberinite, cutinite porigelinite, resinite, and corpohuminite macerals. Waterlogged conditions prevailing in the mire are associated with peat accumulation under anoxic conditions accompanied by low decomposition rates. The determined facies indicators suggest a moderate to high as well as low gelification of the organic matter for the Meuro and Piskowitz open-cast mines, respectively. In Meuro open-cast mine, the prevalence of herbaceous plant in a mire or a bacterial/fungal degradation of woody plant tissues can be envisaged, whereas in the Piskowitz open-cast mine, it is suggested that peat formed in a wet forest mire environment with a limited oxygen supply and a relatively low bacterial/fungal degradation. The studied fossil wood specimens revealed the presence of Quasisequoioxylon piskowitzense preserved as an in-situ fossilized stump, as well as Taxodioxylon ctyptomerioides and Sciadopityoxylon wettsteinii species preserved as fossilized trunks. The examined species belong to the families of Sciadopityaceae and Cupressaceae Li sensu lato. The taphonomy of the in-situ fossilized stump and trunks can be explained by nutrient-, and oxygen-poor oligotrophic mires distinguished as raised bogs and suggesting generally anoxic conditions during Middle to late Miocene Climate transition.

AB  - Global change has the potential to affect river flow conditions which are fundamental determinants of physical habitats. Predictions of the effects of flow alterations on aquatic biota have mostly been assessed based on species ecological traits (e.g., current preferences), which are difficult to link to quantitative discharge data. Alternatively, we used empirically derived predictive relationships for species' response to flow to assess the effect of flow alterations due to climate change in two contrasting central European river catchments. Predictive relationships were set up for 294 individual species based on (1) abundance data from 223 sampling sites in the Kinzig lower-mountainous catchment and 67 sites in the Treene lowland catchment, and (2) flow conditions at these sites described by five flow metrics quantifying the duration, frequency, magnitude, timing and rate of flow events using present-day gauging data. Species' abundances were predicted for three periods: (1) baseline (1998-2017), (2) horizon 2050 (2046-2065) and (3) horizon 2090 (2080-2099) based on these empirical relationships and using high-resolution modeled discharge data for the present and future climate conditions. We compared the differences in predicted abundances among periods for individual species at each site, where the percent change served as a proxy to assess the potential species responses to flow alterations. Climate change was predicted to most strongly affect the low-flow conditions, leading to decreased abundances of species up to -42%. Finally combining the response of all species over all metrics indicated increasing overall species assemblage responses in 98% of the studied river reaches in both projected horizons and were significantly larger in the lower-mountainous Kinzig compared to the lowland Treene catchment. Such quantitative analyses of freshwater taxa responses to flow alterations provide valuable tools for predicting potential climate-change impacts on species abundances and can be applied to any stressor, species, or region.

AB  - Communities located in the interface between marine/brackish and freshwater habitats are likely to be early responders to climatic changes as they are exposed to both saline and freshwater conditions, and thus are expected to be sensitive to any change in their environmental conditions. Climatic effects are predicted to reduce the availability of groundwater, altering the hydrological balance on estuarine-aquifer interfaces. Here, we aimed to characterise the estuarine faunal community along a gradient dependent on groundwater input, under a predicted climatic scenario of reduction in groundwater discharge into the estuary. Sediment macrofauna was sampled along a salinity gradient following both the wet and dry seasons in 2009. Results indicated that species abundance varied significantly with the salinity gradient created by the groundwater discharge into the estuarine habitat and with sampling time. The isopode Cyarhura carinata (Kroyer, 1847) and the polychaetes Heteromastus filiformis (Claparede, 1864) and Hediste diversicolor O.F. Muller, 1776 were associated with the more saline locations, while oligochaeta and Spionidae were more abundant in areas of lower salinity. The polychaete Alkmaria romijni Horst, 1919 was the dominant species and ubiquitous throughout sampling stations. This study provides evidence for estuarine fauna to be considered as a potentially valuable indicator of variation in the input of groundwater into marine-freshwater interface habitats, expected from climatic pressures on aquifer levels, condition and recharge rates. For instance, a reduction in the abundance of some polychaete species, found here to be more abundant in freshwater conditions, and increasing Oligochaeta found here on higher salinities, can potentially be early warnings of a reduction in the input of groundwater into estuaries. Estuarine benthic species are often the main prey for commercially important fish predators such as in our case study, making it important to monitor the aquatic habitat interfaces taking into consideration the estuarine macrobenthos and groundwater availability in the system.

AB  - Under unidirectional sliding, the Stribeck-type curve traverses different lubrication regimes. Under mixed/boundary conditions, tribofilms formed by additives in lubricants represent a key mechanism for preventing wear but are difficult to investigate because of the complex composition of lubricants, their small thickness, and their amorphous nature. The formation of a hydrodynamic fluid film depends on the topography and the viscometric fluid properties. Low coefficients of friction do not consequently indicate that hydrodynamic fluid films were formed. The electric contact resistance serves here as a complementary indicator to identify the hydrodynamic fluid film and tribofilm formation under transient or static sliding conditions. The frictional work (W-R) is a useful quantity to assess the contribution to the frictional losses of all lubrication regimes in a Stribeck-type curve.

AB  - A fluorescence-based assay for the determination of lipase activity using rhodamine B as an indicator, and natural substrates such as olive oil, is described. It is based on the use of a rhodamine B natural substrate emulsion in liquid state, which is advantageous over agar plate assays. This high-throughput method is simple and rapid and can be automated, making it suitable for screening and meta-genomics application. Reaction conditions such as pH and temperature can be varied and controlled. Using triolein or olive oil as a natural substrate allows monitoring of lipase activity in reaction conditions that are closer to those used in industrial settings. The described method is sensitive over a wide range of product concentrations and offers good reproducibility. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Data on chrysophyte cyst to diatom ratios as an index to track Holocene paleosalinity changes are presented. Six sediment cores taken in four coastal systems influenced by Holocene sea level changes indicate that during the transition from marine/brackish to brackish/freshwater and freshwater conditions, increases in the cyst to diatom ratio were recorded. These data suggest that Holocene changes in paleosalinities in coastal aquatic systems may be tracked by using this simple index, however other factors (such as changes in nutrient levels) may complicate some interpretations. Nevertheless, data required to calculate this simple index are easy to obtain, and so relatively little effort is required to obtain some paleolimnological information on these two important algal groups.

AB  - A study of the structure of the plankton community along the coastal zone of the Casa Caiada-Rio Doce area (Pernambuco, Brazil) is presented. The results obtained indicated that in the protected zones the water presented high turbidity, high temperature, low salinity and high nutrient and oxygen rates. All of these conditions were responsible for the reduction in plankton diversity and an increase in the biomass of the most opportunistic (r-strategist) species e.g. Gyrosigma balticum and Bacillaria paxillifera (Phytoplankton) and Euterpina acutifrons (Zooplankton). The differences found with respect to others area studies performed in pristine conditions indicated that plankton structure could be used as an environmental health indicator and that, in this specific area, it was indicative of a poor quality coastal environment.

AB  - The average length of the catch has long been used as a simple indicator of stock condition. Previous studies have evaluated the fishery conditions and species' biological characteristics where such an indicator performs best. This study uses a management strategy evaluation framework to test the combination of an average-length-based assessment with a target- and limit-based harvest control rule in terms of achieving specific long-term management objectives. Results show that the average-length-based harvest strategy performs acceptably well for typical Australian demersal temperate trawl species with relatively high productivity. It is essential that the assessment takes the variability in length-at-age into account for this harvest strategy to work effectively. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The management of nitrogen in wheat based on biological and environmental indicators can ensure productivity with a reduction in environmental impact. The objective of the study was to develop a more sustainable management of nitrogen use in wheat, considering the dose as a fraction of the total supply based on an estimate of the maximum technical and economic efficiency, and expected grain yield, in systems of succession of high and reduced release of N-residual, during acceptable and unfavorable crop years. The study was conducted from 2012 to 2018, in Augusto Pestana, RS, Brazil. Two experiments were conducted in each agricultural year and in each rotation system (soybean/ wheat and corn/wheat), one to quantify the biomass yield and the other to determine grain yield. The experimental design was a randomized block with four repetitions in a 5 x 3 factorial, for doses of N-fertilizer (0, 30, 60, 90, 120 kg ha(-1)) and ways of supplying the nutrient [full condition (100%) at the phenological stage V-3 (third expanded leaf); fractionated (70%/30%) at phenological stage V-3/V-6 (third and sixth expanded leaf) and fractionated (70%/30%) at phenological stage V-3/R-1 (third expanded leaf and ear differentiation)], in the soybean/wheat and corn/wheat succession systems with high and reduced N-residual release, respectively. More efficient use of nitrogen was obtained based on wheat grain productivity when applied at the full dose at the third expanded leaf stage. The supply of the maximum dose of nitrogen with an expectation of 3 t ha(-1) ensures satisfactory productivity with reduced nutrient losses to the environment, especially in unfavorable years for cultivation, regardless of the succession system.

AB  - The threats that arise from climate change and their associated economic, social, and environmental impacts are leading to the transformation of the spatial structures of cities. The growing demand for climate adaptability calls for the development of normative criteria for the design of forms of urban settings that integrate vegetation. Climate-responsive urban design reacts to the challenges of urban physics, which depend heavily on the forms of urban structures and the role of greenery. This method includes research on vegetation indexes and their impact on urban regulatory functions. The goal is to propose a comprehensive framework for assessing the functioning of urban public space, which considers the role and maintenance of green infrastructure. The intersection with the subject matter of analytical urban morphology is evident, in terms of the resolution of the urban fabric and its transformations over time. The framework of climate-responsive urban design also covers examining the parameters of surrounding built structures, such as the floor area ratio, the building coverage ratio, and building heights. In particular, the requirements of climate adaptation have an impact on the design of outdoor spaces in cities. In this article, we apply the selected methods that contribute to the climate-responsive urban design model to recommend the transformations of two urban nodes, in Lodz and Warsaw (Poland). Our goal is to indicate the future form of nodal public spaces with a focus on the needs of urban greenery, and to determine indicators for the local climate zone. After an initial literature review, we discuss a number of available indicators from the perspective of how they might contribute to determine the environmental conditions. We focus on urban water cycle, the requirement of trees for water, and insolation conditions.

AB  - Many lowland floodplain habitats have been disconnected from their rivers by flood defence banks. Removing or lowering these banks can reinstate regular flooding and thus restore these important wetland plant communities. In this study we analyse changes in wetland hydrology and plant community composition following the lowering of flood defence banks at a floodplain of the River Don in the United Kingdom (UK). The aim of the restoration project was to improve the quality of "floodplain grazing marsh" habitat, which is a group of wetland communities that are of conservation interest in the UK. We analyse changes in species richness and community composition over a period of 6 years, and compare the presence of indicator species from the target floodplain grazing marsh plant communities. The lowering of the flood banks increased the frequency of flood events, from an estimated average of 1.7 floods per year to 571 floods per year. The increased flooding significantly increased the proportion of time that the wetland was submerged, and the heterogeneity in hydrological conditions within the floodplain. There were significant differences in composition between the pre-restoration and restored plant communities. Plants with traits for moisture tolerance became more abundant, although the communities did not contain significantly more 'target' floodplain grazing marsh species at the end of the study period than prior to restoration. Colonisation by floodplain grazing marsh species may have been limited because environmental conditions were not yet suitable, or because of a shortage of colonising propagules. While the desired target plant community has not been achieved after 5 years, it is encouraging that the community has changed dynamically as a result of hydrological changes, and that moisture-tolerant species have increased in occurrence. Over the next few decades, the restored flood regime may cause further environmental change or colonisation events, thus helping increase the occurrence of desired floodplain grazing marsh indicator species.

AB  - The ecology of aquatic protists such as testate amoebae is poorly known worldwide, but is almost completely unknown in lakes of the northern Neotropics. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed testate amoebae (Amoebozoa: Arcellinidae) in lakes of the Lacandon Forest, one of the most biodiverse parts of southern Mexico. We set out to evaluate the diversity of testate amoebae communities and assess whether testate amoebae taxa are reliable indicators of environmental variables dissolved oxygen and water depth. We collected 17 surface sediment samples from a range of water depths in six lakes across the Naha-Metzabok Biosphere Reserve, northeastern Chiapas state. We identified 15 testate amoebae taxa distributed across seven genera. Eleven were identified to species level and four to strain (infra-subspecific level), and taxa were distributed unevenly among samples. Distribution of taxa in samples was related to dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in the water measured near the sediment surface. Arcella discoides and Centropyxis aculeata strain "aculeata" were the most tolerant of low oxygen concentrations, whereas the other taxa require higher DO levels. The influence of oxygen was also seen at the assemblage level. Sites with low DO concentrations had Shannon Diversity Index (SDI) values <1.5, an indication of stressful ambient conditions. We identified two species assemblage types, which are distinguished by their oxygen concentration requirements. Assemblage 1 was more diverse and possessed species that are intolerant of low oxygen concentrations, whereas Assemblage 2 possessed fewer, rarer, opportunistic species that tolerate stressful conditions. Low oxygen concentrations are related to water depth and the combination of these two variables is important in determining the composition of testate amoebae assemblages in Lacandon Forest lakes. Quantitative relationships between testate amoebae assemblages and water depth will enable use of sedimented amoebae remains for paleolimnological inference of past water level changes in lakes of the Lacandon Forest.

AB  - Arcellinida (lobose testate amoebae) preserve well in lake sediments and have shown great potential as palaeolimnological indicators, but a limited understanding of their ecology prevents more in-depth interpretations of both contemporary and fossil assemblages. Loch Leven, Scotland, has a well-documented history of nutrient-enrichment and associated lake biological change, creating a temporal gradient along which testate amoeba ecology can be investigated. Plant macrofossil data from a dated sediment core (LEVE14) indicate that a transition from oligo-mesotrophic to eutrophic conditions occurred over at least the last 200 years, enabling direct comparisons to be drawn with fossil testate amoeba assemblages from the same core. Cluster analysis and principal components analysis show that testate amoebae and macrophytes responded synchronously to an early phase of nutrient-enrichment after ca. AD 1200, and to anthropogenic water-level lowering and further enrichment after ca. AD 1830. The results of indicator species analysis (IndVal) support the suggestion inferred previously that Cucurbitella tricuspis is an indicator of nutrient-enrichment, while the association of some less abundant taxa, specifically Difflugia amphora and Mediolus corona, with eutrophic environments is also corroborated. Overall, the testate amoeba assemblage response appears to reflect a complex interaction of factors which were ultimately driven by eutrophication. These include variations in microhabitat associated with changing plant structure and sedimentary conditions influenced by macrophyte community succession. In particular, a shift from an oligo-mesotrophic macrophyte assemblage composed of isoetid plants to one dominated by Potamogeton spp. and dense stands of Characeae is suggested to influence the relative proportions of sediment dwelling and plant-associated testate amoebae. The results highlight the utility of testate amoebae as benthic indicators of lake nutrient-enrichment and demonstrate the value of using multi-proxy palaeolimnological data to refine the ecology of lesser-studied palaeoecological groups.

AB  - This study examines the stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen from cored lacustrine sediments of the Al-Azraq, an arid lake basin on the Jordan Plateau. Lacustrine sediments contain valuable records of paleoenvironmental conditions, recording local and regional response to environmental change. Previous paleo-reconstructions on the Jordan Plateau are based on archaeology, pollen, mineralogy, and stratigraphy. The application of organic geochemistry analyses to these lake sediments identifies multiple sources of organic matter, biological production, and contributes to understanding the paleoenvironments of the Al-Azraq basin during the mid-Pleistocene period. Organic carbon concentration (Corg) provides an overview of the organic matter distribution. Carbon isotopic composition (delta 13Corg) and nitrogen isotopic composition (delta 15N) are indicators of organic matter sources and paleoproductivity. Magnetic susceptibility (MGSUS) measured the concentration of ferromagnetic minerals and indicated aeolian inputs. Organic geochemistry differentiated five paleoenvironmental zones with specific sources of organic matter, both aquatic and terrestrial. It identified a long period of climate wetter than the present, punctuated by a short intense period of aridity. Diagenesis plays an important role in the decomposition of organic matter and studies indicate this degradation can alter the isotopic signals of organic matter. Analyses of the isotopic signals and statistical analyses demonstrate diagenesis is not a factor in the Al-Azraq sediments in all but Zone 4 of the paleoenvironmental zones. This Zone is defined by less negative carbon isotopic composition and the presence of thick primary gypsum layers, in addition to the influx of high peaks of aeolian sediment as reflected in the magnetic susceptibility data. Stable isotope geochemistry provides detailed information on the paleoenvironments of lake sediments, and is applicable to typically challenging arid basin sediments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Tephroseris longifolia subsp. moravica is an endemic endangered taxon of European importance. Within the nine recently known populations it occurs in very specific site conditions of ecotone habitats. In our contribution, we try to quantify its realized niche with regard to the measured components of its biotic and abiotic environment. The main aim was to assess the importance of spatial environmental variation on taxon occurrence and performance and to relate the obtained ecological information to data on taxon abundance and demography. Possible reasons of taxon rarity are discussed, too. Comparison of plot pairs indicated that plots containing the taxon had deeper soil and higher soil Na and Mg contents than plots without it. They also contained higher number of species, especially forbs. Several soil parameters were positively correlated with taxon size and density while light parameters played minor role. Negative correlations between cover of vascular plants, especially grasses and taxon size and density suggest its reduced competitive ability. Vascular plant-based ecological indicator values were set for light (6), temperature (5), continentality (4), moisture (5), soil reaction (7) and nutrients (5). The studied sites differed in topography, soil characteristics (pH, soil Na, K, Ca, P and NH(4)) and cover of herb litter. Size of taxon populations was negatively related to their finite rate of increase which varied between 1.25 and 2.04 and was most sensitive to demographic parameters related to growth. We conclude, that the studied taxon is not strictly stenotopic as the ranges of several environmental variables were rather wide. We suppose, that the narrow limits of recent taxon occurrence are consequences of its low competitive ability and demographic processes related to germination and seedling establishment. The differing requirements of its ontogenetic stages (seedlings and generative individuals) may define the final limits of its small-scale distribution.

AB  - Drought stress is the major constraint to rice (Oryza sativa L.) production and yield stability in rainfed ecosystems. Identifying genomic regions contributing to drought resistance will help develop rice cultivars suitable for rainfed regions through molecular marker assisted breeding. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) linked to plant water stress indicators, phenology and production traits under irrigated and drought stress conditions were mapped by means of a doubled-haploid (DH) population of 154 rice lines from the cross CT9993-5-10-1-M/ IR62266-42-6-2. The DH lines were subjected to water stress before anthesis in three field experiments at two locations. The DH lines showed significant variation for plant water stress indicators, phenology, plant biomass, yield and yield components under irrigated control and water stress. A total of 47 QTLs were identified for various plant water stress indicators, phenology, and production traits under control and water stress conditions in the field, which individually explained 5 to 59% of the phenotype variation. A region was identified on chromosome 4 that harbored major QTLs for plant height, grain yield, and number of grains per panicle under drought stress. By comparing the coincidence of QTLs with specific traits, we also genetically dissected the nature of association of root traits and capacity for osmotic adjustment with rice production under drought. Root traits had positive correlations with yield and yield components under drought stress. This study demonstrated that the region RG939-RG476-RG214 on chromosome 4 identified for root-related drought resistance component QTLs also had pleiotropic effects on yield traits under stress. Consistent QTLs for drought resistance traits and yield under stress were detected and might be useful for marker-assisted selection for rainfed rice improvement.

AB  - This study investigates the nature and components of annual luminescent banding in massive Porites coral skeletons, with a view to refining the technique for using this banding to reconstruct past environmental conditions. Three-dimensional excitation-emission-matrix spectroscopy and optical fibre beam delivery have been used to investigate the luminescence properties of the bright and dull bands of solid coral. Six characteristic excitation/emission peaks have been identified: 280/450-600, 340/450, 370/470, 390/485, 420/505 and 450/530 nm. The first peak corresponds to protein-type fluorescence. The others are characteristic of humic acid luminescence. The difference in luminescence intensity between bright and dull bands has been quantified and characterised spectroscopically. The luminescence of the bright bands is up to 25% more intense than their neighbouring dull bands with the greatest increase in relative intensity in the long wavelength emission region, between 500 and 600 nm. The contribution of long-lived phosphorescence to the total luminescence intensity has been determined by time-resolved measurements on the 100 ms timescale, Both bright and dull bands show long-lived phosphorescence with decay times up to 1.5 s, This phosphorescence accounts for about 10% of the total luminescence intensity of bright bands. The difference in phosphorescence intensity between bright and dull bands is substantially greater than the difference in total luminescence intensity: the phosphorescence of bright bands is up to twice as intense as that of dull bands. This suggests that phosphorescence plays an important role in defining luminescent banding ill coral. Furthermore, the large observable difference in phosphorescence between bright and dull bands indicates that measurement of phosphorescence profiles across growth bands in corals may prove to be a moro sensitive indicator of past environmental conditions than measurements of total luminescence.

AB  - The disposal of liquid wastes and sludges directly into a lagoon in hydraulic continuity with the saturated zone of a shallow sand aquifer at Villa Farm in Warwickshire, U.K., has produced an extensive plume of groundwater pollution. Oil/water mixtures, effluent treatment sludges containing heavy metals, acids, alkalis, organic solvents, phenols, and paint wastes, have been deposited over the years, and many boreholes have been drilled to determine the extent of the pollution and to investigate geochemical and hydropological controls on contaminant migration. A redox zonation occurs in the transition from a heavily polluted and highly reducing zone near the lagoons and at the base of the aquifer, to oxidising conditions in the natural uncontaminated groundwater above. A series of redox reactions predicted by thermodynamics have been identified, namely, aerobic respiration, denitrification, manganese reduction, nitrate reduction, iron reduction, sulphate reduction, and finally methanogenesis. Heavy metals am strongly attenuated in the anaerobic zone as carbonates and sulphides, but nickel persists at concentrations of 0. 1-0.5 mg/l within the plume in association with relatively high molecular weight organic compounds. The character of the dissolved organic carbon in groundwater changes with increasing travel time from the lagoons and metabolites of phenol degradation have been identified. Because methanogenic conditions occur throughout the plume, a soil ps survey above the water table was expected to reveal methane which could be used as indirect evidence of groundwater pollution below. However, methane was only found in trace quantities, and carbon dioxide was found to be a better indicator of groundwater pollution at depth. Profiles of dissolved methane and carbon dioxide through the methanogenic and sulphate reduction zones suggest that methane is being oxidised anaerobically to carbon dioxide within the zone of sulphate reduction.

AB  - The present study aimed to elucidate relationships between phytoplankton species and stressors using multivariate approaches and assess the environmental condition of Burc Reservoir's surface water using phytoplankton metrics from September 2018 to August 2019 according to implementations of the Water Framework Directive. Burc Reservoir had a characteristic of a warm monomictic pattern. Phytoplankton functional groups (E, F, J, L-O, L-M, M-P, P, S-1, T, and W-1) were found in the reservoir. A significant difference was found in total biovolume values changed from 2.28 mm(3)/L in November 2018 to 0.51 mm(3)/L in February 2019. The first two axes of canonical correspondence analysis explained 99.2% of relationships between stressors and phytoplankton assemblages. Explanatory factors such as electrical conductivity (EC), nitrate (NO3-N), total nitrogen (TN), water temperature, calcium (Ca+2), precipitation, total organic carbon (TOC), ortho-phosphate (o-PO4), and total phosphorus (TP) significantly drove the spatiotemporal distribution of phytoplankton. Weighted average regression resulted that phytoplankton species such as Gymnodinium saginatum, Snowella lacustris, Ceratium hirundinella, and Pseudanabaena limnetica were closely associated with high TP, while Fragilaria capucina, Navicula trivialis, Cymbella aspera, Ulnaria biceps, Nitzschia palea, and Pseudopediastrum boryanum closely related to the EC. Carlson's trophic state index indicated that Burc Reservoir mainly has a eutrophic characteristic with the assessment of chlorophyll a, total phosphorus, and Secchi disk depth, while it had a eu-hypertrophic according to the OECD classification. Results of the modified PTI-phytoplankton trophic index (mean = 2.37), the Med-PTI Mediterranean phytoplankton trophic index (mean = 1.96), and the Q assemblage index (mean = 2.58) indicated a moderate ecological status of Burc Reservoir. The present study confirmed that phytoplankton assemblages are closely integrated with the environmental condition of Burc Reservoir, which could be assessed by using the PTI and Med-PTI.

AB  - Crop residue decomposition is an essential process that affects soil properties and ecosystem services related to nutrient recycling, soil organic matter, and aggregation. Therefore, understanding crop residue decomposition is recommended to evaluate soil changes and define a more sustainable sugarcane straw removal management for bioenergy production. The straw chemical composition may be an efficient indicator to investigate this complex process. Thus, we conducted a field study to assess the sugarcane straw composition changes over 1 year using DRIFT spectroscopy technique. The experimental design consisted of a split-plot and randomized block design, and straw removal rates provided the main plot factor with time of sampling as the split-plot factor. Three sugarcane straw removal rates were evaluated: no removal (~ 14.0 Mg ha(-1) of dry mass), 50 (~ 7.0 Mg ha(-1)) and 75% (~ 3.5 Mg ha(-1)). Decreases in the absorbance associated with labile C (1200 to 1100 cm(-1)), and increases in more recalcitrant C (1800 to 1600 cm(-1)) were showed by the DRIFT spectra. In regional scale, the straw chemical composition was affected by environmental conditions, whereas at a local scale, the main driver was the decomposition time. Specific DRIFT peaks were correlated with the referential wet chemical method, commonly named Van Soest method. From the correlations between the Van Soest and DRIFT methods, we suggest using the absorbance of 896, 987, 1173, and 1447 cm(-1) bands to assess cellulose and hemicellulose changes and 1500 cm(-1) band for lignin changes in sugarcane straw. The application of DRIFT analysis to follow the decomposition process is a feasible and clean methodology to detect straw chemical changes induced by the environmental conditions and decomposition time.

AB  - Depressions in semiarid regions with a gypsiferous geological substrate commonly contain highly gypsiferous sediments, with gypsum that formed either as a synsedimentary precipitate during perennial or ephemeral lake stages or as a diagenetic precipitate during saline mudflat stages. The dry to ephemeral lake basins of the Monegros region in northern Spain are depressions of this type and provide a unique opportunity to examine whether and how conditions of gypsum formation are reflected by gypsum crystal morphology, yielding information that can contribute to a correct interpretation of the depositional environment of gypsum in ancient and modern formations. In most lake basins of the study area, the sediment fill consists of a similar sequence of three lithological units. The lower unit includes fragmented gypsum crystals in some basins, recording elastic reworking, and in other depressions it contains large lenticular crystals, formed as phreatic diagenetic precipitates. The middle unit typically contains synsedimentary gypsum with a non-lenticular morphology, modified by postdepositional processes, but it also comprises synsedimentary lenticular gypsum in some basins. In the upper unit, separated from the underlying interval by a marked hiatus, both synsedimentary and diagenetic gypsum are present, the former including layered gypsum deposits with features such as grading and variations in crystal morphology. The results show that a non-lenticular crystal habit of gypsum occurring within the groundmass (sediment matrix) indicates synsedimentary precipitation. In contrast, a lenticular crystal habit cannot be used in isolation as an indicator of the environment in which the gypsum initially precipitated. Unambiguously late-diagenetic gypsum includes fine-grained precipitates in voids created by soil fauna. These infillings consist of initially non-lenticular crystals, with a tabular-prismatic habit, recording that conditions promoting lenticular crystal growth do not always prevail outside the groundmass in soil-related settings and illustrating the importance of knowing the context of analyzed gypsum occurrences at the scale of a sample.

AB  - Europe's cultural landscape has undergone notable changes in the last few decades. In particular, conserving the cultural rural landscape of the Mediterranean basin constitutes a difficult task due to the fact that, on one hand, rural abandonment, and on the other, agricultural intensification, are generating a new type of landscape which is apparently less appealing than the traditional one. indeed, this landscape depends upon the maintenance of traditional agricultural uses and their associated activities, both of which depend on local environmental conditions and on socio-economic conditioning factors. The latter are increasingly being seen as the causes of the changes. Modifications in the social structure and processes affect and alter the rural environment, so that ecological and socio-economic information must be integrated for use as a basis for land use planning and management.
   In the present paper we have applied numerical analyses which associate territorial structure with economic and socio-cultural structure, predicting new types of landscape by means of experimental scenarios of socio-economic changes. The configuration of the traditional rural landscape studied and its spatial heterogeneity depend upon the proportion of the agriculture, pasture and woodland components of the traditional systems. Formalization of this landscape-socio-economy dependence enables us to consider scenarios of socio-economic change and to deduce variations in the landscape. We simulated changes related to the promotion or abandonment of agriculture. The model developed can be considered as an effective agri-environmental indicator, as it provides most of the characteristics required for analysis and environmental appraisal at landscape level.

AB  - Introduction. Recent archaeological studies deal with the integration of natural science disciplines. Such scientific interaction includes the reconstruction of climatic changes, human adaptation to the changing conditions of nature, study of sociocultural specifics in nomadic groups as well as rising archaeological cultures, with emphasis on the interconnection between the fluctuations of steppe environmental conditions and steppe populations. Analysis. The article presents the results of the carried out interdisciplinary analysis of classic and modern archaeological studies and natural science disciplines. This allows evaluating the specifics of different factors (paleoclimatic, sociocultural, etc.) influencing the "steppe-human" system in a new way. Such factors as registered climatic changes, spreading areas of archaeological cultures, mortuary funeral rites, results of paleoanthropological examination, written records and ethnographic data provide evidence to reconstructing different time-span events of early nomads' history in one context. The reconstruction of historical reality shows quite strong correlation between the environment and specific features in the development of ancient steppe societies. Human has high adaptive abilities to changing factors. However, the steppe population mode of life is extremely conservative and it has practically never changed during the Sarmatian or Sauromatian history. Climate fluctuations over the steppe area influenced the demographic and social structure of nomadic society. During auspicious periods, nomadic communities became populous and active politically and military. If negative factors dominated, the population tended to decrease and the social structure tended to simplify. Critical indicators of aridization and humidization in Eurasian steppes are followed with the population outflow, which is evidenced by small amount of archaeological sites or even by vanishing of cultures. Results. Thus, the authors conclude that when studying archaeological sites of the Early Iron Age nomadic cultures, it is necessary to consider the steppe and human as a single organism responsive to changing and a strong impact of environmental and socio-cultural factors.

AB  - As more species undergo range shifts in response to climate change, it is increasingly important to understand the factors that determine an organism's realized niche. Physiological limits imposed by abiotic factors constrain the distributions of many species. Because glucocorticoids are essential to the maintenance of physiological homeostasis, identifying glucocorticoid-environment relationships may generate critical insights into both limits on species distributions and potential responses to environmental change. We explored relationships between variability in baseline glucocorticoids and sensitivity to environmental conditions in two chipmunk species characterized by divergent patterns of spatial, genetic, and morphological change over the past century. Specifically, we investigated whether the alpine chipmunk (Tamias alpinus), which has undergone pronounced changes, displays greater glucocorticoid sensitivity to environmental parameters than the lodgepole chipmunk (T.speciosus), which has exhibited little change over the same interval. From 2013 to 2015, we collected environmental data and fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) samples from these species. Using generalized linear mixed models and a model averaging approach, we examined the impacts of environmental and individual phenotypic parameters on FGMs. We found pronounced interspecific differences, with environmental parameters being better predictors of FGMs in T.alpinus. FGMs in this species were particularly elevated in less climatically suitable habitats and in areas with higher maximum daily temperatures. Individual phenotypic traits were not predictive of FGMs in T.alpinus, although they were highly predictive for T.speciosus. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that T.alpinus is more sensitive to environmental change. More generally, our results suggest that both phenotypic attributes and environmental conditions contribute to FGM responses but that the relative contributions of these factors differ among taxa, including among closely related species. Finally, our analyses underscore the value of glucocorticoids as bioindicators of sensitivity to environmental change in species for which the factors affecting stress physiology have been assessed.

AB  - At the beginning of the drought in the Sahel in the 1970s and 1980s, rainfall decreased markedly, but runoff coefficients and in some cases, absolute runoff increased. This situation was due to the conversion of the land cover from natural vegetation with a low annual runoff coefficient, to cropland and bare soils, whose runoff coefficients are higher. Unless they are adapted, hydrological conceptual models, such as GR2M, are unable to reproduce this increase in runoff. Despite the varying environmental and climatic conditions of the West African Sahel, we show that it is possible to increase the performance of the GR2M model simulations by elaborating a time-varying soil water holding capacity and to incorporate this value in the annual maximum amount of water to be stored in reservoir A of the model.
   We looked for interactions between climate, rural society, and the environment. These interactions drive land-cover changes in the Sahel, which in turn drive the distribution of rainfall between infiltration, evaporation, and runoff and hence the water resources, which are vital in this region. We elaborated several time series of key indicators linked to these interactions.
   We then integrated these changes in the runoff conditions of the GR2M model through the maximum value of the reservoir capacity. We calculated annual values of water holding capacity using the annual values of four classes of land cover, natural vegetation, cultivated area, bare soil, and surface water. We then used the hydrological model with and without this time-varying soil value of A and compared the performances of the model under the two scenarios. Whatever the calibration period used, the Nash-Sutcliffe index was always greater in the case of the time-varying A time series.

AB  - The effective management and conservation of coastal wetlands requires an appropriate typology to underpin classification and mapping, adequate inventory information, and a robust assessment of ecological condition and threats. Extensive and floristically diverse coastal wetlands occur along much of the coast of Victoria (south-eastern Australia), but there are serious deficiencies in all these information requirements. Previously unanalysed data from the Victorian Biodiversity Atlas were used to revise the typology currently applied to coastal saltmarsh in Victoria. To supplement the single unit currently used for State-endorsed mapping and inventory (EVC 9 Coastal Saltmarsh Aggregate), seven new Ecological Vegetation Classes are proposed to better reflect the floristic and structural diversity of coastal saltmarsh in south-eastern Australia. Coastal saltmarsh is currently allocated the lowest conservation status (least concern') across much of Victoria, and it is recommended that this be upgraded variously to the higher categories of endangered', vulnerable', or rare'. A State-wide inventory using the new typology, prepared using recently flown, high-resolution aerial photographs and extensive ground-truthing (212 person-days), indicated that there were 19212ha of coastal saltmarsh of all types, 5177ha of mangroves, and 3227ha of EVC 10 Estuarine Wetland (a wetland type dominated by Juncus kraussii) in Victoria. On-ground assessments undertaken across 30 geographic sectors of the coast indicated that coastal wetlands were confronted by a wide range of anthropogenic threats, which in many cases were quite different from those outlined in prior reviews of Australian wetland systems. Weed invasions were especially problematic, not so much of the exotic and highly publicized Spartina in the lower levels of tidal wetlands but from a wide range of exotic taxa in more elevated saltmarshes (e.g. tall wheat grass Lophopyrum ponticum).

AB  - Brazilian peppertree, Schinus terebinthifolia Raddi (Anacardiaceae), is one of the worst upland exotic weeds in Florida, USA. Foreign exploration for natural enemies led to the discovery of a pit-galling psyllid, Calophya latiforceps Burckhardt (Hemiptera: Calophyidae), in the state of Bahia, Brazil, in 2010. Crawlers of C.latiforceps stimulate the formation of galls on the leaves of S.terebinthifolia resulting in leaf discoloration and in some cases leaf abscission. To determine whether C.latiforceps is a safe candidate for biological control of S.terebinthifolia, host specificity and the presence of selected plant pathogens were examined. Adult oviposition, gall formation, and adult survival of C.latiforceps were examined on 89 plant species under no-choice and choice conditions. We found that C.latiforceps laid eggs on plants in seven families; however, crawlers stimulated gall formation and completed development to adult only on S.terebinthifolia. All crawlers on non-target plants died, likely due to starvation caused either by the absence of a feeding stimulus or by a hypersensitive plant response. Under no-choice conditions, 10% of adults lived for 19days on the target weed, but adult survival was reduced to <3days on non-target plants. Choice testing revealed that females preferred to oviposit on S.terebinthifolia compared to non-target plants. Molecular methods and indicator host inoculations did not detect the presence of Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum', Ca.L. asiaticus', Ca.L. americanus', Ca.L. africanus', or plant viruses in adult C.latiforceps. We conclude that releasing C.latiforceps in the USA will have extremely low risk to non-target plants, and provides another tool for the management of S.terebinthifolia.

AB  - The mass occurrence of the large hyperiid Themisto libellula was recorded in both the western and the eastern Bering Sea within 2007-2011. Those were the years of a relatively long 6-year period of cold, which was caused mainly by the inflow of cold waters from the north; this is confirmed by the distribution of bottom and surface temperatures and also by the ice-cover values. This hyperiid became dominant in the diet of salmon, walleye pollock, herring, and several other nekton fish species. T. libellula periodically spreads southward with cold northern waters, finding favorable conditions in "new" areas. Being a rapidly growing species with a short life cycle, within 1 or 2 years it reaches a high abundance, which then gradually declines and remains at a mean or low level, as usually occurs with species that were introduced into a new habitat. After the environmental conditions deteriorate, as a "warm" period arrives with changes in the general circulation and a growing inflow of warmed Pacific waters, the southern boundary of the species range moves back far northward and it completely disappears in the areas where it prevailed in the plankton and was a main forage item in the diet of many fish species. Taking into account the durations of warm and cold periods from 1980 until 2010, an event like this in the Bering Sea can be expected within 1 or 2 years. In the eastern Bering Sea, the abundance and dominance of a number of zooplankton species may vary simultaneously. This effect is more pronounced in T. libellula and for this reason the species is considered as a biological indicator of the described climatic changes in the Bering Sea.

AB  - LC-MS-MS analysis of groundwater of a tar oil contaminated site showed the occurrence of the N-heterocycles quinoline and isoquinoline as well as their hydroxylated and hydrogenated metabolites. The concentrations of the hydroxylated compounds, 2(1H)-quinolinone and 1(2H)-isoquinolinone, were significantly higher than those of the nonsubstituted parent compounds. Therefore, exclusive quantification of the parent compounds leads to an underestimation of the amount of N-heterocycles present in the groundwater. Microbial degradation experiments of quinoline and isoquinoline with aquifer material of the site as inocculum showed the formation of hydroxylated and hydrogenated products under sulfate-reducing conditions, the prevailing conditions in the field. However, since analyses of seven tar products showed that these compounds are also primary constituents, their detection in groundwater is found to be a nonsufficient indicator for the occurrence of biological natural attenuation processes. Instead, the ratio of hydroxylated to parent compound (R(metabolite)) is proposed as a useful indicator. We found that 65-83% of all groundwater samples showed R(metabolite) for 2(1H)-quinolinone, 1(2H)-isoquinolinone, 3,4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone, and 3,4-dihydro-1(2H)-isoquinolinone, which was higher than the highest ratio found in tar products. With respect to the observed partition coefficient between tar oil and water of 3.5 for quinoline and isoquinoline and 0.3 for 2(1H)-quinolinone and 1(2H)-isoquinolinone, the ratio in groundwater would be approximately 10 times higher than the ratio in tar oil. When paying attention to these two parameters, 19-31% of groundwater samples exceed the highest tar oil ratio. This indicates that biological processes take place in the aquifer of the site and R(metabolite) is an applicable indicator for natural attenuation.

AB  - The Pennsylvanian section at Joggins contains bivalves, possibly representing several species of Naiadites, in great abundance within certain beds of the Joggins Formation (Westphalian A). Shells are chalky-white and in most specimens the internal microstructure is preserved as nacreous tablets which are always aragonite. This site represents the oldest-known occurrence of Paleozoic non-marine biogenic aragonite.
   Geochemically the bivalves are distinct from coeval tropical marine, based on stable and radiogenic isotopes, and terrestrial counterparts based on their trace element contents. The Sr, Mg, Na, Mn and Fe contents are strongly habitat controlled by ambient environmental conditions and suggest a near-shore continental lacustrine-paludal environment. The high enrichment factors for Mn and Fe suggest slightly dysaerobic water conditions during shell secretion.
   The deltaC-13 (+ 2.11 to + 2.24%, PDB) and delta-O-18 (- 5.83 to - 5.72%, PDB) values, after mineralogy correction, for the Joggins bivalves are dissimilar to those of shallow-water, paleoequatorial brachiopods, but suggests that Naiadites also preferred warm, shallow waters. Furthermore, the postulated composition and temperature for annual precipitation of -5.5 to -2.3%, deltaO-18 (SMOW) and 18-24-degrees-C, respectively, support the equatorial position of this locality during the Pennsylvanian. Water reaching the Joggins locality was probably of a rheotrophic nature derived from rain in the Caledonia Highlands. This ''local'' origin of the meteoric water is further supported by its Sr isotopic composition. In addition, the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of the Joggins bivalves (>0.7093) are significantly different from those of coeval brachiopods and mollusks (<0.7085). This isotopic invariance between marine and non-marine invertebrates provides incontrovertible evidence and support for the non-marine paleoecology of Naiadites and thus the enclosing sediments of the upper Joggins Formation.

AB  - Methods of sampling and analyzing the surface material of sheds of composite insulators are reviewed. It is shown that scanning electron microscopy gives useful information from slivers cut from the insulator surfaces, and emission Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy enables derivation of indicators of material oxidation to be developed from surface swabbing with solvents. FTIR absorption spectroscopy and diffuse reflectance FTIR spectroscopy give indicators of surface chalking for ehtylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) insulators. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is used to determine surface layer elemental composition and concentration of oxidized bonds. The techniques are applied to field aged 275 kV EPDM and silicone rubber insulators and tentative correlations developed between surface condition and leakage current. Cluster analysis of results from sampling of a large population of EPDM insulators shows that the surface analysis methods facilitate grouping by location and manufacturer.

AB  - The purpose of the study is to compare indicators of oxidative stress (OS) and bone mineral density in patients with combined course of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and osteoporosis (OP), who are permanently resident in industrial regions and in environmentally friendly conditions.
   Materials and methods. Atotal of 74 patients with combined course of type 2 DM and OP have been examined. The main group included 50 patients who had permanent residence in Zaporizhzhia city (industrial region). The comparison group included 24 patients with combined course of type 2 DM and OP who were born and lived in Mykhailivka town of the Zaporizhzhia region (ecological region). All the patients underwent ultrasound densitometry using the Omnisense 7000 ultrasound densitometer (Beam Medical Ltd, Israel). Osteoporosis risk index (ORI) was calculated for each patient as an average index for 2 bones. The OS intensity was assessed by nitrotyrosine and 8-hydroxyguanine serum levels. Serum glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were also measured.
   Results. The main group patients did not significantly differ from the comparison group patients in terms of OP risk factors, age, gender, duration and course of type 2 DM. The mean values of nitrotyrosine and 8-hydroxyguanine levels were significantly 2.5times (P <0.05) and 1.4 times (P <0.05) higher, respectively, in the main group as compared to similar patients from the environmentally friendly region. The bone mineral density in the industrial region group was significantly lower. Thus, the Rad-Tib ORI was 12 % higher in the main group, Rad-Ph ORI - by 19 %, and Tib-Ph ORI - by 16 % compared with the comparison group (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions. The processes of OS are intensified and severity of osteoporosis is increased in the patients with combined course of type 2 diabetes mellitus and OP who have been permanently living in the large industrial city compared to the residents of the environmentally friendly region.

AB  - The vertical distributions of bulk and molecular biomarker composition in samples from a ca. 156 cm sediment core from Lake Ichkeul were determined. Bulk analysis (Rock-Eval pyrolysis, carbonate, lipid extraction) and molecular analysis of saturated fractions were used to characterize the nature, preservation conditions and input of sedimentary organic matter (OM) to this sub-wet lake environment. The sediments are represented mainly by gray-black silty-clay facies where the carbonate (CaCO3) content varies in a range of 10-30% dry sediment. Rock-Eval pyrolysis revealed a homogeneous total organic carbon (TOC) content of ca. 1% sediment, but with down core fluctuation, indicating different anoxic conditions at different depths and material source variation. The values show three periods of relative enrichment, exceeding ca. 1%, at 146-134 cm, 82 cm and 14-0 cm depth. The low Hydrogen Index (HI) values [<119 mg hydrocarbon (HC)/gTOC)] were characteristic of continental Type III OM. The T-max values in the range 415-420 degrees C were characteristic of immature OM at an early diagenetic stage.
   The distributions of n-alkanes (C-17 to C-34), isoprenoid (iso) alkanes (pristane and phytane), terpanes and steranes showed that the OM is a mixture of marine algal and bacterial source and emergent and floating higher plant origin. In addition, the distributions, as well as several biomarker ratios (n-alkanes, iso-alkanesin-alkanes), showed that the OM is a mixture of immature and mature. Significant downcore fluctuation was observed in the molecular composition. This indicates intense microbial activity below ca. 50 cm core depth under an anoxic and brackish environment.

AB  - Aim On the basis of 2402 phytoecological releves, with complete species lists, and real pH measurements resulting from chemical analyses of the top layer of forest soils, this paper compares quantitatively the ecological response of 46 herbaceous forest species along a pH gradient in two regions of northern France.
   Location The two regions investigated are oceanic north-western France (NW) and semicontinental north-eastern France (NE).
   Methods For each of the 46 species with more than 50 occurrences in both NW and NE regions, an ecological response curve was computed with simple logistic regression models, and two synthetic numerical values were derived: ecological optimum (OPT) and ecological amplitude (AMP). A comparison of the ecological behaviour of species present in both regions was performed in terms of shift in optimum and/or amplitude.
   Results All 46 species did reveal a reaction to pH. Our main observation was the relative stability of the behaviour of most species with reference to pH conditions, which is consistent with results from some previous studies. Slight differences regarding the two synthetic parameters (OPT and AMP) were however observed between the NW and NE regions, probably due to a form of competitive release in neutral environments in the NW.
   Main conclusions Among the main possibilities that could explain a geographical shift in the ecological behaviour of herbaceous species, competitive effects are, we suggest, the most plausible explanation. In the light of former studies, it seems that further analyses of geographical shifts in the ecological behaviour of forest plant species over large areas are needed, such as for example over the European continent.

AB  - By now, a vast amount of experimental material has been accumulated in the field of protective afforestation of the Central Chernozem Region of Russia, which allows estimating the stability and longevity of various trees and shrubs in different environmental conditions. Good growth and high vitality of woody vegetation largely depend on growing conditions and are determined primarily by the relationship between species (individuals within a species) when they are placed in the forest area and the type of terrain. The research purpose is to examine the growth and sanitary condition of protective forest plantations with different combinations in tree and shrub mixing schemes and unequal location by types of terrain. The study was carried out in mature (115-118-year-old) forest strips laid out by the staff of the Kamennaya Steppe experimental forestry G.F. Morozov and N.A. Mikhailov on the territory of the Kamennaya Steppe (Voronezh region, Talovsky district) using archival materials, scientific works of the authors of this article and the employees of the Department of Agroforestry. A comparative analysis of the materials of forest survey work carried out in protective forest plantations created according to the tree-shrub type of mixing on different types of terrain revealed an excess of biometric indicators of tree species growing on the upland type of terrain over those on the slope. It is shown that the initial percentage of participation of English oak is a significant. but not always decisive factor in the creation of oak plantations. They can also be grown with a smaller proportion of this species in the culture, but in this case. timely thinning will be of paramount importance. Over time, there have been significant changes in the composition of plantations, the number of trees and their valuation indicators. There are no viable ash and elm specimens left in the upper tier of the stands. They are severely damaged by stem pests. Certain tree species are damaged by the following pests: common ash by large ash bark beetle (Hylesinus crenatus) and ash bark beetle (Hylesinus fraxini); elm species by cambium-feeding beetles (large elm bark beetle (Scolytus scolytus), European elm bark beetle (Scolytus multistriatus), and pygmy elm bark beetle (Scolytus pygmaeus); English oak by gold pit oak splendour beetle (Chrysobothris affinis), oak borer (Agrilus angustulus), longhorn beetle (Plagionotus detritus), and European oak bark beetle (Scolytus intricatus). The predominant number of trees of all tree species belongs to the categories of limited viable and inviable.

AB  - Simple Summary We tested horses on the impossible task paradigm, a drawback affecting the decision-making process in animals. We used the direction of the horse's ear cup as an indicator of its visual attention in terms of visual selective attention when both ears were directed at the same target and the visual differential attention when the ears were directed differentially to the persons and to the experimental tools. We aimed to evaluate whether the latter behavior could be considered a possible support to solve the problem. The visual differential attention was the most frequent behavior when the resource was unreachable, which supports the view that this gesture could be linked to a request for help from humans to find the solution to the task. Our procedure proved to be a useful way to understand how horses try to attract human attention when they are in a restricted environment, a typical situation for horses living in stables.
   In order to explore the decision-making processes of horses, we designed an impossible task paradigm aimed at causing an expectancy violation in horses. Our goals were to verify whether this paradigm is effective in horses by analyzing their motivation in trying to solve the task and the mode of the potential helping request in such a context. In the first experiment, 30 horses were subjected to three consecutive conditions: no food condition where two persons were positioned at either side of a table in front of the stall, solvable condition when a researcher placed a reachable reward on the table, and the impossible condition when the food was placed farther away and was unreachable by the horse. Eighteen horses were used in the second experiment with similar solvable and impossible conditions but in the absence of people. We measured the direction of the horse's ear cup as an indicator of its visual attention in terms of visual selective attention (VSA) when both ears were directed at the same target and the visual differential attention (VDA) when the ears were directed differentially to the persons and to the table. We also included tactile interaction toward table and people, the olfactory exploration of the table, and the frustration behaviors in the ethogram. In the first experiment, the VDA was the most frequent behavior following the expectancy violation. In the second experiment, horses showed the VDA behavior mostly when people and the unreachable resource were present at the same time. We speculate that the VDA could be a referential gesture aimed to link the solution of the task to the people, as a request for help.

AB  - Terrestrial species are predicted to migrate northward under global warming conditions, yet little is known about the direction and magnitude of change in microbial distribution patterns. In this continental-scale study with more than 1600 forest soil samples, we verify the existence of core microbiota and lump them into a manageable number of eco-clusters based on microbial habitat preferences. By projecting the abundance differences of eco-clusters between future and current climatic conditions, we observed the potential warming-driven migration of the core microbiota under warming, partially verified by a field warming experiment at Southwest China. Specifically, the species that favor low pH are potentially expanding and moving northward to medium-latitudes (25 degrees-45 degrees N), potentially implying that warm temperate forest would be under threat of soil acidification with warming. The eco-cluster of high-pH with high-annual mean temperature (AMT) experienced significant abundance increases at middle- (35 degrees-45 degrees N) to high-latitudes (> 45 degrees N), especially under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, likely resulting in northward expansion. Furthermore, the eco-cluster that favors low-soil organic carbon (SOC) was projected to increase under warming scenarios at low-latitudes (< 25 degrees N), potentially an indicator of SOC storage accumulation in warmer areas. Meanwhile, at high-latitudes (> 45 degrees N) the changes in relative abundance of this eco-cluster is inversely related with the temperature variation trends, suggesting microbes-mediated soil organic carbon changes are more responsive to temperature variation in colder areas. These results have vital implications for the migration direction of microbial communities and its potential ecological consequences in future warming scenarios. (C) 2021 Science China Press.

AB  - Heat stress disturbs the mutualistic relationship between the hard corals and the symbiotic algae, which cause coral bleaching. A wide array of biochemical parameters is used to demonstrate the phenomenon. This study exposed a shallow-water hard coral, Acropora digitifera, to a series of elevated temperatures over time while the interaction between Symbiodiniaceae (SD) density, antioxidants activities, fatty acid (FA) composition, and putative FA health indicators was evaluated. Heat stress caused a substantial loss in SD densities, consequently regulated the antioxidant activities and caused significant changes in FA composition. There was a lack of evidence showing A. digitifera experienced oxidative stress; nonetheless, a significant decrease of monounsaturated fatty acid as (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) during the thermally induced experiment demonstrated that corals utilize their unsaturated FA as a final barrier or as a repair system against oxidative damage once the antioxidant enzyme cannot cope with stress condition. The lower ratio of putative FA health indicators [i.e., n-3 LC:n-6 LC, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA):arachidonic acid (ARA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA):ARA] characterized an unhealthy coral. The loss of SD density was significantly correlated with certain PUFA markers [i.e., linolenic acid (18:3n6), 20:5n3, and 22:6n3] and putative FA health indicator (i.e., n-3 LC:n-6 LC, EPA:ARA, and DHA:ARA). These notably imply that the FA linked with the symbiont can be a potential health indicator for assessing the effect of the environmental stressor on coral. This study also revealed the regulation of FAs during stress conditions, especially when heterotrophic feeding is limited. Future studies on FA profiles toward antagonistic or synergistic effects will offer a better understanding of the nature of this relationship under a harsh climate.

AB  - Palynological analyses in combination with radiocarbon dating on a Holocene borehole from the Lake Nanyi, Anhui Province, East China demonstrate a well-documented local vegetation evolution since 9000 cal BP, which is the first record of Holocene climate change and human impact in this region. Since 9000 cal BP a mixed evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved forest dominated by Cyclobalanopsis and Quercus developed in this area, indicating a warm climate condition with enhanced insolation. A mixed evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved forest was fully developed between 6600-4500 cal BP, which corresponds to the Holocene Climate Optimum with the strong influence of East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). After 3000 cal BP the broad-leaved forest decreased rapidly, while land herbs and ferns increased. It seems that the climate condition in East China was similar to the present after Holocene Climate Optimum. Pollen results show a potential interface between environment changes and human activities. Pollen diagram demonstrates that human impacts on the natural vegetation remained weak at the early stage but significantly enhanced upwards. The distinctive fluctuations of the pollen contents among AP (trees and shrubs), and the possible agriculture indicators might infer the potential human behaviors for environment changes. Due to the enlargement of organized farming and increase in population, natural forest was eventually replaced by farmland since 3000 cal BP. This study would increase our knowledge of Holocene vegetation transition related to the monsoon dynamics on a long timescale in East China and provide an environmental background for more detailed studies on cultural developments in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River region.

AB  - Land degradation has put the world's rangelands under intense pressure and reduced their capacity to provide vital services to those who solely depend on them for survival. With the current pressures on rangelands, worldwide, there is an urgent need to survey the present condition of rangelands. Such detailed surveys can identify where improvement programmes can be emphasised; whether it be reseeding, stock control, sociological restraints or other actions. To combat rangeland degradation, management systems are more effective when they account for community perceptions and practices. This study aims to assess the current status of woody plants in different categories of degradation as perceived by herders in Kunene, Namibia. Furthermore, we wished to compare the perception of degradation by herders with the measured ecological condition. With the help of herders, sites representing different categories of degradation (low, moderate, high and protected) were identified and 10 plots of 400m(2)each were established in each category. Species diversity, density, basal area and regeneration of woody plants increased sequentially along the degradation gradient (high to low). Vegetation attributes such as species diversity, seedling density and standing basal area increased with increasing distances from the villages. Although the herders' perception of degradation, for high and moderate degradation, matches the ecological results, the low degradation sites show signs of bush encroachment, a type of degradation that the herders did not perceive as degradation.Colophospermum mopane, a known encroacher species across Namibia, was the dominant species in the moderate and low degradation sites.Pechuel-loeschea leubnitziae, which is also known to be an indicator of degradation, was the dominant species in the high degradation sites. The findings highlight the present and future threats the study area is facing and form the basis for current restoration research.

AB  - Stable isotope ratios in tree rings are increasingly used as palaeoclimatic archive and ecophysiological indicator. We used cross-dated tree-ring series from different tree functional types, i.e. the evergreen conifer Jmiperus polycarpus and the deciduous broadleaved Quercus macranthera. The samples were collected from Chaharbagh Gorgon forest in northern Iran, where oaks and junipers grow on north-facing and south-facing slopes, respectively. We extracted a-cellulose from the whole wood of annually separated tree rings and evaluated their potential for palaeoclimate reconstructions by examining the relationships between variations of delta C-13 in treering cellulose and climate parameters. Based on tree-ring delta C-13, we calculated intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) and evaluated changes in water availability at the study site over the past 50 years. We found significant negative relationships between tree-ring delta C-13 values in oak and juniper and precipitation in April and spring (only in junipers), while no significant correlations of tree-ring delta C-13 with temperature occurred. A strong negative relationship between tree-ring delta C-13 and summer Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) was found at the drier site, indicating that juniper growing on south-facing slopes is a better indicator of drought stress in semiarid environments. A continuous increase in iWUE in both species was observed. delta C-13 variations in both species reflect the combined influence of climate and local site conditions. The interplay between climatic conditions and species behavior determines the inter-annual delta C-,C-3 patterns of oak and juniper trees. Due to its more enriched mean delta C-13 (i.e., less negative average delta C-I3) and its higher climatic sensitivity, juniper is a more suitable proxy for paleoclimatic reconstructions in northern Iran.

AB  - Migration is a behavioral strategy to access resources that change across a landscape. Animals must ultimately interpret cues to properly time movements that match changing resource quality. Many animals do this by responding primarily to indirect indicators of resource quality such as an internal biological clock or photoperiod. Others are heavily dependent on more direct indicators such as weather or plant phenology. Timing of movement also can be modified by factors specific to individuals. We used time-to-event models for Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) to investigate whether an altitudinal avian migrant was influenced by direct indicators of resource quality when timing migration, and whether timing was influenced by individual characteristics, during the spring (winter to breeding range), summer (breeding to summer range), and fall (summer to winter range) transitional seasons. Greater Sage-Grouse interpreted direct indicators of resource quality, especially temperature, when timing movements between seasonal ranges. Timing was also dependent on individual characteristics including location, reproductive status, and habitat use. After we identified which migration cues were important, we evaluated if migratory and nonmigratory individuals were experiencing similar environmental conditions, which may partly explain why there are different behaviors in a partially migrant population. For the summer and fall transitions, migratory grouse experienced more stimulatory migration cues because of differences in elevation of seasonal ranges. Migratory birds were likely avoiding more rapid plant desiccation in warmer breeding ranges and avoiding higher snow accumulation in colder summer ranges with more precipitation. Altitudinal migrants are likely to use direct indicator cues because they have great utility when migration distances are relatively short. In addition, landscapes with altitudinal migrants have sharp environmental gradients creating conditions conducive for partially migratory behavior in a population.

AB  - Knowledge of reference conditions and species-environment associations is required to ascertain ongoing aquatic biodiversity changes in Arctic regions. The objective of this study was to establish a baseline of fish community structure (species composition, incidence and relative abundance) in relation to salinity, pH and temperature gradients in an Arctic estuary, the Husky Lakes, Canada. Sampling involved an early-summer, standardized, experimental netting survey around the entire perimeter of all estuary basins and peninsulas. Detrended canonical correspondence analysis (DCCA) was used to evaluate species-environment associations. The ecosystem sustains an abundant and diverse fish community, characterized by co-dominance of coregonids and a marine schooling fish, Clupea pallasii, and high abundance of freshwater/freshwater-amphidromous species in the innermost basins. Highest richness and total abundance were related to mixing conditions, warmest temperatures, connectivity to nearby ecosystems, and diversity in species life histories. Salinity determined spatial patterns of fish species abundance and distribution. The incidence of freshwater fish was limited by the availability of low salinity habitat and potential community interactions. These fish, particularly Salvelinus namaycush and Thymallus arcticus, are considered as the most vulnerable to changes in freshwater habitat availability. The fish assemblage reflects environmental information from surrounding fluvial, freshwater, coastal marine and catchment ecosystems, and is thus a prime candidate for monitoring environmental change in the region. The results provide a benchmark against which future studies of fish communities can be compared to evaluate potential effects of climate change and anthropogenic development on fish populations from Husky Lakes and similar Arctic aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - The tetraploid (2n = 4x = 28) Sesleria caerulea and octoploid (2n = 8x = 56) S. tatrae are closely related species with very similar morphology. These species can tolerate a wide range of ecological conditions, and in areas where the two co-occur, individual plants are often hardly distinguishable and assumed to be products of hybridization. Consequently, the ecological requirements of each species and the evolutionary relationship between the two species remain unknown. The aim of this study is to determine the karyological, morphological and ecological differentiation between the two species. A total of 877 S. caerula and S. tatrae plants from 68 populations in the Western Carpathians, Alps and Sudetes mountain ranges were analysed for DNA ploidy level and subjected to morphometric examination. Moreover, phytosociological releves for each location and Ellenberg's indicator values were used as supplementary environmental variables for interpreting the results from an ecological point of view. All individuals of S. caerulea were tetraploid and all those of S. tatrae octoploid. There were no intermediate ploidy levels, which would indicate hybrids between the two species. Morphometric analyses of 28 morphological characters revealed that eight were significantly different in these two species. Of these, density of hairs between the veins on the lemma, and length of lemma, glume and palea were the most reliable diagnostic characters. Morphological dissimilarities, however, were found only at the population level and were not always useful in identification of individual plants. Important differences between the two species were also found in ecological requirements. Detected ecological differences were mostly associated with altitude, moisture, temperature, light intensity and nutrient levels, in terms of which Sesleria caerulea was most tolerant. Conversely, S. tatrae grew under a more narrow range of conditions, occurred at high altitudes and preferred high humidity, high light intensities and nutrient-rich soils. The name Sesleria tatrae is typified.

AB  - Kimmeridgian organic-rich shales of the Madbi Formation from the Marib-Shabowah Basin in western Yemen were analysed to evaluate the type of organic matter, origin and depositional environments as well as their oil-generation potential. Results of the current study establishes the organic geochemical characteristics of the Kimmeridgian organic-rich shales and identifies the kerogen type based on their organic petrographic characteristics as observed under reflected white light and blue light excitation. Kerogen microscopy shows that the Kimmeridgian organic-rich shales contain a large amount of organic matter, consisting predominantly of yellow fluorescing alginite and amorphous organic matter with marine-microfossils (e.g., dinoflagellate cysts and micro-foraminiferal linings). Terrigenous organic matters (e.g., vitrinite, spores and pollen) are also present in low quantities. The high contributions of marine organic matter with minor terrigenous organic matter are also confirmed by carbon isotopic values. The organic richness of the Kimmeridgian shales is mainly due to good preservation under suboxic to relatively anoxic conditions, as indicated by the percent of numerous pyritized fragments associated with the organic matter. The biomarker parameters obtained from mass spectrometer data on m/z 191 and m/z 217 also indicate that these organic-rich shales contain mixed organic matter that were deposited in a marine environment and preserved under suboxic to relatively anoxic conditions.
   The Kimmeridgian organic-rich shales thus have high oil and low gas-generation potential due to oil window maturities and the nature of the organic matter, with high content of hydrogen-rich Type II and mixed Type II-III kerogens with minor contributions of Type III kerogen.

AB  - Little is known about the ability of adult dragonfly individuals to survive into or over the winter in the Cape Floristic Region (CFR), a significant biodiversity hotspot in South Africa. Dragonfly species richness and abundance were recorded throughout winter and into spring in Jonkershoek Nature Reserve. Several environmental variables were also measured. Individuals of eight dragonfly species (four in the Anisoptera and four in the Zygoptera) survived into the winter as adults, even though winter conditions would seem unfavourable (wet, windy and cold) for them in this area at this time of year. Five of these species were CFR endemic or national endemic species or subspecies, illustrating local adaptation. Of the remaining three, all of which are widely distributed species in Africa, only one, Trithemis arteriosa, clearly appeared as old, overwintering adults into spring, indicating its versatility both in its adaptation to winter conditions as well as its well-known tolerance of biotope variability. This may partly explain its success as one of South Africa's most common and widespread species. Although many environmental variables were measured and correlated with species richness and abundance, it was only air temperature and associated low relative humidity that were highly positively significant. This emphasizes that the species were opportunistic during the winter and only took to the air on clear, sunny and warm winter days during the cold season. Unlike some other local studies conducted in the summer, these winter results indicated that water flow was a less important variable than that of the seemingly critical variable of temperature during this season. In addition, the importance of emergent vegetation also played a role and appears important for shelter on cool, wet, windy days which precluded flight activity.

AB  - The present experimental work is dedicated to the analysis of the effect of walking on the thermal insulation of the air layer (I (a) ) and on the convective heat transfer coefficients (h (conv) ) of the human body. Beyond the standing static posture, three step rates were considered: 20, 30 and 45 steps/min. This corresponds to walking speeds of approximately 0.23, 0.34 and 0.51 m/s, respectively. The experiments took place in a climate chamber with an articulated thermal manikin with 16 independent parts. The indoor environment was controlled through the inner wall temperatures since the objective of the tests was restricted to the influence of the walking movements under calm conditions. Five set points were selected: 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30A degrees C, and the operative temperature within the test chamber varied between 11.9 and 29.6A degrees C. The highest and lowest I (a) values obtained were equal to 0.87 and 0.71 clo, respectively, and the reduction in insulation due to walking ranged between 9.8 and 11.5%. The convective coefficients (h (conv) ) for the whole body and for the different body segments were also determined for each step rate. In the case of the whole body, for the standing static reference posture, the mean value of h (conv) was equal to 3.3 W/m(2)A degrees C and a correlation [Nu = Nu(Gr)] for natural convection is also presented in good agreement with previous results. For the other postures, the values of h (conv) were equal to 3.7, 3.9 and 4.2 W/m(2)A degrees C, respectively for 20, 30 and 45 steps/min.

AB  - Here we report a structured matrix model for wild Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) and the use of the model to predict the population-level effects of 4-nonylphenol (4-NP) using a stochastic simulation approach. In the model, the natural fecundity and mortality rates of wild medaka were considered inhibited by 4-NP, based on Weibull dose-response models estimated from a full life-cycle toxicity test. The matrix model was simulated according to three scenarios: (1) stochastic daily growth under optimal conditions, (2) stochastic annual growth under conditions of seasonal variation and (3) population dynamics over 3 years undergoing density-regulation. Accordingly, a finite population growth rate, X, was applied as an endpoint in the first and second scenarios and a quasi-extinction risk in the third scenario. The median and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 4-NP concentrations corresponding to lambda = 1 (C-lambda=1) in the first and second scenarios were 27.5 mu g/L (CI: [20.2, 33.0] mu g/L) and 17.0 mu g/L (CI: [16.0, 17.9) mu g/L), respectively. The quasi-extinction risks mounted quickly when the exposure concentration approached C lambda=1. The influence of uncertainties was analyzed, and the C-lambda=1 was found to be robust against uncertainties in both the mean and the variation of vital rates, whereas the quasi-extinction risk was moderately sensitive to the mean mortality rate. The ignorance of whether the survival of adult madaka should be considered inhibited by 4-NP or not was found to remarkably affect the population-level effects. This study demonstrates an application of C-lambda =1 in a stochastic sense as a population-level ecological risk assessment (PLERA) endpoint in chemical risk management. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The late glacial and the early Holocene sediments of the classic site Bolling So in Denmark are being reinvestigated by multiproxy analyses. We present here the record of Pediastrum species and discuss the climate-mediated changes in the aquatic ecosystem, as reflected by aquatic proxies (e.g. aquatic plants and mosses, cladocerans, ostracods, bryozoan statoblasts), as well as a number of other proxies (organic content, biogenic silica, carbonates, terrestrial plant macrofossils). Climate had warmed to such an extent at c. 12,500 C-14 yrs BP that aquatic life could begin. Productivity was low and only very scarce indication of a warmer interval predating the Allerod chronozone was found. At the beginning of the Allerod chronozone climate ameliorated and productivity clearly increased. The cool climate of the Younger Dryas chronozone (YD) was more clearly reflected in the terrestrial ecosystem than in the aquatic ecosystem, where productivity appeared to remain rather high. The lake was very shallow and non-stratified during the YD, indicating low effective moisture. Probably it warmed throughout early in the open-water season and in that way enabled higher productivity, even if summer temperatures were rather low. It is also possible that the difference in July temperatures between the late part of the Allerod chronozone and the YD was not large in central Jutland. The amelioration of climate at the beginning of the Holocene is clearly reflected in all proxies. There is also evidence that the lake level rose. The lake probably remained alkaline during all of its history but some evidence suggests that pH was somewhat lowered during the YD chronozone. Pediastrum species appear to be relatively good indicators of environmental conditions; similarly, the concentrations may reflect productivity variations during changing climatic conditions.

AB  - During the early Toarcian (Early Jurassic; -183 Ma) global environmental changes promoted the expansion of oxygen-deficient conditions across vast shelf areas around the globe. Ocean margin deoxygenation favored the preservation of organic matter in shelf sediments and is considered to reflect a Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (TOAE). Higher-level global drivers controlled temperature fluctuations, sea level evolution, oceanic circulation patterns, marine primary productivity, and stable carbon isotope excursions. Lower-level factors, controlled by individual basin bathymetry and paleogeography, operated on local to regional scale and here regulated organic matter accumulation. Accordingly, the T-OAE has been described as global event with a strong regional character. During the Toarcian, preferentially organic matter-lean sediments have been deposited at the northern Gondwana paleomargin. Enhanced connectivity to the Tethys Ocean and low marine primary productivity are considered to have been major factors preventing the formation of oxygen-deficient conditions and organic matter preservation. We here report on early Toarcian sediments from the Chaabet El Attaris Section (Tunisia), located at the northern Gondwana paleomargin that episodically became enriched in organic matter. Bio- and chemostratigraphy both confirm that organic matter-rich sediments preferentially formed during the T-OAE but also predate the T-OAE. Sedimentological and micropaleontological characterization in concert with bulk, molecular and stable isotope geochemical investigations reveal that accumulation of marine organic matter occurred under anoxic, but not under euxinic, conditions. Limitation in the supply of reactive iron regulated organic matter sulfurization indicating that during most of the depositional history the levels of free H2S in bottom waters were rather low but limited to the sediment pore water. We conclude that the chemocline was either situated within the sediment or close to the sediment water interface. Spatiotemporally-restricted occurrence of organic matter enriched sediments and anoxic pore waters was promoted by restriction in water column ventilation in a local graben structure.

AB  - Peatland wildfires, especially in tropical ecosystems, are often caused by drought, and lead to smoke and other related problems in all aspects of community life in Indonesia, especially in Central Kalimantan. Drought is worsened by the number of dry days in the dry season, known as the El Nino phenomenon, and the drainage system in a peatland. Additionally, drought decreases the water table and increases the probability of occurrence of wildfires in peatland areas. This study aims to modify the numerical formula of the drought factor (DFt) in the Keetch-Byram drought index (KBDI) based on tropical peatland wildfire conditions in Central Kalimantan during the El Nino phenomenon in 2015. Furthermore, it applies a revised peatland water table reference of 400 mm below the ground surface, based on previous research and the Government regulation on peatland ecosystem protection and management in Indonesia. These El Nino conditions caused a rain decline of approximately 35% in Block A, Ex-Mega Rice Project, Mantangai sub-District, Kapuas District, Central Kalimantan Province. The modified KBDI is compared with the Number of Fire Alerts (NFA) using NASA's Active Fire Data in 2015. The analysis results demonstrate that the modified DFt under tropical peatland conditions leads to an increase in the drought index value, beginning on the driest days between July and November 2015. The value of the KBDI drought index increases from the high to the extreme index from September to November 2015, when as many as 61 extreme drought indices became indicators for peatland wildfire risk assessment. The extreme KBDI is directly proportional to the NFA recorded during 2015, and the highest number of fire alerts is observed for October 2015, with 1746 fire alerts within 31 days and extreme drought indices from 27 days. Hence, this modified formula is suitable for wildfire conditions on this peatland in Central Kalimantan. Overall, the modified DFt can be successfully applied to the El Nino phenomenon in 2015.

AB  - The increase of salt concentrations in influent wastewaters will be a consequence of the sea level rises in coastal areas due to climate change and the future use of seawater to flush toilets as a cost-attractive option for alternative water resources. Yet, little is known about the salinity effect on full-scale wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) performance and on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, such as nitrous oxide (N2O). This study aimed at quantifying the N2O emissions of a full-scale biological aerated filter (BAF) and to correlate the dynamic behavior of the emissions with the process conditions and the periods of infiltration of seawater. A full-scale BAF was monitored for 3 months to assess both their gaseous and liquid N2O fluxes. The total average daily N2O emissions of the plant were 6.16 g N-N2O/kg of NH4-N removed. For the first time at full-scale, a correlation between the N2O emissions and the wastewater influent conductivity (salinity) was found, in which the increase in seawater infiltration in the sewer at high tide augments the daily N2O production and emission to 13.78 g N-N2O/kg of NH4-N removed. The proportional increase in influent conductivity and the N2O emission factor in this WWTP suggested that periods of high conductivity could serve as an indicator of increased N2O emissions by the plant. Furthermore, the operational conditions and the wastewater influent characteristics that influence the N2O emissions were identified as being the dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics due to the filter washing steps, leading to rapid transitions from oxic to sub-oxic conditions, as well as the (re-)adaptation of microbial consortia due to the dynamics of the biofilm thickness associated to the daily washing process. This study shows the impact that the washing process and seawater infiltration has on the N2O emissions of a BAF and contributes to a better understanding of the operational conditions impacting the emissions in WWTPs.

AB  - Understanding how non-invasive indicators of diet quality, such as faecal nitrogen (FN), relate to population performance is a valuable asset when assessing the management of wild ungulates. However, the relationships between FN and protein intake may depend on the ingestion of less palatable plants containing high quantities of tannin (which is known to reduce degradable proteins) and management schemes (such as supplemental feeding). In order to describe the factors and potential use of FN as an indicator of diet quality, we selected a range of red deer (Cervus elaphus) densities in Mediterranean habitats in South Central Spain, which were classified under different management regimens (with and without food supply). We specifically aimed to (i) identify the main population (management, density) and diet quality factors related to FN levels, (ii) assess the relationship between individual performance (body condition measured as kidney fat index, KFI) and FN and (iii) provide evidence of the modulating role that management may play in this relationship. FN was positively associated with the faecal tannin concentration and the density of deer. Interestingly, a positive correlation was observed between FN and nitrogen in plants on hunting estates with a supplemental food supply, whereas this relationship was not evident in the absence of supplemental feeding. Moreover, KFI was negatively associated with FN, and this negative association was more marked in the presence of supplemental feeding. This study exemplifies that caution is necessary when the interpretation of individual FN values is used to monitor the performance of red deer populations, particularly in high density contexts with a reduced quality of forage, and when supplemental food is provided. However, when FN is interpreted in concomitance with body condition, population parameters and diet quality, it has been proved to be a potentially simple, cost-effective and reliable indicator of biological performance and diet quality.

AB  - Airborne transmission is a recognized pathway of contagion; however, it is rarely quantitatively evaluated. The numerous outbreaks that have occurred during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are putting a demand on researchers to develop approaches capable of both predicting contagion in closed environments (predictive assessment) and analyzing previous infections (retrospective assessment).
   This study presents a novel approach for quantitative assessment of the individual infection risk of susceptible subjects exposed in indoor microenvironments in the presence of an asymptomatic infected SARS-CoV-2 subject. The application of a Monte Carlo method allowed the risk for an exposed healthy subject to be evaluated or, starting from an acceptable risk, the maximum exposure time. We applied the proposed approach to four distinct scenarios for a prospective assessment, highlighting that, in order to guarantee an acceptable risk of 10 3 for exposed subjects in naturally ventilated indoor environments, the exposure time could be well below one hour. Such maximum exposure time clearly depends on the viral load emission of the infected subject and on the exposure conditions; thus, longer exposure times were estimated for mechanically ventilated indoor environments and lower viral load emissions. The proposed approach was used for retrospective assessment of documented outbreaks in a restaurant in Guangzhou (China) and at a choir rehearsal in Mount Vernon (USA), showing that, in both cases, the high attack rate values can be justified only assuming the airborne transmission as the main route of contagion. Moreover, we show that such outbreaks are not caused by the rare presence of a superspreader, but can be likely explained by the co-existence of conditions, including emission and exposure parameters, leading to a highly probable event, which can be defined as a "superspreading event".

AB  - The article is devoted to the results of the micronucleus test in two well-known autochthonous sheep breeds of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Kazakhstan: Romanov and Edilbay. In Romanov sheep, the highest rates of micronucleus occurrence were found in lambs (8.7 +/- 0.9 parts per thousand), than in producing rams (5.6 +/- 0.03 parts per thousand) and ewes (4.8 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand). The Edilbay breed has the differences in micronucleus test results in erythrocytes are most pronounced between two intrabreed types: "Birlik" and "Suyunduk". The breeding plant "Birlik" is located in the Ural, the West Kazakhstan region. "Suyunduk" type of Edilbay breed sheep are raised in the breeding plant "Makash" in the Atyrauz region of the Republic of Kazakhstan, located near the Azgir nuclear test site. The difference in the micronucleus test is due to the fact that sheep of the "Suyunduk" type are exposed to environmental stress factors due to the proximity of places with high levels of radionuclide contamination. The constant action of natural selection contributes to the reproduction of animals with increased resistance to environmental stress factors. This explains the low occurrence of cells with cytogenetic abnormalities in sheep of the "Suyunduk" Edilbay breed sheep type. This type has a higher potential for adaptation to adverse breeding conditions than the Birlik type of Edilbay breed sheep. The high level of micronucleus test indicators in sheep of the Romanov breed is associated with the peculiarities of gender and age groups, and also the environmental stress of climatic conditions in Central Russia. A classification of micronucleus is proposed. It is believed that large and medium-sized micronucleus are formed by the action of various mutagens on the body, causing a large in the division of individual chromosomes in metaphase and anaphase. Small micronucleuses indicate a decrease in potential cell viability.

AB  - Environmental conditions in wetlands facilitate favorable biogeochemical conditions for the conversion of inorganic mercury into methylmercury. For this reason, wetlands are increasingly classified as mercury hotspots, places where biota exhibit elevated mercury concentrations. While it is clear that wetlands play an important role in methylmercury production, factors such as geographic variation in mercury deposition, wetland type, and trophic dynamics can cause variation in mercury dynamics and bioaccumulation in biota occupying wetlands or connected to wetland trophic systems. Here, we use songbirds as bioindicators in a two-pronged approach aimed at evaluating the state of our understanding of mercury bioaccumulation by songbirds in wetland ecosystems. First, we use a case study in southeast Missouri to compare blood mercury concentrations in tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) and eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) occupying wetland and non-wetland habitats to test the hypothesis that songbirds in wetlands will have higher mercury bioaccumulation than those in non-wetlands. Adult tree swallows in wetlands had significantly higher blood mercury concentrations than those in non-wetlands; however, no difference between ecosystems was detected in eastern bluebirds. Second, we present a review of the current literature on mercury in songbirds in wetland ecosystems across North America. Mercury concentrations in songbirds varied among wetland types and with geographic location, often in an unpredictable manner. Mercury concentrations in songbird blood varied 3-10 fold at locations separated only by similar to 10 to several hundred kilometers. This magnitude of difference in blood mercury concentrations among wetlands exceeds documented differences between wetland and non-wetland ecosystems. Therefore, we caution against the automatic assumption that songbirds occupying wetlands will have higher mercury bioaccumulation than conspecifics living in other habitats.

AB  - Small-scale fisheries are in decline, negatively impacting sources of food and employment for coastal communities. Therefore, we need to assess how biological and socio-economic conditions influence vulnerability, or a community's susceptibility to loss and consequent ability to adapt. We characterized two Philippine fishing communities, Gulod and Buagsong with similar seagrass and fish species composition, and compared their social vulnerability, or pre-existing conditions likely to influence their response to changes in the fishing resource. Using a place-based model of vulnerability, we used household, fisher, landing and underwater surveys to compare their sensitivity and adaptive capacity.
   Depending on the scale assessed, each community and group within the community differed in their social vulnerability. The Buagsong community was less socially vulnerable, or less sensitive to pertubations to the seagrass resource because it was closer to a major urban center that provided salaried income. When we assessed seagrass fishers as a group within each community, we found that Gulod fishers had greater adaptive capacity than Buagsong fishers because they diversified their catch, gear types, and income sources. We found catch that comprised the greatest landing biomass did not have the highest market value, and fishers continued to capture high value items at low biomass levels. A third of intertidal gleaners were women, and their participation in the fishery enhanced household adaptive capacity by providing additional food and income, in an otherwise male dominated fishery.
   Our research Indicates that community context is not the only determinant of social vulnerability, because groups within the community may decrease their sensitivity, enhance their adaptive capabilities, and ultimately reduce social vulnerability by diversifying income sources, seagrass based catches, and workforces to include women.

AB  - Recent studies of eurypterid paleoecology suggest that formation of eurypterid Lagerstatten in the mid-Paleozoic of Laurentia was controlled by the presence of an ecological-taphonomic window that recurred predictably in nearshore, marginal environments during transgressions. We tested this hypothesis by performing a high-resolution taxonomic, environmental, and stratigraphic survey and quantitative analysis of all Silurian-Lower Devonian eurypterid-bearing intervals in the Appalachian basin, the most prolific region for eurypterid remains in the world. Canonical correspondence analysis of sedimentological and faunal associations revealed a strong lithologic gradient between groupings of eurypterid genera and associated taxa across the basin, and a significant association of eurypterids with microbialites (thrombolites, stromatolites) and evaporitic structures. Field observations confirmed that, stratigraphically, eurypterids in the basin frequently occur above the microbialite structures and beneath evaporites and other indicators of increased salinity or subaerial exposure. Following interpretation of these features within a sequence stratigraphic framework, we present a preservational model in which (1) eurypterids inhabited nearshore settings following freshening conditions concomitant with minor transgressions, (2) their remains were subsequently buried by storms or microbialite sediment baffling, and (3) subsequent long-term preservation of tissues was facilitated by regression and cyclical shallowing-up successions that promoted hypersalinity and anoxia. In the central and southern region of the basin, where microbial structures and evidence for hypersalinity are less common, a similar pattern of cyclical shallowing-upward deposition within eurypterid-bearing units holds. Thus, eurypterid preservation appears to reflect a combination of ecological preferences and abiotic conditions that promoted inhabitation and eventual preservation within the same setting. This study provides the first quantitative support for a sea level-based control on preservation of eurypterids and adds to the growing body of evidence that suggests that analysis of exceptional preservation in the fossil record benefits from interpretation within a sequence stratigraphic framework.

AB  - Deviance partitioning can provide new insights into the ecology of host-parasite interactions. We studied the host-related factors influencing parasite prevalence, abundance, and species richness in European brown hares (Lepus europaeus) from northern Spain. We defined three groups of explanatory variables: host environment, host population, and individual factors. We hypothesised that parasite infection rates and species richness were determined by different host-related factors depending on the nature of the parasite (endo- or ectoparasite, direct or indirect life cycle). To assess the relative importance of these components, we used deviance partitioning, an innovative approach. The explained deviance (ED) was higher for parasite abundance models, followed by those of prevalence and then by species richness, suggesting that parasite abundance models may best describe the host factors influencing parasitization. Models for parasites with a direct life cycle yielded higher ED values than those for indirect life cycle ones. As a general trend, host individual factors explained the largest proportion of the ED, followed by host environmental factors and, finally, the interaction between host environmental and individual factors. Similar hierarchies were found for parasite prevalence, abundance, and species richness. Individual factors comprised the most relevant group of explanatory variables for both types of parasites. However, host environmental factors were also relevant in models for indirect life-cycle parasites. These findings are consistent with the idea of the host as the main habitat of the parasite; whereas, for indirect life-cycle parasites, transmission would be also modulated by environmental conditions. We suggest that parasitization can be used not only as an indicator of individual fitness but also as an indicator of environmental quality for the host. This research underlines the importance of monitoring parasite rates together with environmental, population, and host factors.

AB  - This study concerns post-cultural dynamics in the semi-arid South-West of Madagascar (Analabo area, near the Mikea Forest). A synchronic comparison was performed on a set of abandoned fields plots aged from 2 to 30 years and on forest and savanna reference ecosystems, located on cambic arenosols developed from same Quaternary dune sands. The studied parameters concerned mainly a few physical and chemical soil properties (density, permeability, compaction, texture, C, N, K, P content). Important changes occur in the post-cultural succession: an increase of the soil density and compaction, and decrease of the soil upper layer permeability. Consequently, slash and burn cultivation leads to a packing and an induration of the soil surface. Results about edaphic indicators have shown that the physical parameters used better discriminate various stages of evolution than the chemical parameters do. The multivariate analysis of soil indicators shows that vegetative succession over 30 years in a forest ecosystem cleared, burnt, cultivated and left, does not lead to features corresponding to a closed-canopy forest but rather to those of a tree savanna with open, mixed woody-herbaceous vegetation. The primary dense dry deciduous regeneration of the primary forest is very low or nil. In the semi-arid SW Madagascar (Analabo region), post-cultural dynamics conditions consists in a savanna-formation process, controlled by: (1) the intensity and duration of the disturbance (during the cultivation phase); and (2) the more drastic environmental conditions (including both climate and soil).

AB  - Phytoplankton biomass, as chlorophyll (Chl) a, and net ecosystem production (NEP), were modeled using artificial neural networks (ANNs). Chl a varied seasonally and along a saline gradient throughout the Neuse River (North Carolina). NEP was extremely dynamic in the Trout River (Florida), with phototrophic or heterotrophic conditions occurring over short-term intervals. Physical and chemical variables, arising from meteorological and hydrological conditions, created spatial and/or temporal gradients in both systems and served as interacting predictors for the trends/patterns of Chi a and NEP. ANNs outperformed comparable linear regression models and reliably modeled Chi a concentrations less than 20 mu g L-1 and NEP values, denoting the apparent non-linear interactions among abiotic and indicator variables. ANNs underestimated Chi a concentrations greater than 20 mu g L-1, likely due to the periodicity of data acquisition not being sufficient to generalize system variability, the designated 'lag' effect for variables not being adequate to portray estuarine flow dynamics, the exclusion of (one or more) variables that would have improved prediction, and/or an unrealistic expectation of network performance. Variables indicative of meteorological and hydrological forcing and/or proxy measurements of phytoplankton had the greatest relative impact on prediction of Chl a and NEP. Except for their predictive capability, ANNs might appear to be of limited value for ecological applications and problem solving; interpreting the absolute impact of and/or interacting relationships among network variables is intrinsically difficult. Statistical methods or 'rule extraction' algorithms that convey comprehensible network interpretation are needed prior to the routine use of ANNs in programs assessing and/or forecasting the response of biotic indicators to perturbation or for a means to discern estuarine function.

AB  - This article estimates the minimum energy consumption index in a single story protected farm which would suggest the condition of minimum energy consumption or loss condition. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP), weighted sum method (WSM) and weighted product method (WPM) are used for relative ranking of four energy consumption indicators viz., water pumping, light supplement, CO2 balancing and cooling-heating under three criteria viz., cropping area, daily crop water, and indoor environment. The minimum, maximum and average energy consumption index was predicted by the bacteria foraging optimization (BFO) algorithm and the group method of data handling (GMDH). The minimum energy consumption index (1.4174) predicted by the BFO algorithm gives higher prediction compared energy consumption index (1.114) predicted by the GMDH algorithm.

KW  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Population dynamics, density, and aggregation size of tuberoid orchids have been identified based on mapping, electronic maps constructed with "point processes," and Ripley function and pair-correlation function. Discrete and discrete-continuous types of spatial structure dominate in populations in optimal ecological conditions. The bounded aggregations of levels I (radius 0.45-0.75 m) and II (radius 1.2-2.5 m) are formed at 3 to 7.5 m(2). The spatial pattern depends on generative specimens which are related with the "group effect." The microloci have full ontogenetic structure and may be regarded as elemental populations. They form larger aggregations of levels III and IV with random spatial distribution and continuous bounds. Aggregations of higher level are not formed under worse ecological conditions. Random spatial distribution and incomplete ontogenetic spectrum of microloci are indicators of critical population status.

AB  - Lacustrine stromatolites were widespread in the Miocene Wudaoliang Group (stromatolites of the Wudaoliang Group), northern Tibetan Plateau; but only at one location nearby the Wudaoliang Town, they occurred intensively in thick, laterally traceable beds (Wudaoliang stromatolites). Although deposited in lacustrine environment, the lack of fossils in these rocks hampers determining whether the stromatolites formed in freshwater or saline conditions. To address this problem, and in an attempt to identify criteria to distinguish differences of freshwater and saline conditions, we studied the laminae microfabrics, stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios, rare earth element patterns and biomarkers of the stromatolites. These stromatolites can be divided into fenestral stromatolites and agglutinated stromatolites. The fabric of fenestral stromatolites is formed by microcrystalline carbonate enclosing spar-cemented, angular crystal traces. Essentially, this fabric is interpreted as pseudomorph after former formed evaporite crystals. Faecal pellets identical to that of the present-day brine shrimp Artemia, lack of other eukaryotic fossils, and stable isotopic signals point to a shallow, evaporation-dominated hypersaline lake setting. Covariation of carbon and oxygen isotopes indicates hydrologically closed conditions of the Miocene lake on northern Tibetan Plateau.
   However, if compared to other lacustrine carbonates of the Wudaoliang Group, the high delta C-13 values of the investigated Wudaoliang stromatolites reveal an additional photosynthetic effect during the deposition of the stromatolites. Furthermore, although no direct evidence is available from field observations and microfabrics, a positive europium anomaly of Wudaoliang stromatolites indicates that a palaeo-hydrothermal inflow system had existed in the outcrop area. These new results favour a hypersaline lake setting subject to hot spring inflow for the Wudaoliang stromatolites, in contrast to earlier interpretations suggesting a freshwater lake setting (e.g. Yi et al., Journal of Mineralogy and Petrology 28: 106-113, 2008; Zeng et al., Journal of Mineralogy and Petrology 31: 111-119, 2011). This approach may be appropriate for other lacustrine, unfossiliferous microbialites in settings where the environmental conditions are difficult to determine.

AB  - Canopy temperature (T-c) can be a robust indicator of grapevine water status. However, the assessment of T-c by thermography in field conditions requires optimization, especially under variable environmental conditions (daily and seasonal) just like it occurs in Mediterranean areas. Besides, simplicity and robustness should be the basis of a wider use of thermography in field conditions. Therefore the comparison of simpler and more complex approaches in terms of thermal indicators is wise to test. Our major aims were: i) to assess the performance of four common thermal indicators (canopy temperature T-c, Crop Water Stress Index - CWSI, index of relative stomatal conductance - I-G, and the difference between T-c and the surrounding air - Delta T-onopy_air) to support irrigation decisions ii) to optimize the timing of thermal measurements for different genotypes and iii) to obtain mathematical functions to estimate leaf gas exchange parameters on the basis of thermal data. The trial was conducted in the summer of 2013, in south Portugal. Two V. vinifera red varieties, Touriga Nacional and Aragonez (syn. Tempranillo) were tested. Vines were subjected to two irrigation regimes: i) sustained-deficit irrigation (based on the farm's schedule control) and ii) regulated-deficit irrigation (similar to 50% of the control). We found that measurements done between 11:00 and 17:00 h provide the most significant correlations between T-c, CWSI and IG and leaf stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis for both genotypes. Different linear mathematical functions were obtained to estimate leaf gas exchange based on the best performing thermal indicators under field conditions. Our results emphasize the value of T-c as a relevant explanatory variable of vine's physiological status, in spite of being a simpler and non-normalized thermal indicator. The potential relevance of T-c for grapevine modelling and phenotyping is also discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The problems of rural regions include globally uneven power relations and development patterns, and rapid and uncertain exogenous threats. At the same time, economic and social restructuring involving devolved planning responsibilities, privatised resource rights, and networked management approaches have undermined previous scholarly and policy assumptions about the character of rural regions. We already know that local and regional institutions play a critical role in ensuring the resilience and resourcefulness of rural regions in the face of such challenges. We do not yet understand why some rural regions are resourceful while others strain or even paralyse under conditions of inequity, complexity, uncertainty, and unpredictability. This paper seeks to identify the operational elements of effective regional governance, based on the premise that measuring and monitoring the potential for regional governance enables an assessment of the capacity of regional institutions to cope with the diversity of problems that may arise. A regional governance index is proposed. Four indicators of regional governance are identified, enabling measurement of (1) engagement in regional networks; (2) diversity and synergies across the instrument mix; (3) robustness and adaptability in instrument design; and (4) broader fiscal, administrative and democratic support. These indicators are tested using a case analysis of two rural regions in the USA and Australia. The test reveals the higher level of regional institutional potential in one of the regions, and highlights the critical function of regional network engagement and broader enabling fiscal, administrative and democratic preconditions in this region. The role of the state in organizing the conditions for these is shown to be vital. These findings are of use to particular regions concerned with enhancing their institutional performance, and can also assist government agencies and nonprofits to prioritise their investment and intervention in rural regions. Further development of systematic work in this domain needs to focus on the role and tools of the state, and other 'metagovernors', in organizing both the conditions for regional network engagement, and the broader enabling fiscal, administrative and democratic pre-conditions.

AB  - Patient-reported outcome (PRO) refers to measures that emphasize the subjective view of patients about their health-related conditions and behaviors. Typically, PROs include self-report questionnaires and clinical interviews. Defining PROs for borderline personality disorder (BPD) is particularly challenging given the disorder's high symptomatic heterogeneity, high comorbidity with other psychiatric conditions, highly fluctuating symptoms, weak correlations between symptoms and functional outcomes, and lack of valid and reliable experimental measures to complement self-report data. Here, we provide an overview of currently used BPD outcome measures and discuss them from clinical, psychometric, experimental, and patient perspectives. In addition, we review the most promising leads to improve BPD PROs, including the DSM-5 Section III, the Recovery Approach, Ecological Momentary Assessments, and novel experimental measures of social functioning that are associated with functional and social outcomes.

AB  - The sustainability of regional rural development depends on the integrated status and the coordination between rural resources-environment conditions and rural socioeconomic development. In this paper a diagnostic indicator system is proposed to appraise four representative rural development models such as Mentougou model, Taicang model, Yueqing model and Qionghai model in the eastern coastal region of China from the integrated perspective of population, resources, environment, and development. In conclusion, the formation and evolution of these diverse rural development models are the direct response to the very different characteristics in the environment, market demand, and regional culture. These models are common in that their sustainability depends on the scientific guidance of the regional development functional positioning, strong intra-regional interactions, and self-adaptability to the external conditions.

KW  - VOLATILIZATION
AB  - Evaluation of the potential exposure of bystanders and residents to pesticide vapour emitted from treated agricultural fields is an important component of risk assessment in the pesticide approval process. The information available for the development of a revised exposure assessment is reviewed and a new methodology proposed. Dispersion of vapours downwind of the treated field can be successfully modelled using commercially-available software, although there is no agreed method for predicting the emission of pesticide vapours from a treated field. The proposed exposure assessment model separates the emission of pesticide vapour from its downwind dispersion, allowing the latter to be tailored to UK conditions by using representative meteorological data. More work is needed to develop an appropriate model of emissions that can take into account environmental conditions and physico-chemical properties of the formulation. (C) 2010 IAgrE.

AB  - Hazard analysis techniques have been around for many years, and have proven effective in the prevention of incidents and no doubt the saving of lives. Process hazard analysis (PHA) is now fairly robust and regulated, focused on overarching risks associated with the safe handling of hazardous materials and approaches to engineer-out such risks. Occupational hazard analysis (OHA) is keenly focused on human activity, and personal protection in hazardous working conditions. Both approaches are critical - but are often carried out separately, by different parts of an organization, which could result in an incomplete picture of the full set of operational risks in the field. Developing a holistic picture of both past and present dangers calls for a deep exploration of evidence. HAZOPs, PHA's, incident records and investigations provide expert analysis of hazards and mitigating strategies. Near-miss reports and safety observations add a large amount of information as well; the reporting frequency of these "leading indicators" can be both a blessing and a curse, as time and available resources constrain the ability to analyze and detect hazard signals within. As important as analyzing the historical record is for lessons learned, the more recent observations could indicate new hazards or highlight concerning trends. These could feed valuable "real time" information back to operations and maintenance teams to improve risk assessments and task planning. Enter artificial intelligence (AI) as a means to analyze the large amount of written hazard analyses, reports and observations to quickly extract insights around hazardous conditions, activities, incident causes and risk mitigation measures. Trained to understand concepts and contexts in both process and personal safety, AI can provide a natural-language information exploration environment for scanning thousands of documents in seconds and present common themes and related records. Not unlike us humans, AI learns from the past, informs the present and can help reduce risks in the future.

AB  - Understanding how natural and human-induced drivers will contribute to rising vulnerability and risks in coastal areas requires a broader use of future projections capturing the spatio-temporal dynamics which drive changes in the different vulnerability dimensions, including the solo-demographic and economic spheres.
   To go beyond the traditional approaches for coastal vulnerability appraisal, a Multi-dimensional Coastal Vulnerability Index (MDim-CVI) - integrating a composite set of physical, environmental and socio-economic indicators - is proposed to rank Italian coastal provinces according to their relative vulnerability to extreme sea level scenarios, in 2050. Specifically, information on hazard-prone areas, potentially inundated by sea level rise and extreme water levels (under the RCP8.5 climate scenario) is combined with indicators of geomorphic vulnerability (e.g. elevation, distance from coastline, shoreline evolution trend) exposure, and adaptive capacity (e.g. sensible segments of the population, GDP, land use patterns). The methodology is applied to a reference timeframe, representing current climate and land use condition, and a future scenario for the year 2050, integrating both climate projections and data simulating potential evolution of the environmental and socio-economic systems.
   Results show that most vulnerable provinces are located in the North Adriatic, the Gargano area and other Southern parts of Italy, mostly due to the very high vulnerability scores reported by climate-related indicators (e.g. extreme sea level). The number of vulnerable provinces as well as the magnitude of vulnerability is expected to increase in the future due to the worsening of climate, environmental, and socio-economic conditions (e.g. land use variations and increase of the elderly population). These outcomes can timely inform integrated coastal zone management and support climate adaptation planning. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the effects of soil depth on fine root biomass (FRB) and production (FRP), and determine the relationship between FRP and net primary production (NPP) across two root diameter classes (<1 and 1-2 mm) in Pinus densiflora and Quercus serrata forests. FRB and FRP were investigated from April 2016 to March 2017 using the soil sequential coring and ingrowth core methods. In P densiflora and Q. serrata forests, mean FRB < 1 mm (2.22 +/- 0.23 and 2.63 +/- 0.23 Mg ha(-1)) and annual FRP < 1 mm (0.97 +/- 0.09 and 1.55 +/- 0.16 Mg ha(-1)year(-1)) were higher than mean FRB 1-2 mm (0.63 +/- 0.12 and 1.72 +/- 0.38 Mg ha(-1)) and annual FRP 1-2 mm (0.26 +/- 0.14 and 0.20 +/- 0.06 Mg ha(-1)year(-1)) at 0-30 cm depth. Soil properties, such as soil moisture, organic matter, and inorganic nitrogen, decreased with soil depth (0-30 cm). The gradient of soil properties corresponding with soil depth could directly and indirectly influence FRP <1 mm, resulting in higher FRB <1 mm and FRP <1 mm at topsoil (0-10 cm). Additionally, only FRP <1 mm showed significant relationships with NPP and litter production. Although very fine roots (<1 mm in diameter) occupied a small percentage of NPP (7.5%), they may be an important factor for predicting forest NPP, since NPP would be regulated by the capability of roots to absorb water and nutrients. Our findings indicate that finer roots are more sensitive to soil conditions than thicker roots, and they could he a forest productivity indicator.

AB  - The present study investigated the spatiotemporal distributions of meiofauna and corresponding environmental variables in two different subtidal environments. The two habitats represent unique geographical localities; (1) Jinhae Bay for semi-enclosed industrial bay (under anthropogenic pressure) and (2) Samcheok coast for open sea area (rather in natural condition) in Korea. Biotic and abiotic data were seasonally collected from six monitoring stations in each area for 3 years (2013-16) at two study areas and all the data were comparatively analyzed. First, abiotic data such as sediment properties and water quality parameters showed significant variations in time (season/year) and space (site/area) cross the study areas and within sites in each area. Second, meiofauna assemblages, such as number of taxa, abundance, and composition, greatly varied between seasons and localities, reflecting (in)direct association(s) to local activities and/or environmental gradients. Of note, the Jinhae Bay community was directly influenced by a hypoxia during summer season. In general, the site-specific variations rather prevailed masking seasonal fluctuations, indicating significance of both oceanographic settings and terrestrial land use activities. Among the environmental parameters measured, sediment grain size appeared to be the key factor in determining the meiofaunal assemblages and distributions, particularly under natural condition shown at Samcheok. Altogether, clear separations in meiofaunal community cross sites (inner vs. outer stations) and areas (enclosed industrial bay vs. open sea) implied anthropogenic pressures and certain impacted boundaries. In addition, association of benthic communities to anthropogenic environments seemed to prevail in macrofaunal community, being simultaneously influenced by abiotic seasonal fluctuations. Overall, two contrasting nearshore habitats exhibited typical spatiotemporal distributions of subtidal benthic communities being collectively influenced by anthropogenic stresses and site-specific environmental gradients.

AB  - For the study of soil erosion it is important to set up the experiments well. In the experimental design one of the key factors is the choice of the measurement device. This is especially important when one part of the erosion process needs to be isolated, such as for splash erosion. Therefore, the main aim of this research is to list the general characteristics of the commonly used splash erosion devices and to discuss the performance, to be able to relate them, and make suggestions regarding their use. The devices we selected for this comparative comparison were: the splash cup, funnel, Morgan tray, Tubingen cup, tower, and the gutter. The devices were tested under the same conditions (rainfall characteristics, slope, and soil type) to assess their hydrological response under different intensities of simulated rainfall. All devices were installed on a sloping plot (10 degrees) with sandy soil, and were exposed to 10 min. of simulated rain with intensities ranging from 60 to 172 mm/h to measure the splashed sediment, and to describe problems and differences among them. The results showed that the Tubingen cup was the best performing device to measure kinetic energy of the rain, but, because of its design, it is not possible to measure the detached splashed sediment under natural (field) conditions. On the other hand, the funnel device showed a significant relation with rain intensity because it loses little sediment to washing. In addition, the device is easy to use and cheap. Therefore, this device is highly recommended to estimated splash erosion. to the good performance measuring the actual splash erosion, because it loses little sediment by washing. The device is also cheap and easy to install and manage.

AB  - High resolution organic petrological analysis has been carried out on core samples of the Posidonia Shale from four wells, two located in northwestern Germany (Lower Saxony Basin) and two in the western Netherlands (West Netherlands Basin). The organo-mineral microfacies defined by maceral composition and associated mineral matter show a wide range of variations related to the proportions of individual liptinite macerals of marine origin and of terrestrial macerals (macerals of vitrinite, inertinite groups and sporinite). Variations in organo-mineral microfacies, in which the organic components are sensitive to paleoenvironmental changes, are considered as a potential indicator of changes in depositional conditions.
   Sedimentation of organic matter is controlled by several factors, the most important in the marine environment being primary biomass productivity and influx of transported terrestrial organic matter, biological degradation related to bacterial activity, and the oxygen content of the bottom water. The level of degradation in organic-rich sediments is mainly related to oxygen availability which, in turn, influences the diversity of algae and the quality and quantity of the preserved organic matter. These two factors can be directly linked to maceral preservation and the organo-mineral microfacies. In order to evaluate the relationships between different types of organic matter and paleoenvironmental conditions, two indices, the oxidation index and the degradation index have been proposed. These indices illustrate the transition from highly degraded to well preserved macerals, provide information on the types of organic matter, and permit recognition of precursors for degraded amorphous organic matter (AGM). Use of these indices not only enables determination of the organo-mineral microfacies, but also sheds light on the AOM precursors in the Posidonia Shale. Information derived from the indices can also be used to reconstruct the paleoenvironments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The causes of the greatest mass extinction in Earth's history, in the latest Permian, remain actively debated. Here we use Se isotopes and abundances in marine sediments froman outer-shelf environment to test one of the most common hypotheses for the collapse of the biosphere, i.e. widespread euxinia in the open ocean. Our data show a small positive excursion in delta Se-82/78 prior to the extinction, consistent with local euxinia. However, this is followed by a significant negative excursion with a minimum of -1.8 parts per thousand (relative to NIST SRM3149), immediately preceding the principal extinction horizon. A net fractionation of this magnitude likely resulted from partial reduction of Se oxyanions dissolved in the water column. Due to their low abundance, Se oxyanions are rapidly scavenged in anoxic basins or regions of high biological productivity with little net isotopic fractionation. We therefore interpret the uniquely negative fractionations in this section as an indicator for relatively oxygenated conditions in this marine basin at the time when biological productivity declined. The offset between the peak excursion and the major extinction horizon possibly reflects a slow-down in ocean circulation leading to nutrient limitation, which may thus have prohibited a rapid recovery of the local biosphere in the early Triassic. Although we are unable to extrapolate to the global ocean due to the short residence time of Se in seawater, our data are consistent with the newly emerging view that euxinia developed along ocean margins and in oxygen minimum zones before the extinction, but was probably replaced by (sub-) oxic conditions during the similar to 1 kyr peak productivity decline and was thus not solely responsible for the extinction event.

AB  - Semiarid Mediterranean areas patchily forested with Pinus halepensis Mill. are often affected by urbanisation plans, which influence the conservation of biodiversity in the remaining fragments. We assessed forest biodiversity in eleven Pinus halepensis patches of the municipality of Murcia (SE Spain), on the basis of the abundance, richness and conservation value of birds and woody flora. Under the hypothesis that biodiversity is conditioned by pine density, modulated by other patch features (age, physical substrate, surrounding land uses), mixed regression models were used to relate biodiversity indicators with environmental gradients, detected through principal component analyses (PCAs) performed on three sets of variables: landscape (L); habitat structure (H); and, stand development (S). PCA-L related patch size and connectivity to the abundance of typical woodland birds and to floral and bird species richness. PCA-H related shrub cover associated with Sylvia melanocephala Gmelin., to rock and dry grassland cover, a feature of moderately disturbed areas preferred by Lanius senator L. PCA-S associated taller trees and better physical conditions with canopy dwelling and soil probing bird species, respectively. The bird or plant conservation value of patches did not generally match their protection status, which was confirmed by the analysis of a larger sample of 36 natural patches. A negative relationship between floristic value and pine density suggests that reducing the density of reforestations can lead to more diverse and self-sustaining wooded formations. In contrast, conservation value for birds did not decrease with reforestation, stressing the need to use ornithological and floristic indexes as complementary assessment tools. The results seem useful for building a municipal network of reserves connecting higher status protected areas. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soil microorganisms are critical to carbon and nutrient fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems. Understanding the annual pattern of soil microbial community structure and how it corresponds to soil nutrient availability and plant production is a fundamental first step towards being able to predict impacts of environmental change on ecosystem functioning. We investigated the composition, structure and nutrient stoichiometry of the soil microbial community in mesic arctic tundra on 9 sample dates in 6 months from winter to fall using phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), epifluorescent microscopy and chloroform-fumigation-extraction (CFE). PLFA analysis indicates that the winter microbial community was fungal-dominated, cold-adapted and associated with high C, N and P in the soil solution and microbial biomass. The microscopy data suggest that both bacteria and fungi were active and growing in soils between -5 degrees C and 0 degrees C. A significant shift occurred in the PLFA data, qPCR patterns, microscopy and microbial biogeochemistiy after the thaw period, resulting in a distinct community that persisted through our spring, summer and fall sample dates, despite large changes in plant productivity. This shift was characterised by increasing relative abundances of certain bacteria (especially Gram +ves) as well as a decline in fungal biomass, and corresponded with decreasing C, N and P in the soil solution. The summer period of low substrate availability (plant-microbe competition) was associated with microbial indicators of nutritional stress. Overall, our results indicate that tundra microbial communities are clearly differentiated according to the changes in soil nutrient status and environmental conditions that occur between winter and post-thaw, and that those changes reflect functionally important adaptations to those conditions.

AB  - We evaluated habitat conditions available to infauna and epifauna across a gradient of shoreline development within the Pascagoula River estuary, Missisippi, to determine whether habitat characteristics and biotic responses were influenced by the degree of surrounding alteration. Three zones were defined: (H) severe alteration, (M) intermediate alteration, and (L) natural conditions starting about 5 km upstream. Eleven water-quality and habitat variables were quantified for infaunal and epifaunal nekton as indicators of habitat quality adjacent to both "restricted" and hardened shore and "unrestricted" or marsh-edge shore within each impact zone. Epifaunal nekton richness (S) was consistently greater at unrestricted shore types than restricted ones, highest in zone M and lowest in zone H, whereas infaunal S did not vary among impact zones or between shore types. Cluster analysis showed epifaunal nekton assemblages from unrestricted shores in zones M and L were most similar to each other, whereas restricted shore infaunal assemblages from zones H and M linked at similar to 70%. SIMPER analysis indicated infaunal composition was not dissimilar among zones or between shore types. In contrast, epifaunal nekton assemblages were dissimilar from one another because of the presence and density of Corophium louisianum and Hargeria rapax, two major fish prey items. Our data suggest the relative quality of marsh-edge habitat depends upon the surrounding landscape and that the simple presence of marsh habitat is not enough to ensure a high level of ecosystem health. Rather, it is the spatial arrangement of the marsh that markedly affects the system's health. It is apparent that even the smallest patch of marsh habitat supported a larger diversity of fauna than nearby restricted habitats, suggesting that it matters where a salt-marsh habitat patch (including restoration sites) is located along the landscape because it will influence habitat quality and connectivity and thus the composition of infauna and epifauna nekton assemblages.

AB  - The examination of telomere dynamics is a recent technique in ecology for assessing physiological state and age-related traits from individuals of unknown age. Telomeres shorten with age in most species and are expected to reflect physiological state, reproductive investment, and chronological age. Loss of telomere length is used as an indicator of biological aging, as this detrimental deterioration is associated with lowered survival. Lifespan dimorphism and more rapid senescence in the larger, shorter-lived sex are predicted in species with sexual size dimorphism, however, little is known about the effects of behavioral dimorphism on senescence and life history traits in species with sexual monomorphism. Here we compare telomere dynamics of thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia), a species with male-biased parental care, in two ways: 1) cross-sectionally in birds of known-age (0-28 years) from one colony and 2) longitudinally in birds from four colonies. Telomere dynamics are compared using three measures: the telomere restriction fragment (TRF), a lower window of TRF (TOE), and qPCR. All showed age-related shortening of telomeres, but the TRF measure also indicated that adult female murres have shorter telomere length than adult males, consistent with sex-specific patterns of ageing. Adult males had longer telomeres than adult females on all colonies examined, but chick telomere length did not differ by sex. Additionally, inter-annual telomere changes may be related to environmental conditions; birds from a potentially low quality colony lost telomeres, while those at more hospitable colonies maintained telomere length. We conclude that sex-specific patterns of telomere loss exist in the sexually monomorphic thick-billed murre but are likely to occur between fledging and recruitment. Longer telomeres in males may be related to their homogamous sex chromosomes (ZZ) or to selection for longer life in the care-giving sex. Environmental conditions appeared to be the primary drivers of annual changes in adult birds.

AB  - Groundwater salinity is a widespread problem and a challenge to water resources management. It is an increasing concern in the alluvial plains of Delhi and neighbouring Haryana state as well as a risk for agricultural production water supply and sustainable development. This study aims to identify potential sources of dissolved salts and the driving mechanisms of salinity ingress in the shallow aquifer. It combines a comprehensive review of environmental conditions and the analysis of groundwater samples from 25 sampling points. Major ions are analysed to describe the composition and distribution of saline groundwater and dissolution/precipitation dynamics. Density stratification and local upconing of saline waters were identified by multilevel monitoring and temperature logging. Bromide-chloride ratios hold information on the formation of saline waters, and nitrate is used as an indicator for anthropogenic influences. In addition, stable isotope analysis helps to identify evaporation and to better understand recharge processes and mixing dynamics in the study region. The results lead to the conclusion that surface water and groundwater influx into the poorly drained semiarid basin naturally results in the accumulation of salts in soil, sediments and groundwater. Human-induced changes of environmental conditions, especially the implementation of traditional canal and modern groundwater irrigation, have augmented evapotranspiration and led to waterlogging in large areas. In addition, water-level fluctuations and perturbation of the natural hydraulic equilibrium favour the mobilisation of salts from salt stores in the unsaturated zone and deeper aquifer sections. The holistic approach of this study demonstrates the importance of various salinity mechanisms and provides new insights into the interference of natural and anthropogenic influences.

AB  - Restoration of streams degraded by urbanization has usually been attempted by enhancement of instream habitat or riparian zones. Such restoration approaches are unlikely to substantially improve instrearn ecological condition because they do not match the scale of the degrading process. Recent studies of urban impacts on streams in Melbourne, Australia, on water chemistry, algal biomass and assemblage composition of diatoms and invertebrates, suggested that the primary degrading process to streams in many urban areas is effective imperviousness (EI), the proportion of a catchment covered by impervious surfaces directly connected to the stream by stormwater drainage pipes. The direct connection of impervious surfaces to streams means that even small rainfall events can produce sufficient surface runoff to cause frequent disturbance through regular delivery of water and pollutants; where impervious surfaces are not directly connected to streams, small rainfall events are intercepted and infiltrated. We, therefore, identified use of alternative drainage methods, which maintain a near-natural frequency of surface runoff from the catchment, as the best approach to stream restoration in urban catchments and then used models of relationships between 14 ecological indicators and EI to determine restoration objectives. Ecological condition, as indicated by concentrations of water-quality variables, algal biomass, and several measures of diatom and macroinvertebrate assemblage composition, declined with increasing El until a threshold was reached (EI = 0.01-0.14), beyond which no further degradation was observed. We showed, in a sample catchment, that it is possible to redesign the drainage system to reduce El to a level at which the models predict detectable improvement in most ecological indicators. Distributed, low-impact design measures are required that intercept rainfall from small events and then facilitate its infiltration, evaporation, transpiration, or storage for later in-house use.

AB  - Aquatic depositional environments where anoxic conditions extend from bottom waters into the photic zone occurred frequently during the geologic past. Periods of photic-zone anoxia (PZA) can be recognized by the presence of specific lipids produced exclusively by the green sulphur bacteria (Chlorobiaceae) that are preserved in the sedimentary record. Chlorobiaceae perform anoxygenic photosynthesis that requires light penetration into H2S-saturated waters. Sediment samples integrate paleoenvironmental conditions over time intervals ranging from, at best, a few decades to more commonly several millennia. Photic-zone anoxia recognized in paleoenvironmental analyses is thus defined as episodic, with no further interpretation on the duration and persistence of the anoxic events.
   We provide here a high-resolution, multiproxy chemostratigraphy study for the Toarcian Posidonia, Black Shale from the Dotterrhausen section in SW-Germany, in order to assess duration and seasonal fluctuation of photic-zone anoxia based on the relative abundance of derivatives of Chlorobiaceae lipids. We assess the variability in the degree and persistence of photic-zone anoxia using an aryl isoprenoid ratio (AIR) obtained by calculating the proportion of the short-chain C13-17 versus the intermediate-chain C18-22 aryl isoprenoids. Higher relative abundance of the short-chain analogues is interpreted as indicating more intensive aerobic degradation of aryl isoprenoids. AIR varies between values of 0.5, indicative of persistent PZA phases, and 3.0 for short-termed episodic PZA events. Absolute concentration of aryl isoprenoids is negatively correlated with the AIR, which is in agreement with a progressive diagenetic breakdown of aryl isoprenoids. The AIR decreases are validated using independent palecological and geochemical redox indicators for the Posidonia Shale in SW-Germany. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Abiotic stresses strongly impair plant development and might impose detrimental effects particularly on seedlings. Irradiance and water deficit are relevant factors, which affect performance of young plants under controlled conditions. In our study, we investigated the influence of water shortage combined with different radiation sources -light emitting diodes (LED) and compact fluorescence lamps (CFL) -on physiological and biochemical parameters of young apple plants. Stress responses were assessed by fluorescence-based indices, while relative water, chlorophyll (Chl), and proline content served as reference parameters. The watering regime had a higher impact on biochemical indicators than the radiation sources. Lower Chl content was determined in plants grown under LED both in control and in water deficit plants. Nitrogen balance index and nitrogen balance index with red radiation excitation showed similar patterns regarding leaf Chl results in relation to the radiation source, being higher under CFL. In contrast, the flavonol index was higher in plants cultivated under LED. Stomatal conductance and maximal photochemical efficiency emphasised a radiation quality effect with higher values for CFL. In conclusion, fluorescence indices related to nitrogen status and flavonol content are promising parameters to sense physiological impairments under the given conditions. However, discrepancies compared to previous studies might be related to the different plant species, the nature of dehydration, and the measuring conditions.

AB  - The heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) ducts distribute the conditioned air to different zones. They are installed outside in a harsh environment which escalates the energy loss due to heat transfer. This study aims to estimate the economically feasible and environmental amiable insulation thickness for HVAC duct using life cycle cost (LCC) and environmental assessment method. It deems five insulation materials for the duct and eight energy sources for chiller operation in selected countries. It uses the design and operating parameters of the duct installed in a renowned pharmaceutical company at Jamshoro/Pakistan. An apropos mathematical model is developed using the collected parameters to calculate optimum insulation thickness (OIT), LCC, maximum energy savings (ES) at minimum payback period (PP) and emission reduction in the insulated duct. It examines the effect of insulation thickness on economic and environmental outcomes using the linear slope line regression method. The results revealed that the use of EP and natural gas has minimum LCC of 13.66$/m-year (-0.484), 95% ES (0.248) corresponding to OIT (64.64 mm) with minimum PP of 1.2years (decreasing at a rate of -3.69 with insulation thickness). Fuel consumption reduces dramatically (-0.79) and once OIT is achieved, further increasing insulation thickness has a negligible impact on fuel savings (-0.041). Higher fuel cost produces maximum ES in the duct and reduces PP of insulation cost in selected countries but they do not affect the variation in fuel consumption and CO, CO2 and SO2 emission. Additionally, OIT of EP for duct reduces CO and CO2 emission at a maximum rate of -0.134 in case LPG (96%) and -0.484 (95%) in the case of natural gas, respectively.

AB  - Most methods for ecological assessment developed since the onset of the Water Framework Directive require substantial effort by skilled analysts and are therefore expensive to use. RAPPER ("Rapid Assessment of PeriPhyton Ecology in Rivers") is a high level ecological "triage" method that enables rapid screening of sites within a water body to enable managers to identify areas subject to nutrient pressures. The method involves a survey of macroscopic algae within 10 m lengths of watercourses, taking samples for subsequent identification, and assessing cover. Genus-level identification is used to ensure rapid assessment and comparability, and that the method can be used by a wide range of users. Genera of alga that form conspicuous growths recognisable with the naked eye are designated as either "stress-tolerant" ("S-taxa") or "competitive" taxa ("C-taxa"), depending on their preference for locations with low or high nutrient concentrations. Genera whose representatives span a wide range of nutrient conditions, or for which few data are available, are placed in a third class, "unclassified". The presence of S-taxa and the relative cover of C-taxa are then used to determine whether a site is at risk from eutrophication. Field trials in Scotland demonstrated that the method discriminates between sites with low and high nutrient concentrations. Significant differences were also observed in values of the Trophic Diatom Index between RAPPER classification categories. RAPPER can be used alone (allowing greater spatial or temporal coverage within water bodies at lower cost than conventional assessment methods) or to increase confidence in assessments of the condition of the phytobenthos by incorporating algae other than diatoms. The outcomes also relate directly to the experiences of non-technical stakeholders, and will have benefits for communicating ecosystem health concepts to the wider public, for example through "citizen science".

AB  - P> We analysed a large number of concurrent samples of macroinvertebrate communities and chemical indicators of eutrophication and organic pollution [total-P, total-N, NH(4)-N, biological oxygen demand (BOD(5))] from 594 Danish stream sites. Samples were taken over an 11-year time span as part of the Danish monitoring programme on the aquatic environment. Macroinvertebrate communities were sampled in spring using a standardised kick-sampling procedure whereas chemical variables were sampled six to 24 times per year per site. Habitat variables were assessed once when macroinvertebrates were sampled.
   The plecopteran Leuctra showed a significant negative exponential relationship (r2 = 0.90) with BOD(5) and occurred at only 16% of the sites with BOD(5) above 1.6 mg L-1. Sharp declines with increasing BOD(5) levels were found for the trichopteran families Sericostomatidae and Glossosomatidae although they appeared to be slightly less sensitive than Leuctra. Other plecopterans such as Isoperla showed a similar type of response curve to Leuctra (negative exponential) but occurred at sites with relatively high concentrations of BOD(5) up to 3-4 mg L-1. In contrast, the response curve of the isopod Asellus aquaticus followed a saturation function reaching a plateau above 3-4 mg L-1 BOD(5) and the dipteran Chironomus showed an exponential increase in occurrence with increasing BOD(5) concentration.
   Macroinvertebrate occurrence appeared to be related primarily to concentrations of BOD(5), NH(4)-N and total-P whereas there were almost no relationships to total-N. Occurrence of a number of taxa showed a stronger relationship to habitat conditions (width and substrate) than chemical variables.
   Important macroinvertebrate taxa are reduced at concentrations of BOD(5) that are normally perceived as indicating unimpacted stream site conditions. Our results confirmed sensitivity/tolerance patterns used by existing bioassessment systems only to some degree.

AB  - We introduce a Bayesian structural equation modeling framework to explore the spatiotemporal phytoplankton community patterns in the Neuse River Estuary (study period 1995-2001). The initial hypothesized model considered the influence of the physical environment (flow, salinity, and light availability), nitrogen (dissolved oxidized inorganic nitrogen, and total dissolved inorganic nitrogen), and temperature on total phytoplankton biomass and phytoplankton community structure. Generally, the model gave plausible results and enabled the identification of the longitudinal role of the abiotic factors on the observed phytoplankton dynamics. River flow fluctuations and the resulting salinity and light availability changes (physical environment) dominate the up-estuary processes and loosen the coupling between nitrogen and phytoplankton. Further insights into the phytoplankton community response were provided by the positive path coefficients between the physical environment and diatoms, chlorophytes, and cryptophytes in the down-estuary sections. The latter finding supports an earlier hypothesis that these three groups dominate the phytoplankton community during high freshwater conditions as a result of their faster nutrient uptake and growth rates and their tolerance on low salinity conditions. The relationship between dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations and phytoplankton community becomes more apparent as we move to the down-estuary sections. A categorization of the phytoplankton community into cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates and an assemblage that consists of diatoms, chlorophytes, and cryptophytes provided the best results in the upper and middle segments of the estuary. Finally, the optimal down-estuary grouping aggregates diatoms and chlorophytes, lumps together dinoflagellates with cryptophytes, while cyanobacteria are treated separately. These structural shifts in the temporal phytoplankton community patterns probably result from combined bottom-up and top-down control effects. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper describes the methodology developed to construct a model for predicting the behaviour of the natural radioisotopes of U, Th and Ra in a Mediterranean watershed. The methodology includes the development of the performance assessment model, obtaining water flow and radiological parameters based on experimental data and analysis of results. The model, which accounts for both water flows and mass balances of the radionuclides in a semi-natural environment, provides assessments of radionuclide behaviour in grassland and agricultural soils, rivers and reservoirs, including the processes of radionuclide migration through land and water and interactions between both. From field and laboratory data, it has been possible to obtain parameters for the driving processes considered in the model, water fluxes, source term definition, soil to plant transfer factors and distribution coefficient values. Ranges of parameter values obtained have shown good agreement with published literature data. This general methodological approach was developed to be extended to other radionuclides for the modelling of a biosphere watershed in the context of performance assessment of a High Level Waste (HLW) repository under Mediterranean climate conditions, as well as for forecasting radionuclide transport under similar Mediterranean conditions that will occur in the future in other areas. The application of sensitivity and uncertainty analysis was intended to identify key uncertainties with the aim of setting priorities for future research. The model results for the activity concentration in the reservoir indicate that for U-238 and Th-230 the most relevant parameter is the initial concentrations of the radionuclides in the reservoir sediments. However, for Ra-226 the most important parameter is the precipitation rate over the whole watershed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB  - For a better understanding of siliciclastic shelf environments, correlation between sequence stratigraphy and organic geochemistry is used. Our study is focused on the Cretaceous deposits of Marcoule (Gard, France), particularly on a close-packed siltites layer (200-400 m thick), which is well characterized as a marine flooding facies of a single trangressive-regressive cycle. During the Uppermost Albian and the Lower Cenomanian, the stratigraphic data indicate a change in the depositional environment from offshore to shoreface. Organic geochemistry is used in order to characterize origin and variability of the organic matter in relation to the stratigraphic data. The study is carried out on core samples from 2 drill holes (MAR 203 and MAR 501). Analyses of the aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons were performed using GC-MS and focused on biomarker distributions. The biomarkers indicate a contribution of mixed terrestrial and marine organic matter. The changes in molecular signatures are related to variations in the source of organic matter (marine versus terrestrial), preservation conditions (largely influenced by clay and early diagenesis), environmental oxidation-reduction and acidic conditions as well as bioturbation. Various environmental zones, characterized by different molecular signatures, can be distinguished. Resin derived biomarkers can be assigned to higher plant material input and may reflect the evolution and diversity of Gymnospermae versus Angiospermae during the transgressive/regressive cycle. The relative sea-level variations are clearly correlated with the nature and the preservation of the organic matter. For example, the Pr/Ph and Pr/n-C-17 ratios as well as the regular steranes distributions underline the maximum flooding surface evidenced by other studies. We observe a good correlation between the organic data and sequence stratigraphy: changes in geochemical signatures reflect the 3rd order depositional cycles. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Loading CaO onto spherically-shaped gamma-Al2O3 support was applied for the preparation of a cost-effective and environmentally-friendly heterogeneous catalyst for biodiesel production. Physico-chemical, textural and morphological characterization was performed using optical emission spectroscopy (ICP OES), Hg-porosimetry, N-2 physisorption, scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRPD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR FTIR) and Hammett indicators. The effects of catalyst preparation conditions (different precursor salts and calcination temperatures) on the catalyst activity, and the reaction conditions (methanol-to-oil molar ratio and catalyst loading) on the reaction rate and esters yield were studied. In addition, catalyst stability was investigated. The most active catalyst was derived from the nitrate precursor after calcination at 475 degrees C (inert atmosphere). Under mild reaction conditions (60 degrees C, 5 h, 900 rpm, methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 12:1 and catalyst loading (CaO wt% to the oil) of 0.5%), the equilibrium ester content of 94.3% was obtained in the methanolysis of sunflower oil in a batch reactor. The catalyst remained sufficiently active in two consecutive cycles without any pretreatment. Mechanical erosion caused by stirring and massive deposition of organic molecules from the reaction mixture caused the decrease of catalytic activity while CaO leaching was negligible.

AB  - Bearings are widely used in various industries to support rotating shafts. Their failures accelerate failures of other adjacent components and may cause unexpected machine breakdowns. In recent years, nonlinear vibration responses collected from a dynamic rotor- bearing system have been widely analyzed for bearing diagnostics. Numerous methods have been proposed to identify different bearing faults. However, these methods are unable to predict the future health conditions of bearings. To extend bearing diagnostics to bearing prognostics, this paper reports the design of a state space formulation of nonlinear vibration responses collected from a dynamic rotor- bearing system in order to intelligently predict bearing remaining useful life (RUL). Firstly, analyses of nonlinear vibration responses were conducted to construct a bearing health indicator (BHI) so as to assess the current bearing health condition. Secondly, a state space model of the BHI was developed to mathematically track the health evolution of the BHI. Thirdly, unscented particle filtering was used to predict bearing RUL. Lastly, a new bearing acceleration life testing setup was designed to collect natural bearing degradation data, which were used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed bearing prognostic method. Results show that the prediction accuracy of the proposed bearing prognostic method is promising and the proposed bearing prognostic method is able to reflect future bearing health conditions.

AB  - In West Africa, more than 80% of the original forest cover has disappeared due to the exponential growth of human populations in a recurrent search for new agricultural land. Once the fertility of the land is exhausted, these areas are abandoned and left to be reforested through natural succession. Despite the widespread presence of secondary forests of various ages in West African landscapes, little is known about the trajectories of recovery and the environmental factors that influence recovery rates. We set up 96 0.2 ha forest plots, along a chronosequence of 1 to 40 years and including 7 controls, on which all trees larger than 2.5 cm in diameter at breast height were inventoried. We modelled the recovery trajectories of four complementary dimensions of biodiversity (richness, diversity, composition, indicators of old-growth forest) in a Bayesian framework. Our results show that the four dimensions of biodiversity recover at different rates, with composition recovering much faster than floristic diversity. Among the local, landscape, and historical factors studied, the number of remnants and proximity to old-growth forests have a positive impact on recovery rates, with, under good environmental conditions, the composition, richness, and diversity being almost completely recovered in less than 25 years. Our results demonstrate the very high resilience of the composition of the semi-deciduous forests of West Africa, but also suggest that the management of these post-forest areas must be differentiated according to the landscape context and the presence of isolated trees, which are the last vestiges of the former forest. In unfavourable conditions, natural dynamics should be assisted by agroforestry practices and local tree planting to allow for a rapid restoration of forest goods and services to local populations.

AB  - Torrecillas Lagoon, on the north coast of Puerto Rico, has experienced extensive anthropogenic influence over the past 200 years. Elevated concentrations of Potentially Toxic Elements (PTEs) in bulk sediment (Cu, Zn, Pb, Ni, Cr, Li, V, Fe, As, Se, and Mn) have been reported in surficial sediments and have relatively uniform spatial distributions. Areas with higher concentrations are associated with a higher percentage of total organic carbon (TOC) and percent mud (mud), as well as anoxic conditions. Ammonia beccarii, Quinqueloculina rhodiensis, and Triloculina oblonga are the dominant foraminifers in the lagoon and are characteristic of stressed coastal environments. Bulk concentrations of Cu-Zn-Fe are negatively correlated with numerous foraminiferal taxa, absolute abundances, and diversity indices, though very few correlations with the bioavailable counterparts (F2(Tess)-bioavailable) are observed. Similarly, relative abundances of Quinqueloculina and Triloculina positively correlate with bulk Cu-Zn-Fe but not with F2(Tess)-bioavailable. The waters in Torrecillas lagoon show strong stratification, with hypoxic/anoxic (dissolved oxygen < 3 mg/L) and corrosive (pH < 7.4) conditions below 4 m depth. The presence of such strong gradients in very shallow water represents a dynamic chemical environment, with changes occurring on day-night cycles, tidal cycles, and especially with storm activity that induces mixing of otherwise highly stratified, very localized waters. Recognizing the potential for sequestered PTEs to be remobilized is an essential insight for coastal management agencies that must assess the risks of existing PTEs during coastal engineering activities (e.g., dredge and fill activities) and major storm events. Exchangeable and oxidizable fractions are likely more bioavailable than acid-soluble fractions in influencing the ecology of foraminifers under most circumstances.

AB  - Authigenic minerals can form in the water column and sediments of lakes, either abiotically or mediated by biological activity. Such minerals have been used as paleosalinity and paleoproductivity indicators and reflect trophic state and early diagenetic conditions. They are also considered potential indicators of past and perhaps ongoing microbial activity within sediments. Authigenic concretions, including vivianite, were described in late glacial sediments of Laguna Potrok Aike, a maar lake in southernmost Argentina. Occurrence of iron phosphate implies specific phosphorus sorption behavior and a reducing environment, with methane present. Because organic matter content in these sediments was generally low during glacial times, there must have been alternative sources of phosphorus and biogenic methane. Identifying these sources can help define past trophic state of the lake and diagenetic processes in the sediments. We used scanning electron microscopy, phosphorus speciation in bulk sediment, pore water analyses, in situ ATP measurements, microbial cell counts, and measurements of methane content and its carbon isotope composition (delta C-13(CH4)) to identify components of and processes in the sediment. The multiple approaches indicated that volcanic materials in the catchment are important suppliers of iron, sulfur and phosphorus. These elements influence primary productivity and play a role in microbial metabolism during early diagenesis. Authigenic processes led to the formation of pyrite framboids and revealed sulfate reduction. Anaerobic oxidation of methane and shifts in pore water ion concentration indicated microbial influence with depth. This study documents the presence of active microbes within the sediments and their relationship to changing environmental conditions. It also illustrates the substantial role played by microbes in the formation of Laguna Potrok Aike concretions. Thus, authigenic minerals can be used as biosignatures in these late Pleistocene maar sediments.

AB  - We present a new sea-level reconstruction for the past 1500 years based on biological indicators from the Central Adriatic islands. Biogenic littoral rims built by the coralline rhodophyte Lithophyllum byssoides were found on the particularly exposed sites on the rocky coasts of the islands of Vis, Ravnik and Bisevo in Croatia The presence of thick and well-developed Lithophyllum rims, considered to be precise (+/- 10 cm) sea-level indicators, points directly to the rising sea-level environment. Biogenic rims were mapped, measured and sampled for C-14 dating. The obtained results point to four phases of sea-level changes. The sea-level was near stable from around 550 till 770 cal AD, in the Dark Ages Cold Period (DACP), then during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) (770 till 1330 cal AD) the sea-level increased at a rate of 0.71 mm/yr. During the Little Ice Age (LIA) (1330 till 1640 cal AD) it was near stable again. Later, the sea-level started to rise at a much higher rate particularly during the Current Warm Period (CWP). These data were compared with local predictions derived from a glacio-hydro-isostatic models associated with the Last Glacial cycle. If the isostatic-eustatic component is separated, this area seems to have almost stable tectonic conditions during the past 1500 years.
   Our results show that the large algal rims most likely grew during near-stable sea-level conditions that occurred during two relatively colder periods in the past 1500 years. They also reveal that well-developed (up to 1.8 m wide) upper levels of algal rims were formed during similar to 300 years of stabilisation throughout the LIA. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The objective of this work is to describe the performance of the Santa Lucia natural system for wastewater reclamation (NSWWR) in its first two operating years, where it was run under distinct conditions from the initial design. This plant, located in the island of Gran Canaria, has yielded a wealth of information on the implementation of low-cost technologies in subtropical areas with water scarcity, both ecologically as well as socially sustainable, and the option of installing similar plants in coastal zones. The system also served as a local pilot plant for a natural technology of wastewater reclamation, alternative to conventional solutions, whether centralized or onsite, usually applied for the treatment of domestic wastewater in rural areas. In fact, over the years local wastewater treatment has demonstrated clear advantages: no need for electricity, no leakage of raw sewage along the sewerage systems, social and landscape integration, exploitation of by-products like macrophyte-derived material for local handcrafts, and reuse of reclaimed water for irrigation. Remarkably, the plant operated under forced conditions of a hydraulic overload of 200%; however, the influence of a climate with stable mean temperatures and mild winters may have contributed to a satisfactory overall performance. Mean removal efficiencies were even higher than expected: more than 80% for biochemical and 75% for chemical oxygen demand (BOD5 and COD), and 90% for total suspended solids (TSS). Mean decrease of nitrogen and phosphorus were 50 and 30%, respectively, while abatement of fecal indicators attained 2 log units. The data collected from the Santa Lucia wastewater reclamation system represent an exceptional case study, which may be potentially transferred to other rural or littoral communities that lack sanitation and reclamation systems. Moreover, the option of wastewater reuse and zero discharge is particularly attractive for arid zones. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Phase changing materials provide significant heat storage capacity and features different applications within the field of solar thermal energy, specifically in flat solar collectors. This research study presents a mathematical model of global energy balance of a flat solar collector integrated with phase changing materials under different environmental conditions of tropical climate of Merida, Mexico, which predicted fluid temperature of the system. The model was developed implementing three phase changing materials and monitoring their behavior for a four test-days and three-days samples of continuous series with different sky conditions were considered. Similarly, an optimal material thickness analysis for the best performance was carried out towards an economic feasibility study. This study was implemented for two sectors: residential and industrial, with the aim of verifying its feasibility. The highest temperature reported was 95 degrees C using lauric acid with a thickness of 32 mm, which resulted the most suitable phase changing material for this application. According to economic study, internal rate of return was used as indicator of investment viability. The results reported a maximum internal rate of return of 22% and 17.2% for the residential and industrial sectors, respectively. The integration of these materials improves the performance of these systems, making their implementation feasible in flat solar collectors.

AB  - Rainfall and geology of the catchment exert a dominant control on the trophic state of endorheic basins. River inflows and runoff provide nutrients, influencing primary productivity in the water column. Through time, paleoenvironmental conditions are recorded as variations within the sedimentary organic fraction. Thereafter, microbial populations settle and develop within sediments and lead to degradation processes as long as they remain active. However, their presence is generally not considered in Quaternary studies. The present study is based on the sedimentary record of the maar lake of Laguna Potrok Aike, southern Patagonia. We investigate the relationship between paleoenvironmental conditions and colonization of the corresponding sediments by microbes. Microbiological and geochemical analyses were combined to determine factors allowing microbes to sustain their activity over time. The study of Holocene sediments, containing dense and active microbial communities, provided means to evaluate the potential of microbial communities as agents of early diagenesis. We show that phosphorus released during organic matter degradation is essential for microbial growth. In highly colonized sediments, microbial communities appear capable of recycling the excreted ammonium, thus accounting for nitrogen fractionation toward high values in bulk sediment. Microbial activity in Laguna Potrok Aike still persists in 30 ka old sediments. Thus, we proposed that future lacustrine studies should include some microbial indicators to assess their impact in diagenetic processes.

AB  - Environmental conditions and the occurrence of protected and rare species have been studied in 18 groundwater-fed wetland complexes in north-western Poland. The plant cover of studied objects consisted of 81 syntaxa of water-, spring-, rush and sedge-, mire-, meadow-, tall-forb-, willow carr- and alderwood communities, as well as of 4 syntaxa of the mesophytic forests. Their microhabitat differentiation has been discussed. The expression of environmental conditions in the groundwater-fed communities has been analysed on the basis of Ellenberg's indicator values and the occurrence of protected and rare species. A signifficant negative correlation has been found between the occurrence of rare species and the trophy index, The special position of the mesotrophic rich fen communities, concerning their role in preservation of a large number of endangered species, as well as of rare plant communities is emphasized.

AB  - The biodegradation of organic pollutants is the main pathway for the natural dissipation and anthropogenic remediation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the environment. However, in the saline soils, the PAH biodegradation could be influenced by soil salts through altering the structures of microbial communities and physiological metabolism of degradation bacteria. In the worldwide, soils from oilfields are commonly threated by both soil salinity and PAH contamination, while the influence mechanism of soil salinity on PAH biodegradation were still unclear, especially the shifts of degradation genes and soil enzyme activities. In order to explain the responses of soils and bacterial communities, analysis was conducted including soil properties, structures of bacterial community, PAH degradation genes and soil enzyme activities during a biodegradation process of PAHs in oilfield soils. The results showed that, though low soil salinity (1% NaCl, w/w) could slightly increase PAH degradation rate, the biodegradation in high salt condition (3% NaCl, w/w) were restrained significantly. The higher the soil salinity, the lower the bacterial community diversity, copy number of degradation gene and soil enzyme activity, which could be the reason for reductions of degradation rates in saline soils. Analysis of bacterial community structure showed that, the additions of NaCl increase the abundance of salt-tolerant and halophilic genera, especially in high salt treatments where the halophilic genera dominant, such as Acinetobacter and Halomonas. Picrust2 and redundancy analysis (RDA) both revealed suppression of PAH degradation genes by soil salts, which meant the decrease of degradation microbes and should be the primary cause of reduction of PAH removal. The soil enzyme activities could be indicators for microorganisms when they are facing adverse environmental conditions.

AB  - Aim. Study of the influence of drinking water quality on the ecologically-dependent morbidity of the population of the Republic of Dagestan.
   Material and Methods. Methods of current and retrospective analysis of regional health indicators and methods of mathematical-statistical and medical-geographical analysis were used. Statistical processing of the results was carried out using the STATISTICA and Excel software packages. When carrying out laboratory studies on the quality of drinking water, we used a Lumex atomic absorption spectrometer "MGA-915MD".
   Results. Numerous hygiene studies indicate the direct impact of unsatisfactory drinking water quality on the health of a population. The relationship between sanitary and chemical indicators and the incidence rate for a number of nosological forms has been proven. It is generally accepted that human health is influenced by lifestyle factors (working, living and relaxation conditions), heredity and the ecological condition of the area of residence, including the quality of drinking water. Although it is not possible to differentiate the share of the negative effect caused by the consumption of poor quality drinking water but the incidence of certain nosological forms (cancer of the esophagus, gastrointestinal tract and kidney diseases) in the those regions of the Republic of Dagestan under consideration correlates with the characteristics of drinking water.
   Conclusion. The problem of pollution of water supply sources for the population in the dynamics of the long-term remains a priority concern. The quality and safety of drinking water are decreasing, which cannot but have a negative impact on public health. Correlation linkages between indicators of drinking water quality and oncological morbidity of the population were also established in indicators below the maximum permissible concentrations, which corresponds to a typical logistic model of causal relationships and serves as evidence of the high dependence of health disorders on chemical contamination of water supply sources.

AB  - Simple Summary The study showed that the use of mirrors may represent a low-cost useful tool to stimulate the expression of natural behaviors when rabbits are bred in small groups in a free-range system. The use of mirrors appeared to simulate the condition in which rabbits were allowed to have visual contacts with the other groups, improving important natural behaviors (olfactory investigation, gnawing, alertness, allo-grooming, stretching, locomotion). This is important in the view of adopting welfare-friendly techniques in rearing of farm animals, since consumers demand for high quality animal products is changing in a way that includes in the concept of home-made products also alternative rearing systems complying with the conditions of welfare. The aim of this research was to evaluate the possible usefulness of mirrors in improving rabbit behavior in a free-range breeding system. Three groups (each consisting of nine replicates of three animals) were compared: isolated, isolated with mirrors and separated by a wire mesh (possible visual and olfactory contacts). Rabbits allowed to have a visual and olfactory contact showed a significantly higher expression of important natural behaviors (olfactory investigation, gnawing, alertness, stretching, locomotion) compared to the isolated rabbits (with or without mirrors); while rabbits in the mirror group showed higher allo-grooming activity than those isolated and no different locomotion activity than those separated by wire mesh. Thus, mirrors seemed to be able to modify the behavioral repertoire of isolated rabbits by acting on social perception in rabbits reared in small groups in a free-range system. Nevertheless, despite it being advisable to use a combination of different indicators in order to assess the stress level of an animal, the accuracy of serum cortisol, as well as of some secondary stress markers assay, appeared to be limited in this type of breeding.

AB  - The oriental beech forests along the southern Caspian Sea shores of Iran are characterized by high biodiversity and high ecological value. However, there is little information concerning factors governing community composition and the presence and abundance of invasive plants. In the present study we aimed to evaluate the main drivers of community composition, diversity, and establishment of invasive plants in disturbed and undisturbed Fagus orientalis communities.
   We sampled 104 vegetation releves in undisturbed and disturbed sites of the "Kheiroud Investigation Forest" in northern Iran and collected data on a large number of environmental variables concerning soil properties, light conditions, and topography. Data analysis consisted of a forward selection of significant explanatory variables followed by partial CCA analyses. Additionally, we carried out indicator species analysis of groups of releves affected by different disturbance types and analyzed effects of disturbance on species richness, diversity, and evenness using general linear models.
   CCA results showed that disturbance, soil properties, light conditions and elevation explained 22.6% of the total variation in floristic composition. Gap and gap + grazing were the most important disturbance types affecting community composition. Disturbance had significant but rather weak effects on species richness, evenness, and the Shannon index. The most obvious effect of disturbance was on species composition, as revealed by significant groups of indicator species for different disturbance types. Most of the indicator species in grazed sites were unpalatable, poisonous, and creeping species, which are avoided by cattle. Grazing led to decreased abundance of indicator species and species characteristic of old-growth Fagus forests. The most intensive disturbance type "harvesting + gap + grazing" was associated with invasion by native vascular plant species not typically found in beech forests (apophytes).

AB  - Intra-annual density fluctuations (IADFs) are anomalies of tree rings where wood density is abruptly altered after sudden changes in environmental conditions. Their characterisation can provide information about the relationship between environmental factors and eco-physiological processes during tree growth. This paper reports about the variability of anatomical traits and stable carbon isotopic composition along tree rings as resulting from the application of two different methodological approaches: (a) the separation of each ring into different regions (earlywood, latewood and IADF) and the comparison of anatomical and isotopic parameters measured in those specific sectors and (b) the analysis of such features in continuum along ring width. Moreover, different parameters of vessels (i.e. ecd-equivalent circle diameter, elongation, sphericity and convexity of vessel lumen) were considered to identify those more appropriate for the representation of intra-annual anatomical variations. The analysis was conducted on Arbutus unedo L. growing on the Elba Island (Italy); tree rings of this species form IADFs with features clearly responsive to the environmental conditions experienced during plant growth. Results showed that the first approach, although more suitable to obtain data for subsequent statistical comparisons and for the calculation of correlations with environmental parameters, suffers from elements of subjectivity due to the size and position of the selected tree-ring regions. The in continuum method allows a clearer identification of the variation of tree-ring properties along ring width. Regarding anatomical parameters, shape indexes were not suitable indicators of intra-annual variability. The overall analysis suggested that using both methodologies in synergy helps to gain complete information and avoid misleading interpretations of IADFs in tree rings.

AB  - The potential non-target effects of genetically modified crops are some of the more debated topics within applied biotechnologies in agriculture and environmental risk assessment. The objective of the present research was to study the potential Bt-toxin uptake by the non-target herbivore Myzus persicae Sulzer (Hemiptera: Aphididae) feeding on transgenic oilseed rape plants (Brassica napus cv. 'Westar' lines GT 2-4) expressing the Cry1Ac endotoxin. A specific aim was to replicate our previous experiment in controlled laboratory conditions to avoid or minimize the risk of contamination leading to potential false positive results. The toxin levels in vernalized (V) and not-vernalized (not-V) transgenic oilseed rape plants was also monitored to better clarify the role of physiological processes on Bt-toxin expression. Cry1Ac expression in not-V plants (mean concentration +/- SE = 167.8 +/- 5.7 mu g kg(-1) FW) showed a pattern of large variability, in comparison with V plants whose expression (mean concentration +/- SE = 227.7 +/- 1.9 mu g kg(-1) FW) was significantly more stable. Cry1Ac toxin was detected in three aphid samples reared on V plants with a mean toxin concentration +/- SE of 4.8 +/- 0.6 mu g Kg(-1) FW and in three out of six samples of aphids reared on not-V plants (mean toxin concentration +/- SE = 7.1 +/- 1.2 mu g kg(-1) FW). The mean Bt-toxin concentration of all the positive aphid samples was 5.9 +/- 1.0 mu g kg(-1) FW. Our results confirmed the findings of our previous experiment and highlighted the potential for Cry1Ac toxin uptake by aphids feeding on transgenic oilseed rape plants.

AB  - Wetland soils are characterized by alternating redox process due to the fluctuation of waterlogged conditions. Iron is an important redox substance, and its transfer and transformation in the wetland ecosystem could be an effective indicator for the environment changes. In this paper, we selected the Naoli River catchment in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China as the study area to analyze the dynamics of transfer and transformation of soil iron, and the relationship between iron content change and environmental factors. The results show that the total and crystalline iron contents reach the peak in the depth of 60 cm in soil profile, while the amorphous iron content is higher in the topsoil. In the upper reaches, from the low to high landscape positions, the total and crystalline iron contents decrease from 62.98 g/kg to 41.61 g/kg, 22.82 g/kg to 10.53 g/kg respectively, while the amorphous iron content increases from 2.42 g/kg to 8.88 g/kg. Amorphous iron content has positive correlation with organic matter and soil water contents, while negative correlation with pH. Moreover, both the crystalline and amorphous iron contents present no correlation with total iron content, indicating that environmental factors play a more important role in the transfer and transformation of iron other than the content of the total iron. Different redoximorphic features were found along the soil profile due to the transfer and transformation of iron. E and B horizons of wetland soil in the study area have a matrix Chroma 2 or less, and all the soil types can meet the criteria of American hydric soil indicators except albic soil.

AB  - In Mediterranean aquaculture, significant advances have been made towards a reduction of marine-derived ingredients in aquafeed formulation, as well as in defining the effect on how environmental factors such as rearing density interact with fish health. Little research, however, has examined the interaction between rearing density and dietary composition on main key performance indicators, physiological processes and gut bacterial community. A study was undertaken, therefore to assess growth response, digestive enzyme activity, humoral immunity on skin mucus, plasma biochemistry and gut microbiota of gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata, L. 1758) reared at high (HD, 36-44 kg m(-3)) and low (LD, 12-15 kg m(-3)) final stocking densities and fed high (FM30/FO15, 30% fishmeal FM, 15% fish oil, FO) and low (FM10/FO3; 10% FM and 3% FO) FM and FO levels. Isonitrogenous and isolipidic extruded diets were fed to triplicate fish groups (initial weight 96.2 g) to overfeeding over 98 days. The densities tested had no major effects on overall growth and feed efficiency of sea bream reared at high or low FM and FO dietary level. However, HD seems to reduce feed intake compared to LD mainly in fish fed FM30/F015. Results of digestive enzyme activity indicated a comparable digestive efficiency among rearing densities and within each dietary treatment even if intestinal brush border enzymes appeared to be more influenced by stocking density compared to gastric and pancreatic enzymes. Plasma parameters related to nutritional and physiological conditions were not affected by rearing densities under both nutritional conditions a similar observation was also achieved through the study of lysozyme, protease, antiprotease and total protein determination in skin mucus, however; in this case lysozyme was slightly reduced at HD. For the first time on this species, the effect of rearing density on gut bacterial community was studied. Different response in relation to dietary treatment under HD and LD were detected. Low FM-FO diet maintained steady the biodiversity of the gut bacterial community between LD and HD conditions while fish fed high FM-FO level showed a reduced biodiversity at HD. According to the results, it seems feasible to rear gilthead sea bream at the on-growing phase at a density up to 36-44 kg m(-3) with low or high FM-FO diet without negatively affecting growth, feed efficiency, welfare condition and gut bacterial community.

AB  - Morphological plasticity of ectomycorrhizal (EcM) short roots (known also as first and second order roots with primary development) allows trees to adjust their water and nutrient uptake to local environmental conditions. The morphological traits (MTs) of short-living EcM roots, such as specific root length (SRL) and area, root tip frequency per mass unit (RTF), root tissue density, as well as mean diameter, length, and mass of the root tips, are good indicators of acclimation. We investigated the role of EcM root morphological plasticity across the climate gradient (48-68 degrees N) in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) and (53-66 degrees N) birch (Betula pendula Roth., B. pubescens Ehrh.) forests, as well as in primary and secondary successional birch forests assuming higher plasticity of a respective root trait to reflect higher relevance of that characteristic in acclimation process. We hypothesized that although the morphological plasticity of EcM roots is subject to the abiotic and biotic environmental conditions in the changing climate; the tools to achieve the appropriate morphological acclimation are tree species-specific. Long-term (1994-2010) measurements of EcM roots morphology strongly imply that tree species have different acclimation-indicative root traits in response to changing environments. Birch EcM roots acclimated along latitude by changing mostly SRL [plasticity index (PI) = 0.60], while spruce EcM roots became adjusted by modifying RTF (PI = 0.68). Silver birch as a pioneer species must have a broader tolerance to environmental conditions across various environments; however, the mean PI of all MTs did not differ between early-successional birch and late-successional spruce. The differences between species in SRL, and RTF, diameter, and length decreased southward, toward temperate forests with more favorable growth conditions. EcM root traits reflected root-rhizosphere succession across forest succession stages.

AB  - Cannibalism can be a significant factor limiting the survival of pike,Esox lucius, early life stages in both natural and aquaculture conditions. In the present research, type I cannibalism was studied in pike larvae (size range: 9-32.5 mm standard length, SL) in controlled conditions for 45 days post-hatching (dph). For this purpose, the occurrence of cannibalistic pairs, i.e. prey caught by a cannibal inside the cannibal's mouth, was monitored for 15 min periods by two observers six times daily. Cannibalism was not observed in fish that still had yolk-sacs, but it did occur as soon as the yolk-sac was absorbed on 5 dph at a body size of 13 mm at 22 degrees C and 10 dph at a body size of 13.4 mm at 15 degrees C. The ratio of prey to predator size was on average 87%, but the smallest observed size difference was only 1.3%. The intensity of cannibalistic attacks depended on water temperature with more intense cannibalism at 22 degrees C than at 15 degrees C, and no cannibalism at 10 degrees C. Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in all three sagittal otolith size parameters (area, width, and length) was higher in prey than in cannibals, the differences were not statistically significant.

KW  - program
AB  - The social infrastructure of rural areas is of particular importance when considering issues of both an economic and social nature. Both production and non-production rural areas necessitate the availability of social facilities. The main purpose of social infrastructure facilities nowadays and in the past of rural and urban areas development is to meet the needs of the population. At the same time, social infrastructure defines the basis for the level and quality of life of civil society. Its condition is an indicator of the territorial development and provides opportunities for innovative development and investment attraction. For many years now, the rural social infrastructure has been in poor condition in Russia. Problems are observed in the living conditions of citizens, in elements of residential properties improvement, undeveloped system of medical and educational services, unavailability of cultural and leisure facilities, and so on. Due to such a negative state of the rural social sphere, problems arise with the demographic situation and the production sphere in terms of the inability to attract highly qualified personnel. The Program for the Sustainable Development of Rural Territories developed by the Government of Russia holds back the general, intensively negative situation, and is fundamentally changing it in some regions of the country. The paper presents the results of the implementation of the main Program directions and gives some recommendations on its further implementation and development of the rural social infrastructure.

AB  - The Southern Adriatic Sea is a dynamic region under the influence of diverse physical forces that modify sea water properties as well as plankton dynamics, abundance, and distribution in an intricate way. The most pronounced being: winter vertical convection, lateral exchanges between coastal and open sea waters, and the ingression of water masses of different properties into the Adriatic. We investigated the distribution and abundance of tintinnid species in this dynamic environment in pre- and post-winter conditions in 2015/2016. A strong ingression of the saline Levantine Intermediate Water, supported by the cyclonic mode of the North Ionian Gyre in 2015 and 2016, in December was associated with a high diversity of oceanic species. An unusual spatial distribution of neritic-estuarine species Codonellopsis schabi was observed in deeper layers along the analyzed transect, which emphasizes the strong influence of physical processes on deep water biology in the South Adriatic. A shift of population toward greater depths (mesopelagic) and modification of deep sea community structure was recorded in April as a consequence of the winter convection-driven sinking of tintinnids. Our findings indicate that tintinnid abundance and composition is heavily influenced by physical conditions and they are good indicators of the impact of physical forces, including climate changes, on marine environment.

   Qualitative and quantitative studies on calcareous nannofossils have been carried out on the Middle-Upper Bathonian succession of Gnaszyn (Krakow-Silesia Homocline, Czestochowa region). The nannofossil assemblages are moderately or well-preserved and are dominated by Watznaueria britannica; also common are Staurolithites lumina and Zeugrhabdotus erectus. The presence of delicate nannofossil forms together with dissolution-resistant taxa shows that the changes in composition of some of the nannoplankton assemblages reflect original variations. The frequency and diversity changes of the calcareous nannofossil assemblages have been interpreted in relation to fluctuations of sedimentation rate versus changes in trophic conditions within the photic zone. The highest diversity assemblages contain a high percentage of palaeofertility indicators, and are impoverished in the genus Watznaueria. This is interpreted as a reflection of a lower sedimentation rate and more stable, possibly mesotrophic conditions within the photic zone. On the other hand, W. britannica-dominated assemblages with low species diversity may represent more unstable environments with a high influx of terrestrial material related to a high sedimentation rate and a high nutrient influx, i.e. eutrophic conditions in the photic zone.

AB  - This study evaluated the degree of sediment contamination in several South Florida estuaries. During the 2010 National Condition Assessment, Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute collected water column, sediment and biotic data from estuaries across the entire state of Florida. Sediments were analyzed for arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, zinc and total polychlorinated biphenyls and were compared relative to empirically derived sediment quality guidelines. As a result of this data collection and assessment effort, it was determined that the degree of contamination with respect to sediment was low for all southern Florida estuaries assessed, except the Miami River which was determined to be considerably contaminated. However only one monitoring location was used to assess the Miami River, and as such should be viewed with caution. A low degree of contamination was determined for Biscayne Bay sediments, possibly indicating a recovery from its previously reported higher contaminant level.

AB  - The goal of this paper was to establish the durability profile of antibacterial multilayer thin films under storage and usage conditions. Thin films were built on stainless steel (SS) by means of a layer-by-layer process alternating a negatively charged polyelectrolyte, polyacrylic acid, with a cationic antibacterial peptide, nisin. SS coupons coated with the antibacterial film were challenged under environmental and usage conditions likely to be encountered in real-world applications. The change in antibacterial activity elicited by the challenge was used as an indicator of multilayer film resistance. Antibacterial SS samples could be stored for several weeks at 4 degrees C in ambient air and antibacterial films were resistant to dipping and mild wiping in water and neutral detergent. The multilayer coating showed some weaknesses, however, that need to be addressed.

KW  - CRUSTACEA
AB  - Samples collected from the Guys Hill Formation (Yellow Limestone Group, middle Eocene) in the Seven Rivers region of northwestern Jamaica yielded a rich ostracode fauna, including eight new species. The samples were collected to determine the environment of deposition for the strata that contain both fully-terrestrial and marine vertebrates, including seacows in the transition between land- and sea-faring morphologies. Adult and juvenile and male and female ostracode specimens were recognized, indicating an autochthonous thanatocoenosis. The dominance of cytherideid ostracodes, particularly the presence of significant numbers of noded cytherideids, indicates brackish conditions, at least during part of the chronostratigraphic interval, and marine taxa, such as Orionina and Hemicythere, indicate fluctuating paleoenvironmental conditions, which is consistent with the range of vertebrate fossil faunas collected from the site. New species include Cytherelloidea nebuloreticulata, Paracytheridea jamaicaensis, P. inflata, Cythereis? iturraldei, Quadracythere robusta, Quadracythere polycosta, Hemicythere elongata, and Orionina anteroexposita.

AB  - A novel, miniaturized titration was developed using beads 35 mu m in diameter as semisolid aqueous titrant retained in a nonaqueous sample stream. Agarose beads with internally bound pH indicator served as a pH sensing membrane material swollen with aqueous NaOH titrant. The indicator monitored the remaining titrant within the agarose beads during perfusion with H2SO4 in 1-butanol samples, Irreversible reaction of 2 mg bead layers was made possible by automated packing and disposal in a now cell, This strategy substituted membrane advantages for the burdens of mixing and unnecessary dilution under laminar flow conditions. The agarose environment was conditioned with NaCl to tolerate dissolved salt in the sample. Transmittance measurements were made via fiber optics through FEP PTFE optical windows. A simple inverse relationship held between endpoint volume and acid concentration so that calibration curves were linear, R-2 = 0.9980.

AB  - Operant conditioning and quantitative and Qualitative Behavioral Assessment synergism can provide valuable information about animals' extinction/learning and emotional status. In this study, we tested operant conditioning with 300 donkeys using six different reinforcers. Simultaneously, we studied the effects 15 animal-inherent, environment and location, and test-related factors had on the response type and intensity, mood, and extinction/learning ability variables. We sought to test three hypotheses using nonparametric categorical analyses. First, we studied which of the 15 noncognitive factors could explain the variability of the 4 behavioral variables and their explanatory power. Second, we assessed the frontal and lateral ear positions donkeys displayed when each reinforcement treatment was implemented to study the correlations between the ear position and twelve mood Qualitative Behavioral Assessment categories. Third, we assessed which reinforcement treatment was more suitable to promote donkeys' learning and welfare, studying their success rate at completing the operant conditioning test and welfare-related behavioral signs, respectively. Almost all noncognitive factors significantly affected four variables (P < 0.001), although some were not linearly correlated. Our results show that body language is as an efficient tool to report translatable information on the donkey's mood and that neutral or luring/positive reinforcement techniques promote learning and are welfare-friendly methods to modified behaviors in donkeys.

AB  - The relationship between fish and amphibians is thought to be antagonistic because of the frequent amphibian extirpations after fish introductions, although some field observations show that amphibians and fish often co-occur in rivers. Here, we used surveys in north-eastern Spain (99,700km(2), 15 river catchments, N=535 sites) to identify the most frequent fish-amphibian associations and the riverine conditions that might concurrently promote the diversity of native fish and of five widely distributed amphibian species. Overall, there was little congruence between native fish and amphibian-diversity measures (species richness and the Shannon, Simpson and Pielou diversity indices). Different riverine conditions appeared to be important for the two vertebrate groups. Alien fish richness, which was highly correlated with alien fish abundance, was negatively associated with amphibian richness and Shannon diversity but was positively associated with native fish richness. River water depth was negatively associated with amphibian occurrence. While our snap-shot surveys may be a transitional stage in the fish-amphibian relationships, we found that some widely distributed amphibian species co-occur with fish in rivers in north-eastern Spain. Small rivers, such as tributaries often have the most intact fish assemblages, and probably are the best locations to explore fish-amphibian associations in greater depth.

AB  - The verification of management support of professional and educational trajectory of students in terms of socio-cultural educational environment of the university is considered. The research urgency is caused by the transition to the educational standards of the third generation, which offer students and teachers new opportunities. The teachers face the challenge not only of transferring knowledge and skills to students, but also the formation of future graduate's personality, capable of professional development. The article analyses the conditions for the maintenance of professional and educational trajectory of students at the university. Professional motives and commitment to professional development of students, the level of professional knowledge, commitment to their completion and perfection during the period of professionalization of personality are commented. Formed abilities and skills, professional experience are represented as a set of indicators of quality of professional and personal development of students. The authors hold the view that in practice of higher education institutions the teaching staff faces the task of the organization and ensuring educational process with the guarantee of student's transition to higher levels of professional and personal development. It is proved that the requirements of vocational and educational trajectory allows to approximate the educational process to the needs of students, to form their professional and educational development in the conditions of the university, to prepare for practice.

TI  - Development and evaluation of iron-coated tubes that indicate reduction in soils
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL

AB  - Soil drainage conditions are important to land use decisions. Traditionally, anaerobic conditions induced by poor drainage have been evaluated by observing soil color related to Fe and Mn oxides, using alpha, alpha-dipyridyl dye, measuring dissolved O-2, and measuring E-11. We believe that there is further need for a device that is scientifically sound and easy to use. Therefore, our goals were to develop and test a device that mimics natural soil processes, visualy, indicates soil reduction, and is robust. Our concept was to coat a rod or tube with a colored soil mineral that dissolves on reduction, insert the device into a soil, remove it after a few weeks or longer, and observe if some of the coating had been lost. If the coating was not dissolved, no reduction occurred, but if it was dissolved, reducing conditions must have prevailed. After trying several kinds of coatings and tubes, we chose ferrihydrite (FH) coating on polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe. We call the device an Indicator of Reduction in Soils (IRIS). As the study progressed we added semi-quantitative interpretations by measuring depleted areas using a digital camera and image analysis. We tested IRIS tubes in the lab and in soils in Indiana, Minnesota, and North Dakota, and concluded they performed as expected. Reduction rates increased between February and April and were related to increasing soil temperature, turnover (flux) of soil OC, and content (inventory) of OC. Reduction rates decreased after April, presumably because the nutrient supply for microbes decreased.

AB  - Strain data of structural health monitoring is a prospective to be made full use of, because it reflects the stress peak and fatigue, especially sensitive to local stress redistribution, which is the probably damage in the vicinity of the sensor. For decoupling structural damage and masking effects caused by operational conditions to eliminate the adverse impacts on strain-based damage detection, small time-scale structural events, i.e., the short-term dynamic strain responses, are analyzed in this paper by employing unsupervised modeling. A two-step approach to successively processing the raw strain monitoring data in the sliding time window is presented, consisting of the wavelet-based initial feature extraction step and the decoupling step to draw damage indicators. The principal component analysis and a low-rank property-based subspace projection method are adopted as two alternative decoupling methodologies. The approach's feasibility and robustness are substantiated by analyzing the strain monitoring data from a customized truss experiment to successfully remove the masking effects of operating loads and identify local damages even concerning accommodating situations of missing data and limited measuring points. This work also sheds light on the merit of a low-rank property to separate structural damages from masking effects by comparing the performances of the two optional decoupling methods of the distinct rationales.</p>

AB  - Given the importance of climate conditions for the development of soils, studies on climosequences are a valuable tool to predict the influence of climate change on weathering rates and on soil formation processes. The Baturit, massif, a humid enclave located in the Brazilian semi-arid region, has unique characteristics that cause a disproportional distribution of rainfall: the eastern and northern slopes receive more than 1,600 mm/year of rainfall, whereas the southern and western slopes have semi-arid characteristics with rainfall of less than 600 mm/year. Eight soil profiles were selected to investigate the influence of these distinct climates on soil formation. To achieve this, physical, chemical, morphological, mineralogical and micromorphological data were determined and analyzed. In the humid slope predominate soil processes include melanization, brunification, intense leaching, acidification and alitization, with intensified weathering in higher altitudes. In contrast, the environment in the dry slope favored the occurrence of soils with a higher base status, high-activity clays, low Al saturation and bisialitization processes coexisting with monosialitization, mainly in the soils located at lower altitudes. Micromorphological data indicate that clay illuviation is not the main process responsible for the enrichment of clay in the subsurface horizons. The contrasting environmental conditions with different mineralogical composition seem to be an important indicator of weathering intensity and pedoenvironmental conditions.

AB  - Understanding mechanistic relationships between seagrass and their environmental stressors should be considered for effective management of estuaries and may inform on why change has occurred. We aimed to develop indicators for seagrass health in response to sediment conditions for the Swan-Canning Estuary, south-west Australia. This article describes the development of a new sediment-stress indicator, relating aspects of seagrass productivity with sediment sulfur dynamics. Sulfur stable isotope ratio and total sulfur were measured monthly within the roots, rhizomes and leaves of Halophila ovalis, and significantly varied across sites and months. The growth of seagrass over the summer months appeared restricted by sediment condition, with growth of seagrass lower when sediment derived sulfur and/or total sulfur within rhizome of leaf tissues was higher. H. ovalis appeared quite tolerant of sulfide intrusion within the root compartment, but growth was compromised when sulfide breached the root-rhizome barrier. The tightest correlation between potential sulfur metrics and seagrass growth was observed for the ratio (delta S-34(leaf) + 30)/(TSleaf), and it is this ratio that we propose may be a useful sediment-stress indicator for seagrass. The study also highlights that sediment condition needs to be considered at the meadow scale. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Poplar plantations have been established in upland areas of southwestern China in recent years. However, poor site conditions limit the growth and ecological function of poplar plantations. In this experiment, poplar plantations were established in 2004 and circular areas were mulched around each tree at four rates: 0, 10,000, 20,000 and 30,000 kg ha-1 fresh grass (Imperata cylindrical var. major). The effects of varying amounts of fresh grass mulch on urease and acid phosphatase activities and nutrient availability (N, P and K) in the rhizosphere and bulk soil were assessed under field conditions. Additions of fresh grass mulch greatly improved urease and acid phosphatase activities as well as the concentrations of N, P and K in the rhizosphere and bulk soils, and all measured variables were enhanced as the mulching quantity increased, highlighting the importance of conducting effective residue management in poplar plantations growing on degraded agricultural soil. Enzymatic activity and nutrient availability were always higher in the rhizosphere than in the bulk soil, and rhizosphere effects were more pronounced in the mulch treatment. The results from the present study assume that reactions of enzymatic activity and available nutrients in rhizosphere soils are very sensitive to management practices and that the rhizosphere is an important indicator that reflects conditions and changes in soil fertility.

AB  - A pollen record from a crater lake (Lake Tilla, 10 degrees 23'N, 12 degrees 08'E, c. 700 m asl) in the Sudanian zone of northeast Nigeria provides evidence for the persistence of woodland savanna throughout the Holocene. Wetter conditions from c. 10,000 B.P. to c. 6800 B.P. enabled the establishment of a dense Guinean savanna, though the occurrence and rapid spread of the montane element Olea hochstelleri indicates cool climatic conditions prior to c. 8800 B.P. Patches of closed dry forest may have existed, but never completely displaced the savanna vegetation. Grass fires were frequent throughout the Holocene and were probably important in promoting the open character of the vegetation. From c. 6800 B.P. onwards a gradual floristic change from a Guinean to a Sudano-Guinean savanna and a lowering of lake levels point to drier environmental conditions, which intensified around 3700 B.P. Human impact might have caused increasing sedimentation rates from c. 2500 B.P. onwards. The pollen diagram of Lake Tilla reflects a history of the savanna which appears to have been primarily controlled by climatic changes. The lack of unambiguous pollen indicators might be the reason why human activities remain palynologically hidden even for the late Holocene.

AB  - One of the key features of nature-based solutions (NBSs) is their high effectiveness and economic and resource efficiency in solving problems compared to traditional grey interventions. These aspects, however, have so far attracted little attention in the literature but should be considered, as the evaluation of NBS projects before im-plementation provides an opportunity to use them as practical tools. This paper aims to present a new evaluation framework of NBS projects (at the stage of solution selection) based on the application of performance questions and the indicators approach. The framework consists of three main stages: (1) the formulation of the project aim (s), including the problem(s) to be solved, the scales of the expected effects and the thresholds to be achieved; (2) the elimination of solutions that do not fit the local conditions and setting requirements; and (3) the exam-ination of the performance questions. To consider the whole spectrum of influencing factors, a systematic review was performed to indicate the main concepts related to the issue of NBS effectiveness, including (1) stakeholders' participation, (2) policy and management capability, (3) economic efficiency, (4) analysis of synergies and trade-offs, (5) adaptation to local conditions, (6) adequate spatial scale and (7) performance in the long term. In the current study around 130 indicators were identified for the evaluation of NBS projects. Regarding the impact on the state of knowledge, the present work contributes to the discussion on the conceptual sphere of NBS and its practical implementation by introducing multi-perspective standards and guidelines for the selection of pos-sible NBS projects, and it deals with the complexity of synergies and the trade-offs between benefits.

AB  - This study assesses toxicity of groundwater from remediated fuel spill sites, as the final phase of an environmental risk assessment of contaminated sites at sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island, Tasmania, Australia. To complement previous terrestrial ecotoxicological research, we determine risk to marine environments from residual biodegraded hydrocarbon contaminants in groundwater discharges. Direct toxicity assessments were conducted on 7 composite groundwater test solutions, adjusted to ambient seawater salinity. Eleven native marine invertebrates (from varied taxa: gastropods, bivalves, flatworms, amphipods, copepods, isopods) were exposed and observed for up to 21 d. Lethal time estimates (LT10, LT50) showed sensitivity was time dependent (LT10s = 4-15 d) and variable between species. Three species showed no response to any test solution, and most species did not respond for up to 5 d. Data were interpreted using an expert judgment response matrix with multiple lines of evidence to predict risk. No consistent patterns in the relative toxicity of test solutions, based on polar or nonpolar hydrocarbon concentrations, were identified. Although toxicity was observed in some species, this was only under worst-case conditions of undiluted, continuous, extended exposure. Natural dynamics of the site, including low groundwater discharge rates, high rainfall, and a highly energetic receiving environment, ensure groundwater is rapidly diluted and dispersed. In this context, and based on site conditions at the time of testing, these toxicity assessments provide robust evidence that residual contamination in groundwater at remediated sites at Macquarie Island is unlikely to represent a risk to the adjacent marine communities tested.

AB  - Exploring the role of belowground bud bank in plant adaptive strategies is essential for understanding the processes of vegetation regeneration under conditions of environmental disturbance and stress. Up to present, few studies have examined the response of bud bank size and composition to environmental stress and disturbance in sand dune environments. Here, three sand dune types (mobile, semi-fixed and fixed sand dunes), five dune positions (two characterized by severe, one by moderate and two by light water stress conditions), and two dune aspects (wind-erosion dune aspect and sand-burial dune aspect) were selected to test the hypothesis that aeolian activity disturbance and water stress play different roles in shaping the distribution of different bud bank types. One-way ANOVA and linear mixed effect models were applied to analyze the effect of dune type, position and aspect on bud bank density. We assessed how aeolian disturbance and water stress affect the regeneration capacity of bud bank in sand dunes. Our results showed that root-sprouting buds accounted for a larger proportion of the total number of buds in the windward aspect of the dunes, whereas filler buds were predominant in the leeward aspect of the dunes. Plants tended to produce more rhizome buds and root collar buds in the lowland. Therefore our study indicated that root-sprouting buds are more important in habitats with severe wind erosion disturbance, whereas filler buds are more important in the case of intensive sand burial disturbance; additionally, rhizome buds are proved more sensitive to water stress. The survival strategies and phenotypic responses observed here can be used to analyze indicators of population regeneration and should be carefully considered in sand dune management.

AB  - Where poor people rely on land that is degraded or vulnerable to degradation, they are at high risk of being locked into a downward spiral of poverty. It is estimated that over 1.5 billion people are affected by land degradation (UNCCD, 2014).
   The World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT) and Both ENDS and their networks of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), promote sustainable land management (SLM) as a necessary shift from degrading the land to sustainable use and restoration. However, many SLM initiatives started by communities remain below the radar of policy makers and government institutions and therefore, being unrecognised for what they are, do not get institutional support, i.e. an enabling policy environment, economic incentives, and the technical support that they need to develop and be adopted by others.
   This paper analyses the contribution of community-based initiatives to SDG15.3: Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN), and the three LDN indicators: land cover, land productivity and carbon stocks. In addition, enabling conditions for community-based initiatives to contribute to the implementation of LDN are identified and discussed. The contribution of community-based SLM initiatives to LDN will be illustrated by the SLM practices documented in WOCAT's global database and by the example of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR). It is concluded that community-based SLM initiatives can make a relevant contribution to addressing land degradation and achieving LDN, particularly so by improving land productivity and carbon stocks, and to some extent and in the case of FMNR, vegetation cover also. Creating enabling conditions for community-based initiatives to develop include: knowledge development by scientists, local communities and policy makers, inclusive land governance (land tenure security, strengthening institutions and the recognition of local knowledge), and access to technical and financial resources.

AB  - The pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a nuclear receptor belonging to the NR1I sub-family and a known master regulator of xenobiotic metabolism. New roles have been recently proposed in mammals through its activation by vitamin K (VK) such as regulation of glucose metabolism, bone homeostasis, reproduction, neuronal development and cognitive capacities. In marine fish species little is known about PXR and its potential roles. Here, expression patterns of pxr transcripts and conservation of protein domains were determined in the Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis), a marine flatfish model species in aquatic ecotoxicology. In addition to a full coding sequence transcript (sspxrl), two variants lacking DNA and/or ligand binding domains (sspxr2 and sspxr3) were also identified. The expression of sspxrl during early development and in adult tissues was ubiquitous, but highest levels were observed in liver, intestine and skin. Expression was also detected by in situ hybridization in chondrocytes and cells from the granular and inner nuclear layers in three month old fish. Finally, sspxrl expression was shown to be differentially regulated under physiological conditions related with fasting, VK and warfarin metabolism. The present work provides new and basic knowledge regarding pxr sequence and expression patterns in a marine flatfish species to unveil the potential impact of xenobiotics on marine fish physiology, and will allow a better and more ecosystemic environmental risk assessment of different pollutants over the marine environments with the development of reporter assays using PXR sequences from evolutionary distantly marine species (such as vertebrate and invertebrate marine species).

AB  - The aims are to evaluate morpho-anatomical bud development during dormancy and to compare the heat requirement needed to start bud break in several grapevine cultivars characterised by different geographic origins. A detailed description is presented of the bud growth stages of Vitis Vinifera cultivars to contribute to the standardisation of national and international testing systems of fruit growing. Based on the general BBCH-scale, the codes describe the first stages of budbreak in several cultivars with different geographical origins. Dormancy release was evaluated both under natural and forcing conditions, appropriate method to establish the budbreak of deciduous species. The cultivars were characterised in relation to the achievement of complete bud scale opening stage (03 of BBCH scale) which is suggested to consider as an early and indicator of budbreak.

AB  - Following the Limitation of phosphorus inputs, total phosphorus concentrations decreased substantially between 1980 and 1990 in four lakes of western Switzerland. Tubificid and lumbriculid communities of Lakes Geneva and Neuchatel responded clearly to this decrease. Indeed, mean relative abundance of species typical of oligotrophic conditions (mostly Stylodrilus heringianus and Spirosperma velutinus) doubled in oligochaete communities of both these deep lakes (> 40 m). These changes indicated that both lakes were meso-eutrophic around 1980, but mesotrophic since 1990. In contrast, oligochaete communities of Lakes Morat and Joux, which consisted mostly of tolerant species (Tubifex: tubifex, Potamothrix hammoniensis, and Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri), did not indicate an improvement of environmental conditions between 1980 and 1990. In Lake Joux the ratio of chironomid to oligochaete biomass was a more simple indicator of change than the species present in oligochaete communities.

AB  - Soundness of the human future depends on whether or not the human beings can establish the world system of "Sustainable Development". And the development of enclosed sea and its coastal area seems to be a just model of that of the finite globe. The "Sustainable Development" system established at these model areas should be extended to the whole world.
   Indispensable three conditions for establishing the "Sustainable Development" have been indicated. (1) Establishment of a social system for assuring priority of environmental plan, (2) democratization of policy making process and establishment of a system for rightly functioning environmental assessment, (3) generalization of setting environmental assimilating capacity and conception on regulation of total emission.
   Environmental education as an important strategy for establishing the "Sustainable Development" and subjects for practising it are discussed.

AB  - This study evaluated the effects in the pain and sleep, and the clinic significance after an analytic-behavioral intervention to manage the condition of the physical and interpersonal environment related to pain. Four women with fibromyalgia and insomnia participated in a study with intervention withdrawal multiple baseline design and initial, intermediate, final, and follow-up assessments. Self-report instruments were used to assess pain intensity and disability, sleep quality, and insomnia severity, besides the actigraphy. Data showed that the intervention (20 sessions) was effective in reducing the sleep and pain problems in all participants by shifting two participants from clinical to non-clinical status in sleep indicators. The gains were maintained or increased in follow-up measures. However, the results should take into consideration the clinical condition and other variables that may have individually impacted the results.

AB  - This study quantitatively evaluates the dual operational-environmental performance of the ports in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region in China. Factor analysis is first applied to identify the common factors for comprehensively ranking the level of dual operational-environmental performance of each port. Environmental treatment, port conditions and development potential are identified as the common factors. The Port of Shenzhen is found to have the best performance in environmental treatment and development potential, while the Port of Guangzhou has the best fundamental conditions. Cluster analysis is then applied to compare the clusters of ports in the PRD region with and without 'green' elements. It is found that small and medium-sized ports need to respond the call of Chinese Government on provincial-level unified port platform to realise dual operational-environmental performance.

AB  - This paper aimed to establish the species diversity of earthworms (Oligochaeta: Lumbricidae) and the chemical composition of earthworm surface castings within an urban park from west side of Romania (Timioara City): Plevnei Park (45 degrees 44'58 '' N, 21 degrees 13'38 '' E). Eight lumbricid earthworm species have been identified: Lumbricus terrestris, Aporrectodea rosea, Aporrectodea longa, Aporrectodea caliginosa, Allolobophora chlorotica, Dendrobaena veneta, Dendrobaena octaedra, Dendrodrilus rubidus. Based on species incidence, several ecological indicators have been calculated: the constancy of earthworm species in the sampling areas, the SOrensen similarity of sampling points as species composition, and the Jaccard similarity (coenotic affinity) of the earthworm species within the sampled points. The surface castings have been analyzed for the following physical-chemical parameters: pH, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (N), plant available phosphorus (P), plant available potassium (K), and calcium water soluble (Ca). Because it is not yet clearly elucidated the casting behavior (surface or subsurface) of earthworms, and their feeding behavior, habitat behavior and casting behavior are not always clearly separated traits, and because until now it is insufficiently known how the environmental conditions affect the surface or subsurface casts production in earthworms, or how these conditions determine more than a single casting behavior for one species, there had been difficult to conclude which of the found species is responsible for the surface casting within the studied urban park. To find possible correlations existing between the physical-chemical parameters of the earthworm castings, Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall correlations (p<0.05) were calculated. The study revealed significant positive correlations between these chemical parameters of earthworm castings: pH-K, pH-TOC, and TOC-Ca.

AB  - Evolutionary theory predicts that clonal organisms are more susceptible to extinction than sexually reproducing organisms, due to low genetic variation and slow rates of evolution. In agreement, conservation management considers genetic variation as the ultimate measure of a population's ability to survive over time. However, clonal plants are among the oldest living organisms on our planet. Here, we test the hypothesis that clonal seagrass meadows display epigenetic variation that complements genetic variation as a source of phenotypic variation. In a clonal meadow of the seagrassZostera marina, we characterized DNA methylation among 42 shoots. We also sequenced the whole genome of 10 shoots to correlate methylation patterns with photosynthetic performance under exposure to and recovery from 27 degrees C, while controlling for somatic mutations. Here, we show for the first time that clonal seagrass shoots display DNA methylation variation that is independent from underlying genetic variation, and associated with variation in photosynthetic performance under experimental conditions. It remains unknown to what degree this association could be influenced by epigenetic responses to transplantation-related stress, given that the methylomes showed a strong shift under acclimation to laboratory conditions. The lack of untreated control samples in the heat stress experiment did not allow us to distinguish methylome shifts induced by acclimation from such induced by heat stress. Notwithstanding, the co-variation in DNA methylation and photosynthetic performance may be linkedviagene expression because methylation patterns varied in functionally relevant genes involved in photosynthesis, and in the repair and prevention of heat-induced protein damage. While genotypic diversity has been shown to enhance stress resilience in seagrass meadows, we suggest that epigenetic variation plays a similar role in meadows dominated by a single genotype. Consequently, conservation management of clonal plants should consider epigenetic variation as indicator of resilience and stability.

AB  - Mediterranean deltaic-coastal plains represent relatively underexplored depositional archives that record the Holocene response of vegetation and depositional systems to high-frequency climate changes. In this study, we examine a 25 m-thick succession of Holocene age (core EM2) recovered in the innermost portion of the Po delta plain of northern Italy, applying an integrated palyno-stratigraphic approach. The existence of a paludal, freshwater setting inland of the line of maximum marine transgression favoured a low degree of pollen transportation. Application of cluster analysis to this palynological record leads to the identification of pollen-derived biomes and seven (auto)ecological groups of taxa that discriminate environmental signal (depositional facies) and regional climate conditions within a well-dated coastal record. Percentage variations of hygrophytes, aquatics and pasture-meadow herbs reveal local environmental dynamics, enabling the detailed facies characterisation of the cored succession, especially in terms of water table conditions. Framed into a chronologically constrained, high-resolution facies context, the proportion of montane taxa (climate degradation indicator) relative to Mediterranean taxa and Quercus + other deciduous trees (climate optimum indicators) highlight a vegetation-climate variability in the plain that fits with Bond events, especially for the early-mid Holocene (i.e., Preboreal and Boreal Oscillation, 8.2 ka event), supporting a strong Mediterranean-North Atlantic climate connection. For the first time, pollen from a continental succession of the Adriatic area clearly depicts the effects of the 8.2 ka cooling event on vegetation patterns (progressive degradation in high altitude communities) and depositional dynamics (increased fluvial activity), assessing the major role played by climate changes in shaping coastal landscapes in addition to glacio-eustatic variations.

AB  - The end-Devonian Hangenberg Crisis constituted one of the greatest ecological and environmental perturbations of the Paleozoic Era. To date, however, it has been difficult to precisely constrain the occurrence of the Hangenberg Crisis in the Appalachian Basin of the United States and thus to directly assess the effects of this crisis on marine microbial communities and paleoenvironmental conditions. Here, we integrate organic and inorganic chemostratigraphic records compiled from two discrete outcrop locations to characterize the onset and paleoenvironmental transitions associated with the Hangenberg Crisis within the Cleveland Shale member of the Ohio Shale. The upper Cleveland Shale records both positive carbon (delta C-13(org)) and nitrogen (delta N-15(total)) isotopic excursions, and replenished trace metal inventories with links to eustatic rise. These dual but apparently temporally offset isotope excursions may be useful for stratigraphic correlation with other productive end-Devonian epeiric marine locations. Deposition of the black shale succession occurred locally beneath a redox-stratified water column with euxinic zones, with signs of strengthening denitrification during the Hangenberg Crisis interval, but with an otherwise stable and algal-rich marine microbial community structure sustained in the surface mixed layer as ascertained by lipid biomarker assemblages. Discernible trace fossil signals in some horizons suggest, however, that bioturbation and seafloor oxygenation occurred episodically throughout this succession and highlight that geochemical proxies often fail to capture these rapid and sporadic redox fluctuations in ancient black shales. The paleoenvironmental conditions, source biota, and accumulations of black shale are consistent with expressions of the Hangenberg Crisis globally, suggesting this event is likely captured within the uppermost strata of the Cleveland Shale in North America.

AB  - Accurately estimating aboveground vegetation biomass productivity is essential for local ecosystem assessment and best land management practice. Satellite-derived growing season time-integrated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GSN) has been used as a proxy for vegetation biomass productivity. A 250-m grassland biomass productivity map for the Greater Platte River Basin had been developed based on the relationship between Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GSN and Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) annual grassland productivity. However, the 250-m MODIS grassland biomass productivity map does not capture detailed ecological features (or patterns) and may result in only generalized estimation of the regional total productivity. Developing a high or moderate spatial resolution (e.g., 30-m) productivity map to better understand the regional detailed vegetation condition and ecosystem services is preferred. The 30-m Landsat data provide spatial detail for characterizing human-scale processes and have been successfully used for land cover and land change studies. The main goal of this study is to develop a 30-m grassland biomass productivity estimation map for central Nebraska, leveraging 250-m MODIS GSN and 30-m Landsat data. A rule-based piecewise regression GSN model based on MODIS and Landsat (r = 0.91) was developed, and a 30-m MODIS equivalent GSN map was generated. Finally, a 30-m grassland biomass productivity estimation map, which provides spatially detailed ecological features and conditions for central Nebraska, was produced. The resulting 30-m grassland productivity map was generally supported by the SSURGO biomass production map and will be useful for regional ecosystem study and local land management practices.

AB  - Local observations of ecological change are important in developing tools for rangeland management and filling in gaps where quantitative data are lacking. Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) is a potential source of information that can complement scientific knowledge. It may also allow policy makers and scientists to suggest responses that will be locally relevant, and therefore effective on the ground. We conducted 40 surveys with the use of closed-ended questionnaires followed by open-ended qualitative questions with herders in two soum (administrative districts), located in the steppe and forest steppe of Mongolia. Respondents were asked about their observations of rangeland change and its causes in the last 20 yr. Across the study areas, a strong majority (75%) of all herders reported that rangeland condition was much worse than 20 yr ago. Herders in both soum reported increases in undesirable plant species, declines in species richness, and the disappearance or decreasing abundance of specific desirable plant species. Comparing the two soum, more herders in the forest-steppe site (90%) reported that rangeland condition was much worse than reported by herders in the steppe site (65%). In qualitative responses to open-ended questions, herders identified multiple indicators of and causes behind degradation, including very heavy grazing. In a large, sparsely populated country like Mongolia, herders' observations may serve as an early warning of rangeland change, provide insights into causes of change, and identify key uncertainties. Community-based rangeland management organizations (CBRMs) could help to translate herder observations into action by participating in formal monitoring based on herder-identified indicators and implementing changes in management in response to observed change. However, herders cannot address all issues that might be contributing to troubling ecological trends without higher-level policy coordinating rangeland monitoring and herder movements at regional and national scales.

AB  - Modelling of environmental impacts from the application of treated organic Municipal solid waste (MSW) in agriculture differs widely between different models for environmental assessment of waste systems. In this comparative Study five models were examined concerning quantification and impact assessment of environmental effects from land application of treated organic MSW: DST (Decision Support Tool, USA), IWM (Integrated Waste Management, UK), THE IFEU PROJECT (Germany), ORWARE (ORganic WAste REsearch, Sweden) and EASEWASTE (Environmental Assessment of Solid Waste Systems and Technologies, Denmark). DST and IWM are life cycle inventory (LCI) models, thus not performing actual impact assessment. The DST model includes only one water emission (biological oxygen demand) from compost leaching in the results and IWM considers only air emissions from avoided production of commercial fertilizers. THE IFEU PROJECT, ORWARE and EASEWASTE are life cycle assessment (LCA) models containing more detailed land application modules. A case Study estimating the environmental impacts from land application of 1 ton of composted Source sorted organic household waste was performed to compare the results from the different models and investigate the origin of any difference in type or magnitude of the results. The contributions from the LCI models were limited and did not depend on waste composition or local agricultural conditions. The three LCA models use the same overall approach for quantifying the impacts of the system. However, due to slightly different assumptions, quantification methods and environmental impact assessment, the obtained results varied clearly between the models. Furthermore, local conditions (e.g. soil type, farm type, climate and legal regulation) and waste composition strongly influenced the results of the environmental assessment.

AB  - Hedgerow plant communities, including herbaceous species growing in the hedge base, are important conservation indicators of hedgerow habitat condition. The effects of management have the potential to alter the species richness and composition of hedgerow plant communities, but this has not previously been tested experimentally. A novel field experiment was used to test the effects of hedgerow management on hedgerow basal flora. Hedgerow cutting treatments, including relaxed cutting regimes funded under agri-environment schemes, were applied in replicated blocks at four sites in lowland UK. After 6 years of experimental cutting treatments the hedgerow plant communities were surveyed, both directly under the woody hedgerow vegetation and immediately adjacent to the hedges. For hedgerow plots cut in autumn, a reduced intensity cutting regime (incremental cutting) resulted in an average reduction of one species and a small shift towards plants typical of less fertile conditions, compared to cutting back to a standard height and width. Hedgerow plots cut in late winter had a plant community typical of slightly shadier conditions, compared with those cut in autumn. Hedgerow cutting management can thus alter the richness and composition of plant communities, over relatively short timescales. These results are discussed in the context of longer term trends in hedgerow plant communities across northern Europe, and conservation management funded under agri-environment schemes.

AB  - Archaeological sites are essentially submitted to decay phenomena inherent on their history as well as the environment to which they are exposed after excavation. The history of such archaeological sites is particularly related to their long-term underground conservation conditions during which they were subject to salt migration into the architectural remains.
   It is well known that soluble salts present in building materials can cause damage, mainly by producing stresses in the substrate. A lot of research has been done in the past concerning the behaviour of salts in built constructions. However, most studies include single salts, of which the deliquescence points are well documented, while in situ one mostly finds complex salt mixtures, which makes the conservation strategy much more intricate.
   The environmental conditions to minimize damage of salt-laden porous building materials can be modelled using a computer program ECOS capable of predicting the crystallization behaviour of salt mixtures. To use the model data of quantitative salt analyses are required as input. The program is then able to predict from a thermodynamic point of view which minerals will exist in the solid state under specified climatic conditions.
   This paper deals with the results of a systematic investigation of the salt contamination of the building materials of the Coudenberg site and a prediction of the behaviour of the salt mixture related to the actual climate, as part of the environmental assessment.

AB  - A direct exposure method to detect mutagenicity of car exhausts was applied to study the influence of the running conditions of a diesel engine functioning on an assay platform. Biological and physico-chemical approaches were carried out together to appreciate the quality of diesel emissions. Exhausts, emitted by a diesel engine (Renault, 2068 cm3) were sampled from a dilution tube connected to a constant volume sampler. Regulated pollutants (CO, NO(x), HC and particles) and some non-regulated pollutants (monoaromatic hydrocarbons (MAH) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), aldehydes) were analysed when the engine ran al different operating conditions of load (full, 3/4, 2/4 and 1/4) and of engine speed (from 1000 to 4000 rev./min). The mutagenicity (Ames test) of diesel exhaust was assessed by a direct exposure method which does not need extraction of the particles. Bacteria are pre-seeded onto the agar plate and exposed directly to the diesel exhausts parallelly to the measurements of pollutants. The engine speed and the load influence the level, the composition and the induced mutagenicity of the diesel emissions and the results show that: when engine speed increases all the gaz phase indicators increase independantly of the load, those of the particulate phase and mutagenicity increase at low load but decrease at full load; when load increase, all the indicators of both phases decrease except NO(x) which increases.

AB  - Solar radiation is the ultimate source of energy flowing through the atmosphere; it fuels all atmospheric motions. The visible-wavelength range of solar radiation represents a significant contribution to the earth's energy budget, and visible light is a vital indicator for the composition and thermodynamic processes of the atmosphere from the smallest weather scales to the largest climate scales. The accurate and fast description of light propagation in the atmosphere and its lower-boundary environment is therefore of critical importance for the simulation and prediction of weather and climate.
   Simulated Weather Imagery (SWIm) is a new, fast, and physically based visible-wavelength three-dimensional radiative transfer model. Given the location and intensity of the sources of light (natural or artificial) and the composition (e.g., clear or turbid air with aerosols, liquid or ice clouds, precipitating rain, snow, and ice hydrometeors) of the atmosphere, it describes the propagation of light and produces visually and physically realistic hemispheric or 360 degrees spherical panoramic color images of the atmosphere and the underlying terrain from any specified vantage point either on or above the earth's surface.
   Applications of SWIm include the visualization of atmospheric and land surface conditions simulated or forecast by numerical weather or climate analysis and prediction systems for either scientific or lay audiences. Simulated SWIm imagery can also be generated for and compared with observed camera images to (i) assess the fidelity and (ii) im-prove the performance of numerical atmospheric and land surface models. Through the use of the latter in a data assimilation scheme, it can also (iii) improve the estimate of the state of atmospheric and land surface initial conditions for situational awareness and numerical weather prediction forecast initialization purposes.

AB  - Soil-archeological studies were performed in the area of the ancient Russian settlement Sorokino 1 dating back to the 13th century AD and located in the upper reaches of the Orlik River (Khotynets district, Orel oblast) within the natural zone of deciduous forests. Morphological, physical, and chemical properties of soils associated with the archeological monument and with the background area under the forest were analyzed. Phytolith spectra and the radiocarbon age of soil organic matter were determined in the paleosols of the archeological monument and in the background surface soils. A comparative analysis of the soil features-indicators of the environment-allowed us to determine and characterize the main stages of the formation of soils and landscapes under the influence of climate changes and anthropogenic factors. Climate-related alternation of the phases of steppe and forest development in the study area was revealed. Steppe conditions in the Boreal period of the Holocene were replaced by the spreading of deciduous forests in the Holocene Optimum (Middle Atlantic period). At the end of the Atlantic period, steppe landscapes reappeared in the area, which was reflected in the intensification of the activity of steppe burrowers (mole rats) in the soil profiles. Steppe formation in river valleys during the Medieval Climatic Optimum was replaced by the propagation of forests in the subsequent Little Ice Age. The analysis of phytolith complexes of different ages indicated that the forests growing in the studied area in the Late Holocene included both deciduous and coniferous trees and reflected cooler climatic conditions in comparison with the deciduous forests without conifers of the Atlantic Optimum. In the recent centuries of the active agricultural development, forests have been replaced by arable land and hayfields, which has led to the formation of chernozems in the areas previously occupied by dark gray forest soils (Luvic Greyzemic Phaeozems).

AB  - We evaluate the role of differences in substrate age and environmental conditions, as represented by different geological units, in determining the phylogenetic structure and distribution of tree communities in the northwest Amazon. We used 412 0.1-ha plots distributed across the three main geological units (craton, tertiary and alluvial) in the Colombian Amazon, to answer the following research questions: i) To what extent do environmental filtering and dispersal limitation determine the phylogenetic composition of tree communities across geological units in the Colombian Amazon? and ii) Are there differences between geological units in the extent to which niche conservatism shapes the phylogenetic structure of indicator species (i.e., strong habitat-specialists) in tree communities? The results of our study give support for both environmental filtering and dispersal being important drivers of the phylogenetic structure and turnover of tree communities. Nonetheless, the extent to which geology explained the phylogenetic turnover of tree communities was surpassed by the geographic distance between plots, which was used to account for effects of dispersal limitation. This finding suggests that most of the lineages have had sufficient time to migrate and establish into adjacent geological units, contradicting claims that geological conditions are the dominant factors determining the distribution of tree communities across northwestern Amazonia. However, in the craton unit, indicator species were more closely related than expected by chance, while in the alluvial and tertiary units, observed relationships were not statistically different from null expectations. These results indicate that environmental filtering is asymmetrical among geological units, with the craton environment being the most restrictive. In contrast, the alluvial unit may be relatively easy to colonize and hence ecological strategies may be more labile through evolutionary history.

AB  - Environmental stress in plants impacts many biological processes, including male gametogenesis, and affects several cytological mechanisms that are strongly interrelated. To understand the likely impact of rising temperature on reproductive fitness in the climate change regime, a study of tapetal mitosis and its accompanying meiosis over seasons was made to elucidate the influence of temperature change on the cytological events occurring during microsporogenesis. For this we used two species of an environmentally sensitive plant system, i.e., genus Cymbopogon Sprengel (Poaceae), namely Cymbopogon nardus (L.) Rendle var. confertiflorus (Steud.) Bor (2n = 20) and Cymbopogon jwaruncusha (Jones) Schult. (2n = 20). Both species flower profusely during extreme summer (48 degrees C) and mild winter (15 degrees C) but support low and high seed fertility, respectively, in the two seasons. We have shown that tapetal mitotic patterns over seasons entail differential behavior for tapetal mitosis. During the process of tapetum development there are episodes of endomitosis that form either (i) an endopolyploid genomically imbalanced uninucleate and multinucleate tapetum, and (or) (ii) an acytokinetic multinucleate genomically balanced tapetum, with the progression of meiosis in the accompanying sporogenous tissue. The relative frequency of occurrence of the two types of tapetum mitosis patterns is significantly different in the two seasons, and it is found to be correlated with the temperature conditions. Whereas, the former (genomically imbalanced tapetum) are prevalent during the hot summer, the latter (genomically balanced tapetum) are frequent under optimal conditions. Such a differential behaviour in tapetal mitosis vis-a-vis temperature change is also correspondingly accompanied by substantial disturbances or regularity in meiotic anaphase disjunction. Both species show similar patterns. The study underpins that tapetal mitotic behaviour per se could be a reasonable indicator to elucidate the effect of climate change on reproductive fitness.

AB  - Few studies have looked jointly at the effects of larval stressors on life history and physiology across metamorphosis, especially in tropical insects. Here we investigated how the variation of food availability during the larval stage of the tropical and territorial American rubyspot damselfly (Hetaerina americana) affects adult body size and body mass, and two physiological indicators of condition - phenoloxidase activity (an indicator of immune ability) and protein concentration. We also investigated whether larval developmental time is prolonged when food is scarce, an expected situation for tropical species whose larval time is less constrained, compared to temperate species. Second instar larvae were collected from their natural environments and reared in one of two diet regimes: (i) "rich" provided with five Artemia sauna prey every day, and (ii) "poor" provided with two A. sauna prey every day. In order to compare how distinct our treatments were from natural conditions, a second set of last-instar larvae were also collected and allowed to emerge. Only body size and phenoloxidase increased in the rich regime, possibly to prioritize investment on sexually selected traits (which increase mating opportunities), and immune ability, given pathogen pressure. The sexes did not differ in body size in relation to food regimes but they did differ in body mass and protein concentration; this can be explained on the basis of the energetically demanding territorial activities by males (for the case of body mass), and female allocation to egg production (for the case of protein). Finally, animals delayed larval development when food was scarce, which is coherent for tropical environments. These findings provide key insights in the role of food availability in a tropical species. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study adopts the "syndrome approach", originally defined by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), (Downing et al., 2002) to assess and map rural land abandonment (RLA), that occurred during the period 1990-2005 within the wider Mediterranean area. The basic idea behind the syndrome approach is to describe change processes by archetypical, dynamic, and co-evolutionary patterns of civilization-nature interactions. In the frame of the Rural Exodus Syndrome the RLA can be interpreted as the occurrence of environmental degradation through the abandonment of traditional agricultural practices. Multi-source spatial data, including biophysical-related variables mainly derived from Earth Observation as well as socio-economical GIS-based data, were used to define proxies for expected underlying processes and drivers of the mentioned syndrome. The analysis of data is rooted in the fuzzy set theory and approximate reasoning techniques which allows for the handling of uncertain and imprecise knowledge of environmental systems. Generalized Conjunction/Disjunction operators (GCD) were applied to compute intermediate indicator score maps representing the conditions that may affect the RLA, and a bipolar operator was used to combine mandatory and favouring conditions with the aim of generating a RLA indicator. The indicator expresses the detailed location and severity, or degree, of the syndrome. The Northern Mediterranean was generally found to suffer from RLA to a distinctly higher degree than the Southern Mediterranean. Reported abandonment studies from the existing literature, the European CORINE land cover map, and the Less Favoured Areas (LFA) map all supported the findings by confirming plausibility through convergence of evidence from comparisons with different types of independent information. This spatially highly-detailed results obtained may be of particular interest to policy and decision makers involved in rural development planning in the conceived areas. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the last couple of decades, studies have examined the potential environmental risks associated with reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) management through a range of approaches. Variable risk assessment methodologies and uncertainty on RAP behavior in a stockpile or during reuse have led to inconsistent regulatory oversight in many jurisdictions. The objective of this literature review is to provide clarity on the findings pertaining to RAP leaching and assess the potential human and environmental health risks associated with reported constituent mobility from RAP. The reviewed literature focuses on the leaching of metals and organic compounds; direct ex-posure risk was briefly reviewed and found not to exceed natural soils or aggregates. On occasion, the literature reports elevated leached concentrations of certain metals (e.g., lead) and some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from a few RAP samples. These elevated RAP leachate concentrations are assessed via fate and transport model (US EPA IWEM) to estimate dilution and attenuation of select metals and PAHs under typical environmen-tal conditions and reuse or storage scenarios (e.g., stockpiling). This analysis suggests that most reported leachate concentrations of potential concern would be effectively attenuated at the most conservative conditions simu-lated (10 m, 100% infiltration); limitations with modeling are acknowledged. Pavement materials and external sources, along with chosen testing protocols, influence RAP leachate concentrations, affecting conclusions for po-tential environmental impacts of RAP in the literature. Understanding how these variables impact leaching and risk assessment is necessary to maximize and continue beneficial reuse of RAP while safeguarding human and environmental health.

AB  - The main criteria for the functioning of agronomic phytocoenosis are indicators of their economic and energy efficiency. In particular, the issues of manufacturability and rational use of sown areas during the growing season characterize the level of agronomic culture in a particular geographical area. Under these conditions, it is important to study the possibility of joint cultivation of agricultural plants, which will reduce energy consumption, improve the phytosanitary condition of crops and increase the profitability of agricultural production. When growing tomatoes in compatible crops, it is necessary to take into account not only aspects of technology, but also the interaction of plants with each other at the level of physiological and biochemical processes. That is why allelopathic relationship between plants, due to the physiologically active substances they secrete at the initial stage of ontogenesis, is not without the interest. It is the scientific basis for the development of sound crop rotation and mixed (compacted) crops, and also helps to increase the productivity of agro- and natural coenoses in order to prevent soil fatigue in monoculture, control weeds, pests, phytopathogenic organisms, etc. Allelopathic substances (collins) of some plant species cause different reactions to other species: some of them have active growth, others have suppressed growth processes, and still others remain neutral to such effects. The stimulating effect is manifested in the awakening of seeds, strengthening of growth processes and the formation of seedling organs. In future this fact will lead to the activation of plant development and an increase in their productivity. At the same time, mutual oppression of plants cannot be ruled out, which can be detected during laboratory studies using biological tests. Field studies of compatible (compacted) crops of tomato with other plants (sugar corn, shallots) were performed using allelopathic testing methods according to Grodzinsky. The expediency and economic efficiency of growing tomatoes in compatible crops with shallots on a green feather have been experimentally proved using statistical methods.

AB  - Cellular stress responses consist of a complex network of pathways and linked processes that, when perturbed, are postulated to have roles in the pathogenesis of various human diseases. To assess the impact of environmental insults upon this network, we developed a novel stress response resolution (SRR) assay for investigation of cellular stress resolution outcomes and the effects of environmental agents and conditions thereupon. SRR assay-based criteria identified three distinct groups of surviving cell clones, including those resembling parental cells, those showing Hprt/HPRT mutations, and a third type, Phenotype-altered clones, that occurred predominantly in cells pretreated with a chemical mutagen, was heterogeneous in nature, and expressed significant alterations in cell morphology and/or function compared with parental cells. Further evaluation of Phenotype-altered clones found evidence of various alterations that resembled epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, phenotype switching, checkpoint dysfunction, senescence barrier bypass, and/or epigenetic reprogramming. Phenotype-altered clones were found to occur spontaneously in a cell line with a mutator phenotype, to represent the major surviving clone type in a variation of the SRR assay, and to be tumorigenic in nude mice. Assessment of SRR assay final results showed that pretreatment with a chemical mutagen induced significant changes in cellular stress response prosurvival capacity, in damage avoidance versus damage tolerance stress resolution outcomes, and in the damage burden in the final surviving cell populations. Taken together, these results support the conclusion that use of the SRR assay can provide novel insights into the role of environmental insults in the pathogenesis of cancer and other human diseases.

AB  - The nature of soil iron oxides is of great interest from the viewpoints of both pedogenesis and environmental geochemistry as they are sensitive diagnostic indicators of soil hydromorphism on the one hand, and exhibit high sorption capacity for many toxic metal pollutants on the other. In this study, the association of 17 trace elements (Al, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, K, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Si, Sr, Ti, V and Zn) with Fe-rich nodules from a neutral-alkaline floodplain soil using various chemical extractions and dissolution analyses was investigated.
   The Fe-rich nodules consist of amorphous phases, probably of ferrihydrite. Other phases in the nodules are corresponding to those forming the soil matrix. Additionally, disordered goethite was found in the pseudomorphs after amphiboles. These amphiboles may have been the source of iron for nodule formation in this soil. Cobalt and Mn showed the highest enrichment in the nodules when compared to their total soil concentrations. Other metals, such as Cd, Ba, Ni, V, Zn, Cu and Pb can be characterized much smaller accumulation similarly to Fe. Additionally, Al, Mg, Si, Ti, K and Cr (e.g. elements bound to silicates and oxides), as well as Ca and Sr (e.g. elements bound to carbonates) also showed similar behavior during the extractions.
   At the neutral-slightly alkaline conditions of the studied soil, the effect of pH may overwrite that of hydromorphism on trace metal accumulation in the Fe-rich nodules. Due to the intense sorption on and co-precipitation with oxide phases at these pH conditions, as well as the re-crystallization of oxides during the redox cycles, most of the cationic metals prefer Fe oxides over Mn oxides in their accumulation.

AB  - In semiarid rangelands, continuous grazing may decrease vegetation cover, accelerating soil erosion and eventually causing a transition to an alternative, degraded state. State-and-transition models invoke process-based explanations of alternative states, but there are few examples that use empirical data on key factors and processes. We used rainfall simulation to determine 1) the relationships between soil surface characteristics and interrill erosion in 3 spatially related plant communities: stable grass with scattered shrubs (GS), degraded grass with scattered shrubs (I)GS), and degraded shrub steppes (DSS), and 2) the site conservation threshold (SCT) of this rangeland. We also analyzed the effect of past erosion on soil and vegetation characteristics. In the GS, sediment production and sediment concentration were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than in the DGS and the DSS. The main soil protection factors in the GS and in the DGS were perennial grass and litter cover, while in the DSS, gravel cover became the main soil protection factor. The SCT, the point at which the rate of soil erosion increases markedly, corresponded to a plant-and-litter cover close to 90% and occurred within the DGS. Although this plant community may reverse back to the conserved GS, long-term accelerated erosion may result in enough soil loss to trigger irreversible changes and prompt the transition to the DSS. The threshold underlying this transition would be reached when the A horizon is severely reduced by erosion. Under these conditions, the soil hydrological properties are affected irreversibly, preventing perennial grass establishment. While the GS represents a resource conserving plant community, desirable for both forage production and soil protection, the DSS represents a dysfunctional state with a minimum forage value. The DGS represents an unstable and transitional community that, without management intervention to halt soil erosion, will likely change into the DSS.

AB  - The effect of land use change, from arable to abandoned pasture, on soil properties and vegetation establishment was studied in hilly areas of the island of Lesvos. The main purpose of this study was to establish key indicators or land parameters that can be used for defining environmentally sensitive areas to desertification. 106 soil sites were selected in fields cultivated or non-cultivated for 40-45 years and measurements related to protection from land degradation after abandonment, such as fertility status (organic matter content, pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), exchangeable potassium and sodium), water storage capacity (soil water retention characteristics, soil depth), erosion resistance (soil aggregate stability), and vegetation characteristics (plant species, extent of vegetation cover) were conducted. The selected sites were located on a variety of parent materials such as volcanic lava, pyroclastics, ignimbrite, schist-marble, and shale. The obtained data indicated that soil pH, and CEC were slightly affected after abandonment as compared to the cultivated soils. Levels of exchangeable sodium and potassium were higher in cultivated soils. Organic matter content and soil aggregate stability were greatly enhanced in most of the abandoned soils. Physical characteristics of the parent material greatly influenced the establishment of the natural vegetation. A critical minimum soil depth of 25-30 cm was measured. On mole shallow soils, the associated natural perennial vegetation cover was rapidly reduced, under the prevailing climatic conditions of the study area. Reduction of vegetation cover was related to the parent material. Perennial vegetation was not supported at all on soils below a crucial depth, ranging from 4 to 10 cm, depending on the parent material. This study showed that soil depth is the most important parameter which has to be considered in planning land use change from arable to unmanaged pasture under the soil and climatic conditions of the study area.

AB  - The depletion of fossil fuels and environmental pollution (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions) through the combustion of fossil fuels have stimulated studies on new technologies able to curtail the energy consumption of existing fractionation units. In this regard, heat pumps have garnered substantial attention due to their potential to improve the process energy efficiency. This study aims to provide extensive economic analysis and environmental impact assessment of the application of heat pumps under different conditions and scenarios. For this purpose, we first selected three important conditions: feed composition, plant capacity, and fuel price. Then, we performed a range of analyses to identify the major costs and environmental drivers. The economics and environmental impact of heat pump-assisted distillation was investigated and compared with those of conventional distillation.

AB  - Hematology is an important pathological and diagnostic tool. This paper describes the hematological parameters of 76 specimens of Hoplias malabaricus infested with monogenean parasites, which were collected from two lagoons. The hematological parameters included: erythrocyte count (Er), microhematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin (Hb), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). The blood parameters showed no significant changes associated with the infestation. Water temperature was found to be negatively correlated with MCV and Hct, with values of r(s) = -0.52, p<0.0001 and r(s) = -0.48, p<0.0001, respectively. The mean Relative Condition Factor was Kn=1.01, indicating good health conditions of the fish in these lagoons. No correlation was found between the monogenean infestation and the blood parameters, or between the environmental factors and the monogeneans.

AB  - Chironomid larvae are important components of aquatic biota, due to their abundance and participation in food webs, and because the v are considered environmental bioindicators. Manv laboratory studies have analyzed the effects of pollutants on chironomids, especially on Chironomus calligraphus Goeldi, 1905. However, little is known about the life cycle attributes of Chironomidae (Diptera). The main pourpose of this study was to analyze C. calligraphus life cycle under laboratory, conditions. The growth rate was almost constant between larval instars (r= 1.60 +/- 0.02), the immature development time (D) was 15 days and the minimum generation time (G) was 18 days. According to these results and field observations C. calligraphus has a temperature-dependent life cycle, with several overlapped short duration cohorts in spring-summer followed by one or two generations of longer duration in winter.

AB  - Forest-dependent communities can be exemplified in terms of subsistence dependence, park-based tourism dependence, or traditional logging dependence. In monitoring the sustainability of these places, researchers have struggled to develop relevant indicators responsive to their unique social, economic, and environmental conditions. In this study, we attempt to deal with these conditions by employing a quality-of-life framework in the selection of local-level indicators, and by scrutinizing these indicators in term of their relevance to specific sustainability concerns. We used workshops, an indicator evaluation framework, and survey research to identify relevant local-level indicators of sustainability in two Saskatchewan communities. Findings emphasize the need for caution in asserting the utility of ``one-size-fits-all'' approaches to community sustainability. These communities define progress toward sustainability quite differently and therefore require a unique set of progress measures.

AB  - The article problematizes the relationship in Bogota between the distribution of socioeconomic groups according to their quality of life and the distribution of trees, as evidence of environmental injustice. From the territorial analysis of Bogota's urban structure, quality of life indicators are calculated which are related through the use of econometric techniques with the distribution of trees in the city. It is found that the characteristics of the urban model of Bogota present a close relationship between the spatial patterns of socioeconomic segregation of the population with low quality of life and low distribution of trees per person. It is concluded that the city presents a condition of environmental injustice at a spatial level, to the benefit of populations with greater urban living conditions.

AB  - The study of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in living organisms has produced contradictory results over the past few decades of research. Though the protocol for measuring FA is firmly established, the sources of FA remain unclear in many cases. Our goal is to examine the relationship between FA and both the concentration of biomarkers of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and body condition in a medium-sized mammal, the European wild boar (Sus scrofa). Using a Partial Least Squares regression (PLSr), we found a positive significant relationship (Stone-Geisser test) between oxidative stress and FA but a negative relationship between oxidative stress and body condition. Our results suggest that FA can be used to assess the physiological costs associated with oxidative stress in mammals. (C) 2015 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - The Karkloof blue butterfly, Orachrysops ariadne (Butler) (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae), is endemic to the Mistbelt grassland of KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa, and is currently Red-listed as Vulnerable. This study compares the ecological conditions at the four known colonies to assist in making informed decisions regarding its conservation A large proportion of the grassland in KwaZulu-Natal has been afforested and cultivated, and at least 92% of the Mistbelt has been transformed, with only about 1% in good condition remaining. Predictions on the habitat requirements of this species a re necessary for developing a conservation strategy and action plan. Here, we also propose O. ariadne as an indicator species for quality Mistbelt grassland. Saving enough of the remaining Mistbelt grassland is crucial, not just for the survival of O. ariadne, but also for the Mistbelt grassland community a,; a whole.

AB  - Desalination technologies play a vital role in water production. Along with the production of clean drinking water, desalination plants produce waste in the form of hypersaline water or brine which may harm the surrounding environment. This paper proposes a method of brine management using microalgae. The alga species Nannochloropsis sp. was tested for its ability to grow in high salt stress conditions, up to 80 g L-1, and in desalination brine with concentration of 70 g L-1. Interestingly, four- and five-fold increases in biomass were observed in salt stress conditions of 60, 70, and 80 g L-1. In the case of the desalination brine conditions, Nannochloropsis sp. growth resulted in comparable biomass values to the salt stress experiments, proving that algal growth was not inhibited due to the presence of brine. For cost efficiency, further research was conducted to optimize the concentration and components of the brine-nutrient medium. The best growth was obtained in the optimized brine-based F/2 medium (B-UV), which was scaled up and tested for its bio-desalination and bio- fuel capacities. Biomass productivity and lipid productivity were found to be 0.05 +/- 0.016 g L-1 d(-1) and 9.5% +/- 2.1% w/w, respectively. This study presents a cost-effective sustainable method for brine management through which value is created.

KW  - PROJECT-ICSAP
AB  - Introduction Hospitalisation for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions (HACSCs) is frequently used as an indicator of the quality and effectiveness of primary healthcare (PHC) services around the world. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the PHC model (family health strategy (FHS) x conventional) and the availability of specialised PHC physicians is associated or not with total hospitalisation or HACSCs in the National Health System (SUS) of the municipality of Curitiba, Parana state (PR), Brazil.
   Methodology This is a cross-sectional ecological study using multiple linear regression with socioeconomic and professional data from municipal health units (MHUs) between 1 April 2014 and 31 March 2015.
   Results After adjustment for age and sex and control of socioeconomic variables, the FHS model was associated with six fewer HACSCs a year per 10 000 inhabitants in relation to the conventional model and the availability of one family physician at each FHS model MHU per 10 000 inhabitants was associated with 1.1 fewer HACSCs for heart failure a year per 10 000 inhabitants. Basic specialists (clinicians, paediatricians and obstetrician/gynaecologists) and subspecialists showed no significant association with HACSC rates.
   Conclusion These results obtained in a major Brazilian city reinforce the role of FHS as a priority PHC model in the country and indicate the potentially significant impact of specialising in family medicine on improving the health conditions of the population.

AB  - Measurements of body size and mass are fundamental to pinniped population management and research. Manual measurements tend to be accurate but are invasive and logistically challenging to obtain. Ground-based photogrammetric techniques are less invasive, but inherent limitations make them impractical for many field applications. The recent proliferation of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) in wildlife monitoring has provided a promising new platform for the photogrammetry of free-ranging pinnipeds. Leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) are an apex predator in coastal Antarctica whose body condition could be a valuable indicator of ecosystem health. We aerially surveyed leopard seals of known body size and mass to test the precision and accuracy of photogrammetry from a small UAS. Flights were conducted in January and February of 2013 and 2014 and 50 photogrammetric samples were obtained from 15 unrestrained seals. UAS-derived measurements of standard length were accurate to within 2.01 +/- 1.06%, and paired comparisons with ground measurements were statistically indistinguishable. An allometric linear mixed effects model predicted leopard seal mass within 19.40 kg (4.4% error for a 440 kg seal). Photogrammetric measurements from a single, vertical image obtained using UAS provide a noninvasive approach for estimating the mass and body condition of pinnipeds that may be widely applicable.

AB  - The focus of this paper is on how water distribution systems can be made more resilient and adaptable, thus reducing their vulnerability to future changes. A performance evaluation methodology is outlined and used to assess the resilience of today's water infrastructure and its vulnerability to future changes, based on adopting four future scenarios, suitably adapted to represent future water demand states. The results highlight the sensitivity of key performance indicators to a range of future conditions relative to current conditions. The concept of future proofing is introduced and three strategies compared to design/re-design and operate the network, building in varying degrees of adaptive capacity to deliver solutions that are feasible under both today's and tomorrow's conditions. The key findings are that, without any intervention, all solutions are feasible when demand is equal to or less than the design case while resilience of the system improves for small decrease in demand, major reduction in demand shows a big improvement in water quality. Three future proofing strategies, namely operation, designed in operation and multistage design and operation show great potential to create flexibility that allows for operational diversity in the short term while trying to achieve long-term goals. The multistage design and operation strategy is able to outperform the other two strategies considering reduction in cost and improvement in performance of the system.

AB  - Indicators of forest health used in previous studies have focused on crown variables analyzed individually at the tree level by summarizing over all species. This approach has the virtue of simplicity but does not account for the three-dimensional attributes of a tree crown, the multivariate nature of the crown variables, or variability among species. To alleviate these difficulties, we define composite crown indicators based on geometric principles to better quantify the entire tree crown. These include crown volume, crown surface area, and crown production efficiency. These indicators were then standardized to a mean of 0 and variance of 1 to enable direct comparison among species. Residualized indicators, which can also be standardized, were defined as the deviation from a regression model that adjusted for tree and plot conditions. Distributional properties were examined for the three composite crown indicators and their standardized-residualized counterparts for 6167 trees from 250 permanent plots distributed across Virginia, Georgia, and Alabama. Comparisons between the composite crown indicators and their associated standardized residual indicators revealed that only two or three plots were jointly classified as poor by both when thresholds were set at the lower 5 percentiles of statistical distributions. In contrast, 19-21 other plots were classified differently, emphasizing that different aspects of crown condition are being summarized when the raw values are adjusted and standardized. Generally, crown volume and crown surface area behaved similarly, while crown production efficiency was substantially different.

AB  - A physiologically based, mechanistic framework was developed to understand key risk factors associated with adverse health effects from heat waves. The framework consists of a number of integrated transdisciplinary modules. Environmental conditions and behavioral responses link to a physiological model, which predicts core temperature. Core temperature over time is then converted into a time-at-temperature metric. The output of the framework is a heat-related health effects index (HEI), reflecting the potential relative severity of the heat stress on health. The framework is flexible, allowing the individual models to be adapted to conditions at specific locations and to be updated as new information becomes available. Scenario analyses are easily accommodated, enabling the framework to evaluate issues such as intervention strategies and the possible effects of global climate change on heat-related illnesses. The framework and an initial set of component models were applied to conditions during the 1995 Chicago event and the results compared with published studies. For individuals, there was reasonably good agreement between HEI ratios and actual mortality risk ratios when comparing indoor versus outdoor environments. When aggregating across populations, predicted HEI ratios were significantly smaller than actual mortality ratios when comparing healthy versus compromised populations, supporting the notion that mortality may not be the best indicator of heat stress effects. Future work should include refinement of the initial models and application to other cities and heat events.

AB  - The geochemistry of the clastic sedimentary units of the Suonahu Formation from the QD17 well in the northern Qiangtang basin, Tibet, was studied using various chemical analyses. SiO2/Al2O3 ratios indicated that compositional maturity and recycling of the sediments were low to moderate. The total rare earth element (Sigma REE) contents of the clastic sediments ranged from 29.28 to 191.92 ppm. Element abundances suggest that the studied clastic sediments in the northern Qiangtang Basin were mainly sourced from felsic rocks mixed with small amounts of intermediate rocks, and that they were mostly developed in a continental setting. The REE geochemistry of the elastic sediments suggests that these different lithological samples were derived from a similar terrigenous source and that the Eu anomaly was inherited from the source rocks. The paleoclimate index (C-value) varied from 0.01 to 0.36, reflecting generally arid to semiarid conditions. In addition, Rb/Sr (about 0.41) and Sr/Cu (about 37.02) ratios support the idea that arid conditions prevailed during the deposition of the Suonahu Formation. Sr/Ba ratios (0.48-3.23) suggest a paleoenvironment with variable salinity. The covariation among this factor and paleoclimate indicators suggests that variations in climatic conditions exerted a primary control on salinity. The chemical index of alteration (CIA), A-CN-K ternary diagram, and low Th/U ratios indicate that the parent rocks of the elastic sediments experienced weak chemical weathering. Two multidimensional tectonic discrimination diagrams based on major elements show that the Suonahu Formation was deposited in a rift-related basin. The TiO2 versus Zr, La/Th versus Hf, and Co/Th versus La/Sc bivariate diagrams and multi-major elements discrimination diagram indicate that the detritus was primarily derived from felsic igneous rocks with less contribution from intermediate igneous rocks.

AB  - Limited knowledge of the physiological basis of the detrimental effects of soil salinity on growth and yield of barley and the consequent lack of suitable screening traits are two reasons for the limited success of plant breeding in saline environments. We assessed the relationships between grain yield, carbon isotope discrimination (Delta), canopy temperature, stomatal conductance, and grain ash content in a set of barley cultivars grown in a soil salinity gradient imposed by a triple-line-source sprinkler system. A linear increase in soil salinity produced significant (P<0.05) and linear decreases in grain yield and Delta, and increases in midday differential canopy temperature (delta T). For unit increase in soil solution electrical conductivity (ECss), Delta decreased by 0.2 parts per thousand and delta T increased by 0.3 degrees C. Increasing soil salinity from the control (non-saline) to a highly saline level (ECss=22 dS m(-1)) decreased leaf stomatal conductance by 65% and increased grain ash content by 11-29%. Grain yield and grain Delta of 34 barley cultivars were significantly (r=0.58; P<0.01) correlated in non-saline conditions, suggesting that Delta is a useful indicator of yield potential in barley. However, there was no significant correlation between grain yield and grain Delta under highly saline conditions (r=0.29; P>0.05). A multiple linear regression of Delta, stomatal conductance and grain ash content on grain yield was highly significant (R-2=0.77, P<0.001) in non-saline conditions, but not in highly saline conditions. We concluded that none of the studied characters would be useful in screening for high yield under saline environments, and that grain yield under salt stress remains the only reliable means of identifying higher salt tolerance in barley.

To understand the selectors of the ARGs, we examined the occurrence of heavy metals (Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Cd, Pb and Zn), associated ARB (beta-lactam-resistant Escherichia coli, beta-lactam-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae) and ARGs (bla(OXA), bla(CTX-M), bla(IMP), bla(TEM)) in water and sediments from two sub-urban rivers receiving urban and hospital effluent waters in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). High abundances of ARB and ARGs were observed in all sediment samples. All the metal contents correlated negatively with grain size (- 0.94 <= r <= - 0.54, p < 0.05) except for Ni and positively with organic matter content and total copies of 16 s rRNA (0.42 <= r <= 0.79, p < 0.05), except for Ni and Zn. The metals had a significant positive correlation with the faecal indicator Enterococcus except for Ni and Cd (0.43 <= r <= 0.67, p < 0.05). Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae correlated negatively with Zn (r = - 0.44, p < 0.05) and positively with all the rest of toxic metals (0.58 <= r <= 1.0, p < 0.05). These results suggested that some metals had a great influence on the persistence of ARB and ARGs in sediments. Overall, this study strongly recommends the managing urban wastewater to preserve water resources used for human and agricultural purposes. Additionally, we recommend the utilizing biological indicators (faecal indicator bacteria, ARB, ARGs) when investigating urban wastewater pollutions.

AB  - In China's vast land, the mountainous environment accounts for almost 33% of the total area. Therefore, potential mountain environmental disasters pose a great danger to daily production and human life. Traditional mountain monitoring methods have the disadvantages of poor real-time performance, high cost, and high energy consumption. Therefore, it is very important to establish a proper tracking system on the mountain. In order to analyze and monitor some of the problems in the traditional wireless network (Wireless Sensor Network, WSN), multiple sensor nodes are configured to detect the mountain environment. In addition, this paper studies the distribution nature of geological spatial hazards in coal fields, and conducts a landslide sensitivity analysis on the scale of land exploration based on the most advanced model. This model is not only suitable for artificial slope analysis, soil improvement and consolidation, and regional planning. Optimize and study the geographical conditions of the area. Reasonable monitoring and development of coal field resources provide reference and value for related research and management activities in other areas of coal fields with similar conditions. Finally, this article focuses on the logistics supply chain management optimization system. Managing the logistics supply chain is the basic guarantee for the sound development of any supermarket and the entire retail industry. The reasonable organization of the logistics supply chain can not only make the goods run smoothly, reduce the storage pressure of the store, but also reduce the management cost of a single store. By optimizing the supplier management system and chain management methods, the cost is minimized, thereby ensuring the interests of the enterprise. This research provides a theoretical basis for establishing a sustainable logistics management system for regional distribution centers to achieve cost optimization, profit maximization, and enhancement of competitiveness.

AB  - The soil environment is a key factor affecting the distribution of plant communities. The soil environments of many arid wetland areas are deteriorating. The present study investigated plant-soil relationships in an arid wetland region (along the middle reaches of Heihe River, Northwest China). The main objective was to establish an approach to use plants as bioindicators of soil conditions. With such an approach, environmental changes inferred from plant observations can be monitored, facilitating the prevention of negative environmental impacts and the improvement of environmental management. Collection of vegetation data and soil sampling was conducted at a total of 87 plots from 27 stations in the study area from July to August 2017. The vegetation data included plant community type and the abundance, height, and coverage of each species. The soil characteristics included salinity (SA), pH, water content (WC), bulk density (BD), soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP) and available potassium (AK). A total of 13 main plant community types were identified by detrended correspondence analysis. The soil physicochemical properties varied among the different plant communities. Multivariate analysis showed that the vegetation variables were closely related to SA, pH and WC. The quantitative plant-soil relationships was also established to aid the management of the wetlands. Based on the established relationships, an expansion of Calamagrostis spp. would suggest a decrease in soil SA, a replacement of Inula japonica with Equisetum ramosissimum would indicate an increase in soil pH, and an expansion of Tamarix spp. would suggest increases in soil SA and pH. Our results support the use of plants as soil bioindicators of disturbance and the approach of quantitative plant-soil relationship to improve the environmental management of wetland ecosystems in arid areas.

AB  - Questions Which are the main wet and mesic grassland vegetation types along the climatic gradient on the southern margin of the Pannonian basin? Which are the most important environmental gradients that determine their distribution and species composition? Location The southern margin of the Pannonian plain (N and E Slovenia, N Croatia, N Serbia). Methods A database of 2,575 vegetation plots originally assigned to theMolinio-Arrhenathereteawas compiled. Semi-supervised classification based on theK-means algorithm was applied to assign plots into 12 a-priori alliances and to search for new alliances. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) ordination with Ellenberg's indicator values and bioclimatic variables were applied to show the influence of ecological conditions on species composition. The plots within each alliance were further classified into associations using the beta flexible method. Results Classification resulted in 12 alliances recognized in the EuroVegChecklist, and two new groups appeared. The first group occurs in the eastern part of the research area, where many ruderal species appear. This group was treated as a new alliance,Salvio nemorosae-Arrhenatherionforming a vicariant syntaxon of the allianceArrhenatherion. The second group occurs in the western part. It is a transitional group between mesic (Arrhenatherion) and wet meadows (Deschampsion) and can be treated asAlopecurion. Besides, three new associations and six new subassociations were described, together with the typification of seven associations and of three subassociations. Numerical analyses revealed floristic, ecological and geographical differentiation among analysed vegetation types. Conclusions The communities showed typical Central European features in the western part, but their floristic and ecological conditions changed towards the eastern part, where the continental influence was more pronounced. The vegetation structure and plant species composition in the studied area were influenced by soil moisture and soil nutrient availability as well as by strong biogeographical and climatic gradients.

AB  - Integrated analyses of multiple groups of microfossils are frequently performed to unravel the palaeoenvironmental evolution of subsurface coastal successions, where the complex interaction among several palaeoecological factors can be detected with benthic assemblages. This work investigates the palaeoenvironmental resolution potential provided by benthic foraminifera and ostracoda within a Pleistocene lagoonal succession of the Romagna coastal plain (northern Italy). Quantitative approaches and statistical techniques have been applied to both groups in order to understand the main factors that controlled the composition of assemblages and compare the palaeoecological record provided by single fossil groups.
   The two faunal groups are characterized by the high dominance of opportunistic species (Ammonia tepidaAmmonia parkinsoniana and Cyprideis torosa); however, detailed palaeoecological information is inferred from less common taxa. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages are mainly determined by the frequencies of abnormal individuals and species related to high concentrations of organic matter, showing two assemblages: a stressed assemblage, consistent with a brackish-water environment subject to salinity and oxygen fluctuations, and an unstressed assemblage, which indicates more stable conditions. Despite the lower number of species, ostracoda show more significant differences in terms of species composition and ecological structure between their three assemblages, formed in response to a salinity gradient and indicative of inner, central, and outer lagoon conditions. The stratigraphic distribution of ostracod assemblages shows a general transgressive-regressive trend with minor fluctuations, whereas benthic foraminifera highlight the presence of a significant palaeoenvironmental stress.
   In this case, the higher abundance along the stratigraphic succession, the higher differentiation of the assemblages, and the well-defined relationship between taxa and ecological parameters determine Ostracoda as the most reliable fossil group for precise palaeoenvironmental reconstructions. Nevertheless, benthic foraminifera indicate palaeoenvironmental stress and can be used to refine the environmental interpretation in the presence of monospecific ostracod assemblages.

AB  - Metal and metalloid contamination constitutes a major concern in aquatic ecosystems. Thus it is important to find rapid and reliable indicators of metal stress to aquatic organisms. In this study, we tested the use of H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) - based metabolomics to examine the response of Daphnia magna neonates after a 48 h exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of arsenic (49 mu g L-1), copper (12.4 mu g L-1) or lithium (1150 mu g L-1). Metabolomic responses for all conditions were compared to a control using principal component analysis (PCA) and metabolites that contributed to the variation between the exposures and the control condition were identified and quantified. The PCA showed that copper and lithium exposures result in statistically significant metabolite variations from the control. Contributing to this variation was a number of amino acids such as: phenylalanine, leucine, lysine, glutamine, glycine, alanine, methionine and glutamine as well as the nucleobase uracil and osmolyte glycerophosphocholine. The similarities in metabolome changes suggest that lithium has an analogous mode of toxicity to that of copper, and may be impairing energy production and ionoregulation. The PCA also showed that arsenic exposure resulted in a metabolic shift in comparison to the control population but this change was not statistically significant. However, significant changes in specific metabolites such as alanine and lysine were observed, suggesting that energy metabolism is indeed disrupted. This research demonstrates that H-1 NMR-based metabolomics is a viable platform for discerning metabolomic changes and mode of toxicity of D. magna in response to metal stressors in the environment.

AB  - Background: Postmortem microbiological examinations are performed in forensic and medical pathology for defining uncertain causes of deaths and for screening of deceased tissue donors. Interpretation of bacteriological data, however, is hampered by false-positive results due to agonal spread of microorganisms, postmortem bacterial translocation, and environmental contamination.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We performed a kinetic survey of naturally occurring postmortem gut flora changes in the small and large intestines of conventional and gnotobiotic mice associated with a human microbiota (hfa) applying cultural and molecular methods. Sacrificed mice were kept under ambient conditions for up to 72 hours postmortem. Intestinal microbiota changes were most pronounced in the ileal lumen where enterobacteria and enterococci increased by 3-5 orders of magnitude in conventional and hfa mice. Interestingly, comparable intestinal overgrowth was shown in acute and chronic intestinal inflammation in mice and men. In hfa mice, ileal overgrowth with enterococci and enterobacteria started 3 and 24 hours postmortem, respectively. Strikingly, intestinal bacteria translocated to extra-intestinal compartments such as mesenteric lymphnodes, spleen, liver, kidney, and cardiac blood as early as 5 min after death. Furthermore, intestinal tissue destruction was characterized by increased numbers of apoptotic cells and neutrophils within 3 hours postmortem, whereas counts of proliferative cells as well as T- and B-lymphocytes and regulatory T-cells decreased between 3 and 12 hours postmortem.
   Conclusions/Significance: We conclude that kinetics of ileal overgrowth with enterobacteria and enterococci in hfa mice can be used as an indicator for compromized intestinal functionality and for more precisely defining the time point of death under defined ambient conditions. The rapid translocation of intestinal bacteria starting within a few minutes after death will help to distinguish between relevant bacteria and secondary contaminants thus providing important informations for routine applications and future studies in applied microbiology, forensic pathology, and criminal medicine.

AB  - P>1. While anthropogenic stream acidification is known to lower species diversity and impair decomposition, its effects on nutrient cycling remain unclear. The influence of acid-stress on microbial physiology can have implications for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles, linking environmental conditions to ecosystem processes.
   2. We collected leaf biofilms from streams spanning a gradient of pH (5.1-6.7), related to chronic acidification, to investigate the relationship between qCO(2) (biomass-specific respiration; mg CO2-C g-1 fungal C h-1), a known indicator of stress, and biomass-specific N uptake (mu g NH4-N mg-1 fungal biomass h-1) at two levels of N availability (25 and 100 mu g NH4-N L-1) in experimental microcosms.
   3. Strong patterns of increasing qCO(2) (i.e. increasing stress) and increasing microbial N uptake were observed with a decrease in ambient (i.e. chronic) stream pH at both levels of N availability. However, fungal biomass was lower on leaves from more acidic streams, resulting in lower overall respiration and N uptake when rates were standardized by leaf biomass.
   4. Results suggest that chronic acidification decreases fungal metabolic efficiency because, under acid conditions, these organisms allocate more resources to maintenance and survival and increase their removal of N, possibly via increased exoenzyme production. At the same time, greater N availability enhanced N uptake without influencing CO2 production, implying increased growth efficiency.
   5. At the ecosystem level, reductions in growth because of chronic acidification reduce microbial biomass and may impair decomposition and N uptake; however, in systems where N is initially scarce, increased N availability may alleviate these effects. Ecosystem response to chronic stressors may be better understood by a greater focus on microbial physiology, coupled elemental cycling, and responses across several scales of investigation.

AB  - A brief summary of the historical developments relating to plant distribution and aquatic macrophyte-nutrient indices provided a means of assessing the general context and validity of previous assumptions. This has particular current relevance because of the prominent use of bioindicators for defining nutrient enrichment. A survey of 161 sites distributed across two broadly contrasting groups of rivers (circum-neutral versus alkaline) recorded 110 species of aquatic macrophytes and these have been statistically analyzed to (i) rank and separate the individual effects of local environmental conditions and spatial isolation on species distribution in the two contrasting groups of sites; (ii) calculate a macrophyte index based on plant cover and species indicator values (Mean Trophic Rank, MTR); and finally (iii) investigate the implications for biomonitoiing. Chemical, physical and hydrological site attributes together with spatial isolation, each explained a significant and at least partially independent influence over plant species distribution. It was extremely difficult, however, to separate the single effects of different site attributes on plant distribution. While some plant species are more restricted to certain environmental conditions, many appeared indifferent to the range of those being tested. The role played by nutrients (nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)) were either mostly indistinguishable from other site attributes (e.g., nitrate from conductivity) or subordinate (e.g., soluble reactive phosphorus, ammonium). It is therefore very unlikely that macrophyte species composition could provide a reliable bioindicator of the surrounding nutrient (N, P) status. The calculation of the plant index illustrated this unreliability by showing that strong correlations existed with many environmental variables, not just inorganic N and P. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The EU Water Framework Directive uses abiotic variables for classifying streams and rivers into types. For rivers, the EU Water Framework Directive fixed typology i.e. 'System A' typology are defined by ecoregions, size based on the catchment area, catchment geology and altitude. Within any given part of the WFD typology, it is assumed that biological communities at undisturbed sites will be broadly similar and will therefore constitute a type-specific biological target and a way to stratify the spatial variability in stream and river monitoring and assessment. The data collected for the STAR project cover 13 countries and include 22 stream types. A total of 233 sites were fully sampled for all biological quality elements (fish, macrophytes, benthic macroinvertebrates, and diatoms) in the study. Analysing the STAR macroinvertebrate dataset in relation to environmental and biogeographical variables resulted in three major groups of stream types that correspond to three major landscape types in Europe: Mountains, Lowlands and Mediterranean. Similar results were found when analysing all four biological quality elements (fish, macrophytes, benthic macroinvertebrates, and diatoms) sampled in the STAR project. The studies also showed that the stream types using the WFD 'System A' descriptors are probably less useful at finer scales and it is suggested that a stream typology should take three main parameters as a starting point, i.e., climate (temperature), slope (current velocity) and stream size. Existing site-specific multivariate RIVPACS-type predictive models were also compared to both null models and the WFD 'System A' physical typology as methods of predicting macroinvertebrate reference conditions. It was concluded that the multivariate models are more effective in predicting reference conditions primarily because they make use of continuous rather than categorical predictor variables and because the multivariate RIVPACS-type models are not constrained by the use of a limited number of variables.

AB  - As a stoloniferous perennial grass, Aeluropus lagopoides (L.) Trin. is a candidate of choice to elucidate the physiological and molecular aspects of acclimation to adverse environmental conditions. Vegetatively propagated plants were subjected to drought stress by withholding water for 5, 11 or 18 days. Indicators such as relative water content (RWC), relative growth rate and net photosynthesis rate as well as free proline, soluble sugars, the levels of potassium, total protein and chlorophyll contents were monitored for the duration of the drought treatment and subsequent re-watering. Close correlations between RWC and the other indicators of drought stress were evident. When RWC was reduced to 5%, plants looked healthy, net photosynthesis and leaf biomass decreased only slightly and total protein content was relatively higher than the control plants. Moderate reduction in RWC to 10% reduced relative growth rate and net CO2 assimilation but remarkably increased total protein content. In this state, plants recovered shortly after re-watering. When RWC was reduced severely to more than 20%, the dry weight, net photosynthesis rate and chlorophyll and total protein contents decreased while the levels of free proline and soluble sugars increased significantly. Re-watering helped in the partial recovery of the plants. Although total protein contents of severely drought-stressed plants were significantly reduced, alterations in the expression of only a few proteins were detected. Also, the expression of about 1.5% of transcripts was affected by severe drought. Using DD-AFLP methodology, several differentially expressed genes were identified. These genes are predicted to be involved in signaling, regulation of gene expression and osmotic adjustment processes. Altogether, these data indicate that drought tolerance is well programmed in A. lagopoides allowing adaptation to harsh environmental conditions in the natural habitat. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Relationships between littoral surface-sediment diatom assemblages and ambient limnological conditions were examined in 186 lentic fresh waters throughout lower Belgium (Flanders). Most of these waters were small, unstratified, alkaline and rich in nutrients. Using weighted-averaging techniques, robust and accurate transfer functions were developed for median pH-values ranging from 3.4 to 9.3 and dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations from < 1.6 to 63 mg l(-1) (jackknifed r(2) approximate to 0.87, RMSEP < 10% of the observed range), while a less precise model was obtained for sodium (2-571 mg l(-1); jackknifed r(2) approximate to 0.69, RMSEP 9.9% of the range). Restricting the data set to circumneutral and alkaline sites (pH >= 6.5) revealed the importance of additional variables, including calcium, silica, chemical oxygen demand and potential gross oxygen production (a proxy for metabolic activity and phytoplankton abundance). Calibration models for these variables were strong enough to be useful (jackknifed r(2) 0.57-0.59, RMSEP 13.1-16.4% of the observed range), although estimations should not always be considered entirely independent. Except for the predominant pH gradient, removal of all taxa with a distribution unrelated to the variable of interest improved model performance. In general, such taxa were proportionally represented among taxa classified according to their principal habitat. Application of the present models to diatom assemblages of shallow-water sediments obtained from historical samples and, most importantly, herbarium-macrophyte specimens, will improve hindsight into regional freshwater conditions and add to base-line setting of ecological quality standards in a highly impacted region.

AB  - Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) can reach surface waters used for drinking water extraction and recreational activities, such as swimming and fishing. The aim of the present study was to systematically assess the lifetime human health risks posed by 15 individual APIs and their mixtures occurring in the German-Dutch transboundary Vecht River. An exposure model was developed and used to assess the combined risks of oral and dermal exposure under a variety of exposure conditions. A total of 4500 API uptake values and 165 lifetime risk values were estimated for 15 and 11 APIs, respectively. Overall, the lifetime human health risks posed by the APIs and their mixtures based on modeling results were deemed acceptable under typical exposure conditions. Under very extreme environmental conditions and human behavior, API mixture risks were of potential concern while the risks of individual APIs were negligible, with a few exceptions. The antibiotic doxycycline and analgesic phenazone showed the highest and lowest risks, respectively. The study did not evaluate the potential risks caused by metabolite compounds.

AB  - The main slaughter and morpho-physiological characteristics of male Siberian x Russian Sturgeon hybrids were studied when grown in an industrial cage farm located in a reservoir in Southeastern Bulgaria. Three groups of different body weight were formed for the purposes of the experiment: 1 - 2500 to 3499 g; 2 - 3500-4499 g; 3 - 4500-5499 g. The studied hybrid has been found to have very good properties of meat-production. Slaughter value (eviscerated yields) ranged from 86.8 to 88.8%. The relative share of the whole fillet in the body was from 48.6 to 54.3%, in the cleaned carcass from 80.5 to 90.9%, and to the fillet without the abdomen 38.7-46.8% and 64.1-78.3%, respectively. These indicators depend less on body weight and more on the condition of the fish, with higher values on fish with better conditioning indices. Fish by weight group differing significantly in average body weight do not differ proportionally in basic linear measurements. The relative share of the viscera, gonads, swim bladder and bone plates increased with the increase in the body weight of the fish, and the proportion of head without gills, fins and tail, spleen and heart decreased. Gills, pyloric appendage and liver do not change naturally with changes in fish body weight.

AB  - Bacterial aggregation is ruled by specific and nonspecific adhesion mechanisms. For the probiotic strain Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (Lp299v) the biochemistry of adhesion has been previously studied and S-layer proteins have been identified. However, physicochemical mechanisms which ruled the aggregation and adhesion phenomena able to change through the time under different pH conditions have not been completely elucidated. In this study we have described the non-specific adhesion mechanisms (hydrophobicity, zeta potential and morphology) of Lp299v auto-aggregates over time (24 h) at different pH levels (from 5.0 to 9.0) under starvation conditions. Auto-aggregation was time-dependent increasing up to 60% after 22 h at pH 5. On the other hand, the acidophilic nature of the Lp299v cell surface was confirmed showing higher affinity with chloroform than with n-hexadecane, while zeta potential was negative in all cases. Size and shape parameters were found to be time and pH dependent. A strong Pearson correlation (0.991) was observed between circularity and auto-aggregation. In conclusion, Lp299v's nonspecific adhesion mechanism was found to be more related to time than to pH levels, indicating that van der Waals and hydrophobic forces have the potential to dominate the auto-aggregation of Lp299v. Finally, the results showed that lower pH may promote auto-aggregation possibly easing the colonization at the upper level of the digestive system.

AB  - Palynomorph and palynofacies analysis have been performed on 34 cutting samples from the Late Devonian sediments of the Atiavi-1 well in the Keta Basin. Five (5) palynofacies associations linked to different depositional environments have been identified based on the kerogen content in the samples. Palynofacies types Pf A, Pf B and Pf E reflect deposition under mud-dominated oxic shelf conditions (distal shelf), characterized by kerogen type III > IV which is gas prone. Palynofacies type C (Pf C) and D (Pf D) reflect heterolithic oxic shelf (proximal) conditions and are also characterized by type HI or IV kerogen.
   The palynomorph associations (miospores, acritarchs and chitinozoans) indicate an offshore distal or outer shelf environment for the lower section (1490 m-1244 m) with the upper sections (1244 m 936 m) showing intermixing of land-derived elements (miospores, phytoclasts and cuticles) with minor amounts of acritarchs, which strongly suggests deposition in shallow marine/fluvio-deltaic environment. The abundance and diversity of spores is an indication of humid climatic condition which existed at the time of deposition.
   Palynomorphs with marker species based mainly on miospores assemblages and some diagnostic chitinozoans and acritarchs association from the Atiavi-1 well indicate an age of upper lower Devonian (Emsian) to latest Devonian (Strunian). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The investigation of spatial and temporal changes of river width and width variability is a suitable tool for analysing morphological changes and estimating the ecological quality of a river, e.g. for the European Water Framework Directive. However, width and width variance interact closely with the varying hydraulic and sedinnentological conditions in the river. In general, a high width variance is often accompanied by a high depth, flow and sediment diversity which in turn is an indicator for the existence of different micro- (river bed) and mesohabitats (e.g. riffles and pools). The width variance provides information on the morphodynannics and resilience of a river. It also gives some indication of the length of the river banks and the number of diverse and ecologically vital habitats in the river bed, along the riparian zone and in the floodplain.
   This study examines changes of the channel width and width variation of the river Elbe and compares different methods while quantitatively assessing these hydronnorphological parameters. Dependent on the discharge, width and width variation for different spatial situations (e.g. river bed, floodplain) are determined for a historical (1830-1850) and a current condition. These data are statistically analysed and compared to obtain a five-point scale evaluation.
   Based on the results, this study should give recommendations as to which method is best suited in terms of various aspects. Special consideration will be given to different ecological issues.

AB  - A simple selective supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) method was developed for the determination of desorption behaviour of PCBs in sediments. This method was applied to determine the distribution of individual PCB congeners among sites of differing bonding strengths in two Swedish sediments (Lake Jarnsjon and Baltic bay Orserumsviken). Four different PCB fractions were distinguished in each sediment by applying consecutively harsher supercritical fluid extraction conditions on the same sample. Even though the two sediments had completely different textures, they showed very similar extraction behaviour. It was shown that, in both sediments, a major part of the PCBs (58% and 65%, respectively) were located at "fast sites", from which they were extractable already with the mildest extraction conditions (60 min, 40degreesC and 120 bar). Only a small fraction of the PCBs were so tightly bound to the sediments (located at "slow sites"), that they could be extracted only under the harshest conditions (60 min, 150degreesC and 400 bar). Information of this kind should be of great value for the determination of bioavailability of pollutants in sediments and soils, and it is the author's belief that this technique has the potential to develop into a powerful tool in environmental risk assessment.

AB  - Efforts to protect tropical ecosystems aim at implementing biological corridors across the national territory of Costa Rica. However, potential near-future climate change challenges the effectiveness of such conservation measures. For this purpose, we developed near-future climate change scenarios at high spatial resolution using open-access global data from the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS). These projections resulted from downscaling (to a 1km(2) national grid) and quantile-mapping bias-correction of the Essential Climate Variables Global Circulation Model (ECV_GCM) ensemble mean from the CDS using a moderate Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5). Projections were evaluated with limited local station data and applied to generate future ecosystem indicators (Holdridge Life Zones, HLZs). We show significantly increasing temperatures of 2.6 degrees C with a spatial variability of +/- 0.4 degrees C for Costa Rica until 2040 with local differences (higher temperatures projected for the southern Costa Rican Caribbean). The future mean annual precipitation showed slightly wetter conditions (120 +/- 43 mm/year) and most prominently in the Costa Rican Caribbean and south Pacific, but no significant drying in the north of Costa Rica by 2040. The bias-corrected climate data were aggregated to decadal and 30-year average (1971-2040) life zone ecosystem indicators that could potentially show ecosystem shifts. Changes in the life zones are most likely due to warmer temperatures and to a lesser extent caused by projected wetter conditions. Shifts are more likely to occur at higher elevations with a potential loss of the sub-tropical rainforest ecosystem. The projections support diminishing tropical dry forests and slightly increasing tropical rain and wet forests in the biological corridors of the driest and wettest regions, respectively. A countrywide spatial uniformity of dominating tropical moist forests (increase from 24% to 49%) at the expense of other HLZs was projected by 2040.

AB  - The complexity of invasion process of alien species is very high and requires better understanding. Nowadays, the successful range expansion of Erechtites hieraciifolia is being observed in Poland. In the study, the distribution of the species in Poland was summarized, based on the available literature and new field data. The fieldworks were conducted in the part of the species expansion zone located in the central and north-eastern Poland. Two case studies on species encroachment into post-fire and transitional bog communities were performed and a case inventory of the species presence on the border of its' main secondary range was conducted. The measurements of height, counting of the number of inflorescences per individual and the number of achenes per flower head, were conducted in selected stands. There was performed a checking of local conditions of growth using ecological indicator values for vascular plants. The analyzed specimens of the species had significantly less inflorescences and achenes than in the other parts of the species expansion zone. They grew also in worse light conditions and in less fertile sites. The species colonized most disturbed patches at first. It spread to the less disturbed ones and omitted natural sites. The massive colonization of the transitional bog could be caused by groundwater level lowering. In the area of the edge of the species main range it was found in many diffuse stands within disturbed patches of the landscape. Based on the obtained results the species is considered to create now still only a moderate threat in the analyzed part of the expansion zone. The possibility of its expansion to wetland sites and sudden appearance in Kampinos National Park needs much more attention.

AB  - Each year, the European Food Safety Authority, supported by a network of experts in the EU Member States, assesses and publishes the environmental risks of 30-40 pesticides active substances. The assessments support hundreds of national risk evaluations for marketing (re-)authorisations of Plant Protection Products. These prospective regulatory evaluations are based on worst-case scenarios in order to provide the high level of protection required by the EU legislations, and establishes the conditions for a correct use of the products including risk mitigations options. However, recent publications suggest that the desired high level of protection may not be achieved with the current risk assessment paradigm. The consideration of larger spatial scales and multiple stressors, including different pesticide uses, could improve the risk assessment process. A next step is the use of these larger spatial scales for evidence-based assessments, evaluating the overall impact of pesticide use on the European environment and biodiversity. Reaching this level would provide science-based support to the National Plans on sustainable use of pesticides and to the broader EU policies defined in the EU Environmental Action Programmes. Recent technological developments, as well as policy efforts, have solved two of the key issues blocking this progress in the past. Data availability and technical capacity for handling Big Data are no longer an unaffordable obstacle. The current proposal presents an alternative environmental risk assessment paradigm, integrating use patterns and pesticides properties with landscape ecotypes and eco-regions, covering the variability of the European agro-environmental conditions. The paradigm is suggested to be implemented in a spatially explicit conceptual model, using the ecosystem services approach and vulnerable key driver species to represent the service providing units. This approach would allow mapping the likelihood and magnitude of the impact of pesticide use on ecosystems functions, environmental resources, and biodiversity at the EU scale.

AB  - A plant microbial fuel cell (PMFC) is a novel and sustainable bioelectrochemical technology that takes advantage of the organic compounds released through the plant roots (exudates) to produce power via electrochemically active bacteria. This technology has been implemented in flooded ecosystem; however, their use in arid or semiarid environments has been less explored. Thus, the use of plant adapted to conditions of less water availability could expand the application of PMFCs. In this study, seven Sedum species (succulent plants) were evaluated for their ability to generate energy under non-saturated conditions. Electrochemical results confirmed power generation by the Sedum species tested, with reactors using Sedum hybridum achieving the highest power density (92 mu Wm(-2)), followed by reactors tested with S. rupestre (15.5 mu Wm(-2)). The lowest performance was observed in systems using S. spurium (< 1 mu Wm(-2)). Total organic carbon from root exudates did not have a direct effect on PMFCs performance. Pyrosequencing analysis revealed higher abundance of bacteria in the family Micrococcaceae in anodic biofilms of S. hybridum (13.47 +/- 2.69%) reactors than in biofilms of S. rupestre (2.28 +/- 0.52%), and S. spurium (2.29 +/- 1.94%) PMFCs. Although the current magnitudes observed in our study were lower than those reported for flooded PMFCs, a positive relationship between water content of plant growth media and power outputs was observed. After irrigation, current and water gradually decrease over time with a similar rate, showing a correlation coefficient between both variables of 0.95 +/- 0.01. Moreover, it encourages further testing of PMCFs as potential indicators of soil water content in semiarid green roofs where a better water-use efficiency is needed.

AB  - Fractionation of carbon isotopes by plants during CO2 uptake and fixation (Delta(leaf)) varies with environmental conditions, but quantitative patterns of Delta(leaf) across environmental gradients at the global scale are lacking. This impedes interpretation of variability in ancient terrestrial organic matter, which encodes climatic and ecological signals. To address this problem, we converted 3,310 published leaf Alpha values into mean Delta(leaf) values for 334 woody plant species at 105 locations (yielding 570 species-site combinations) representing a wide range of environmental conditions. Our analyses reveal a strong positive correlation between Delta(leaf) and mean annual precipitation (MAP; R-2 = 0.55), mirroring global trends in gross primary production and indicating stomatal constraints on leaf gas-exchange, mediated by water supply, are the dominant control of Delta(leaf) at large spatial scales. Independent of MAP, we show a lesser, negative effect of altitude on Delta(leaf) and minor effects of temperature and latitude. After accounting for these factors, mean Delta(leaf) of evergreen gymnosperms is lower (by 1-2.7%) than for other woody plant functional types (PFT), likely due to greater leaf-level water-use efficiency. Together, environmental and PFT effects contribute to differences in mean Delta(leaf) of up to 6% between biomes. Coupling geologic indicators of ancient precipitation and PFT (or biome) with modern Delta(leaf) patterns has potential to yield more robust reconstructions of atmospheric delta C-13 values, leading to better constraints on past greenhouse-gas perturbations. Accordingly, we estimate a 4.6% decline in the delta C-13 of atmospheric CO2 at the onset of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, an abrupt global warming event similar to 55.8 Ma.

AB  - Although it is well established that land use and management affects soil microbial biodiversity, with consequences for soil-mediated ecosystem services, knowledge on human-induced variability in soil bacterial and fungal communities is more abundant for cropping than for livestock systems. In particular, grazing management affects vegetation cover and light availability to lower vegetation layers, particularly in wooded grazing ecosystems. Our objective was to evaluate the use of T-RFLP analysis to characterise soil microbial community patterns. We worked in a grazed temperate savannah in Entre Rios (Argentina) and focused on two farms with different grazing management, resulting in different vegetation cover. At each farm, we sampled soils from four conditions forming a two shrub cover conditions (open and close) by two light availability conditions (high and low) factorial set with three replicates. T-RFLP data for bacteria and fungi were used to characterise biodiversity patterns (diversity indexes, relative abundance of operational taxonomic units and community structure). Analyses were performed, between and within farms, using nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis, non-parametric multivariate analysis of variance and network analysis. Variation patterns of soil microbial communities were detected using T-RFLP analysis in savannah soils from these two livestock farms. Farm, light and shrub conditions were statistically significant factors shaping variation patterns. For bacterial communities, light availability and shrub cover affected biodiversity and community structure respectively, but this impact was detected only for the farm with lower grazing intensity. For fungal communities, light availability was the factor shaping community structure, also with slightly higher impact on the farm with lower grazing intensity. These results suggest that in temperate woodlands lower grazing intensity, associated with higher vegetation cover, increases bacterial biodiversity while it decreases fungal community structure. Soil bacterial and fungal communities, showed contrasting patterns, and appear as sensitive indicators to monitor grazing management effects. We showed that T-RFLP analysis is a cost-effective methodology (compared to Illumina sequencing) that would be useful to disentangle impact of grazing intensity and vegetation cover in grazed temperate savannah.

AB  - The Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, is a sensitive bio-indicator of environmental changes ranging from tidal flux to heavy-metal pollution. Extreme fluctuations in dissolved oxygen levels are well documented in Mobile Bay, AL. Extended periods of low dissolved oxygen occurring during the summer months have been shown to cause oyster mortality. The current study examined the effects of anoxia on tubule morphology of the digestive gland in the Eastern oyster as well as the quantity and quality of whole-body anaerobic bacteria counts. Oysters were exposed to anoxic conditions (<0.1 mg/L O(2)) at 28 degrees C in a laboratory setting and sampled at 0 h (preexposure), 24 h, 48 h, and 60 h, and after a 4-wk recovery interval. The whole-body anaerobic bacteria count for test oysters (Mean = 1.11 X 10(6) cfu/mL) from the 60-h interval was significantly higher than counts for the preexposure oysters, 24-h, and 48-h experimental intervals. The most common bacteria isolated were Clostridium sp. Histological examination of oysters exposed to anoxic conditions indicated stress in the digestive gland. Changes in shape and size of digestive tubule epithelial cells occurred, as well as sloughing of secretory absorptive cells into the digestive tubule lumen. Necrosis and inflammation composed of aggregates of hemocytes along with bacterial infiltration into digestive tissue was noted in oysters exposed to anoxic conditions. Digestive tubule lumen ratios of oysters sampled after a 60-h exposure to anoxia were increased significantly in comparison with preexposure oysters. Digestive tubule lumen ratios returned to preexposurc morphology after a 4-wk week recovery period. Oysters have the ability to regenerate digestive gland tissue if environmental conditions return to normal. These findings indicate that anoxia exposure at summer temperatures contributes to digestive gland atrophy and necrosis in C. virginica. The combination of digestive gland atrophy, necrosis, and bacterial infiltration into digestive tissues suggests that oysters may be succumbing to infection during periods of anoxic stress.

AB  - The use of azo dyes as dosimetric indicators to measure the efficiency of enhanced photocatalytic solar disinfection has been developed based upon the solar dose required to inactivate helminth ova, a highly resistant waterborne pathogen frequently found in surface water sources in developing countries. A range of treatment conditions were examined to determine the optimal inactivation conditions required for a range of pathogens. The inactivation data were fitted using a modification of the Chick-Watson kinetic model. It was determined that the radiation dose required for >5-log helminth egg inactivation was approximately 140 kJ L-1 (using photo-Fenton reaction at [Fe(II)] = 10 mM and initial [H2O2] = 280 mM). In order to develop a dosimetric indicator providing a visual color change corresponding to this dose, a range of reaction conditions were examined to achieve removal of a dye, Acid Orange 24 (AO24). For experiments performed at [Fe(II)] = 0.7 mM and initial [H2O2] = 5 mM, complete color removal was achieved following receipt of a dose equal to 155 kJ L-1. 6-log inactivation of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was achieved following receipt of less than 10 kJ L-1. No significant increase in the inactivation dose was required when up to 5 mg L-1 natural organic matter (NOM) was added to the bacterial suspension. These results confirm that helminth eggs are an appropriate index for microbiologically safe water following enhanced photocatalytic solar disinfection. AO24 dye degradation was determined to serve as an accurate dosimetric indicator. The indicator employed is easy to use in the laboratory and field conditions, where the dye solutions may be prepared on-site and submitted to solar radiation in a glass vial in close proximity with water being disinfected in the solar collector. The user can easily and quickly monitor the treatment efficiency and be confident that the water disinfection process is complete when complete discoloration has been reached. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the context of tremendously promoting bioenergy utilization, regional suitability for industrial development of biomass power generation is a critical factor when deploying region-specific strategies. An integrated framework is developed incorporating resource potential, development demands and development conditions to evaluate the suitability for regional industrial development of power generation utilizing agricultural bioresources. Twelve indicators reflecting local resource, environmental and socioeconomic features are used to measure the suitability of 31 provincial regions in China. An improved matter-element extension model combined with the entropy weight method is adopted to attain holistic and hierarchical suitability ranks. The results reveal that the distribution of holistic suitability ranks among regions is imbalanced with the eastern regions presenting more advantages compared with the western regions. Three regions belonging to Rank I (optimum) are Henan, Shandong and Xinjiang. Hainan, Tibet, Qinghai are classified into Rank V (unsuited). Moreover, there are great differences in the limiting factors of the suitability among regions. Resource potential is a limiting factor for Beijing, Shanghai, Fujian, Hainan and Guizhou; Development demands refrain Fujian, Guangxi and Yunnan; Tianjin and Ningxia are limited by development conditions. Tibet and Qinghai have the worst performance on each criterion. The results and region-targeted policy recommendations can provide insights for bioenergy utilization development in accordance with local conditions closely.

AB  - The properties of amorphous calcium carbonate provide the foundation for understanding mineralization of calcified skeletons but inconsistencies between studies suggest the physical picture is incomplete. This study quantifies the metastable solubility and structure of ACC produced under a series of chemical conditions. Using complementary in situ methods that quantify ACC structure (in situ PDF analysis) in parallel with chemical composition (TGA, ICP-OES), we find two short-range structures are produced that also show distinct morphological differences. Conditions with high carbonate ion concentrations stabilize a Ca-rich ACC with short-range order that is independent of Mg content. In contrast, low carbonate solutions favor Mg-rich ACC with mixed Ca- and Mg-short range order. Measurements of solubility product determined from supersaturated and undersaturated conditions find the distinctive structures are related to solution carbonate activity while solubility is primarily determined by the magnesium content of the solid. Bulk solubility is a composite that concurs with established values. The findings demonstrate the type of ACC that forms is tuned by Mg2+ and CO3-2- concentration and suggest ACC structure, not bulk composition, is a reliable indicator of intermediate phase. This chemical framework also provides a basis for interpreting apparent differences between observations of ACC in synthetic and natural systems that reconciles previous structural studies.

AB  - This paper investigates the beach morphology changes in response to coastal structures and wave conditions on the Southern Gold Coast region (Letitia Spit, NSW to Kirra Beach, QLD). To do so, 137 individual days - spanning approximately 90 years (1930 - 2017) - were analysed using remote-sensing. Images were rectified and mapped in ArcGIS 10.3, identifying sandbars, spit formations, shoreline indicator and the river delta. The analysis showed long-term trends in response to the major coastal interventions (training walls and artificial bypassing). In general, the beach equilibrium was reestablished in similar to 10 years after the interventions, even though this condition could mean a complete upper beach depletion. Both the river and headland bypassing systems presented changes as results of the anthropogenic structures and to natural stressors. For instance, to have a natural recovery of Point Danger bypassing, the river delta would need to rebuild, and a continuous increased longshore transport would be necessary. These conditions were observed during strong El Nino years. In addition, the bypassing systems within Coolangatta Bay showed that sediment deposits location and seasonal wave variability control the type and occurrence of the bypassing. Overall, the study proved the complex interconnection between coastal compartments that is essential to understand for having an effective coastal management. The knowledge of long-term morphodynamic processes gained with this approach can support coastal cities to maintain healthy and resilient beach systems.

AB  - Plants that live in aquatic habitats are frequently subjected to oxygen limitation and many of them modify their anatomy and physiology to counteract hypoxia. In these habitats, the role of plant associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which are widespread in terrestrial environments and frequently confer benefits to the associated plant, is still debated. Starting from data taken from 34 selected papers, this study focuses on the occurrence of AMF in the roots of wetland and aquatic plants, taking into account the hydrological conditions of the sites, the plant wetland indicators and life forms, plant taxonomy and colonization by dark septate endophytes. The results have demonstrated the importance of hydrology in controlling the frequency and intensity of AMF root colonization, which tends to be low in obligate wetland plants. Moreover, colonization is generally lower and, possibly, less functional in monocots than in dicots. We suggest that the hydrological conditions, by filtering species according to their water tolerance, shape plant community composition, and that although AMF colonization is one of the traits that may increase plant fitness, it is not the most important one. In fact, a range of nutritional and growth strategies, which are more variegated than in terrestrial habitats, exists in wetland/aquatic habitats, and these strategies may rely, or not, on AMF colonization, as a consequence of the habitat and species.

AB  - To test the paradigm that large-bodied zooplankton species dominate in fishless lakes, we evaluated crustacean zooplankton composition of 53 fishless boreal lakes across a broad geographic scale (north-west Saskatchewan, Canada) in relation to contemporary environmental factors. Lake productivity, acid-base status and intensity of invertebrate predation were the three major environmental filters of crustacean zooplankton composition of the survey lakes, while lake morphometry and drainage basin characteristics likely had indirect effects by influencing the variations in above environmental factors. The traditionally expected dominance of large-bodied zooplankton species in fishless conditions only occurred in well-buffered shallow lakes with higher productivity and intense invertebrate predation. Daphnia pulex was dominant in more eutrophic lakes, while higher abundances of Holopedium gibberum were favored by relatively mesotrophic conditions. In exception to the traditional view, small-bodied species dominated in 57% of survey lakes as influenced by interactions of biotic and abiotic factors. Bosmina longirostris and cyclopoid copepods dominated less productive, deeper lakes with low invertebrate predation. Predominance of Leptodiaptomus minutus was supported under unfavorable environmental conditions for other species, i.e. poor buffering capacity and/or low calcium concentration. The present study demonstrates that exceptions to the generally expected species composition in fishless lakes can be caused by interactions among abiotic and biotic factors.

AB  - Algal blooms in reservoirs used for both fish and drinking water production are a major water quality problem. The authors assessed data gathered from both published literature and from their own field enclosure experiments to analyze the relationships of phytoplankton chlorophyll alpha concentrations with biomass and algal cell count. Experimental data were collected from indoor locations, field enclosures, and natural water bodies. Under laboratory conditions, where the types of algae and the nutrients provided were well controlled, a significant positive correlation between chlorophyll alpha and biomass was found out in all cases except when the dominant species changed considerably. Field enclosure experiments, with higher biodiversity but allowing control over nutrients, also showed significant correlations between chlorophyll alpha concentration and biomass. However, complex natural water bodies showed either positive or no correlation depending on the particular conditions. Under all three sets of conditions, the cell count of algae showed significant correlations with chlorophyll alpha concentrations if a single species was cultured alone or if it became the overwhelmingly dominant species in the field studies. If the dominant species changed during the course of the experiment, sometimes a positive correlation was observed but often there was no strong correlation between chlorophyll alpha and biomass. The research indicates that phytoplankton chlorophyll alpha may be used as an indicator for monitoring algal blooms in reservoirs. However, this study underlines the limits of its use.

AB  - Ecosystem services provided by lowland British floodplains respectively under semi-natural conditions and converted for intensive maize production were assessed. Floodplains across lowland Britain have been extensively disconnected from river channels, depleting habitat for wildlife and other beneficial ecosystem services. Conservation measures are often regarded as costly constraints on economic and development freedoms whilst, conversely, conversion for intensive agricultural production is rewarded by markets despite many often-overlooked externalities. Maize growing has increased in Britain since the 1970s, initially for feedlot production of livestock and now increasingly for grant aided biofuel production for anaerobic digestion. Comparative literature-based ecosystem service assessments using the RAWES (Rapid Assessment of Wetland Ecosystem Services) approach reveal that lowland British floodplains in semi-natural condition provide a wider range of provisioning services than those converted for monocultural intensive production of maize, in addition to a diversity of regulating, cultural and supporting service benefits that are lost or transformed into disservices when floodplains are converted for intensive maize growth. Benefits and disbenefits of floodplains managed under the two scenarios (semi-natural versus monocultural maize) are presented graphically as an intuitive means to support decision-makers. Monetisation of benefits would be risky, not merely due to uncertainties but as this may skew conclusions and subsequent decision-making towards maximisation of marketed or near-market services, consequently misrepresenting the diversity of values of whole socioecological floodplain systems. Management solutions protective of the societal values provided by floodplain ecosystem may include buffer zoning as a mitigation measure, but a more strategic solution may be zonation of land use based on suitability not only for crop production but recognising the full spectrum of societally beneficial ecosystem services demonstrated by RAWES assessment. A variety of drivers for a changing approach to floodplain farming - statutory, fiscal and self beneficial - are highlighted, and are generically applicable beyond Britain with context-specific modification.

AB  - The present scenario of Brazilian livestock farming presents a poor ability of management skills and an inexperienced adoption of modem technologies. The aim of this research was to study the setback of carrying out the Brazilian Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) on sustainability indicators, focusing at production in the economic, productive, natural and social conditions of beef cattle breeding systems in the Amazonian biome in the northern part of Mato Grosso, Brazil. Researchers conducted the experiment in the town of Alta Floresta between August 2012 and August 2014 in six cattle ranching lands. They carried out diagnoses in the properties, and, afterwards, applied an application to the producers, focusing on their supervisory skills, their technological knowledge status and their strength for choosing some technologies in sanitary and reproductive management, feeding systems, types of supplements and water sources provided to the animals and to the facilities. The team collected the technical and commercial data between 2013 and 2014. In addition, they carried out a complementary examination to test enteric methane emissions. Based on the results, the following GAP made it possible to reach better indicators than those found in pastures that tried none GAP. Complementarily, methane emissions per kg of live weight were lower in intensified areas. Intensification generated better economic indicators, with gross margin differences of US$ 318.89. The results in the intensified areas, when compared to the one in the conventional systems, presented a 16% increase in productive weight in live weight.ha(-1), with a 2.05% increase in investment return rates and US$ 142.94 in net present value. The GAP has provided economic, social and environmental gains, such as an increase of almost 5% in investment return rates, generating higher production, continuing employment in farms with historical negative gross margins and reducing the methane emissions per kg of live weight in the dry season by 54%.

AB  - Pollen and macrofossils were studied in a core from a fen at the foot of a slope in the Vosges Mountains, NE France. The present-day vegetation of little disturbed Abies, Fagus, and Picea forest and wetlands has been described in detail in terms of phytosociological communities using the Braun-Blanquet approach. Past ecological conditions are reconstructed in five steps: (1) The modern vegetation types are described as combinations of phytosociological species groups. (2) Micro- and macrofossils are assigned to these groups. (3) These in combination determine the past vegetation types at the site; there were simultaneously several such types in some biozones. (4) The sequence of past vegetation types is interpreted as successional pathways. (5) Past ecological conditions are inferred from these pathways. Results are: (1) The types of local forest and fen were the same around 1000 B.C. as today. (2) Rising groundwater around 650 B.C. caused a natural wet meadow to develop at the site. (3) Trees were felled near the site in the first century B.C. (Late Iron Age), facilitating the immigration of Picea. (4) Groundwater level rose during early Medieval times because of a wetter climate and alder carr replaced the dry-soil forest close to the site. (5) During High Medieval Times (10th-13th century) the nearby raised bog expanded over the site. (6) Forestry starting around A.D. 1750 caused nutrient-rich water to reach the site, resulting in abrupt vegetation change. (7) The creation of a forest road around A.D. 1855 (historical information) caused further nutrient enrichment of the site. The validity of the method used depends on the assumption that past and present vegetation types are virtually identical, which is true in our study area and study period, according to all the indications that we have.

AB  - Purpose. Under the conditions of strengthening of the destructive effects of the global economic crisis and the growing number of risks of agribusiness, there is a problem in finding the ways to improve accounting and analytical support as the only reliable source of the relevant and accurate information needed for economic security management. The purpose of the article is to substantiate the directions to improve the analytical basis as a component of accounting and analytical support of economic security management of the agricultural enterprises.
   Methodology / approach. The methodological basis of the research is a dialectical method of cognition of the complex economic phenomena. Consideration of the analytical support of complex management processes took place using a systematic approach, analysis and synthesis. Using an integral approach, a methodology for assessing and analyzing economic security of the agricultural enterprises is developed. This methodology approach includes the parameters of financial, social, resource and environmental security.
   Results. The analysis of the theoretical and methodological foundations of accounting and analytical support of economic security management showed a variety of the approaches to the choice of the indicators that describe the level of economic security. The situation is complicated by the need to analyze the information that may be relevant for management decisions in conditions of uncertainty. Under these conditions, it is proposed to implement a model of analytical support for economic security management under conditions of uncertainty and growing risks and threats to the business environment of the agricultural enterprises, which should be based on the use of general economic, statistical, integral and econometric approaches. It is determined that in the process of counteracting the risks and threats of the external and internal environment of the agrarian business the use of the integral methods of assessing economic security of the agricultural enterprises becomes crucial. It is substantiated that the most expedient in terms of achieving strategic goals of the enterprise, maintaining its competitive advantages and ensuring sustainable development is the use of integral assessment of economic security, which should be based on a synergistic approach to analysis of 25 indicators of financial, social, resource and environmental components. The approach was tested on the example of 24 agricultural enterprises of Kharkiv region (Ukraine) of crop specialization (2019). The model is also used to analyze the dynamics of the level of economic security under conditions of individual agricultural enterprises of different organizational and legal forms of management (2014-2019).
   Originality / scientific novelty. According to the results of the research, a methodological approach to determination of the integral level of economic security of the agricultural enterprises has been improved, based on the impact of the indicators of its individual components, which, at the same time, improves the analytical support of economic security management and strengthens verification, forecasting, preventive, planning and control functions of accounting and analytical support of management mechanisms.
   Practical value / implications. The practical significance of the proposed approaches consists of the possibility of positioning the enterprises in terms of optimal, satisfactory, shaky and crisis economic security zones, as well as analyzing the dynamics of the integral level of economic security, which takes into consideration the causal relations of the key areas of the agrarian business under conditions of uncertainty.

AB  - The practice of liming may influence the leaching of herbicides in soils, especially those with weak acid character, such as picloram. The study on leaching, preserving soil structure, is an important factor when one intends to understand the dynamics of herbicides and environmental impacts. Thus, the effect of liming on picloram leaching in a dystrophic Red Yellow Latosol under field conditions was studied using a bioindicator plant. The experiment was set up in a completely randomized design (CRD), in split-plot scheme, with factorial in the plot. The factors of the plot corresponded to two soil conditions (presence and absence of liming) and 5 picloram concentrations (0; 384; 768; 1152; 1536 g ha(-1)), and the factor of the subplot was 5 soil depths (0-8, 8-16, 16-24, 24-32 and 32-40 cm), with four replicates. Pipes were introduced into the soil and, in part of the treatments, limestone was applied superficially. After ninety days, the different doses of picloram were applied on the surface of each pipe and these pipes were withdrawn after an accumulated rainfall of 128 mm, to perform the bioassay using cucumber plants (Cucumis sativus). Evaluations of plant development (phytotoxicity and shoot biomass) were carried out 21 days after sowing. It was concluded that picloram showed high leaching rate under all studied conditions and liming increased picloram leaching at doses lower than 768 g ha(-1).

AB  - The Frasnian-Famennian boundary is correlated with one of several Late Devonian extinction pulses that resulted in a significant decrease in diversity as well as ecological restructuring. This event is recognized within the globally correlated Upper Kellwasser interval that is well exposed and biostratigraphically well constrained in shale units of western New York State. The ichnological and geochemical signals of the interval stratigraphically below the Upper Kellwasser event at these localities provides insight into the onset of this important extinction event. Detailed analysis of ichnogeneric composition, relative size of burrow populations, amount of bioturbation, and trace metal concentrations vary in concert. Deep-penetrating, pyritized Skolithos burrows terminate abruptly at a thin, laminated black shale interval with enriched Mo levels, up to 31 ppm, and are overlain by an interval of gray-green bioturbated shales dominated by Chondrites. These textural and chemical shifts reveal that bottom-water oxygen levels decrease rapidly below the base of the Upper Kellwasser interval. Relative oxygen levels are interpreted to remain low through the Chondrites-dominated interval, with protracted stressed conditions followed by a gradual decrease to anoxic conditions within the Upper Kellwasser interval. These results suggest that, at least locally in the Appalachian Basin, bottom-water oxygen stress and/or fluctuating oxygen conditions were present leading up to the extinction event. This evidence does not support an instantaneous onset of anoxia as causal mechanism for extinction.

AB  - Artificial reefs (ARs) have become an important tool to increase the ichthyofauna associated with artisanal and commercial fishing. Integrated evaluations of ARs are necessary to comprehend the condition and benefits of these structures. Multimetric indices (ARMIs) were developed to evaluate fish assemblages associated with artificial structures and to assess the efficiency of the AR compared to control area (CA). The AR global ranking index (ARMI(r)) and AR local effect index (ARMI(e)) include 16 metrics that represent four broad levels of the fish community: structure of fish assemblages, trophic structure, vulnerability and economic importance. Individual metrics were evaluated using a long-term dataset of fish assemblages from the AR and CA in northern Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Bottom gillnets were used to sample the fish two times per year for 21 years after creating the reef. The ARMI(r) general score for the AR was 51 out of a possible 100, with scores varying from 38 to 54. The ARMI(r) general score for the CA was 39 out of 100, with scores varying from 35 to 47. Average ARMI(e) values were 12% higher for the AR in relation to the CA. Spatial-temporal comparisons of the ARMI(r) using generalized additive models revealed significant differences between AR and CA. Evaluations of the ARMI(e) scores revealed that the assemblage structure and economic importance level significantly increased over time in the AR. The proposed indices combine structural and functional levels of fish, providing a robust and sensitive method to evaluate the ecological condition of ARs and adjacent areas. The data contribute to discussions related to ARs management and provides a baseline for defining fish assemblage metrics in assessment of localities with artificial structures.

AB  - Highly hydrophobic Di 2-ethyl hexyl phthalate (DEHP) is one of the most prevalent plasticizers in wastewaters. Since its half-life in biological treatment is around 25 days, it can be used as an efficiency indicator of wastewater treatment plant for the removal of hydrophobic emerging contaminants. In this study, the performance of submerged membrane bioreactor was monitored to understand the effect of DEHP on the growth of aerobic microorganisms. The data showed that the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia concentration were detected below 10 and 1.0 mg/L, respectively for operating conditions of hydraulic retention time (HRT) = 4 and 6 hr, sludge retention time (SRT) = 140 day and sludge concentration between 11.5 and 15.8 g volatile solid (VS)/L. The removal efficiency of DEHP under these conditions was higher and ranged between 91% and 98%. Results also showed that the removal efficiency of DEHP in biological treatment depended on the concentration of sludge, as adsorption is the main mechanism of its removal. For the submerged membrane bioreactor, the pore size is the pivotal factor for DEHP removal, since it determines the amount of soluble microbial products coming out of the process. Highly assimilated microorganisms increase the biodegradation rate, as 74% of inlet DEHP was biodegraded; however, the concentration of DEHP inside sludge was beyond the discharge limit. Understanding the fate of DEHP in membrane bioreactor, which is one of the most promising and futuristic treatment process could provide replacement for conventional processes to satisfy the future stricter regulations on emerging contaminants.

AB  - Human-altered flow regime is often claimed to be one of the most serious and continuing threats to aquatic biodiversity in streams and rivers. It is commonly found that both seasonal and subdaily flow patterns are changed below hydropeaking dams due to the multifunctions of the reservoirs such as flood control and water supply. The aim of this paper is to comprehensively quantify the degree of ecologically relevant hydrologic alteration downstream of Gangkouwan Reservoir, focusing particularly on the subdaily flow variation induced by hydropeaking operations. The method is based on the assessment framework set by the indicators of hydrologic alteration (IHA). Hydrologic parameters in groups 1-3 of the IHA were adopted to assess the degree of hydrologic alteration at daily to monthly time scales and based on a daily mean flow data series for both the pre-and post-impact periods. A set of biologically relevant hydrologic parameters based on post-dam hourly flow data, including magnitude and duration of baseflow, magnitude and duration of peaking flows, frequency of peaking flows and ramping rates, were proposed to depict subdaily flow pulses andwater condition changes induced by hydropeaking. The results show that Gangkouwan Reservoir made the intra-annual distribution of runoff more consistent, reduced annual peak discharges, and changed the timing of the yearly maximum. The monthly distribution of these hydrologic parameters at the hourly temporal scale provides detailed information on ecologically significant features of the subdaily flow variation induced by hydropeaking operations. This paper provides useful guidance for further investigations on responses of river biota to hydropeaking and provides guidance for suggesting mitigation measures against hydropeaking effects.

AB  - P>1. Growth rate is a fundamental property of organisms. In trees, growth is indeterminate and varies in space and time depending on resource availability, genetic constraints, competition and stress from biotic and abiotic environmental factors.
   2. The ratio between the abundance of RNA and DNA in the tissue has been used to indicate recent growth rates in many systems, but not for trees. We assessed the applicability of using RNA : DNA ratios for assessing intraspecific and interspecific differences in growth rates in two species of mangrove trees under field conditions. We manipulated growth by fertilizing mangrove trees over a period of 4 years and measured tree growth as increments in linear extension of tagged shoots. The C, N and P contents per unit biomass were measured to test the hypothesis that faster growing organisms require more P per unit biomass (the Growth Rate Hypothesis).
   3. We found that interspecific differences in the RNA : DNA ratio clearly reflected the difference in shoot elongation rates between the species. Intraspecific differences in RNA : DNA were significantly correlated with growth rates only for Avicennia marina and not for Ceriops australis. C : N and C : P ratios were lower in trees with higher growth rates and exhibited a negative correlation with RNA : DNA ratios.
   4. Our results indicate that RNA : DNA ratios can reliably predict interspecific differences in growth rates between the two mangrove species and that RNA : DNA ratios can be used as an indication of variation in growth rate for Avicennia marina. The interaction between C : N : P ratios, RNA : DNA ratios and growth rates supported the Growth Rate Hypothesis on an interspecific level, but not on an intraspecific level.

AB  - Bacteroidales and viruses were contemporaneously measured during dry and wet weather conditions at a watershed-scale in a semi-arid watershed impacted by a mixture of agricultural runoff, municipal wastewater effluent and municipal runoff. The results highlight the presence of municipal wastewater effluent as a confounding factor for microbial source tracking (MST) studies, and thus data were segregated into groups based on whether they were impacted by wastewater effluent. In semi-arid environments such as the Calleguas Creek watershed, located in southern California, the relative contribution of municipal wastewater effluent is dependent on hydrology as storm events lead to conditions where agricultural and municipal stormwater dominate receiving waters (rather than municipal wastewater, which is the case during dry weather). As such, the approach to data segregation was dependent on hydrology/storm conditions. Storm events led to significant increases in ruminant- and dog-associated Bacteroidales concentrations, indicating that overland transport connects strong non-human fecal sources with surface waters. Because the dataset had a large number of non-detect samples, data handling included the Kaplan -Meir estimator and data were presented graphically in a manner that reflects the potential effect of detection limits. In surface water samples with virus detections, Escherichia coli concentrations were often below (in compliance with) the recreational water quality criteria. In fact, sites downstream of direct inputs of municipal wastewater effluent exhibited the lowest concentrations of E. coli, but the highest concentrations of human-associated Bacteroidales and highest detection rates of human viruses. The toolkit, comprised of the four Bacteroidales assays and human virus assays used, can be successfully applied to inform watershed managers seeking to comply with recreational water quality criteria. However, care should be taken when analyzing data to account for the effect of non-detect samples, sources with differing microbial viability, and diverging hydrologic conditions.

AB  - Considering the high demand for cooling, heating and electricity and with more than 300 annual sunny days, an innovative hybrid biomass-solar driven micro-scale tri-generation system is proposed to provide cooling, heating and electricity under Lebanese conditions. The system comprises an organic Rankine cycle-based combined heat and power unit, a liquid desiccant dehumidification unit and a dew point evaporative cooling unit. A complete technical, economic and environmental assessment of the tri-generation system is performed to assess its applicability and feasibility. Employing a 2 kWe ORC-based CHP unit, the useful heat output ranges between 4.2 and 11.75 kW, with an electric power capacity between 0.7 and 1.92 kW. The maximum hourly cooling capacity delivered by the coupled cooling and dehumidification system is attained in August with 8.7 kW. The tri-generation system allows annual savings of 8225 USD on the heating bill, 960 USD on the electricity bill and 950 USD on the cooling bill compared to conventional production technologies. In addition, the CO2 emissions reduction ranges between 3.1 tons in June and 9.2 tons in March. The results of this study demonstrate the large potential of using such tri-generation systems under the Lebanese conditions compared to the conventional separate energy production technologies.

AB  - Eight putative consistently expressed genes in Carnobacterium maltaromaticum and Lactobacillus curvatus, and nine in Listeria innocua, were examined for their potential as references for the normalization of gene expression. Expression stability of candidate reference genes was evaluated under growth conditions of low (5 A degrees C) and moderately high (40-42.5 A degrees C) temperatures, and high salt (a parts per thousand yen3 % NaCl) using the geNormplus and NormFinder algorithms. Under temperature stress, both algorithms ranked elongation factor Tu (Tuf) as the most stably expressed gene in C. maltaromaticum. In L. curvatus, at similar conditions, geNormplus identified Tuf and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH) as suitable for normalization, while NormFinder identified phenylalanyl-tRNA synthase and recombinase A as the best pair. In L. innocua grown under the same temperatures, geNormplus ranked 6PGDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and Tuf as the top three most stable references, whereas NormFinder identified GAPDH and 6PGDH as suitable for normalization, with Tuf ranked as number six. There was less consistency between algorithms in the salt stress experiment. No gene was identified that exhibited such a constant level of expression as to outperform the other candidates under both experimental conditions. This study underlines the need for normalizing bacterial gene expression using multiple carefully selected references.

AB  - Vegetation coverage and surface temperature are important parameters in describing the characteristics of land cover, which in combination call provide information on vegetation and soil moisture conditions at the surface. This paper aims to estimate spatial and temporal patterns of soil moisture in the Loess Plateau, China. Using Terra/MODIS images for each 10-day period in 2004 covering the semi-arid North Shaanxi Loess Plateau, a simplified land surface dryness index (Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Index, TVDI) developed by Sandholt [Sandholt, I., Rasmussena, K, Andersenb, J., 2002. A simple interpretation of the Surface temperature/vegetation index space for assessment of surface moisture status. Remote Sensing of Environment 79, 213-224.] was used to determine the relationship between surface temperature and vegetation index. From the analysis, it call be inferred that the trend in seasonal change of TVDI is high values in the dry season (spring or summer) and low values in the rainy season (autumn or winter). Moreover, the land surface moisture of each watershed had its seasonal characteristics. The relationship between TVDI and land cover types indicated that water-retention in forest and shrub areas was better than cropland and rangeland in relatively wet conditions, and rangeland was better than forest and shrub areas in dry conditions.

AB  - We applied an extensive data set from 211 locations along Austrian rivers to assess community structure and the ratios of functional feeding groups of benthic macroinvertebrates. A total of 569 taxa have been identified. At the catchment scale, the Enns, Salzach, and Traun Rivers exhibited the highest taxa richness whereas the Inn River showed the lowest richness. Beta-diversity was highest along the impounded and fragmented Enns and Drau Rivers. Consequently, high corridor diversity corresponded to a low degree of nestedness. Overall, scrapers and gathering-collectors dominated the benthic community. Further, the relationship between habitat conditions and metrics based on functional feeding groups were statistically analyzed to validate the potential of these metrics as indicators of ecosystem attributes. We examined four major ecosystem attributes: species diversity, material cycling, longitudinal material transport, and lateral material input. Multiple regression analyses for midorder rivers demonstrated that metrics were significantly related to habitat conditions. For example, the metric set indicating primary production was positively correlated with periphyton cover, dissolved oxygen, dominant sediment size, and average annual discharge. Overall, most metrics exhibited unique responses to habitat conditions, implying that they are useful proxies of ecosystem attributes. Thus, a function-based approach based on macroinvertebrates has the potential to become an effective tool for the assessment of river ecosystems.

AB  - Various ethological publications currently encourage the expectation that the indicators regarding the behaviour of the horse will provide reliable information about the existence and extent of well-being and discomfort as a current condition. Such discussions focus, in some cases, on the consideration of valid, reliable and "practicable' signs of the existence of a very pleasant condition. Such indications which occur frequently and can be decoded without special methodological measures are generally understood as "practicable'. This approach is not infrequently guided by the desire to create the conditions for well-being as a permanent condition to promote the comfortableness of the existence of horses in the care of man. The approach outlined is usually also associated with the conviction that the human being can determine low-intensity moods based on the behaviour of the horses themselves. The assumption of sustained well-being corresponds to the natural existence and the natural function of sensations less than the human notions of uninterrupted happiness or lasting fun. Against the prevalent human ideas, the evolutionary biology analysis makes clear: the states of mind represent the psychic states with which the organism responds to what is encountered according to its innate as well as acquired dispositions, and this affects emotionally as "approving", on the one hand, and "unpleasant', on the other. Such mental states of varying intensity and duration promote (over) life, in particular, in that they cause the organism to end or avoid excellent behaviour by means of unpleasant sensations, and to continue and/or repeat the behaviour which is characterized by pleasant sensations. Behavioural determinants of strength are, above all, the high-intensity feelings, that is to say, well-being, which stand out clearly from the usual course of experience. The usual course of experience dominates the moods of moderate intensity and the states of a far-reaching emotional indifference, namely, the states in which the functional sequence of certain actions or a specific occurrence is experienced in particular, the attention being directed to such sequences.

LA  - Czech
AB  - Knowledge of basic factor conditioning and limiting the performance of the present farming system is a basic prerequisition for objective decision in further trend of development. One of the decisive roles is played by the knowledge and rational utilization of production capacity of soils.
   In order to design an optimum structure of the farm system in the Presov district, the soils were classified in five agroecological groups on the basis of determination of the energy values of soils (Fig. 1). The groups thus formed represent sufficiently heterogenous production conditions of this district.  The correctness qualification of this classification of enterprises is confirmed also by the determination of their altitude as a basic conservative element of the landscape.
   An analysis of existed farm systems in selected groups, performed over the years 1981 to 1988 by mutual comparison of selected indicators (Tab. 1) and parameters (Tab. 11) of their structures manifested the existing discrepancies in bonds between particular components and subsystems of management.  The implemented system of management in the Presov district accepts the heterogenous production conditions, this is reflected adversely on the lavel of yielded cropping phytomass and imbalance and mutual disconnection of subsystems of management.
   It was confirmed that an intensity of bioenergy potential of soils, as well as total produced dry matter with higher altitude, is failing (Fig. 2). At the same time, a relation between bioenergy soil potential and fertilizer consumption (Fig. 3).
   It follows from the results obtained that large reserves in efficiency of agricultural production are in correctly chosen structure of agricultural systems and that obtaining an optimum state is possible only by the change of their structure in all agroecological groups while respecting and production conditions and principles of rational management.
   New structure. indicators presented in Tab. I, was determined by carbon method (Kudrna, 1986) for each agricultural enterprise separatly and subsequent aggregation for each agroecological group. The calculation confirmed that existing system of management is possible to be optimized to a certain degree, thus reflecting in better energy performance of inputs and also in economic and ecological field as well.

AB  - Deep root development, which is important for the drought resistance in rice ( Oryza sativa L.), is a complex trait combining various root morphologies. The objective of this study was to elucidate genotypic variation in deep root development in relation to morphological indicators such as vertical root distribution and root growth angle. Two experiments were conducted: one on upland fields, and one in pots and fields. In experiment 1, the root systems of six rice cultivars on upland fields were physio- morphologically analyzed under different water regimes ( irrigated and intermittent drought conditions during panicle development). In experiment 2, cultivar differences in root growth angles were evaluated with 12 cultivars using the basket method under irrigated conditions. No cultivar x environment interactions were found for total root length or deep root length between irrigated and drought conditions in experiment 1. This suggests that constitutive root growth, which is genetically determined, is important for deep root development under intermittent drought conditions during reproductive stage. Among root traits, the deep root ratio ( i. e., deep root weight divided by total root weight) was most closely related to deep root length under both water regimes. This suggested that vertical root distribution constitutively affects deep root length. Significant genotypic variation existed in the nodal root diameter and root growth angle of upland rice in experiment 2. It was considered that genotypes with thick roots allocated more assimilates to deep roots through root growth angles higher to the horizontal plane on upland fields. This is the first report on genotypic variation in the root growth angle of rice on upland fields. It should prove useful for rough estimations of genotypic variation in the vertical root distribution of upland rice because root growth angle is rapidly and easily measured.

AB  - A slum environment is an area that commonly has characteristics of unhealthy house conditions and tends to create a crowded condition among residents. This study is intended to measure the happiness level of the household. This study also suggests an instrument that can be used to understand the happiness level. The dimensions and indicators of happiness factors were derived from Statistics Indonesia, including the dimensions of life satisfaction, feelings, and the meanings of life. The research was conducted in several slum areas in Indonesia, such as in Kali Baru Village, Cilincing District, North Jakarta Municipality, DKI Jakarta Province. The sample comprised 100 households selected using multistage random sampling. The assessment of household happiness applied the expected value rules based on the composite index. The major finding of this study is that 100% of unhappy household were unemployed.

AB  - Nutritional condition is a valuable metric in ecosystem-based fisheries management. However, the need for lethal sampling for the most accurate indicators ethically and logistically limits sample sizes. Percent moisture has been recommended for management of Striped Bass Morone saxatilis. We sought to develop bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) models for five size-classes of Striped Bass across three temperatures in a controlled laboratory setting. Results suggest that BIA is an accurate and robust method for estimating percent dry weight in Striped Bass, with model adjusted R-2 values in the range of 0.70-0.89. Temperature correction models successfully removed a significant relationship (P < 0.0001) between temperature and BIA model residuals (P = 0.48). We recommend that these models be tested with independent data collected in a field setting.

AB  - The paper introduces a 2D shallow water model based on a two-phase formulation for the analysis of fast geomorphic transients occurring in the context of river morphodynamics. Mass and momentum conservation principles are separately imposed for both phases. The model naturally accounts for non-equilibrium solid transport, since neither instantaneous adaptation hypothesis nor any lag equation is employed to represent sediment dynamics. The hyperbolic character of the proposed model is shown to be preserved independently on the flow conditions. Results from numerical simulations of both 1D and 2D test-cases are compared with literature experimental data and with available numerical solutions.

AB  - Are people sensitive to the level of compatibility in everyday settings? We manipulated via scenario both a specified goal and a setting typically associated with a given goal. Settings were either typically compatible with the specified goal or not. Different participants rated either compatibility (as a direct indicator of sensitivity to manipulated compatibility) or preference for being in the setting (as an indirect indicator of sensitivity). For both measures, mean ratings were significantly greater in the high-compatibility conditions than in the low-compatibility conditions. We conclude that people are indeed sensitive to the level of compatibility in everyday settings. These findings indicate that a core concept of Attention Restoration Theory (ART), compatibility, has psychological reality in everyday settings and thus support the construct validity and external validity of the compatibility concept.

AB  - This article presents an analysis of the different theoretical models for the relationship between elections and economics, as well as econometric tests applied to GDP and employment trends in Latin American democracies from 1979 to 1998. Considering that a government's possibilities for pushing its policy objectives forward depends on its agenda power, the article analyzes the majority versus minority nature of governments, seeking to define the political conditions that favor a level of macroeconomic evolution in keeping with the objective of maintaining power. On the one hand, the results of empirical tests show a post-electoral deterioration of target indicators, as predicted by theoretical models. On the other hand, greater economic dynamism in election years is observed more frequently in governments with a majority in the legislature, a characteristic of the political system generally associated with greater macroeconomic policy efficiency, but also a condition favoring electoral manipulation of policy.

AB  - In this paper I contrast Husserlian transcendental eidetic phenomenology with some other views of what phenomenology is supposed to be and argue that, as eidetic, it does not admit of being 'naturalized' in accordance with standard accounts of naturalization. The paper indicates what some of the eidetic results in phenomenology are and it links these to the employment of reason in philosophical investigation, as distinct from introspection, emotion or empirical observation. Eidetic phenomenology, unlike cognitive science, should issue in a 'logic' of consciousness. Instead of being derived from empirical investigations its results should consist of high-level background conditions that are necessary for cognitive science to be possible in the first place. To negate these conditions is to be faced with certain types of 'material' contradictions. Some analogies with science - mathematical science - are used to develop the argument.

AB  - Temporal variability of rainfall affects earth's climatic systems, and it has a profound impact on the ecosystems, agriculture and society. In this study, a Stability Index (SI) is developed to evaluate long-term rainfall stability using probabilistic indicators [Reliability, Resilience and Vulnerability (RRV)] and geostatistical modelling. Developed index is applied to an Indian arid region using 1979-2013 annual rainfall data. The efficacy of the SI is examined by comparing it with a conventional dispersion statistic viz., coefficient of variation (CV) of the rainfall time series. The 'low' to 'moderate' ranges of Reliability (0.29-0.49), Resilience (0.27-0.50) and Vulnerability (0.35-0.49) suggest that the rainfall in the study area is at a high risk of insufficiency. There are 'strong' to 'moderate' correlation among all the three indicators. It is found that the RRV indicators and SI have no spatial trend and follow normal distribution. 'Spherical', 'circular' and 'exponential' are adjudged to be the best-fit geostatistical models. The scatter plots of RRV indicators and CV, Spearman's rank correlation and Student's t-test revealed that SI precisely account for the long-term stability of annual rainfall. SI is superior to the conventional measure of dispersion as the former addresses risk in terms of frequency of being higher than the mean rainfall and thereby considers ability to return from unsatisfactory to satisfactory condition. Also, the development of SI involves straightforward computation, ease of rainfall data availability at local and regional scales and less time-consuming analysis. It is concluded that the SI based on probability indicators can be a useful tool for analyzing spatio-temporal dynamics of rainfall and delineating prioritized areas for rainwater management at community, river basin and regional scales. The RRV concept could be further extended to solve future environmental problems under changing climate and socio-economic conditions.

AB  - Water resources on the Canadian Prairies are at risk due to human settlement, agricultural intensification, and climatic change. The Red River Valley (RRV), Manitoba, Canada, represents a nexus of these cumulative stressors. Here land use change, combined with a recent increase in precipitation and runoff, imperils the protective function of tributaries draining to Lake Winnipeg. A concerted research effort over the past decade has greatly improved availability of data and knowledge about the RRV. However, a full synthesis of these data and information remain lacking. We undertook a review to identify and compare contemporary and historical land use, climatic, hydrologic, and water quality condition within the RRV. Then, using current knowledge of the ecological condition of streams in the RRV and elsewhere, we completed an ecological causal assessment of RRV tributaries to identify linkages and knowledge gaps between anthropogenic drivers and ecological endpoints. We found wastewater to be the candidate cause of ecological effects in RRV streams best supported by empirical evidence. A lack of complete lines of evidence linking agriculture, the greatest diffuse source of nutrient inputs, and ecological effects in RRV tributaries underscored a need for stressor-specific indicators and improved biomonitoring strategies to better detect likely impacts of land use. We also identified a need for research to connect well-known causal elements in the RRV, such as climatic variables and hydrological alteration, to ecological effects. Our findings provide direction for future research and can aid in development of an adaptive management strategy for tributaries of the RRV.

AB  - In this study, FeNi nanoparticles were green synthesized using Punica granatum (pomegranate) peel extract, and these nanoparticles were also formed in situ over quartz sand (GS-FeNi) for removal of tetracycline (TC). Under the optimized operating conditions, (GS-FeNi concentration: 1.5% w/v; concentration of TC: 20 mg/L; interaction period: 180 min), 99 +/- 0.2% TC removal was achieved in the batch reactor. The removal capacity was 181 +/- 1 mg/g. A detailed characterization of the sorbent and the solution before and after the interaction revealed that the removal mechanism(s) involved both the sorption and degradation of TC. The reusability of reactant was assessed for four cycles of operation, and 77 +/- 4% of TC removal was obtained in the cycle. To judge the environmental sustainability of the process, residual toxicity assay of the interacted TC solution was performed with indicator bacteria (Bacillus and Pseudomonas) and algae (Chlorella sp.), which confirmed a substantial decrease in the toxicity. The continuous column studies were undertaken in the packed bed reactors using GS-FeNi. Employing the optimized conditions, quite high removal efficiency (978 +/- 5 mg/g) was obtained in the columns. The application of GS-FeNi for antibiotic removal was further evaluated in lake water, tap water, and ground water spiked with TC, and the removal capacity achieved was found to be 781 +/- 5, 712 +/- 5, and 687 +/- 3 mg/g, respectively. This work can pave the way for treatment of antibiotics and other pollutants in the reactors using novel green composites prepared from fruit wastes.

AB  - There are millions of small-scale fishers worldwide that rely on coral reefs for their livelihood. Yields from many of these coral reef fisheries, however, have been declining. In Indonesia and other coral reefs worldwide, management approaches are dominated by marine protected areas but other options including gear-restrictions may be feasible and more adaptive to local ecological and social conditions. Yet, there is little data on the impacts and selectivity of fishing gears for coral reef fisheries. In this paper, we present results from a case study on the island of Lombok, where we examine the selectivity and overlap in catch composition of the two main fishing gear types: spearguns and handlines. The catch per unit effort (CPUE) was greater in handlines than spearguns, 10.8 and 9.97 kg trip(-1), respectively. The two gears targeted different fish communities with little overlap in dominant species, suggesting a partitioning of resources; handlines targeted piscivores, whereas spearguns targeted mostly herbivores. Mean trophic level was 3.6 for the handline catch and 2.8 for spearguns, where it was inversely related to CPUE. Spearguns captured more species overall and the number of species increased as the CPUE increased. Length parameters of maturity indicated that neither gear showed signs of (growth) overfishing and fishing grounds dominated by speargun fishers had catches associated with younger ages at first maturity than handlines. Our findings provide local baseline data on the potential utility of gear restrictions as a management tool. Specifically, managers could monitor reefs and reduce handlines when piscivorous fishes are low and on spearguns when species diversity is low or algal abundance is high. Should it become more desirable to implement ecosystem approaches to management that are adaptive to changing ecological and social conditions, these indicators may be used as starting points along with local management preferences of fishers.

AB  - Studying vegetation change across biome boundaries provides insight into vegetation resilience. In this study, shifts in grassland composition are reconstructed from sediments in three wetland sites across altitudinal gradient from 2128 to 897 m.a.s.l., representing a gradient from the grassland biome to the grassland/savanna boundary in the Mpumalanga region, north-eastern South Africa. Phytolith records from Verloren Valei (dated from 10,600 BP), Graskop (dated from 6500 BP) and Versailles (dated from 4500 BP) are used to reconstruct shifts in grassland composition and vegetation change. Phytolith morphotypes are used to construct environmental indices that are correlated with pollen main ecological groups, charcoal and delta 13C and C/N ratio. The results are compared to available regional paleoclimate data. Both Verloren Valei and Graskop have been dominated by grassland, but Versailles show a stronger influence of bushveld/savanna pollen. Phytolith data suggest that grassland composition was stable at Versailles and Graskop, but grassland at Verloren Valei has changed significantly over time. The early Holocene was dominated by a Pooideae/Chloridoideae C3 and C4 grassland, probably a remnant of the earlier Pleistocene cool-dry conditions. After 8500 BP grassland composition changed gradually to a Chloridoideae and Panicoidea dominated C4 grassland BP, and finally a moist Cyperaceae and Panicoidea dominated C3/C4 grassland after 4000 BP. This shift possibly occurs as a delayed response to the warmer and wetter conditions of the mid Holocene optimum at this high altitude site. The results suggest that the grassland/savanna boundary has remained stable over time, indicating considerable resilience of grasslands to climate change. This resilience may be related to the turnover of species within the grassland biome, as indicated by shifts between 8500 and 4000 BP at Verloren Valei. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - It has been suggested that structural ultraviolet (UV) patches on the wings of butterflies play a role in sexual selection. UV patches may be condition-dependent signals of mate quality. In the current study, we investigated associations between the morphological properties of two male wing patterns (one signalling and one non-signalling trait) and between these patterns and various environmental variables in seven species of the genus Gonepteryx (G. rhamni, G. nepalensis, G. maxima, G. amintha, G. aspasia, G. niphonica and G. cleopatra). We collected UV photographs of a total of 320 male specimens and analysed them using geometric morphometrics. Our results show that the shape of UV patches (a signalling trait) is more asymmetric than the wing venation (a non-signalling trait). In both examined traits, however, relationship between the environment and fluctuating asymmetry is significant only in a minority of species. Our results thus do not support the hypothesis that fluctuating asymmetry is a reliable indicator of an individual's quality, in other words, that UV patches are condition-dependent trait. Examination of correlations between the two investigated shapes and the environment yielded similar results, and while the shape of UV patterns tended to be more strongly associated with the environment than the venation patterns, the correlation reached a level of significance only in a minority of cases. Due to the ambiguity of our findings, we cannot corroborate the hypothesis that UV patches act as biological signals of male quality in Gonepteryx butterflies, which is the case in various other related butterfly species. Finally, we found that UV patches discriminate among various Gonepteryx species better than the venation patterns do, which indicates that UV patches play a role in species recognition. It also suggests that UV patterns could be a useful taxonomic trait.

AB  - Wild populations are continuously subjected to changes in environmental factors that pose different challenges. Body condition and hormones have been commonly used as health indicators due to their potential correlation with fitness. In the present study, we analyzed whether habitats of different quality influenced body mass, food intake and physiological stress levels in wild wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus). Field work was seasonally carried out in Holm oak woods and pine forests in central Spain. A total of 93 wood mice from 4 different populations (2 per habitat type) were live-trapped. From each captured individual we noted body mass and food intake, measured as the amount of bait remaining in each trap. The physiological stress levels were measured non-invasively in collected fresh feces by quantifying fecal corticosterone metabolites (FCM) with a 5a-pregnane-3 ss,11 ss, 21-triol-20-one enzyme immunoassay. Wood mice abundances decreased from spring to summer, were higher in Holm oak woods than in pine forests and also resulted in different age-class distribution between both habitats. Individuals inhabiting pine forests showed a lower body mass and increased food intake, probably because of the comparatively lower food quality and availability in this habitat. Furthermore, these individuals showed increased physiological stress levels, likely due to the lower quality habitat in relation to both food and vegetation cover availability. Overall, besides affecting local wood mouse abundance, our study underscores the effect of habitat quality on body mass, food intake and the endocrine stress response. Considering the wood mouse's pivotal position in ecosystems, these results could help in the understanding of environmental traits hampering the viability of wild populations.

AB  - Biodiversity studies of global change mainly focus on direct impacts such as losses in species numbers or ecosystem functions. In this study, we focus on the long-term effects of recent land-cover conversion and subsequent ecological isolation of Kilimanjaro on biodiversity in a paleobiogeographical context, linking our findings with the long-standing question whether colonization of African mountains mainly depended on long-distance dispersal, or whether gradual migration has been possible through habitat bridges under colder climates. For this, we used Orthoptera as bioindicators, whose patterns of endemism and habitat demands we studied on about 500 vegetation plots on Kilimanjaro and Mt. Meru (Tanzania) since 1996. Land-cover changes in the same area were revealed using a supervised classification of Landsat images from 1976 to 2000. In 1976, there was a corridor of submontane forest vegetation linking Kilimanjaro with Mt. Meru, replaced by human settlements and agriculture after 2000. Until recently, this submontane forest bridge facilitated the dispersal of forest animals, illustrated by the large number of endemic submontane forest Orthoptera shared by both mountains. Furthermore, the occurrence of common montane endemics suggests the existence of a former forest corridor with montane vegetation during much earlier times under climatic conditions 2-7 degrees C cooler and 400-1,700mm wetter than today. Based on the endemicity patterns of forest Orthoptera, negative consequences are predicted due to the effects of isolation, in particular for larger forest animals. Kilimanjaro is becoming an increasingly isolated ecosystem with far reaching consequences for diversity and endemism. Forest bridges between East African mountains acted as important migratory corridors and are not only a prehistoric phenomenon during periods with other climatic conditions but also disappeared in some places recently due to increasing and direct anthropogenic impact.

AB  - As part of the study of the Chironomidae fauna in lotic waters of North-Eastern Algeria, nine sampling stations in the Oued Charef basin were visited monthly during a study cycle. This work collected 7615 specimens forming a list of 75 species divided into four subfamilies. For North Africa, 23 species are reported for the first time, including six species of Tanypodinae (Paramerina vaillanti, P. berkana, Procladius lugens, Thienemannimyia zousfana, Trissopelopia longimana, Trissopelopia sp. and Zavrelimyia berberi), eight species of Chironominae (Cladotanytarsus vanderwulpi, Cryptochironomus obreptans, C. supplicans, Cryptotendipes usmaensis, Polypedilum sordens, Micropsectra fallax, M. contracta and Tanytarsus sylvaticus), and nine species of Orthocladinae (Cricotopus tibialis, Chaetocladius insolitus, C. piger, Tokunagaia rectangularis, Heterotrissocladius subpilosus, Limnophyes gurgicola, Nanocladius bicolor, Rheotanytarsus distinctissimus and Smittia sp.). In Algeria, 34 species are reported for the first time: seven Tanypodinae, 15 Chironominae and 12 Orthocladinae. In addition to the species reported as new for North Africa, the following ones can be added: Macropelopia nebulosa, Harnischia curtilamellatus, Microtendipes chloris, M. confinis, Polypedilum convictum, Stictochironomus sp., Paratanytarsus dissimilis, Cricotopus fuscus, C. trifascia and Pseudosmittia sp. This study has highlighted factors that control the distribution of the Chironomidae depending on characteristics of each site and the study season. The results have shown that the occurrence and diversity of chironomid species in these streams are significantly influenced by conductivity, temperature, current velocity and the type of substratum, while altitude had no significant effect on chironomid occurrence and distribution. The Motomura analysis and the ecological indices comparison have shown that the sampled stations are widely different. Despite the extreme environmental conditions undergone by streams of this area (eutrophication, high temperatures, drought in summer and water abstraction), Oued Chaniour was the richest and most balanced community, comprising 40 mostly stenotopic species, which require undisturbed conditions.

AB  - Some populations quickly adapt to strong and novel selection pressures caused by anthropogenic stressors. However, this short-term evolutionary response to novel and harsh environmental conditions may lead to adaptation costs, and evaluating these costs is important if we want to understand the evolution of resistance to anthropogenic stressors. In this experimental evolution study, we exposed Caenorhabditis elegans populations to uranium (U populations), salt (NaCl populations) and alternating uranium/salt treatments (U/NaCl populations) and to a control environment (C populations), over 22 generations. In parallel, we ran common-garden and reciprocal-transplant experiments to assess the adaptive costs for populations that have evolved in the different environmental conditions. Our results showed rapid evolutionary changes in life history characteristics of populations exposed to the different pollution regimes. Furthermore, adaptive costs depended on the type of pollutant: pollution-adapted populations had lower fitness than C populations, when the populations were returned to their original environment. Fitness in uranium environments was lower for NaCl populations than for U populations. In contrast, fitness in salt environments was similar between U and NaCl populations. Moreover, fitness of U/NaCl populations showed similar or higher fitness in both the uranium and the salt environments compared to populations adapted to constant uranium or salt environments. Our results show that adaptive evolution to a particular stressor can lead to either adaptive costs or benefits once in contact with another stressor. Furthermore, we did not find any evidence that adaptation to alternating stressors was associated with additional adaption costs. This study highlights the need to incorporate adaptive cost assessments when undertaking ecological risk assessments of pollutants.

AB  - This study proposes a use of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for environmental assessment. All radial and non-radial models are discussed under natural and managerial disposability. The natural disposability implies corporate strategy by which a firm attempts to decrease an input vector to decrease a vector of undesirable outputs. Given the decreased input vector, a firm attempts to increase a vector of desirable outputs as much as possible. This type of strategy, supported by economists, indicates negative adaptation to a regulation change on undesirable outputs. In contrast, the managerial disposability indicates opposite strategy by increasing the input vector. This disposability expresses corporate strategy by which a firm considers the regulation change as a new business opportunity. A firm attempts to improve its performance by utilizing new environmental technology and/or new management. This type of strategy, supported by corporate strategists in U.S. business schools, indicates positive adaptation to the regulation change on undesirable outputs. Using the proposed DEA assessment, this study examines the relationship among energy consumption, economic development and environmental protection in Japanese prefectures. To theoretically extend the use of DEA for environmental assessment, this study incorporates Strong Complementary Slackness Conditions (SCSCs) into the proposed radial models. The incorporation of SCSCs has three methodological strengths. First, DEA/SCSCs can handle an occurrence of multiple reference sets and multiple projections. Second, the incorporation of SCSCs makes it possible to restrict dual variables (multiples) in a specific range without any prior information. Finally. DEA/SCSCs can bypass the conventional procedure (i.e., a radial model combined with an additive model) used for DEA radial measurement. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Stocking broilers at a high density has been a strategy to optimize the area of the cage and hence increase the efficiency of broiler production. If the environmental (microclimate) conditions and rearing management are not properly managed, stocking broilers at a high density may, however, result in stressful conditions that are harmful for the production, health and welfare of broilers. To ameliorate these unfavorable effects of overcrowding stress, dietary interventions have been conducted. Probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, plant-derived products, vitamins, propolis, amino acids, fatty acids, etc. have been supplemented in diets to deal with the harmful impact of stress induced by a high stocking density of broilers. This review covers the detrimental effects of overcrowding-induced stress on broiler development and attempts to ameliorate those negative effects by dietary interventions.

AB  - Debates about ancient Amazonian social organization have evaluated characterizations from a range of sources that include ethnographically documented foraging societies and archaeological discoveries suggestive of sedentized agriculturists. This study uses qualitative ethnoarchaeological data about foraging and small-scale horticulture among the Pume of Venezuela, and Lewis Binford's quantified database of foraging groups and environmental parameters, to develop a testable model that predicts the conditions under which Amazon Basin foragers would (or would not) intensify subsistence to the point of incorporating maize and other cultivars; as well as the conditions for reversing the process. Specific expectations for the archaeological and paleoenvironmental record are proposed as indicators, and assessed relative to what we currently know from the archaeological record.

In this study, galvanic sludge was characterized in order to identify its structural properties and to evaluate the environmental hazards due to climate conditions that may be caused by this industrial waste when it comes in contact with rainwater. The objective of this research was to evaluate three extraction tests, synthetic precipitation leaching procedure (SPLP), American Society of Testing and Material (ASTM) method and rain water leaching for their ability to extracts metals in galvanic sludge. All three metals (Cr, Ni, Zn) leached above the drinking water standards as well as this leaching results higher with rain water thus possibly posing a potential risk to groundwater with climate conditions.

AB  - The issues addressed by the article concern the assessment of energy efficiency in rail transport, resulting from the proper organization of rail traffic. The problems related to energy consumption and, thus, the negative impact of rail transport on the natural environment are highly significant in terms of the green deal concept, climate change and sustainable development. In this article, energy efficiency is investigated in the context of minimizing the energy consumption necessary to satisfy a specific transport requirement. The essence of this article is to present an approach to energy-efficient planning of rail freight traffic. This article aims to develop a method covers the allocation of railway vehicles dedicated to freight traffic (locomotives and railcars) to perform a defined transport task, taking into account the energy efficiency assessment of the solution, routing the train launched with regard to the accomplishment of the defined transport task on the railway network, and determining the conditions of transport for a defined transport task, taking into account the allocated rolling stock (locomotives and railcars) and the route. In this article, based on the presented state of knowledge, a decision-making model has been proposed, including the model's parameters, the values being searched for, indicators for assessing the quality of the solution, as well as the limitations and boundary conditions of the problem. The function of minimizing the energy consumption necessary to transport a shipment within the railway network (determining the energy efficiency of the proposed solution) has been proposed as the criterion. In addition, a description of the proprietary method of selecting rolling stock for accomplishing tasks, based on the assessment of the energy efficiency of the solution and a case study illustrating the operation of the method on the example of the area of Poland, has been presented.

AB  - Hybrid systems combining heat pump and gas heater can demonstrate the economic benefits, while their environmental performance is rarely investigated. In this paper, a comprehensive environmental performance investigation has been conducted to reveal the potential for emission reductions. A new environmental impact methodology has been built, and various influencing factors are evaluated. In respect of the climates, the hourly energy consumption emission first increases and then declines, which is the result of multiple effects from the weighting factors of fuel source emissions and each heating sector's performance. Under the operation condition map for the current study, the effects of the target (final) water temperatures, electricity generation emission factor reduction, and price ratios are revealed to be the top 3 heaviest fluctuations for emissions for hourly system operation energy consumption, followed by each heating sector's efficiency enhancements. The environmental impacts due to hourly system operation do not closely follow the hourly energy consumption profile for the effect of climate conditions and can be quite opposite when considering the effect of fuel source price ratios. In addition, the lifetime environmental performance has been examined for typical cities in China. In the cold region, such as Shenyang, the emission due to the natural gas contributor shares more than 46% of the total emissions. For warm cities (Shanghai, Wuhan, and Chengdu), the emission of the natural gas is only responsible for 9% or even less of the total emissions. A switch from R410A (GWP(100):1924) to R452B (GWP(100):675) can also lead to 11% emission total reductions for city of Shanghai, Wuhan, and Chengdu. It is anticipated that the viewpoints and insights from this study can be beneficial for the engineers, policymakers, scholars, public, and manufactures to maintaining the maximum sustainability and economic benefits.

AB  - In birds, the steroid hormone corticosterone (CORT) is considered a major mediator in a number of physiological mechanisms and behaviours critical for the regulation of an organism's energy balance. However, the question of whether the way in which circulating plasma CORT is incorporated into feathers actually reflects this regulation, and consequently whether feather CORT (CORT-F) measures allow to make inferences on past levels of energetic demands (also known as the allostatic load), remains unclear. While previous studies have yielded promising results, the technique still wants further study and validation in a wider range of bird species, across life-history stages and under different ecological situations. Here, we tested whether CORT-F levels in a sample of 427 nestling black kites (Milvus migrans) reflected interindividual variation in a number of environmental, social and physiological variables known to elevate allostatic load during development. We found that nestlings exposed to low ambient temperatures exhibited high CORT-F, suggesting that feathers registered the expected rise in circulating CORT levels inducing thermogenesis in response to cold stress. CORT-F was also negatively related to body condition, supporting the notion that allostasis becomes less affordable as energy stores become depleted. Finally, CORT-F also reflected brood hierarchy rank, with subordinate chicks exhibiting the highest levels, followed by first-hatched (dominant) chicks and lastly singleton nestlings. Moreover, CORT-F levels in nestlings from multiple-chick broods (but not in singletons) declined with age, mirroring the dynamics of establishment and stabilization of sibling hierarchies in black kites. Altogether, our results underscore the potential of using CORT-F to infer allostatic load in wild avian populations and their potential power as indicator tools in conservation biology.

AB  - Bituminous coals and carbonaceous shales, located in the Jiza-Qamar Basin, on the eastern Yemen, were analysed based on a combined investigation of organic geochemistry and petrology to define the palaeodepositional environment condition, organic matter inputs and their thermal maturity. Carbon isotope compositions and various biomarkers were performed on coals and carbonaceous shales within the Upper Cretaceous Mukalla Formation in the Jiza-Qamar Basin. The delta C-13 values range from -29.2 parts per thousand to -24.5 parts per thousand with average values around -26.7 parts per thousand, whereas the organic carbon contents in most sediment samples are consistently high (>3%), indicating that the organic matter in the Mukalla coal and carbonaceous shale sediments has a predominantly terrigenous origin with slightly marine influence during burial. This has also been identified from kerogen microscopy, which is characterized by dominance of vitrinite and liptinite organic matter.
   The investigated biomarkers indicated that the Mukalla coals and carbonaceous shales contain high contribution of land plants with a minor aquatic organic matter input that was deposited in a fluvial to deltaic environments and preserved under relatively oxic conditions. This has been achieved from acyclic isoprenoids, terpane and sterane biomarkers of a saturated hydrocarbon and dibenzothiophene, alkylnaphthalene and methylphenanthrene biomarkers of an aromatic hydrocarbon.
   Based on the analysed biomarker thermal maturity indicators, it may be deduced that the Mukalla coals and carbonaceous shales in the Jiza-Qamar Basin have entered an early-mature to mature stages for hydrocarbon generation. This is also supported by vitrinite reflectance values of 0.63-0.83% Ro indicative that these sediments have reached oil window maturity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nowadays, genetically modified plants are cultivated in many countries and it is important to consider their safety for surrounding environment. So, the environmental risk assessments of genetically modified plants are evaluated. This assessment consists of an objective evaluation of risk and involves generating; collecting and assessing of information on a GM plant with the aim to determine its impact on human or animal health and the environment relative to non-genetically modified organisms. One of the numerous methods used to investigate the impact of GM plants on the environment is the Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism. This method was used for comparison of genetic variation in populations of bacteria isolated from rhizosphere of genetically modified maize MON810 carrying the gene crylAb and genetically nonmodified maize. Rhizosphere samples were collected in Slovakia during two years (2008, 2009) in July and September and 16S rRNA gene was amplified from metagenomic DNA using universal eubacterial primers. Differences in the number of terminal restriction fragments between control and GM maize hybrids were not detected. Additionally, variation within bacterial communities composition from rhizosphere of MON810 and non-GM hybrids was not observed, nevertheless negligible differences in composition of bacterial community were observed between two sampling periods (July and September). These changes were observed in non-GM as well as in GM maize hybrids and reflected effects of environment and conditions, no influence of genetic modification. The 16S rDNA clone library creation from rhizosphere sample of MON810 maize followed by DNA sequencing revealed that the Proteobacteria were major group of bacteria and Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Chloroflexi were less represented. This study did not confirm any changes in the soil ecosystem, which would have been larger than normal variations caused by external conditions.

AB  - High-resolution geochemical analysis of a 6-m-long sediment core from Zoar Lake, southern Spain, provides a detailed characterization of major changes in lake and watershed processes during the last 4,000 years. Geochemical variables were used as paleolimnological indicators and complement Zoar Lakes's paleoenvironmental reconstruction based on sedimentological and biological proxies, which define periods of increasing allochthonous input to the lake and periods of dominant autochthonous sedimentation. Chemical ratios identify periods of endogenic carbonate formation (higher Ca/Al, Sr/Al and Ba/Al ratios), evaporite precipitation (higher S/Al, Sr/Al ratios), and anoxic conditions (higher Mo/Al, U/Th ratios and Eu anomaly). Higher productivity is marked by elevated organic carbon content and carbonate precipitation (Mg/Ca). Hydrological reconstruction for Zoar Lake was based on sedimentological, mineralogical and biological proxies, and shows that lower lake levels are characterized by Sr-rich sediments (a brackish lake with aragonite) and S-rich sediments (a saline lake with gypsum), while higher lake levels are characterized by sediments enriched in elements associated with alumino-silicates (Al, K, Ti, Fe, trace and rare earth elements), reflecting fresher conditions. Geochemical indicators also mark periods of higher detrital input to the lake related to human activity in the watershed: (1) during the Iberian Roman Humid Period (650 BC-AD 300), around the onset of the Little Ice Age (AD 1400), during the relatively drier Post-Roman and Middle Ages (AD 800-1400), and over the last 50 years, due to mechanized farming practices. Heavy metal enrichment in the sediments (Cu and Ni) suggests intensification of human activities during the Iberian Roman Period, and the use of fertilizers during the last 50 years.

AB  - Pesticide risk indicators provide simple support in the assessment of environmental and health risks from pesticide use, and can therefore inform policies to foster a sustainable interaction of agriculture with the environment. For their relative simplicity, indicators may be particularly useful under conditions of limited data availability and resources, such as in Less Developed Countries (LDCs). However, indicator complexity can vary significantly, in particular between those that rely on an exposure-toxicity ratio (ETR) and those that do not. In addition, pesticide risk indicators are usually developed for Western contexts, which might cause incorrect estimation in LDCs. This study investigated the appropriateness of seven pesticide risk indicators for use in LDCs, with reference to smallholding agriculture in Colombia. Seven farm-level indicators, among which 3 relied on an ETR (POCER, EPRIP, PIRI) and 4 on a non-ETR approach (EIQ, PestScreen, OHRI, Dosemeci et al., 2002), were calculated and then compared by means of the Spearman rank correlation test. Indicators were also compared with respect to key indicator characteristics, i.e. user friendliness and ability to represent the system under study. The comparison of the indicators in terms of the total environmental risk suggests that the indicators not relying on an ETR approach cannot be used as a reliable proxy for more complex, i.e. ETR, indicators. ETR indicators, when user-friendly, show a comparative advantage over non-ETR in best combining the need for a relatively simple tool to be used in contexts of limited data availability and resources, and for a reliable estimation of environmental risk. Non-ETR indicators remain useful and accessible tools to discriminate between different pesticides prior to application. Concerning the human health risk, simple algorithms seem more appropriate for assessing human health risk in LDCs. However, further research on health risk indicators and their validation under LDC conditions is needed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ordovician-Silurian black shales are the source rocks in the Palaeozoic petroleum system in Iraq. However, their source and depositional conditions from their mineralogy and inorganic geochemistry are quite lacking in previous works. These shales also provide an opportunity to examine the changes in paleoenvironment, paleoclimate and paleoredox conditions across the Ordovician-Silurian transition.
   The Ordovician black shales comprise of kaolinite, illite, chlorite, quartz, dolomite, calcite, and traces of feldspars and siderite, while the Silurian black shales comprise of illite, quartz, calcite, dolomite and pyrite. Calculated SiO2 (wt %) and Al2O3/TiO2 ratios suggest felsic source rocks for the Ordovician black shales and intermediate source rocks for Silurian hot shales. The shallow marine setting for the Ordovician black shales that changed to a deeper environment during the Silurian time was interpreted from the V, P2O5, and Al2O3 diagrams is consistent with the abundance of trace fossils Monocraterion sp., Cruziana problematica, Diplichnites sp., and Skolithos sp. which refer to proximal shallow marine conditions and abundance of graptolites monograptus in the Silurian black shales, which refer to an open-marine environment. Paleoredox indicators such as TOC and Mn contents as well as Ni/Co, V/Ni, U/Th, and V/Cr ratios prove fluctuation of redox conditions from oxic in the Ordovician shales to anoxic in the Silurian black shales. Late Ordovician glaciation in Iraq can be indicated from the low values of chemical index of weathering (CIA = 52-58) in the samples from the upper part of the upper part of the Khabour Formation that refer to cold and arid climate conditions that prevailed during the late Ordovician time. Abundance of extrabasinal and poor-sorted mud clasts in this interval might support the glaciogenic origin of this part. The black shales in the Khabour Formation is considered as fair source rock (average TOC = 0.9 wt%), while that in the Akkas Formation is an excellent source rock (average TOC = 13.2 wt%) for hydrocarbon generation. Kerogen in the Ordovician and Silurian black shales were derived from marine organic matter as indicated by the binary plot and total C1-C15-n-C6-n-C14-n-C15 + ternary diagram. Organic matter in the Ordovician black shales is highly matured compared to that in the Silurian black shales due to higher illite crystallinity (IC) values in the Ordovician (0.61-0.75 degrees D2 theta) relative to that in the Silurian (0.45-0.55 degrees D2 theta) black shales.

AB  - The identification of factors determining the adaptation and nitrogen (N) utilization of spelt wheat is important for the successful introduction of the crop to a new environment. The present study was carried out to investigate the relative importance of grain-filling rate and duration of grain growth and to analyse the nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUtE) and biomass production efficiency of spelt under Mediterranean conditions. The performance of spelt was evaluated in relation to a well-adapted bread wheat cultivar. Three spelt cultivars (Ressac, Poeme and Cosmos) and one bread wheat cultivar (Centauro) were grown for two growing seasons on a silty clay soil under two N levels (0 and 100 kg N/ha). Grain-filling parameters were estimated using the cubic polynomial model. This model provided good fit to the grain-filling data of spelt cultivars, with high coefficients of determination (R-2) that ranged from 0.868 to 0.999. Cultivar differences were found for all grain-filling parameters studied, and these differences accounted for most of the variation observed within each particular grain-filling component in both years. Grain filling of spelt plants took place under adverse environmental conditions, mainly high temperatures, which led to a shortening of the grain-filling period. This fact was not fully compensated by the increase in the grain-filling rate, and eventually resulted in a reduction of the final spelt grain weight. Selection for early-flowering cultivars could be a successful strategy to moderate the influence of the environment on grain filling and improve the adaptation of spelt under Mediterranean conditions. The mean grain-filling rate was positively correlated with dry matter translocation, suggesting the crucial role of reserve assimilates in the vegetative tissues for the grain growth of spelt. The efficiency of N utilization to produce biomass was greater during the grain-filling period than the vegetative period. Averaged across N application rates, NUtE in spelt ranged from 20.1 to 29.5 g grain/g plant N. Cultivar differences in NUtE were observed in both years. Grain yield per unit grain N (grain DM/grain total N at maturity) contributed more to the total variation in NUtE among spelt cultivars compared with N harvest index (NHI). Spelt showed lower NUtE values, probably due to its higher grain N concentration and lower NHI compared with wheat. Low straw N concentration at maturity may be an indicator of improved NUtE in spelt, as evidenced by the negative relationship detected between the two variables. These results provide a better understanding of factors related with the adaptation and N utilization of spelt under Mediterranean conditions.

AB  - Treatment with Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells (MSCs) in clinical trials is becoming one of the most-popular and fast-developing branches of modern regenerative medicine, as it is still in an experimental phase. The cross-section of diseases to which these cells are applied is very wide, ranging from degenerative diseases, through autoimmune processes and to acute inflammatory diseases, e.g., viral infections. Indeed, now that first clinical trials applying MSCs against COVID-19 have started, important questions concern not only the therapeutic properties of MSCs, but also the changes that might occur in the cell features as a response to the "cytokine storm" present in the acute phase of an infection and capable of posing a risk to a patient. The aim of our study was thus to assess changes potentially occurring in the biology of MSCs in the active inflammatory environment, e.g., in regards to the cell cycle, cell migration and secretory capacity. The study using MSCs derived from Wharton's jelly (WJ-MSCs) was conducted under two aerobic conditions: 21% O-2 vs. 5% O-2, since oxygen concentration is one of the key factors in inflammation. Under both oxygen conditions cells were exposed to proinflammatory cytokines involved significantly in acute inflammation, i.e., IFN gamma, TNF alpha and IL-1 beta at different concentrations. Regardless of the aerobic conditions, WJ-MSCs in the inflammatory environment do not lose features typical for mesenchymal cells, and their proliferation dynamic remains unchanged. Sudden fluctuations in proliferation, the early indicator of potential genetic disturbance, were not observed, while the cells' migration activity increased. The presence of pro-inflammatory factors was also found to increase the secretion of such anti-inflammatory cytokines as IL-4 and IL-10. It is concluded that the inflammatory milieu in vitro does not cause phenotype changes or give rise to proliferation disruption of WJ-MSCs, and nor does it inhibit the secretory properties providing for their use against acute inflammation.

AB  - Determining the conditions for further liberalization and the reality of long-term and effective trade and economic cooperation of Ukraine with the EU countries requires assessing the strength and probability of the influence of institutional factors. The possibility of taking into account the significance of institutional factors in the development of foreign trade relations creates a gravity modelling. Determination of gravitational principles of foreign trade actualizes the problem of developing the gravity model, which takes into account impact of institutional factors, contains the necessary and sufficient number of factors, and may be tested for adequacy based on statistical data. The purpose of the paper is to construct the gravity model taking into account the institutional conditions of trade and its empirical verification on the example of trade turnover between Ukraine and the EU. Methodology. Methods of statistical analysis and econometric modelling were used for constructing the gravity model, estimating its statistical significance and predictive ability. In the article, the necessity of taking into account the influence of institutional factors on the formation of the competitive status of the country in the sphere of international trade is substantiated. It is proved that, in conditions of increasing the contradictory nature of trade relations, the role of institutional gravity factors in foreign trade between states increases. The result of the article is the gravity model with such explanatory factors, as the gross domestic product of trade partners in purchasing power parity and the complex characteristic of "trade distance" between countries as an indicator of the influence of institutional factors on foreign trade relations. As a conclusion, it may be noted that the model is statistically significant, adequately describes the input data. The proposed model takes into account the presence of institutional factors of foreign trade, whose influence on the interstate trade and economic cooperation conditions is constantly increasing. Value/originality. The proposed results can be used for modelling and forecasting of foreign trade between trading partners, taking into account the impact of specific institutional factors on their foreign trade relations.

AB  - Northwestern Iberia is characterized for being an Atlantic/Mediterranean transitional area, where the most natural forests contain certain species, typical from either biogeographic region, growing under limiting conditions due to their marginal location. In order to identify the main climatic factors controlling growth, and thus better understand how they impact wood formation processes of the key tree species in these ecosystems, we analyzed tree rings of two somehow contrasting oaks (Quercus robur, Atlantic; and Q. pyrenaica, sub Mediterranean) at their distribution boundary towards the Mediterranean region. For this, two nearby sites with slightly different regime of water availability were selected for each species. We developed chronologies of radial increment (expressed as latewood width) and functional anatomical traits (size and number of earlywood vessels) for the last decades, and also monitored wood formation along two growing seasons. Our results suggest that the combination of anatomical traits and radial growth constitute a useful tool to understand the behavior of these species in boundary distribution areas. We found some differences between sites, especially for Q. pyrenaica, but the main factors controlling growth were clearly identified at all sites. Earlywood characteristics were mainly related to temperature, whereas latewood width responded to precipitation, regardless of the species. However, vessels of low-elevation Q. robur seemed to be controlled by factors affecting carbohydrate balance, while those of high-elevation Q. pyrenaica were associated to spring conditions for growth resumption. Summer water availability was linked to a wider latewood for both species. In addition, the analysis of xylogenesis carried out at all sites was essential to interpret climate responses by providing evidences for the existence of a cause-effect relationship.

AB  - In seasonally dry tropical environments, natural archives of isotopes present in cellulose of tree rings can be used to study changes in the hydrological cycle. We investigated the stable oxygen isotope ratios in tree-ring cellulose (delta O-18(TRC)) of Cedrela odorata L. from Caatinga forest, northeastern Brazil, and tested if delta O-18(TRC) is correlated to climate parameters. We extracted the alpha-cellulose from the most recent 50 tree rings (1968-2017). The inter-annual variation of delta O-18(TRC) was strongly synchronized (r = 0.65) among all five studied individuals and closely related to changes in humidity during the growing season. The delta O-18(TRC) was significantly correlated (p < 0.01) with precipitation (r = - 0.59), relative humidity (r = - 0.37), air temperature (r = 0.55), soil water deficit (r = 0.62) and PDSI drought index (r = - 0.62), with most significant correlation during wet season and in the first month of the dry season. The relationship with local climate variables reflects the effect of evaporative enrichment of leaf water on delta O-18(TRC), whereby dry soil conditions, the low relative humidity and high air temperature reduce stomatal conductance and lead to increased evaporative enrichment of delta O-18(TRC). Spatial correlations revealed a strong impact of PDSI in delta O-18(TRC). Our results also show an increase in delta O-18(TRC) values from the 1990s onwards due to extreme and recurring droughts in northeastern Brazil. We conclude that delta O-18(TRC) variations are related to the climatic conditions, especially during the wet period due to the greater water availability for plant physiological processes.

AB  - There is growing evidence that both increases in mean temperature and the widespread daily temperature fluctuations (DTF) may increase pesticide toxicity. Nevertheless, the likely more stressful, realistic combination of the two warming-related stressors has rarely been considered in ecotoxicology. Moreover, we have little knowledge on whether these stressor combinations could impair ecosystem functioning. We examined the effect of the pesticide chlorpyrifos under an increased mean temperature (+4 degrees C, from 18 degrees C to 22 degrees C) and in the presence of DTF (constant and 8 degrees C) on two life-history traits (mortality and growth rate) and one ecologically important behavioural trait (feeding rate) in the freshwater isopod Asellus aquaticus. The chlorpyrifos concentration used, 0.2 mu g/L, did not cause mortality in any thermal condition, nor did it cause sublethal effects at the mean temperature of 18 degrees C. A key finding was that growth rate was strongly reduced by the pesticide only under the combination of both a higher mean temperature and DTF, highlighting the importance of testing toxicity under this realistic thermal scenario. The leaf consumption of chlorpyrifos-exposed isopods increased at the higher mean temperature when this was kept constant, however, it lowered again towards control levels when DTF was induced, thereby contributing to the growth reduction at this most stressful condition. These alterations of growth and leaf degradation rates may impact nutrient recycling, a key ecosystem function. Our results highlight the importance of integrating both increases in mean temperature and in DTF to improve current and future ecological risk assessment of pesticides. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Slow sand filters (SSFs) have been shown to effectively improve water quality. The aim of the present study was to obtain low-cost materials (LCMs) as filter mediums (FMs) to efficiently purify harvested rainwater and to document the relationship between bacterial community structure and water purification. The red clay was mixed with crushed limestone and crushed brick, respectively. The mixtures or brick powder were used as the filter media for SSFs. Laboratory column tests were conducted in conjunction with the monitoring of representative water quality parameters (COD, NH4+, CFU and total coliforms) to estimate the performance of low-cost material slow sand filters (LCM-SSFs), including the time needed for biofilm maturation. The relationship between bacterial community structure and SSF performance was determined using a combination of 16S rRNA gene sequencing and an array of statistical techniques. The results demonstrated that LCM-SSFs perform well in purifying harvested rainwater, and are of superior economic benefit. LCMs had a stronger adsorptivity than quartz sand, which enhanced the purification of harvested rainwater before the biofilms matured, and shorten the time required for biofilm maturation. During the 90-day laboratory experiment, a mixture of crushed limestone and red clay exhibited the best performance. The abundance of Opitutae could be used as a potential indicator of NH4+ removal efficiency by SSFs. Schmutzdecke was characterized by abundant, diverse and evenly distributed bacterial communities that produced rich, stable and robust environmental functions, and that possessed an excellent purifying capacity. Environmental conditions associated with low ecological stress, such as neutral pH filter mediums and lucifugal experimental conditions, were conducive to the diversity and evenness of effluent bacterial communities and improved the performance of LCM-SSFs in purifying harvested rainwater.

AB  - Populus tomentosa grow rapidly, but are salt susceptible. To quickly and efficiently gain new poplar breeds with better salt resistance, a DREB transcription factor derived from Atriplex hortensis was transformed into triploid Populus tomentosa by our lab, which significantly improved the salt tolerance of host plants. However, environmental impacts of transgenic plants must be assessed before large-scale cultivation in China. Here, we conducted a field trial of AhDREB1 transgenic and non-transgenic triploid Populus tomentosa to assess the impact of transgenic trees on rhizospheric soil microbial communities and allelopathic activity of leaves. No significant differences in the number of soil microbes present were detected between the transgenic lines and the non-transgenic controls. The allelopathic activity of leaves from both the transgenic and non-transgenic lines varied with sampling time, but did not differ significantly between the transgenic and non-transgenic lines. These results indicate that the impact on the environment of AhDREB1 transgenic P. tomentosa did not differ significantly from that of the non-transformed controls for the variables observed in this field trial. We also investigated the persistence of AhDREB1 genes in decomposing transgenic poplar leaf on the soil under natural conditions for five months, and our data indicated that fragments of the genetically modified DNA were not detectable in the field after more than two months. We used a triphenyl tetrazolium chloride test (TTC) (or pollen germination method) and hybridization to test the pollen viability and fertility, respectively, of the transgenic and non-transgenic trees and the results showed that the pollen viability of both the transgenic and non-transgenic trees was extremely low in 2016; the receptor plant may have been sterile.

AB  - We tested the usefulness of the 5 alpha(H)-stanol/Delta(5)-sterol ratios obtained by the tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) thermochemolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method used to reconstruct redox events in marine sediments as a redox tracer in lake sediments using cores from Lake Suigetsu, Japan. The lake was previously a freshwater lake and is now brackish owing to excavation works conducted during the 17th century. Other redox tracer analyses (e.g., based on farnesol) have shown that C26(nor-24)Delta(22)/C26(nor-24)Delta(5,22) (24-nordehydrocholestanol/24-nprdehydrpcholesterol), C-28(24Me)Delta(22)/C-28(24Me)Delta(5,22) (diatomstanoficliatomsteml), and C-27 Delta(22)/C-27 Delta(5,22) (22-dehydrocholestanol/22-de hydrocholesterol) ratios have risen (similar to 0.53) following strong anoxic conditions that formed in Lake Suigetsu (A.D. 1848 and 1935). This study is the first to show that 5 alpha(H)-stanol/Delta(5)-sterol ratios determined using the TMAH method could be useful as a redox tracer in lacustrine environments. In particular, the ratio of diatomsterol, which is detected in both brackish and fresh water in relatively high abundance, has the potential to be a very useful tracer of redox events. On the other hand, the other 5 alpha(H)-stanol/Delta(5)-sterol ratios (C-27 Delta(0)/C-27 Delta(5) [cholestanol/cholesterol], C-28(24me)Delta(0)/C-28(24me)Delta(5) [campestanol/campesterol], and C-29(24Et)Delta(0)/C-29(24Et)Delta(5) [sitostanol/sitosterol] ratios) showed no increasing trends, suggesting the influence of terrestrial inputs from degraded products.

AB  - Soil nutrient content plays a key role in plant growth through mineral nutrition and toxicity. Its impact on plant species and community distribution is studied on a large geographical scale through surrogates like topography or geology. We investigated the importance of soil pH and C:N ratio, as direct nutritional gradients, to determine, with climatic factors, the spatial distribution of plant communities over large territories.
   We studied the distribution of six beech habitats of the NATURA 2000 network throughout France (550,000 km(2)).
   Models were calibrated with 2108 floristic plots classified in the NATURA 2000 system and including climatic and topographic variables and soil nutritional measurements carried out in a laboratory. Logistic regression was used to model habitat distribution according to environmental variables. Climatic layers, a digital elevation model and maps of soil pH and nitrogen content, created using plant indicator values and large floristic databases, were used to map the sites suitable for beech communities. Distribution models were evaluated with an independent set of 2091 phytosociological plots.
   pH and nitrogen supply were the key distribution drivers for four of the six beech communities on a national scale. Their use in the distribution models distinguished within homogeneous climatic territories a gradient of nutritional conditions from acidic areas, suitable for nutrient-poor beech communities, to calcareous areas suitable for nutrient-rich ones. Predicted maps of beech habitats fit the spatial distribution of validation plots.
   Soil pH and nitrogen supply strongly improve predictions of forest community distribution carried out with climatic variables on a broad geographical scale. They allow delineation of areas with nutritional conditions suitable for each community, as well as the realization of predictive high-resolution maps over large areas useful for sustainable and conservation management.

AB  - In the present study, indium tin oxide (ITO) was used as a transparent working electrode for the development of an electrochemical sensor for the detection of mercury (II) ions (Hg2+). The electrode was modified by direct electrodeposition of polyaniline (PANI), multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) followed by optimization of the analyte and operating conditions, aiming to improve the selectivity, sensitivity and reliability of the electrode for mercury detection. Successful immobilization of the PANI and nanomaterials (MWCNTs and AuNPs) on the ITO electrode was confirmed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses. The optimum conditions for mercury detection using the modified ITO electrode were pH 7.0 of Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM) in the presence of 1 mM methylene blue (MB) as a redox indicator, a scan rate of 0.10 V center dot s(-1) and a 70 s interaction time. The electrochemical behavior of the modified electrode under the optimized conditions indicated a high reproducibility and high sensitivity of mercury detection. It is therefore suggested that the PANI/MWCNT/AuNP-modified ITO electrode could be a promising material for the development of on-site mercury detection tools for applications in fields such as diagnostics, the environment, safety and security controls or other industries.

AB  - As a key initiator of polymerization, azo compounds (azos) can supply abundant energy to the polymerization process. Although polymerization can be implemented more smoothly and the product can be modified, the use of azos also increases the probability of process hazards caused by high heat accumulation and release. To preserve the thermal safety of using azo initiators in the synthesis process, the frequently used azo initiators dimethyl 2,2'-azobis(2-methyl propionate) (AIBME) and 2,2'-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile) (ABVN) were chosen for investigation. Under process conditions, initiators are essential for evolving and monitoring chemical reactions on both the laboratory scale and process environment. The assessment, control, and mitigation of reaction hazards are primarily based on kinetic models, which are used to estimate multiple critical safety parameters, such as TMRad in process safety and TCL and SADT in storage and transportation operation. The data from the adiabatic calorimeter correspond to real process situations are combined with the nonlinear adiabatic kinetic model, which is rarely applied to analyze the thermal hazard properties of azos. The results indicated that the kinetic model of azos in the actual process, the thermal hazard characteristics, and simulation of the runaway mode of azos in setting boundary conditions should also be investigated.

AB  - Sediments in Lower Murray Lake, northern Ellesmere Island, Nunavut Canada (81A degrees 21'A N, 69A degrees 32'A W) contain annual laminations (varves) that provide a record of sediment accumulation through the past 5000+ years. Annual mass accumulation was estimated based on measurements of varve thickness and sediment bulk density. Comparison of Lower Murray Lake mass accumulation with instrumental climate data, long-term records of climatic forcing mechanisms and other regional paleoclimate records suggests that lake sedimentation is positively correlated with regional melt season temperatures driven by radiative forcing. The temperature reconstruction suggests that recent temperatures are similar to 2.6A degrees C higher than minimum temperatures observed during the Little Ice Age, maximum temperatures during the past 5200 years exceeded modern values by similar to 0.6A degrees C, and that minimum temperatures observed approximately 2900 varve years BC were similar to 3.5A degrees C colder than recent conditions. Recent temperatures were the warmest since the fourteenth century, but similar conditions existed intermittently during the period spanning similar to 4000-1000 varve years ago. A highly stable pattern of sedimentation throughout the period of record supports the use of annual mass accumulation in Lower Murray Lake as a reliable proxy indicator of local climatic conditions in the past.

AB  - The wet air oxidation of aqueous solutions of polyethylene glycol, a synthetic polymer used in a wide range of applications, has been investigated at temperatures from 383 to 513 K and oxygen partial pressures From 2 to 3 MPa. Molecular weights From 62 (ethylene glycol) to 35,000 were studied with respect to their behaviour under wet oxidation conditions in terms of the intermediate compounds produced and the reaction mechanisms. It was found that the autocatalytic mechanism of thermochemical autoxidation was capable of converting macromolecules to lower molecular weight end-products, such as oligomers and carboxylic acids, at very short reaction times and mild operating conditions. The oxidation of the lower molecular weight products was also studied to aid the mechanistic interpretation. Total oxidation of these compounds to carbon dioxide proved to be difficult since compounds such as ethylene glycol and acetic acid are very resistant to chemical oxidation even under more severe conditions. Assessments of the aerobic biodegradability of polyethylene glycols, before and after wet air oxidation, were performed by measuring BOD5/COD ratios and the results are compared to those reported in the literature. The drawbacks of using BOD/COD ratios as an index of aerobic biodegradability are discussed and implications for integrated chemical-biological treatment are given.

AB  - Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) measurement of enterococci has been proposed as a rapid technique for assessment of beach water quality, but the response of qPCR results to environmental conditions has not been fully explored. Culture-based E. coli and enterococci have been used in empirical predictive models to characterize their responses to environmental conditions and to increase monitoring frequency and efficiency. This approach has been attempted with qPCR results only in few studies. During the summer of 2006, water samples were collected from two southern Lake Michigan beaches and the nearby river outfall (Burns Ditch) and were analyzed for enterococci by culture-based and non-culture-based (i.e., qPCR) methods, as well as culture-based E. coli. Culturable enterococci densities (log CFU/100 ml) for the beaches were significantly correlated with enterococci qPCR cell equivalents (CE) (R=0.650, P<0.0001, N=32). Enterococci CE and CFU densities were highest in Burns Ditch relative to the beach sites; however, only CFUs were significantly higher (P<0.0001). Culturable enterococci densities at Burns Ditch and the beaches were significantly correlated (R=0.565, P<0.0001, N=32). Culturable E. coli and enterococci densities were significantly correlated (R=0.682, P<0.0001, N=32). Regression analyses suggested that enterococci CFU could be predicted by lake turbidity, Burns Ditch discharge, and wind direction (adjusted R-2=0.608); enterococci CE was best predicted by Burns Ditch discharge and log-transformed lake turbidity x wave height (adjusted R-2=0.40). In summary, our results show that analytically, the qPCR method compares well to the non-culture-based method for measuring enterococci densities in beach water and that both these approaches can be predicted by hydrometeorological conditions. Selected predictors and model results highlight the differences between the environmental responses of the two method endpoints and the potentially high variance in qPCR results.

AB  - Young children are infected by a diverse range of enteric pathogens in high disease burden settings, suggesting pathogen contamination of the environment is equally diverse. This study aimed to characterize across- and within-neighborhood diversity in enteric pathogen contamination of public domains in urban informal settlements of Kisumu, Kenya, and to assess the relationship between pathogen detection patterns and human and domestic animal sanitation conditions. Microbial contamination of soil and surface water from 166 public sites in three Kisumu neighborhoods was measured by enterococcal assays and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for 19 enteric pathogens. Regression was used to assess the association between observed sanitary indicators of contamination with enterococci and pathogen presence and concentration, and pathogen diversity. Seventeen types of pathogens were detected in Kisumu public domains. Enteric pathogens were codetected in 33% of soil and 65% of surface water samples. Greater pathogen diversity was associated with the presence of domestic animal feces but not with human open defecation, deteriorating latrines, flies, or disposal of human feces. Sanitary conditions were not associated with enterococcal bacteria, specific pathogen concentrations, or "any pathogen". Young children played at 40% of observed sites. Managing domestic animal feces may be required to reduce enteric pathogen environmental contamination in high-burden settings.

AB  - Only a portion of the population exposed to trauma will develop persistent emotional alterations characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which illustrates the necessity for identifying vulnerability factors and novel pharmacotherapeutic alternatives. Interestingly, clinical evidence suggests that novelty seeking is a good predictor for vulnerability to the development of excessive and persistent fear. Here, we first tested this hypothesis by analyzing contextual and cued fear responses of rats selected for their high (high responders, HR) or low (low responders, LR) exploration of a novel environment, indicator of novelty seeking. While HR and LR rats exhibited similar sensitivity to the shock and cued fear memory retention, fewer extinction sessions were required in HR than LR animals to reach extinction, indicating faster contextual and cued memory extinction. In a second part, we found an effective disruption of contextual fear reconsolidation by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine, associated with a down-regulation of early growth response 1 (Egr1) in the hippocampal CA1 area, and up-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) mRNA levels in the prelimbic and infralimbic cortices. Altogether, these data demonstrate a link between novelty seeking and conditioned fear extinction, and highlight a promising novel role of ketamine in affecting established fear memory.

AB  - Recruitment variability in many fish populations is postulated to be influenced by climatic and oceanographic variability. However, a mechanistic understanding of the influence of specific variables on recruitment is generally lacking. Feeding ecology is one possible mechanism that more directly links ocean conditions and recruitment. We test this mechanism using juvenile Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) collected off the west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, in 2000-2009. Stable isotopes of carbon (C-13), an indicator of temperature or primary productivity, and nitrogen (N-15), an indicator of trophic position, were taken from muscle tissues of genetically stock-identified salmon. We also collated large-scale climate indices (e.g., Pacific Decadal Oscillation, North Pacific Gyre Oscillation), local climate variables (e.g., sea surface temperature) and copepod community composition across these years. We used a Bayesian network to determine how ocean conditions influenced feeding ecology, and subsequent survival rates. We found that smolt survival of Chinook Salmon is predicted by their C-13 value, but not their N-15. In turn, large-scale climate variability determined the C-13 values of salmon, thus linking climate to survival through feeding ecology, likely through qualities propagated from the base of the food chain.

AB  - A methodological framework for hydromorphological assessment, analysis and monitoring (named IDRAIM) has been developed with the specific aim of supporting the management of river processes by integrating the objectives of ecological quality and flood risk mitigation. The framework builds on existing and up-to-date geomorphological concepts and approaches and has been tested on several Italian streams.
   The framework includes the following four phases: (1) catchment-wide characterization of the fluvial system; (2) evolutionary trajectory reconstruction and assessment of current river conditions; (3) description of future trends of channel evolution; and (4) identification of management options.
   The framework provides specific consideration of the temporal context, in terms of reconstructing the trajectory of past channel evolution as a basis for interpreting present river conditions and future trends. A series of specific tools has been developed for the assessment of river conditions, in terms of morphological quality and channel dynamics. These include: the Morphological Quality Index (MQI), the Morphological Dynamics Index (MDI), the Event Dynamics Classification (EDC), and the river morphodynamic corridors (MC and EMC).
   The monitoring of morphological parameters and indicators, alongside the assessment of future scenarios of channel evolution provides knowledge for the identification, planning and prioritization of actions for enhancing morphological quality and risk mitigation.

AB  - The Araguas experimental catchment has been monitored to study badland dynamics in the Central Pyrenees. Previous studies of weathering processes within the catchment reported strong regolith dynamics associated with seasonal variations in the temperature and moisture regimes. A preliminary analysis of hydrological response and suspended sediment transport data recorded at a gauging station also demonstrated seasonal trends. The main objective of the present study is to understand the effect of regolith dynamics on sediment detachment and infiltration processes, based on field studies using simulated rainfall. The experiment design was based on seasonal differences in the physical conditions of surface regolith and the general trends of hydro-sedimentological responses. Rainfall simulations were conducted on small plots using a pressure nozzle. Similar experimental rainfall conditions were set for all plots (rainfall intensity around 45 mm h(-1)).
   The results showed strong variations in the infiltration and detachment responses closely associated with the regolith conditions and crusting development. Infiltration showed seasonal differences in time lag and intensity: average infiltration rates ranged from very low (2,05 mm h(-1)) to moderated high values (44.04 mm h(-1)) associated to regolith development conditions. Maximum sediment concentration, as an indicator of particles produced by detachment, also ranged from moderate (3 g l(-1)) to extreme values (145 g l(-1)). Mean and minimum infiltration rates showed negative correlations with initial moisture content. Sediment concentration showed a positive correlation with time lag, ponding, and sealing time, and a negative correlation with initial moisture. In terms of seasonal trends, infiltration and erosion responses were relatively stable during spring and autumn, whereas wide variations were recorded in infiltration rates and sediment detachment during summer and winter. As a general conclusion, the obtained results indicate that seasonal differences in detachment and infiltration depend on the nature of regolith development.

AB  - It remains unclear whether environmental conditions, including bicycle lane provision, are factors in dock-less bicycle uptake at the decision point. In conditions of generous bicycle supply and the ability to park a bicycle almost anywhere, it is important to know what local conditions might be influential in its use. The present study considered the role of 13 environmental factors in uptake and deposit rates by street segment, in a sample from a database of more than 3 m records over a ten-day period in May 2017, in Beijing, China. Street segments, defined by intersections, were coded for environmental factors using satellite and street view imagery. Uptake and especially deposit rates vary greatly by street segment and by local area. Linear regression reveals that 6 factors are highly significant in higher uptake and deposit ? the presence of a dedicated bicycle pathway, street lighting, sidewalks, bicycle parking lots, POI density, and street segment length ? while 3 were highly significant in lower uptake rates ? interruptions in bicycle lane continuity, distance to the metro station, and elaborate environmental design. Altogether, environmental factors account for 42.4% of the variance in local bicycle trip origins and 38.7% of variance in destinations on street segments. This research contributes new understanding of the important role of local environmental factors in higher bicycle mode share in the context of a dock-less rental bicycle system.

AB  - The development and implementation of 4th generation advanced heating and cooling nodes is needed in the face of growing, and more and more differential thermal comfort needs. The paper introduces a unique novel structure of hybrid heating and cooling node designed, constructed and already operated under moderate climate conditions of Poland. The substation integrates centralized district heat rate with locally produced useful heat gain from solar thermal collectors. The system driven both by heat and electricity delivers central heating, domestic hot water, cooling power, and low-temperature waste heat. This manuscript describes the simulation model, preliminary validation results, proposes a method for smart control of the node with a flexibly chosen optimization criterion and shows its impact. Creation of the control procedure satisfying economic or environmental savings objective functions is presented and discussed. The procedure was built upon assumed economic data and boundary conditions. Its potential is verified by means of simulation on validated component models. Depending on function-defined thermal comfort needs, current surrounding conditions and chosen optimization criterion, implementing the procedure may contribute to savings of variable scale if compared to a reference case. Preliminary simulation results revealed that in average, the by applying the economic optimization criterion, the cumulative operational costs become 1/3 of the reference case. At the same time, if the environmental optimization criterion is considered, the cumulative harmful substances emission indicator can be decreased less significantly: by 0.6%.

AB  - The present study estimates the potential costs of land degradation (LD) in agriculture at the national scale in Italy during 2000-2006 and provides a medium-term scenario for 2015 based on changes in climate conditions and human pressure. According to the user cost approach, a depletion factor (S) to agricultural income has been derived from the observed changes in a composite index of land sensitivity to degradation. Based on S figures, the investigated area has been classified into five risk categories from 'negligible' to 'high'. Surface land classified as 'high LD risk' increased slightly from 1.1 per cent in 2000 to 4.4 per cent in 2006 ranging from 2.9 to 8.6 per cent in 2015. Eleven indicators have been used to identify the socioeconomic conditions which possibly discriminate districts in 'high' and 'low' LD risk in agriculture. The gap in LD risk observed in 2000 between developed and disadvantaged regions in Italy reduced significantly in 2006. This suggests that agriculture is sensitive to LD in both economically marginal and affluent areas where climate and soil conditions are turning towards the worse. These results support strategies improving sustainable agriculture-environment relationships and protecting the soil resource base at the local scale. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The response of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to sudden vs. gradual changes in different environmental stress conditions during both respiratory growth and aerobic fermentative growth in the presence of excess glucose was investigated by monitoring the level and rate of expression of the stress response protein Hsp12p using the fluorescent fusion construct Hsp12p-Gfp2p. The initial expression level and the rate of Hsp12p synthesis was significantly greater under glucose-limited conditions in the chemostat (D < 0.14 h(-1)) compared with when excess glucose was present in the auxostat. Decreasing the dilution rate and the glucose concentration further in the A-stat resulted in increased Hsp12p expression, which was more marked when a rapid rather than a gradual change was affected. Common stress factors such as NaCl, ethanol and elevated temperature caused stress responses in both D-stat and auxo-accelerostat culture. The magnitude of the stress response depended on the stress factor, cultivation conditions as well as the rate of change of the stress factor. The rate of Hsp12p synthesis increased due to all applied stresses, with the observed increase between 2 and 20 times lower when the stress was applied gradually rather than rapidly. The results suggested that the Hsp12p expression rate is a good indicator of applied stress in S. cerevisiae.

AB  - Many studies have shown that housing mice individually over a long period significantly alters their physiology, but in most cases measurement has required human interference and restraint for sampling. Using a radio-telemetry system with implantable transmitters, we recorded heart rate (HR), motor activity (ACT) and body temperature (BT) of freely moving male mice (NMRI) housed either individually or in pairs with an ovarectomized female. Data for each parameter were collected at 5 min intervals for two consecutive 24 h periods. Even after several weeks of habituation to the social conditions, HR was increased in mice housed individually compared with mice housed in pairs, although their measured ACT did not differ. Additionally, BT tended to be reduced in individually-housed mice. When the data were analysed according to different ACT levels, HR was increased in individually-housed mice during phases of low and high, but not intermediate, motor activity. Furthermore, individually-housed mice had more, but shorter, resting bouts, indicating disruption of the normal circadian sleep pattern. Enhanced HR in individually-housed mice does not necessarily indicate stress, but might be an important physiological indicator of discomfort. The fact that individual housing alters basic physiological parameters in laboratory mice highlights the need to control for housing-dependent variation, especially in experiments that are sensitive to changes in these parameters.

AB  - The evolution of selfing from outcrossing is characterized by a series of morphological changes to flowers culminating in the selfing syndrome. However, which morphological traits initiate increased self-pollination and which are accumulated after self-fertilization establishes is poorly understood. Because the expression of floral traits may depend on the conditions experienced by an individual during flower development, investigation of changes in mating system should also account for environmental and developmental factors. Here, early stages in the evolution of self-pollination are investigated by comparing floral traits among Brazilian populations of Eichhornia paniculata (Pontederiaceae), an annual aquatic that displays variation in selfing rates associated with the breakdown of tristyly to semi-homostyly.
   Thirty-one Brazilian populations under uniform glasshouse conditions were compared to investigate genetic and environmental influences on flower size and stigma-anther separation (herkogamy), two traits that commonly vary in association with transitions to selfing. Within-plant variation in herkogamy was also examined and plants grown under contrasting environmental conditions were compared to examine to what extent this trait exhibits phenotypic plasticity.
   In E. paniculata a reduction in herkogamy is the principal modification initiating the evolution of selfing. Significantly, reduced herkogamy was restricted to the mid-styled morph and occurred independently of flower size. Significant genetic variation for herkogamy was detected among populations and families, including genotypes exhibiting developmental instability of stamen position with bimodal distributions of herkogamy values. Cloned genets exposed to contrasting growth conditions demonstrated environmental control of herkogamy and genotypic differences in plasticity of this trait.
   The ability to modify herkogamy independently of other floral traits, genetic variation in the environmental sensitivity of herkogamy, and the production of modified and unmodified flowers within some individuals, reveal the potential for dynamic control of the mating system in a species that commonly confronts heterogeneous aquatic environments.

AB  - juvenile Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii peelii). trout cod (Maccullochella macquariensis). and Macquarie perch (Macquaria australasica) (family Percichthyidae) are reared in fertilised earthen ponds to produce fingerlings for aquaculture and stock enhancement purposes to support recreational fisheries and conservation efforts in South eastern Australia. A total of 102 pond stocking trials were conducted over 13 production seasons to quantify growth, survival, condition and yield of juvenile percichthyids and to explore interactions between these variables and a range of biotic and abiotic factors. Water chemistry and zooplankton within ponds fluctuated widely from I week to the next and varied considerably between ponds. Zooplankton was composed of rotifers, cladocerans (mainly Moina and Daphnia), calanoids and cyclopoids. Fish Length-weight. length-age and weight-age relationships are described. Specific growth rates (SGRs) were negatively correlated with both size-at-stocking and stocking biomass for all species. SGRs and fish condition were highest in the weeks immediately following stocking, but declined in latter weeks. Survival rates were variable (0.2 99%). but generally increased and became less variable over the 13 seasons. Increasing stocking density reduced the growth and condition of fish. but did not affect survival. Significant correlations were detected between various fish production indicators (growth, survival and yield) and several water chemistry and biota parameters (prey abundance), but none were consistent for all three species of fish. Some water chemistry parameters reached levels that may have stressed fish and reduced growth and Survival. Declines in growth and condition at higher densities, and in latter weeks following stocking, were attributed to a reduction in the availability of preferred prey due to overgrazing by fish. The influence of percichthyid fish on plankton communities in nursery ponds depends largely on fish biomass and size-selective predation. This Study has contributed significantly to the knowledge of nursery pond ecosystems. and led to improved pond management and increased reliability of the production of fingerling percichthyids in Australia.

AB  - Down-core sediment pigment concentrations from four Northern European estuaries were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to investigate phytoplankton community structure and preservation conditions over the last ca. 100 years where all sites have experienced different levels of eutrophication. Phytoplankton pigments have been shown to be useful biomarkers for phytoplankton community structure and abundance due to their taxonomic specificity. The pigment concentrations and sediment pigment inventory showed large variation between the four sites. Concentrations ranged from more than 6000 nmol/g OC to less than 100 nmol/g OC and the inventory integrated over the top 10 cm from more than 300 nmol/cm(2) to less than 30 nmol/cm(2) for total identified pigments. Good pigment preservation in Mariager Fjord (Denmark) reflected the almost permanently anoxic conditions. Pigments in Laajalahti (Finland) showed peak concentrations around the time of highest nitrogen loading events known from historical and modelled records over the past 100 years. In contrast, poor downcore preservation of pigments (especially carotenoids) was observed in the Ems-Dollard (The Netherlands) and Himmerfjarden (Sweden) estuaries. The Ems-Dollard site is an intertidal mudflat that experiences daily exposure to light and air, which enhances pigment degradation. In Himmerfjarden, resuspension is an important process affecting both the sedimentation rate and degradation properties. The different preservation conditions at the four sites were supported by the differences in two degradation indicators; the ratio of pheopigment-a to chlorophyll-a and total carotenoids to total pigments. Class-specific carotenoid pigments represented the dominant algal groups reported from each site, however, no distinct down-core changes in the pigment composition were observed at any of the four sites. This indicated that changes in plankton community structure on the group level have been limited over this time period or masked by low preservation of pigments. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the Russian Federation logging operations are traditionally carried out in winter. This is due to the predominance of areas with swamped and water-logged (class III and IV) soils in the forest fund, where work of forestry equipment is difficult, and sometimes impossible in the warm season. The work of logging companies in the forests of the cryolithozone, characterized by a sharply continental climate, with severe frosts in winter, is hampered by the fact that forest machines are not recommended to operate at temperatures below -40 degrees C due to the high probability of breaking of metal structures and hydraulic system. At the same time, in the warm season, most of the cutting areas on cryosolic soils become difficult to pass for heavy forest machines. It turns out that the convenient period for logging in the forests of the molithozone is quite small. This results in the need of work in the so-called off-season period, when the air temperature becomes positive, and the thawing processes of the soil top layer begin. The same applies to the logging companies not operating in the conditions of cryosolic soils, for instance, in the Leningrad, Novgorod, Pskov, Vologda regions, etc. The observed climate warming has led to a significant reduction in the sustained period of winter logging. Frequent temperature transitions around 0 degrees C in winter, autumn and spring necessitate to work during the off-season too, while cutting areas thaw. In bad seasonal and climatic conditions, which primarily include off-season periods in general and permafrost in particular, it is very difficult to take into account in mathematical models features of soil freezing and thawing and their effect on the destruction nature. The article shows that the development of long-term predictive models of indicators of cyclic interaction between the skidding system and forest soil in adverse climatic conditions of off-season logging operations in order to improve their reliability requires rapid adjustment of the calculated parameters based on the actual experimental data at a given step of the cycles.

AB  - The non-marine Fushun Basin in NE China is a fault-controlled basin filled with Eocene sediments. It hosts the largest opencast coal and oil shale mine in Asia. A single thick oil shale layer overlying subbituminous coal occurs within the Middle Eocene Jijuntun Formation. Based on mineralogy, inorganic and organic geochemistry, organic petrography, stable isotope geochemistry, and vitrinite reflectance measurements, the depositional environment and the oil shale potential of the oil shale-bearing succession were investigated. The Jijuntun Formation is subdivided into a lower and an upper unit characterized by a low and high quality oil shale, respectively. The thick oil shale layer of the Jijuntun Formation developed under long-lasting stable conditions in a deep freshwater lake, after drowning of a swamp. The organic matter in the lower unit is characterized by landplant-derived macerals. The sediments containing a type II kerogen (HI: similar to 400 mgHC/gTOC) were deposited during warm and humid conditions. Lacustrine organisms predominant in the upper unit are forming kerogen type I (HI: similar to 700 mgHC/gTOC). High bioproductivity and excellent preservation conditions resulted in high TOC contents up to 23.6 wt.% in the upper unit. The organic matter preservation was controlled by photic zone anoxia originating in a temperature stratified water column in the deep lake, without significant changes in bottom water salinity. Mid-Eocene cooling during deposition of the upper unit of the Jijuntun Formation is reflected by clay mineral composition. A hot and arid climate favoring brackish conditions in a shallow lake prevailed during accumulation of the overlying carbonate-rich Xilutian Formation. Individual geochemical parameters in the Fushun Basin have to be used with caution, e.g. the maturity proxy T-max, is affected by kerogen type, the redox proxy Pr/Ph ratio is probably biased by different sources of isoprenoids. This demonstrates the importance of multi-proxy studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Vegetation and soil indicators of nutrient condition were evaluated in 30 wetlands, 10 each in 3 Nutrient Ecoregions (NE) (VI-Corn Belt and Northern Great Plains, VII-Mostly Glaciated Dairy Region, IX-Temperate Forested Plains and Hills) of the Midwestern United States (U.S.) to identify robust indicators for assessment of wetland nutrient enrichment and eutrophication. Nutrient condition was characterized by surface water inorganic N (NH4-N, NO3-N) and P (PO4-P) concentrations measured seasonally for I year, plant available and total soil N and P, and aboveground biomass, leaf N and P and species composition of emergent vegetation measured at the end of the growing season. Aboveground biomass, nutrient uptake and species composition were positively related to surface water NH4-N (N) but not to PO4-P or NO3-N. Aboveground biomass and biomass of aggressive species, Typha spp. plus Phalaris arundinacea, increased asymptotically with surface water N whereas leaf P, senesced leaf N and senesced leaf P increased linearly with N. And, species richness declined with surface water N. Soil total P was positively related to surface water PO4-P but it was the only soil indicator related to wetland nutrient condition. Individual regressions for each NE generally were superior to a single regression for all NEs. In NE VI (Corn Belt), few indicators were related to surface water N because of the high degree of anthropogenic disturbance (85% of the landscape is cleared) as compared to NEs VII and IX (24-53% cleared). Of the indicators evaluated, stem height (r(2) = 0.42 for all NEs, r(2) = 0.56 for NE VII + IX) and percent biomass of aggressive species, Typha spp. plus Phalaris, (r(2) = 0.46 for all NEs, r(2) = 0.54 for NE VII + IX), were the best predictors of wetland nutrient enrichment. Vegetation-based indicators are a promising tool for assessment of wetland nutrient condition but they may not be effective in NEs where landscape disturbance is intense and widespread.

AB  - Although root plaques and associated oxidized root channels are used for wetland identification as field indicators of wetland hydrology, little information is available concerning their reliability as related to the environmental and biotic factors controlling their formation. Therefore, this review describes and evaluates the current state of knowledge of the factors controlling the formation of iron plaques and recommends research to address information gaps.
   Both abiotic and biotic factors control the presence and degree of iron plaque formation. The most important abiotic factor is the availability of soil iron. However, the effect of site variation in soil physico-chemical characteristics (e.g., texture, organic matter, pH, Eh, and soil fertility) on iron availability and microbial activity can influence the formation and persistence of root plaques and oxidized root channels. Although the oxidizing capacity of the plant root is the most important biotic factor controlling plaque formation, only a limited number of wetland species have been evaluated for this ability, so species-specific differences are generally unknown.
   Unlike some of the other hydrologic indicators used in wetland delineation (e.g., water marks on trees or sediment deposits) root plaques and oxidized root channels indicate soil saturation for a sufficient period to produce anaerobic soil conditions. Additionally, when found in conjunction with a living root, oxidized root channels indicate that the anaerobic conditions occurred within the life span of the plant root. Therefore, the presence of oxidized root channels and iron plaque surrounding living roots is a relatively good indicator of current wetland hydrologic conditions. However, research is needed to elucidate the relative abilities of different plant species to produce oxidized root channels, the temporal persistence of the root iron plaque and the role that soil physico-chemical condition plays in controlling plaque formation. Without a better understanding of the controls on iron plaque formation and disappearance, the absence of oxidized root channels, in itself, should not be used to indicate the absence of a wetland.

AB  - We analyzed what are the best ecological conditions for megafauna associated with the bamboo coral Isidella elongate based on the geomorphological, physical and trophic information taken in 3 stations (St1, St2, St3) off the southern Catalonian coasts at 620 m depth in June 2011. Results were compared with assemblage compositions recorded in past cruises (May 1992, 1994) at the same 3 stations. St1 was in a fishing ground exploited since the 1940s over a relatively wide slope at ca. 22 km from the nearest canyon head; St2 and St3 were on a narrower slope closer to canyon heads and to the Ebro river mouth than SO. I. elongate had formed (to May 1994, at least) a dense coral forest at St2-St3 (to ca. 255 colonies/ha at St3), and some isolated colonies (to ca. 0.9 colonies/ha) were still collected in 2011. Fish and invertebrate communities significantly differed between St1 and St2/St3, with two macrourid fishes (Trachrhynchus trachyrhynchus and Nezumia aequalis) and two decapods (Plesionika mania and Plesionika acanthonotus) more abundant at St2/St3. The following ecological indicators imply better food conditions for megafauna at St2-St3 and for I. elongate itself: (i) greater density of zooplankton (copepods, euphausiids, and others) as potential prey for planktivores (including I. elongate); (ii) greater biomass and mean weight of epifaunal and infaunal deposit feeders; (iii) higher feeding intensity, F, at St3 for benthos feeders (Phycis blennoides, N. aequalis and Aristeus antennatus). Also, at St2-St3 we found higher near-bottom turbidity (indicating particle resuspension: food for suspension feeders) and finer and more reduced (E-h) sediments. The results let us suggest that corals and accompanying fauna preferently found optimal ecological conditions in the same habitat, while habitat-forming capacity by L elongate seemed weak to generate these conditions. Coral forests may enhance detritus accumulations around them, improving habitat conditions for benthos feeders (e.g. macrourid fish). At St3 our side-scan sonar recorded three types of tracks produced by trawler doors, which match with three identified vessels occasionally operating in the area. After this low fishing activity off the Ebro Delta since the mid-1990s, almost all colonies of I. elongate has been removed. However, this impact has hardly altered fish and invertebrate composition without any significant loss of diversity, pointing also toward a rather low capacity of I. elongate facies in forming habitat for megafauna on muddy bottoms of the Mediterranean slope.

AB  - The water quality range for wastewater treatment projects in the food processing industry changes constantly. To fully understand the threshold for pollutant removal with the lowest possible energy consumption, the relationship between pollutant removal and wastewater treatment conditions was established using response surface methodology (RSM). The optimum conditions for total COD, TN, and NH3-N removal from saline mustard tuber wastewater (MTWW) with a packed cage rotating biological contactor (RBC) system were investigated by experiments based on a Box-Behnken design (BBD). The independent variables were organic load (ORL), rotational disk velocity (RDV), and immersion rate (IR). Parameters of COD, TN, and NH3-N removal efficiency were selected as responses. The optimal conditions for the best COD, TN, and NH3-N removal efficiency with the lowest energy consumption were found to be at an ORL of 26.71 kg/day, a RDV of 1.62 rpm (7.62 m/s), and an IR of 46%. After the optimization, the energy cost was evaluated by coupling energy performance indicators with organic pollution efficiencies to be the highest class of performance. This research demonstrates that the suggested models have a good predicting and fitting ability in interrelations between the pollutant removal and process parameters of the packed cage RBC system treating saline MTWW.

AB  - With the improvement of digitalization and automation level of the thermodynamic systems, the stable and accurate data resources are indispensable for improving efficiency and reducing energy consumption to characterize the operation state of energy systems. Data reconciliation technology helps to improve the raw data quality by establishing the constraint equations and objective functions, which can decrease measurement uncertainty and identify gross errors to accurately estimate performance and economic indicators of thermodynamic systems. In this paper, a novel data reconciliation model considering the relative residual and variable correlation is proposed to weaken the influence of operating conditions and measurement uncertainty in the thermodynamic system on the performance evaluation parameters. Moreover, different objective functions are designed and compared to quantify the evaluation results. The effectiveness of the model is verified by natural gas compressor, which is a typical thermodynamic system. In the simulation experiments, the measurement data under different operating conditions are constructed by adding the Gaussian white noise to simulation data, and the reconciled results of three objective functions and three correlation functions are further analyzed and compared. The results indicate that the proposed model has higher accuracy and stability. In the application for field data, the accuracy of performance evaluation based on the reconciled parameters is higher than that of directly calculation by the raw data or other reconciliation models.

AB  - The synmetamorphic nappe system of the Rhodope Metamorphic Complex has been deformed into dome-and-basin structures attributed to syn- to post-convergent exhumation. We document the deformation style and present new thermobarometric and geochronological constraints for the Kesebir-Kardamos dome in southern Bulgaria and northern Greece. The dome consists of a migmatitic core overlain by high-grade thrust sheets. Kinematic indicators indicate a continuum from ductile to brittle conditions during exhumation. Thermodynamic modeling applied to the high-grade, intermediate thrust sheets yielded peak conditions of 1.2 GPa and ca 730 A degrees C. New U-Pb SHRIMP-II dating of zircons from rocks of the same unit revealed Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous (145 Ma) as the time of metamorphic crystallization; some zircon rims yielded Eocene ages (53 and 44 Ma) interpreted as having been thermally reset owing to coeval granitoid magmatism. The high-grade rocks were covered by Lutetian-Priabonian marine sediments after exhumation. Slumps suggest that sedimentation took place in a tectonically active environment. Our new structural, petrological and geochronological results suggest that the major shear zone in the core of the Kesebir-Kardamos dome is equivalent to the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous Nestos Shear Zone. Post-Jurassic metamorphic ages recorded in the Rhodope most likely represent crustal rather than deep subduction geodynamic processes.

AB  - The hybrid localization using Angle Of Am (AOA) and Differential Received Strength Signal Indicator (DRSSI) of an RF source with unknown power and Non Line-of-Sight (NLOS) condition has been proven to be advantageous compared to using each method separately. In this paper, the initial hybrid method, which was implemented using particle filters due to the multi-modal/non-Gaussian nature of localization in NLOS condition, has been replaced by a multi -step Gaussian filtering approach which provides similar accuracy with better performance. This has been done using DRSSI input in the first step of the filtering to determine the linearization point, and then using AOA and DRSSI inputs together in the second step of the filtering to improve the localization accuracy. The proposed method has been implemented using Extended Kalman filter and Unscented Kalman filter. The simulation results show that the accuracy of the multi -step Gaussian filleting is comparable to the particle filleting approach with much lower computational load that is important for online localization of several RF sources. Furthermore, the effects of uncertainty on the propagation parameters have been studied to show that the robustness of the multi -step Gaussian filtering to the uncertainties is comparable to the particle filter approach.

AB  - Shale gas (SG) wells in the Wufeng-Longmaxi Formation in northern Guizhou differ considerably in their production capacities. Preservation conditions are a crucial factor affecting the formation of SG reservoirs. In this study, the formation water (FW) in four wells in northern Guizhou was analyzed to determine the type; the Cl/Mg, Ca/Mg, and Na/CI coefficients (C-Cl/Mg, C-Ca/Mg, and C-Na/Cl, respectively), and the coefficient of desulfurization (Cd); the SG in these wells was tested to identify its composition and the sources of its components. The results show the following: wells TX1 and CYI contain two types (CaCl2 and NaHCO3) of FW, each with low C-Na/Cl, low C-d, high C-Ca/Mg, and high Caimg, suggesting a high level of FW retention. The FW in wells TM1 and CD1 is of NaHCO3 type and is characterized by high C-Na/Cl, high C-d, low C-Ca/Mg, and low C-Cl/Mg, indicating a high level of connectivity between the FW and surface water. Nonhydrocarbon gases account for a high proportion of SG in composition; with a L'N value between -8.7 and -4.2 parts per thousand, N-2 accounts for approximately 20% of SG in wells TX1 and CYI, respectively. This result indicates the ammonification of organic matter (OM) during pyrolysis and hydrocarbon generation as sources of N-2. In contrast, with a N-15 value between -3.6 and 0 parts per thousand, N-2 accounts for over 70% of SG in wells TM1 and CD1, respectively, indicating the atmosphere, the ammonification of OM, and the presence of poor preservation conditions due to a high level of connectivity between the shale bed and the atmosphere acted as the sources of N-2. The metamorphism coefficients of FW in conjunction with the SG composition and the sources of nonhydrocarbon gases can serve as auxiliary indicators of the quality of SG preservation conditions.

AB  - This study was developed in order to delineate a possible geographical distribution of teosinte in Mexico, based on climatic and topographic variables. Geographic location from 259 accessions made between the 1960's and the 1990's in Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua representing eight teosinte taxa, were used to identify and characterize altitudinal and climatic conditions where teosinte grows. These environmental indicators were used to delimit potential areas for five taxa on digital climatic images worked in the GIS IDRISI. Results showed that race Balsas (Zea mays subsp. parviglumis) is mainly distributed in the subhumid tropics with an altitude between 420 and 1920 masl, annual precipitation between 813 to 1758 mm, and annual temperature from 18 to 28 degreesC. Race Chalco (Zea mays subsp. mexicana) is found in the highlands (2000 to 2600 mast) in temperate to subtropical environments, with annual precipitation and temperature ranking from 557 to 965 min and 11 to 18 degreesC, respectively. Race Central Plateau (Zea mays subsp. mexicana) prefers subtropical conditions With altitudes between 1530 and 2320 masl, annual precipitation and temperature of 491 to 979 mm and IS to 24 degreesC, respectively. Race Huehuetenango (Zea mays subsp. buehuetenangenesis) develops in tropical environments at altitudes from 920 to 1650 masl, annual thermal range < 10 degreesC, and annual mean temperature and precipitation of 18 to 25 degreesC and 940 to 2159 min, respectively. Zea luxurians also develops in tropical conditions with low thermal range (< 10 degreesC, but in warmer (21-29 degreesC, annual), more humid (1756-2108 mm, annual) and lower altitudes (9 to 1200 masl). Zea diploperennis, Zea perennis and Nobogame (Zea mays subsp. mexicana) are adapted to Subtropical conditions and mid elevations with annual precipitation ranges of 1018-1513, 879-905 and 1017-1021 mm, respectively, and annual mean temperature Of 18-21. 17-19 and 14 degreesC. Maps Of potential geographical distribution of teosinte showed that environmental requirements of Zea mays ssp. parviglumis, Z. mays ssp. mexicana, Z. Mays ssp. bubuetenangenesis luxurians and Z, diploperennis are met in 18, 15, 5, 3 and 4 states of Mexico, respectively.

AB  - Remote sensing of vegetation has largely been revolving around the measurement of passive or active electromagnetic radiation of the top of the canopy. Nevertheless, plants hold a vertical structure and different processes and intensities take place within a plant organism depending on the environmental conditions. One of the main inputs for photosynthesis is photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) and a few studies have taken into account the effect of the qualitative and quantitative changes of the available PAR within the plants canopies. Mostly large plants (trees, shrubs) are affected by this phenomena, while signs of it could be observed in dense monocultures, too. Lake Balaton is a large lake with 12 km(2) dense reed stands, some of which have been suffering from reed die-back; consequently, the reed density and stress condition exhibit a vertical PAR variability within the canopy due to the structure and condition of the plants but also a horizontal variability attributed to the reedbed's heterogeneous density. In this study we investigate the expression of photosynthetic and spectroscopic parameters in different PAR conditions. We concentrate on chlorophyll fluorescence as this is an early-stage indicator of stress manifestation in plants. We first investigate how these parameters differ across leaf samples which are exposed to a higher degree of PAR variability due to their vertical position in the reed culm (sun and shade leaves). In the second part, we concentrate on how the same parameters exhibit in reed patches of different densities. We then look into hyperspectral regions through graphs of coefficient of determination and associate the former with the physiological parameters. We report on the large variability found from measurements taken at different parts of the canopy and the association with spectral regions in the visible and near-infrared domain. We find that at low irradiance plants increase their acclimation to low light conditions. Plant density at Phragmites stands affects the vertical light attenuation and consequently the photophysiological response of basal leaves. Moreover, the hyperspectral response from the sun and shade leaves has been found to differ; charts of the coefficient of determination indicate that the spectral region around the red-edge inflection point for each case of sun and shade leaves correlate strongly with ETRmax and alpha. When analysing the data cumulatively, independent of their vertical position within the stand, we found correlations of R-2 = 0.65 (band combination 696 and 651) and R-2 = 0.61 (band combination 636 and 642) for the ETRmax and alpha, respectively.

AB  - Little is known about the abiotic factors contributing to the preharvest persistence of Salmonella in tomato tissues. Therefore, we investigated the effects of specific environmental conditions and contamination methods on the persistence and dissemination of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype Typhimurium (JSG626) in tomato plants. When plants were sprayed on the leaves with a JSG626-contaminated solution, JSG626 persistence in the phyllosphere (bacteria located on the surface of the inoculated foliage and stem tissues) was lower at higher temperatures (30 degrees C day/25 degrees C night) than at lower temperatures (20 degrees C day/15 degrees C night). However, wounding cotyledons with contaminated tools improved JSG626 persistence and the internalization rate (2.27%) in planta compared to spray inoculation (0.004%). The systemic dissemination of JSG626 to other tissues increased when contaminated plants were grown under low relative humidity (<40%); however, JSG626 was only detected in the root systems at later sampling times (between 21 and 98 days postinoculation [dpi]). Further, after tomato scions were grafted onto rootstocks using contaminated cutting tools, dissemination of JSG626 was preferentially basipetal and occasionally acropetal in the plants, with higher persistence rates and loads of JSG626 in root systems compared to foliar tissues. JSG626 was detected in the grafting point and root systems up to 242 dpi; however, none of the fruits harvested from contaminated plants between 90 and 137 dpi were positive for JSG626. This study demonstrates that environmental temperature and relative humidity could be good indicators for estimating the persistence of Salmonella enterica in tomato plants. Further, root systems may represent a risk for long-term persistence of Salmonella enterica in tomato plants.
   IMPORTANCE Tomatoes are one of the most widely produced vegetables around the world; however, fresh tomatoes have been connected to multiple wide-scale salmonellosis outbreaks over the past decades. Salmonella is commonly found in the environment and can persist in hostile conditions for several weeks before being internalized into plant tissues, where it is protected from conventional sanitation methods. In addition to biotic factors (host, inoculum size, and phytobiome), abiotic factors (environmental conditions) may affect the persistence of Salmonella in crop production. This study demonstrates that specific environmental conditions, the inoculation method, and the inoculum density affect the persistence and dissemination of JSG626 in tomato plant tissues. Our findings enhance the understanding of interactions between Salmonella enterica and fresh produce and may lead to the development of novel management practices on farms.

AB  - The Second Songhua River is the biggest river system in Jilin Province, China. In recent years, the rapid economic development in this area has increased the prominence of water resources and water-related environmental problems; these include surface water pollution and the overexploitation of groundwater resources. Bank infiltration on the floodplains of the Second Songhua River is an important process of groundwater-surface water exchange under exploitation conditions. Understanding this process can help in the development of water resource management plans and strategies for the region. In this research, a multi-criteria evaluation index system was developed with which to evaluate the suitability of bank filtration along the Second Songhua River. The system was comprised of main suitability indexes for water quantity, water quality, the interaction intensity between surface water and groundwater, and the exploitation condition of groundwater resources. The index system was integrated into GIS (Geographic Information System) to complete the evaluation of the various indicators. According to the weighted sum of each index, the suitability of river bank filtration (RBF) in the study area was divided into five grades. Although the evaluation index system and evaluation method are applicable only to the Second Songhua River basin, the underlying principle and techniques it embodies can be applied elsewhere. For future generalization of the evaluation index system, the specific evaluation index and its scoring criteria should be modified appropriately based on local conditions.

AB  - Since direct benefits are likely to be absent in the grasshopper Chorthippus biguttulus, indirect genetic benefits are a potential explanation for costly female preference. Choosy females may improve their fitness in terms of enhanced attractiveness of sons alone or additionally by improved viability of offspring. We tested the predictions of these two hypotheses by comparing attractiveness-related song traits and viability in offspring of attractive and unattractive grasshopper males. The experiment was conducted with larvae reared under semi natural lab conditions in one year and under natural conditions in the field in the following year. If reared under natural conditions no significant differences in viability and song traits between offspring of attractive and unattractive males could be found. Offspring reared in the lab produced calling songs with a significantly more exact song rhythm when sired by attractive males than offspring of unattractive males. Offspring of attractive males should thus have a theoretical advantage in mate choice, which, however, did not translate into higher attractiveness values in acoustic female choice experiments. Therefore our experiments could not resolve whether female choice in C biguttulus evolved according to the sexy son hypothesis. Since viability in offspring of attractive males did not differ from offspring of unattractive males, "good genes" seems unlikely to be the underlying mechanism of female choice.

AB  - Society's increasing awareness of being more sustainable in everyday life has driven public transport operators to focus their attention on minimizing noise emissions in their network. In densely populated areas, operators strive to raise their attractiveness and gain acceptance from both passengers and residents. In particular, rail-bound traffic faces the challenge of multi-body systems, which ideally require a joint track and vehicle design in order to account for all spring-damper subsystems that represent the interaction between a vehicle and its environment. Despite manifold elastic components in the track and vehicle structure, inhomogeneities and unevenness lead to the excitation of vibrations in the tactile and audible range of humans during wheel-rail interaction. The goal of this paper is to use instrumented fleet vehicles in a tram network to produce a map of noise and vibration emissions as recorded onboard. The data gathered can be used to provide operators with up-to-date information concerning the relative rail condition across their network in order to find and compare hotspots, while in the long run, regular surveys can assist degradation monitoring and maintenance planning. Depending on the type of rail damage to be evaluated, different vibro-acoustic features can be used in data analysis. Typical performance indicators include bandpass levels, maximum fast-weighted levels or loudness, which can subsequently be used - together with auxiliary information about the rail network - to train classification algorithms for automatic fault detection.

AB  - Aim. The aim is to study the features of lateral and radial differentiation, as well as biological absorption of Mn, Zn, Cu and Mo in landscape-geochemical catena of the Lower Dniester valley. Methods. Sampling and sample preparation were carried out in accordance with generally accepted methods. Determination of the metal content in soils, soil extracts (acetate-ammonium buffer with pH = 4.8) and plants was carried out in accredited laboratories using atomic absorption spectrometry. Results. The differentiation of the total and mobile forms of the four indicator elements (Mn, Zn, Cu and Mo) in soils and plants in conditions of the steppe region of the lower Dniester valley was studied for the first time. Their lateral and radial differentiation in soils and the variability of the content and intensity of biological absorption by plants in different landscape-geochemical conditions are shown. Conclusions. It was found that preferentially, Mn weakly differentiates in soils on different relief elements, and Zn and Mo accumulate mainly in subordinate landscapes. For these three metals, the poor differentiation of the content in plants growing in different landscape-geochemical conditions is more typical, although the biological absorption of Zn appreciably increases in subordinate landscapes. Cu weakly migrates in the landscape and the content of its mobile forms is often higher in soils on terraces and watersheds and therefore its biological absorption is more active on slopes and in relief depressions.

AB  - This work studied the loading capabilities and release behavior of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) multilayer films, using methylene blue dye (MB) as an indicator. PAA/PAH multilayers assembled at pH = 2.5/2.5 loaded MB throughout the multilayers due to available binding sites and a permeable structure. The amount of MB loaded increased linearly with increasing film thickness. Use of buffered MB solutions enabled faster and more uniform MB loading into the multilayers, because ions within the MB solution caused further swelling of the multilayer film. Release studies demonstrated a pH-sensitive release mechanism, where lower pH environments increased the release rate. Buffered environments also increased the release rate of MB from the multilayer films. By assembling capping layers of PAA/PAH at pH 6.5/6.5 on top of 2.5/2.5 PAA/PAH multilayers, the diffusion of MB through the multilayers was better controlled under nonbuffered conditions. Under buffered conditions, however, the permeability of the 6.5/6.5 PAA/PAH capping layers increased due to swelling, and MB diffusion was not hindered. Further work needs to be done to slow release of MB under buffered conditions. The controlled loading capabilities and pH-sensitive release behavior of weak polyelectrolyte multilayer films demonstrated here may be useful toward drug delivery applications.

AB  - The Early-Middle Miocene succession in the cankiri-corum Basin (ccB) represents a potentially large bituminous shale resource in Turkey. In order to elucidate paleoredox conditions during deposition of the Hancili Formation and to evaluate the role of anoxia in accumulation of the organic-rich shales, a total of 70 samples were collected using channel-profile sampling strategy. Rock Eval pyrolysis data indicates that the majority of the samples have excellent generative potential. Total organic carbon (TOC) content of the Hancili ranges from 0.61 to 13.91 wt% (5.59 wt% on average). Pyrolysis data as well as microscopic and isotopic studies of the samples indicate that the organic matter in the Hancili bituminous shales is immature to early mature, predominantly oil prone (Types I and II), and algal in origin. Moreover, the isotopic (delta(13)Corg) and geochemical studies suggest that the studied samples were deposited in a lacustrine setting which is consistent with the previous sedimentological inferences. Based on average enrichment factors (EF) of redox-sensitive elements, Ni (-2.18), V (-1.58), Cu (-1.47) and Mo (-1.1) are only slightly enriched relative to the average shale, whereas U (-0.76), Pb (-0.71) and Zn (-0.73) are depleted. Such an enrichment pattern for redox sensitive trace elements reflects an environment with an oxic-dysoxic water column. Well-known redox-sensitive geochemical ratios (e.g., V/(V-FNi), Ni/Co) also show small-scale fluctuations in redox conditions during deposition of the Hancili Formation. TOC-S-Fe relationships suggest that the Hancili Formation were deposited under oxic-dysoxic water conditions. However, high TOC and HI along with low 01 values of the samples suggest that the samples have not weathered under oxic-dysoxic regime. To investigate the role of anoxia in accumulation of the Hancili organic-rich shales, TOC content of 41 samples were plotted against the paleoredox ratios. Lack of correlation between the TOC content and redox indicators suggests that the redox conditions were not a controlling factor in accumulation of the organic-rich shales of the Hancili Formation. Other factors such as high sedimentation rate and periodic eutrophication (e.g., algal bloom) may have influenced accumulation of organic matter (OM) and compensated for the lack of preservative anoxic conditions.

AB  - Analysis of Cladocera and organic matter from the sediments of the Rzecino paleolake are presented. These are probably among the first detailed published data from the Eemian Interglacial (MIS 5e) organic matter. The Rzecino paleolake is located in NW Poland in an area covered by the last glaciation. Approximately 5.8 m of sediment was analyzed. Previous palynological data indicate a continuous accumulation from the final phase of the Wartanian to the early Vistulian Glaciation. Data on the Cladocera correlated with the results of the analyses of organic matter, which enabled the reconstruction of varying environmental conditions and geneses of organic matter. In the final phase of the Wartanian and at the beginning of the Eemian Interglacial, low frequencies of Cladocera specimens and species were identified, which suggests unfavorable conditions for the development of zooplankton. Organic matter (OM) was characterized by a small amount of organic carbon and nitrogen, a high value of C/N (18-27) and a delta C-13 of approximately -26 aEuro degrees, which suggests a higher plant source and a predominantly terrestrial origin for OM. An improvement in environmental conditions occurred during the pollen zone E3. The number of Cladocera species and individuals increased. An increase in TOC and TN suggests an enhancement of primary productivity and the development of macrophytes in the lake. A lower C/N ratio indicates a primary role of algae in the production of organic matter. During the Eemian optimum (pollen zones E4-E5), mostly Cladocera species preferring warm water occurred. Algae remained a significant component of OM. The early Eemian post-optimum (pollen zone E6) was characterized as a period of maximal abundance of zooplankton (20 species). During this period, rapid decreases in TOC, TN and the C/N ratio and an increase in delta C-13 values suggest the reduced abundance of higher plants in the lake. In pollen zone E7, the frequency and diversity of Cladocera rapidly decreased. Species that tolerate cold water were dominant, which reflects unfavorable conditions for the development of zooplankton but a high water level. The low content of organic carbon and nitrogen, a C/N ratio in the range of 13-17 and delta C-13 values in the range of -26.2 to -28 aEuro degrees suggest the inhibition of terrestrial plant delivery. During the Early Vistulian (pollen zone EV1), rare faunal remains and the features of OM (the lowest amounts of TOC and TN, and the highest value of C/N) reflect the decline of lake conditions and a lack of primary production and aquatic vegetation in the lake.

AB  - Aim. Assessment of current climate changes in the territory of Ciscaucasia in order to predict the yield of winter wheat.
   Methods. Integral indicators of climatic conditions for agricultural production were employed. For the investigations, we selected five-year periods for which the meteorological parameters were averaged, and to identify trends the data of specific five-year periods were compared with the average value for the entire series of observations (1960-2020).
   Results. The deviation of precipitation in April was highest in 2011-2015, when it increased by 22 mm, and in 1986-1990 and 1991-1995, when it decreased by 15 and 10 mm respectively. In Eastern Ciscaucasia, where conditions are more arid than in the Western and Central regions, in both the rise in air temperature and the amount of precipitation, especially in April and May, increased in the 21st century for the entire period of active vegetation.
   Conclusion. It was established that the value of the hydrothermal coefficient practically did not change during the 1960-2020 period. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was an increase in productivity against the background of a relatively high level of annual precipitation and this stability is confirmed at the present time. There is a very close relationship between natural and climatic factors and the level of winter wheat yield.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyse sustainable forest management in Poland in the years 2009-2015. The concept of sustainable development itself has also been analysed as the starting point for sustainable forest management development. Based on the conducted analysis of statistical data, it was attempted to answer the question about the condition of sustainable forest management in Poland.
   Design/methodology/approach Two basic research methods were used in the presented paper. The first of them was the analysis of existing data. The conducted analysis covered the subject literature, reports and analyses referring to forest management. The second applied research method was the statistical analysis which covered structure analysis and dynamics analysis.
   Findings It can be adopted, within the framework of general conclusions, that the condition of sustainable forest management in Poland is moderately satisfactory, with the reservation of the need to maintain and intensify all processes and projects aimed at the implementation of the broadly approached concept of sustainable development.
   Originality/value The core of the study is focused on the statistical analysis of selected forest management aspects in Poland in the context of the assessment of sustainable forest management condition, with particular emphasis on forest cover, defoliation, forest area, restoration and afforestation, tree planting, wood harvesting, average wood sales price, excluding land from forest production for non-forest purposes. The importance of environmental education was also highlighted.

AB  - Nanosilver (nAg) is a nanoparticle commonly incorporated into consumer products for its antimicrobial properties that has been detected in aquatic environments. Toxic effects of nAg on fish have been observed, and nAg may induce a stress response in fish in the form of increased blood plasma cortisol. Effects of nAg exposure on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were investigated over a 28-d period using blood plasma cortisol concentrations as an indicator of stress. Several morphometric measures (growth, Fulton's condition factor, and hepatosomatic index [HSI]) were also taken during the experiment to investigate potential whole-body effects of exposure, and concentrations of nAg in fish muscle tissue were measured. Fish were exposed to environmentally relevant (average 0.28 mu g/L) and higher (average 47.60 mu g/L) exposure concentrations of nAg. The results showed a significant increase in blood plasma cortisol for both exposure treatments. A significant effect on HSI by treatment dependent on exposure time was also observed, although no obvious trend was detected, whereas other morphometric measures were not affected by nAg exposure. In addition, Ag was detected in fish muscle tissue. The results indicate that although nAg did engage the stress response in fish, it did not affect growth or condition under the experimental conditions and time frame investigated. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB  - The aim of the study was to examine how visual and audio information influences audio-visual environment assessment. Original audio-visual recordings were made at seven different places in the city of Poznan. Participants of the psychophysical experiments were asked to rate, on a numerical standardized scale, the degree of comfort they would feel if they were in such an environment. The assessments of audio-visual comfort were carried out in a laboratory in four different conditions: (a) audio samples only, (b) original audio-visual samples, (c) video samples only, and (d) mixed audio-visual samples. The general results of this experiment showed a significant difference between the investigated conditions, but not for all the investigated samples. There was a significant improvement in comfort assessment when visual information was added (in only three out of 7 cases), when conditions (a) and (b) were compared. On the other hand, the results show that the comfort assessment of audio-visual samples could be changed by manipulating the audio rather than the video part of the audiovisual sample. Finally, it seems, that people could differentiate audio-visual representations of a given place in the environment based rather of on the sound sources' compositions than on the sound level. Object identification is responsible for both landscape and soundscape grouping. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The study of dielectric response is a significant method to characterize the electrical properties of insulating materials and a useful tool for condition assessment of the insulation systems of rotating machines. Time and frequency domain measurements can be used to determine the dielectric response. Polarization and depolarization current measurements are usually used as a time domain measurement while in frequency domain the capacitance and dissipation factor of the samples can be measured over a broad range of frequencies. The dielectric response of machine insulation is affected by variety of parameters such as degree of aging, contamination and the environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity. In this work, time and frequency methods are used to determine the impact of humidity on the dielectric response of different insulation technologies used for stator insulation of large rotating machines. The measurements were conducted on bars and coils in laboratory conditions as a comparison base and then the dielectric response of the samples was monitored in an environmental chamber during two different humidification periods. The samples were selected to cover the most common materials and technologies used in operating rotating machines including asphalt; epoxy and polyester based insulating systems. The results showed considerable change in the dielectric response when the samples were exposed to moisture. Further studies demonstrated that the change in dielectric response is mostly attributable to the end-winding and stress-grading layer.

TI  - Reduction in Body Mass and Blubber Thickness of Harbor Porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) Due to Near-Fasting for 24 Hours in Four Seasons

AB  - When wild harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) are disturbed by (and perhaps flee from) anthropogenic sound, they probably do not forage, and thus they fast for a period of time. The rate of body mass loss during fasting is probably related to internal parameters such as initial body mass and blubber thickness, hormonal and reproductive state, and anxiety and activity levels, as well as to environmental parameters such as water and air temperature. Reduced blubber thickness causes reduced insulation which, in turn, increases heat loss to the environment. If blubber cannot be replenished by eating extra food, porpoises' fitness may decline, which may eventually result in hypothermia and pneumonia To increase understanding of the effects of fasting, the body condition of two captive porpoises was quantified while they were kept under ambient temperature conditions similar to those experienced by wild conspecifics in the North Sea, and while they were near-fasting (i.e., almost fasting) for 24 hours (consuming 3 to 10% of the average daily food intake of their normal ration in each period). Replicated near-fasting periods took place during each of the four seasons of the year, and body mass (an indicator of body condition) declined in all 30 near-fasting periods (15 for each animal). For both porpoises in all seasons, body mass loss represented approximately 4% of initial body mass (of which -0.7% was due to loss of food in the alimentary canal). Blubber thickness was difficult to quantify due to low measurement accuracy in relation to loss, but small decreases in blubber thickness (0 to 3 mm) occurred. A linear mixed-effects model showed that mass loss was greatest overall in autumn, lowest in summer, and intermediate in winter and spring. Harbor porpoises, therefore, appear to be most vulnerable to the effects of fasting due to disturbance in autumn, perhaps because their blubber layer has to increase in autumn to cope with the decreasing water temperature.

AB  - Conventional, sustainable or organic farming practices are assumed to have distinct effects on soil fertility and health. This is often supported by arguments linking management and resulting soil parameters to crop yield and produce quality. Soil microbial communities are sensitive to management practices that alter soil water fluxes and the pools and fluxes of nutrients. These effects might be accentuated in arid or semiarid agriculture. Conversion to vineyard use, under Mediterranean conditions, and the subsequent application of different management types creates the conditions for divergent soil microbial communities. An off-season survey of variably managed vineyards located in a Mediterranean climate showed that both organic and conventional vineyard management had the most distinct impact on soil abiotic parameters, and on the bacterial and fungal communities; both organic and sustainable management enhanced soil organic carbon, water holding capacity and nitrogen availability. The sustainable management led to soil microbial communities most similar to the natural conditions. Fungal diversity was better than bacterial diversity at discriminating between soils under different management types. Classes of the dominant Ascomycota phylum had best discriminating power; Mucoromycota declined significantly after conversion to vineyard use and was a key taxonomic indicator for such conversion. Regarding bacterial communities, a focus on functional categories, e.g. nitrogen-fixing taxa, may be more informative than total diversity assessments.

AB  - Although monitoring and evaluating child poverty has been recognized as important, there is little statistical information focused on children. Because the annual EU-Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) survey does not include child-specific information on an annual basis, this study proposes a measure of child exposure to household material deprivation based on this dataset. The study considers four domains of deprivation that have a direct impact on child development: housing conditions, household financial capacity, household durable goods, and environmental living conditions. Although developing a child-centered measurement of child deprivation is important, the EU-SILC considers the household as the unit of measurement. Therefore, our proposal is household-based, allowing annual monitoring of children's exposure to deprivation-an important insight for social policy purposes to tackle the problem of child poverty. Using the 2017 Portuguese sample, we applied graded response models to assess the psychometric properties of the EU-SILC items and fit separate indexes per domain and the composite index. Item selection was based on their characteristic curves and information functions. The results allow for the selection of more informative items for every domain to obtain the composite index. In general, the empirical analysis confirmed the theoretical approach for item selection. The methodology may be directly applied to the full EU dataset or to each country individually.

AB  - Lithological, petrographic, and geochemical analysis of the Middle to Upper Jurassic succession (i.e. Sargelu and Naokelekan formations) from northernmost Iraq were undertaken with the aim of providing an updated discussion for their sedimentary and diagenetic histories, as well as examining the evaporation proxies and palaeoredox conditions under which these two formations were deposited. Lithologically, the Sargelu Formation comprises massive dolomites, interbedded with shales, rare cherts and one single limestone bed, whilst the Naokelekan Formation consists of shales overlain by limestones and one single dolomite bed. Petrographic analysis of both formations revealed the presence of rare ostracods, bioclastic fragments as well as calcispheres. Five main microfacies were recognized, including bioclastic wackestone, mudstone, dolorudite, dolarenite and dolomicrite microfacies. The shales comprise clay minerals assemblages (illite/muscovite and kaolinite) with some quartz, alkali feldspar and rare pyrite. The Sargelu Formation was probably deposited in a shallow-marine environment. In contrast, the Naokelekan Formation is hypothesized to be deposited in a restricted shallow-lagoon environment. Palaeoredox indicators suggest that both formations were accumulated under anoxic conditions, most probably in silted basins where water circulation was restricted. Tectonic activity thus resulted in basin compartmentalization across the region, which also explains the marked differences which are often observed.

AB  - Bearings are typically used in wind turbines to support shafts and gears that increase rotational speed from a low speed rotor to a higher speed electrical generator. For various bearing applications, condition monitoring using vibration measurements has remained a subject of intense study to the present day since several decades. Various signal processing techniques are used to analyse vibration signals and extract features related to defects. Statistical indicators such as Crest Factor (CF) and Kurtosis (KU) were reported as very sensitive indicators when the presence of the defects is pronounced, whilst their values may come down to the level of undamaged components when the damage is well advanced. Further, these indicators were applied to an acquired data from proposed diagnostic models, test rigs, and instrumentations that were specifically used for particular research tests, and thus, it is essential to undertake further investigations and analysis to assess the influence of other factors such as the structural noise and other operating conditions on the real-world applications. With this in mind, the present work proposes Signal Intensity Estimator (SIE) as a new technique to discriminate individual types of early natural damage in real-world wind turbine bearings. Comparative results between SIE and conventional indicators such as KU and CF are also presented. It was concluded that SIE has an advantage over the other fault indicators if sufficient data are provided.

AB  - Onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTSs) are commonly used to treat domestic wastewater in the Dickinson Bayou watershed, located between Houston and Galveston. The Dickinson Bayou is classified as "impaired" by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality due to high levels of indicator bacterium, Escherichia coli. Failing OWTSs in the watershed are possible sources for the impairment of the bayou. Nearly all of the watershed is at risk to failing OWTSs due to high water table and clay content in the soil. The HYDRUS modeling software for water and solute flow through variably saturated media was used to simulate the performance of (1) conventional OWTSs, (2) aerobic treatment units (ATUs) with spray distribution, and (3) mounded OWTSs under conditions indicative of the Dickinson Bayou watershed. The purpose of the study was to simulate system performance under existing conditions. Simulation results indicated that both the conventional and ATU systems fail due to effluent ponding and E. coli transport to the land surface due to high water tables and clay soils in the watershed. Simulations indicated that conventional and ATU systems failed when rainfall intensity was greater than 0.25 cm/h. However, themodel simulations indicatemound systems did not fail under existing conditions as they did not allow E. coli to reach the surface or ponding to occur. Consequently, mound systems can be considered as better systems in this watershed to minimize bacterial loadings.

AB  - An environmental aging test protocol for evaluation of environmental durability of concrete wrapped with fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites is proposed. The wrap material was made off-glass and aramid woven fabric impregnated in an epoxy resin matrix. The effect of temperature, moisture, pH level, and freezing-and-thawing cycles on the mechanical properties of FRP-wrapped concrete was investigated. Aged FRP concrete hybrid cylinders were tested in compression after 1000, 3000, and 8000 h of environmental exposure. FRP composite coupons were exposed to the same conditions and tested in tension to identify the degradation mechanisms. Hygrothermal swelling of the FRP wrap was observed for the different aging conditions and led to a reduction in concrete confinement The main cause of environmental damage in the hybrid system was the combined effect of moisture and elevated temperature on the tensile strength of the E-glass fibers. Residual hygrothermal strains in the FRP wrap and reduction in tensile strength of the E-glass fibers controlled the changes in the stress-strain response of the concrete-FRP hybrid system due to environmental aging. The following mechanical indicators were proposed to characterize environmental durability of FRP-wrapped concrete: 1) critical stress onset of unstable cracking propagation) of concrete FRP cylinders; 2) retained compressive strength of concrete FRP cylinders; and 3) retained tensile strength of FRP coupons. The rate at which the retained compressive strength varied with time under the influence of the various environmental conditions was studied.

AB  - Five samples from Cretaceous and Jurassic organic-rich shale and coal layers in clastic intervals in the Agur 1 borehole (Negev, southern Israel) were analyzed in order to determine their genetic history, as well as their potential as a source for oil and gas.  Analyses of the samples included elemental composition, various pyrolysis experiments and pyrolysis gas chromatography, organic solvent extraction, open-column liquid chromatographic fractionation, saturate fraction gas chromatography and combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and detailed organic petrography using reflected white and fluorescent light microscopy.
   The results obtained suggest that the Cretaceous sample has a "normal" coaly composition and low maturation in the lignite range whereas the Jurassic samples have unique maceral and geochemical characteristics that reveal evolution through two major stages.  In the first stage, terrestrially derived organic material was accumulated under partially oxidizing conditions forming coaly deposits.  Primarily terrestrial origin and oxidizing conditions are indicated, for example, by the constituent macerals, abundance of reaction rims (mainly on vitrinite and resinite macerals), abundance of alkylbenzenes, ratio of pristane to phytane, and distribution of n-alkane, sterance, and triterpane in the solvent extract of the samples.  However, pulses of faster subsidence have resulted in formation of deeper lagoons.  Consequently, coaly materials from the surrounding highs were eroded, transported, and redeposited within nearby lagoons.  The transportation and redeposition were involved with selective removal of some of the humic substances, progressive bacterial degradation of some plant lipids, and further diagenesis under reducing conditions.  The later modification resulted in enrichment of exinite, mainly bituminite, abundance of fluorescent vitrinite (including particles with reaction rims), and the relatively high hydrogen content indicated by the elemental and RockEval analyses.  These effects are particularly pronounced in the organic-rich shale and less in the coal.  Abundance of microlayering texture in the organic materials suggests that deposition during the later phase took place in shallow water in a low energy environment.
   The later modification under reducing conditions resulted in a relatively high hydrogen content in contrast to what is commonly anticipated for terrestrial materials that were deposited originally in oxidizing conditions.  RockEval pyrolysis S2 indicates that the studied samples have the potential to generate hydrocarbons.  However, vitrinite reflectance, UV-fluorescence, Tmax, and sterane and triterpane isomerization ratios indicate an immature to marginally mature level, suggesting that the samples studied did not reach the major phase of oil generation.  In addition, because of the unique composition of the organic materials, the major products anticipated upon generation are gas, aromatics, and oxygen-rich compounds.

AB  - The investigation of the relationship between paleoenvironmental conditions and distribution and relative abundance of specific saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons was the main objective of this study, thus marking the parameters, which were most sensitive to environmental changes. Insights on the type, generative potential, and maturity of organic matter (OM), as well as paleoclimate conditions, along with the reconstruction of depositional settings of the northwest part of the Toplica basin (Serbia), were provided. Organic petrographic, palynofacies, organic geochemical, mineralogical, and XRF analyses were carried out to investigate 40 sediment samples of the Prebreza and Cucale sedimentary units.
   Investigated samples were deposited in the saline and anoxic environment, under semi-arid to semi-humid/humid climate conditions, along with the constant inflow of volcanoclastic material. The predominance of delta-methyltrimethyltridecil chroman (delta-MTTC) within euxinic portions of the stratified water column was associated with an increase in salinity, which was noticed for sediments of the Prebreza unit. Sediments from this stratigraphic unit showed a higher contribution of algae precursor, whereas sediments of the Cucale unit suggested higher participation of microbiologically reworked OM.
   Most of the samples contained oil-prone kerogen type II. Maturity of the OM for sediments of the Prebreza unit ranged from immature to early-mature, while for samples of the Cucale unit varied from early-mature to mature stages. Distribution of hopane biomarkers typical for crude oil indicated that depth of 1 km was a boundary for the genesis of thermodynamic, more stable compounds.
   A significant portion of semifusinite was correlated with the paleofire event, which affected the distribution of n-alkanes. The high production of hydrocarbons was related to volcanic activity.
   Parameters, which proved to be highly susceptible at the stratigraphic boundary between the Prebreza and Cucale units, were C-value, S/H, alpha-MTTC, delta-MTTC, beta-/gamma-MTTC, and (1,3- + 1,6-)/(1,4 + 1,5-DMC), respectively.

AB  - Micropropagated plants experience significant stress from rapid water loss when they are transferred from an in vitro culture to either greenhouse or field conditions. This is caused both by inefficient stomatal control of transpiration and the change to a higher light intensity and lower humidity. Understanding the physiological, vascular and biomechanical processes that allow micropropagated plants to modify their phenotype in response to environmental conditions can help to improve both field performance and plant survival. To identify changes between the hybrid poplar [Populus tremula x (Populus x canescens)] plants propagated from in vitro tissue culture and those from root cuttings, we assessed leaf performance for any differences in leaf growth, photosynthetic and vascular traits, and also nanomechanical properties of the tracheary element cell walls. The micropropagated plants showed significantly higher values for leaf area, leaf length, leaf width and leaf dry mass. The greater leaf area and leaf size dimensions resulted from the higher transpiration rate recorded for this stock type. Also, the micropropagated plants reached higher values for chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters and for the nanomechanical dissipation energy of tracheary element cell walls which may indicate a higher damping capacity within the primary xylem tissue under abiotic stress conditions. The performance of the plants propagated from root cuttings was superior for instantaneous water-use efficiency which signifies a higher acclimation capacity to stressful conditions during a severe drought particularly for this stock type. Similarities were found among the majority of the examined leaf traits for both vegetative plant origins including leaf mass per area, stomatal conductance, net photosynthetic rate, hydraulic axial conductivity, indicators of leaf midrib vascular architecture, as well as for the majority of cell wall nanomechanical traits. This research revealed that there were no drawbacks in the leaf physiological performance which could be attributed to the micropropagated plants of fast growing hybrid poplar.

AB  - Venous thrombosis, whose main clinical presentations include deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, represents a major health problem worldwide. Numerous conditions are known to predispose to venous thrombosis and these conditions are commonly referred to as risk indicators or risk factors. Generally accepted or "classically" acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism include advanced age, prolonged immobilisation, surgery, fractures, use of oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy, pregnancy, puerperium, cancer and antiphospholipid syndrome. In addition to these well-established risk factors for venous thrombosis, several lines of evidence that have emerged over the past few decades indicate a role of novel genetic risk factors, mainly related to the haemostatic system, in influencing thrombotic risk. The most significant breakthrough has been the confirmation of the concept that inherited hypercoagulable conditions are present in a large proportion of patients with venous thromboembolic disease. These include mutations in the genes that encode antithrombin, protein C and protein S, and the factor V Leiden and factor II G20210 A mutations. Moreover, plasmatic risk indicators, such as hyper-homocysteinemia and elevated concentrations of factors II, VIII, IX, XI and fibrinogen, have also been documented. This extensive list of genetic and acquired factors serves to illustrate that a single cause of venous thrombosis does not exist and that this condition should be considered as a complex or multifactorial trait. Complex traits can be understood by assuming an interaction between different mutations in candidate susceptibility genes. The risk that is associated with each genetic defect may be relatively low in isolation but the simultaneous presence of several mutations may dramatically increase disease susceptibility. Moreover, environmental factors may interact with one or more genetic variations to add further to the risk. The analysis of genetic risk factors and plasmatic factors, together with private life style and environmental factors, has contributed significantly to our understanding of the genetic predisposition to venous thrombosis.

AB  - The possible negative impacts of flow regulation on riparian zone conditions can be observed due to the disruption of the natural flow regime in reservoirs. In spite of considerable literature on the qualitative effects of external disturbances on riparian health indicators (RHIs), quantitative evaluations of such changes induced by pressure are rare in the literature. Our study evaluated the effects of pressure indicators on the RHIs, and the responses of RHIs relevant to the riparian zones of the Three Gorges Dam Reservoir (TGDR), China, by using the field-based approach. This paper is a component of a large project-rapid appraisal of riparian condition for the TGDR, China. The analysis has compared pressures (13 indicators) and RHIs (27 indicators) determined from the transects (259) identified throughout the TGDR (within 15 counties) by categorizing into upstream, midstream, and downstream. By using basic statistical techniques (Kruskal-Wallis tests and Pearson's correlation), pressure indicators were found to significantly differently influence RHIs for the categorized three sections of the riparian zones of the TGDR. The correlation analysis confirmed that the pressure indicators correlated (range of r = -0.496-0.971) with the RHIs (enlisted as habitat, plant cover, regeneration, erosion, and exotic parameters). Moreover, pressure indicators were found to have a highly significant influence on erosion and habitat parameters, but moderate effects on plant cover, exotic and regeneration parameters. In addition, the highest relative effect of the pressure indicators was detected in the upstream transects, whereas the lowest was in the downstream transects. Agglomerative Hierarchical Cluster analysis also confirmed the substantial dissimilarity in the upstream transects, whereas significant similarities were identified between midstream and downstream transects. These results may be particularly important in the planning stages, to help administrators and planners form better priorities and treatments for reach-scale conservation and restoration of wide-ranging riparian zones.

AB  - In this study, change of the apparent resistivity values was investigated on reinforced and unreinforced concrete samples that were designed in different strength of the dry and water saturated conditions. For this purpose, studies were conducted with 150 x 150 x 150 mm(3) samples of 9 different concrete designs. A piece of 10, 14 or 20 mm diameter reinforcement was placed in the middle of concrete samples and 18 samples were prepared for all types of them and 9 samples for the unreinforced samples, Some of the prepared these samples were subjected to the water cure and the other part of the samples were kept in the air cure. The potential difference measurements were made by electrical resistivity method on different surfaces of the sample at specific time periods of during the 90 days and apparent resistivity values of the samples were determined. Furthermore, the concrete strength was determined from average of 3 samples by uniaxial compressive strength test of each sample on 7th, 28th and 90th days. Changes of the apparent resistivity and concrete strength values that obtained from these conducted studies were investigated to depending on time. At the same time, relationship between uniaxial compressive strength and the apparent resistivity was revealed in case of the samples' being in water or air cure. Accordingly, it was stated that the different curing conditions have an effect on the apparent resistivity of concrete and concrete strength. Therefore, while the apparent resistivity of the concrete design having different strengths increased depending on increasing concrete compressive strength of samples in the water cure: it reduced in the air cure. This research is important in terms of both time and being economical by providing a non-destructive approach to the determination in-situ of the concrete strength of the water or gas saturated old and new concrete structures.

AB  - Corporate social responsibility (CSR) research is not new, but its importance to today's socially conscious market environment is even more evident in recent years. This study moves beyond CSR as simply the socially responsible actions and policies of organizations and focuses on the complex psychology of CSR as it relates to individuals within the organization. Given CSR can positively affect both the individuals within the organization and the organization itself, better understanding and leveraging the mechanisms and conditions of CSR that facilitate desired employee outcomes is crucial for organizational performance. However, scholars lack consensus in determining a theoretical framework for understanding how and under what conditions CSR will make an impact on employees and ultimately organizational performance. This study adds clarity by exploring the effect of perceived CSR on a more comprehensive set of employees' attitudinal and behavioral reactions (i.e., turnover intention, in-role job performance, and helping behavior) via the mediating mechanism of organizational identification and the moderating condition of moral identity. Hypotheses were derived using social identity theory. Results were based on data obtained from 340 Chinese manufacturing employee-supervisor dyads. This study found that employees' perceived CSR had an indirect relationship via organizational identification with each of the variables: (1) turnover intention, (2) in-role job performance, and (3) helping behavior. Specifically, the negative relationship between perceived CSR and turnover intention was stronger when employees had higher moral identity and the positive relationship between perceived CSR and in-role job performance and helping behavior was amplified by moral identity. Our findings show how the mediating mechanism of organizational identity and the moderating condition of moral identity work together to improve organizational effectiveness. The findings reveal several ways in which organizations can strategically focus their CSR and human resource efforts, such as applying this model and focusing on moral identity as a key indicator when evaluating employees.

AB  - Oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) is one of the three most important oil crops in China, and is regarded as a drought-tolerant oilseed crop. However, it is commonly sensitive to waterlogging, which usually refers to an adverse environment that limits crop development. Moreover, crop growth and soil irrigation can be monitored at a regional level using remote sensing data. High spatial resolution optical satellite sensors are very useful to capture and resist unfavorable field conditions at the sub-field scale. In this study, four different optical sensors, i.e., Pleiades-1A, Worldview-2, Worldview-3, and SPOT-6, were used to estimate the dry above-ground biomass (AGB) of oilseed rape and track the seasonal growth dynamics. In addition, three different soil water content field experiments were carried out at different oilseed rape growth stages from November 2014 to May 2015 in Northern Zhejiang province, China. As a significant indicator of crop productivity, AGB was measured during the seasonal growth stages of the oilseed rape at the experimental plots. Several representative vegetation indices (VIs) obtained from multiple satellite sensors were compared with the simultaneously-collected oilseed rape AGB. Results showed that the estimation model using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with a power regression model performed best through the seasonal growth dynamics, with the highest coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.77), the smallest root mean square error (RMSE = 104.64 g/m(2)), and the relative RMSE (rRMSE = 21%). It is concluded that the use of selected VIs and high spatial multiple satellite data can significantly estimate AGB during the winter oilseed rape growth stages, and can be applied to map the variability of winter oilseed rape at the sub-field level under different waterlogging conditions, which is very promising in the application of agricultural irrigation and precision agriculture.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between storage environmental factors (water activity (a(w)) (0.89-0.97) and temperature (15 degrees C-30 degrees C)), colonisation of wheat and maize by Fusarium graminearum and F. verticillioides respectively and the dry matter losses (DMLs) caused and quantified by contamination with deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEA) and fumonisins (FUMs) during storage. Fungal growth was assessed by the amount of CO2 produced under different interacting conditions of a(w) and temperature. DMLs were quantified using the cumulative CO2 data, and these were shown to increase as temperature and a(w) increased. The amount of DON, ZEA (wheat for human consumption) and FUMs (feed maize) produced was significantly affected by the storage conditions. The three toxins however showed different patterns of production. Optimum for DON was at the wettest conditions (0.97a(w)) and the highest temperature assessed (30 degrees C), whereas for ZEA this shifted to 25 degrees C. FUMs were produced in higher amounts in maize at 30 degrees C and 0.97a(w); however, at intermediate a(w) levels (0.955a(w)), the highest production occurred at 25 degrees C followed by 20 degrees C. Polynomial models were developed for the effect of the storage factors on DMLs and toxin production. DMLs under different environmental conditions were significantly correlated with DON and FUMs. DON contamination was above the EU limits in at least 80% of the wheat samples with DMLs 41%, whereas at least 70% of the same samples contained ZEA above the respective EU legislative limits. Similarly, at least 75% of the maize samples with DMLs >= 0.9% exceeded the EU limits for the sum of FUMs in feed. These results show that it may be possible to use temporal CO2 production during storage of grains as an indicator of the level of contamination of the grain with mycotoxins.

AB  - A portable unilateral nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) instrument was used to detect in field conditions the water status of leaves of herbaceous crops (Zea mays, Phaseolus vulgaris), mesophyllous trees (Populus nigra), and natural Mediterranean vegetation characterized by water-spending shrubs (Cistus incanus) and water-saving sclerophyllous trees (Quercus ilex). A good relationship was observed between NMR signal, leaf relative water content, and leaf transpiration in herbaceous leaves undergoing fast dehydration or slowly developing a drought stress. A relationship was also observed between NMR signal and water potential of Populus leaves during the development of a water stress and when leaves recovered from the stress. In the natural vegetation, the relationship between NMR signal and water status was found in Cistus, the species characterized by high transpiration rates, when measured during a drought stress period and after a rainfall. In the case of the sclerophyllous Quercus, the NMR signal, the relative water content, and the transpiration rate did not change at different leaf water status, possibly because a large amount of water is compartmentalized in cellular structures and macromolecules. The good association between NMR signal and relative water content was lost in leaves exposed for 24 h to dehydration or to an osmotic stress caused by polyethylene glycol feeding. At this time, the transverse relaxation time became longer than in leaves maintained under optimal water conditions, and two indicators of membrane damage, the ion leakage and the emission of products of membrane lipoxygenation [(Z)-3-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexenol, and (E)-2-hexenol], increased. These results taken all together give information on the physiological state of a leaf under a developing stress and show the usefulness of the NMR instrumentation for screening vegetation health and fitness in natural and cultivated conditions. It is concluded that the portable unilateral NMR instrument may be usefully employed in field conditions to monitor nondestructively the water status of plants and to assist agricultural practices, such as irrigation scheduling, to minimize stomatal closure and the consequent limitation to plant production.

AB  - Poultry meat spoils quickly unless it is processed, stored, and distributed under refrigerated conditions. Research has shown that the microbial spoilage rate is predominantly controlled by temperature and the spoilage flora of refrigerated, aerobically-stored poultry meat is generally dominated by Pseudomonas spp.
   The objective of our study was to develop and validate a mathematical model that predicts the growth of Pseudomonas in raw poultry stored under aerobic conditions over a variety of temperatures.
   Thirty-seven Pseudomonas growth rates were extracted from 6 previously published studies. Objectives, methods and data presentation formats varied widely among the studies, but all the studies used either naturally contaminated meat or poultry or Pseudomonas isolated from meat or poultry grown in laboratory media. These extracted growth rates were used to develop a model relating growth rate of Pseudomonas to storage or incubation temperature. A square-root equation [Ratkowsky, D.A., Olley, J., McMeekin, T.A., and Ball, A., 1982. Relationship between temperature and growth rate of bacterial cultures. J. Appl. Bacteriol. 149, 1-5.] was used to model the data. Model predictions were then compared to 20 Pseudomonas and 20 total aerobes growth rate measurements collected in our laboratory. The growth rates were derived from more than 600 bacterial concentration measurements on raw poultry at 10 temperatures ranging from 0 to 25 degrees C. Visual inspection of the data and the indices of bias and accuracy factors proposed by Baranyi et al. [Baranyi, J., Pin, C., and Ross, T., 1999. Validating and comparing predictive models. Int. J. Food Micro. 48, 159-166.] were used to analyze the performance of the model.
   The experimental data for Pseudomonas showed a 4.8% discrepancy with the predictions and a bias of +3.6%. Percent discrepancies show close agreement between model predictions and observations, and the positive bias factor demonstrates that the proposed model over-predicts growth rate, thus, can be considered fail-safe. Both Pseudomonas spp. as well as total aerobes may be considered good indicators of poultry spoilage.
   A properly constructed and validated model for Pseudomonas growth under aerobic conditions can provide a fast and cost-effective alternative to traditional microbiological techniques to estimate the effects of storage temperature on product shelf-life. The model developed here may be used to determine the effect of both initial Pseudomonas concentration and storage temperature on shelf-life of poultry meat under aerobic storage conditions over temperatures from 0 to 25 degrees C.

AB  - Soil management decisions often are aimed at improving or maintaining the soil in a productive condition. Several indicators have been used to denote changes in the soil by various management practices, but changes in bulk density is the most commonly reported factor. Bulk density, in and of itself, gives little insight on the underlying soil environment that affects plant growth. We investigated using the Least Limiting Water Range (LLWR) to evaluate changes in the soil caused by soil management. The LLWR combines limitations to root growth caused by water holding capacity, soil strength and soil aeration into a single number that can be used to determine soil physical improvement or degradation. The LLWR appeared to be a good indicator of plant productivity when the full potential of water holding capacity on available water can be realized, such as with wheat (Triticum aestivum, L.) grown in a no-till system when the wheat followed a fallow period. A regression of wheat yield to LLWR gave an r(2) of 0.76. The LLWR was a poorer indicator of plant productivity when conditions such as low total water availability limited the expression of the potential soil status on crop production. Dryland corn (Zea mays, L.) yields were more poorly correlated with LLWR (r(2)=0.18), indicating that, under dryland conditions, in-season factors relating to water infiltration may be more important to corn production than water holding capacity. An improved method to evaluate in-season soil environmental dynamics was made by using Water Stress Day (WSD). The WSD was calculated by summing the differences of actual water contents in the field from the limits identified by the LLWR during the growing season. A regression of irrigated corn yield with LLWR as the soil indicator of the soil environment resulted in an r(2) of 0.002. A regression of the same yield data with WSD as the indicator of the soil environment resulted in an r(2) of 0.60. We concluded that the LLWR can be a useful measure of management effects on soil potential productivity. Soil management practices that maximize the LLWR can maximize the potential of a soil for crop production. Knowledge of the LLWR for a soil can help the farm manager optimize growing conditions by helping schedule irrigation and for making tillage decisions. The WSD, calculated from the LLWR and in-season water dynamics, allows us to evaluate changes in the soil caused by differing soil management practices and identify critical periods of stress on the plant that can reduce production.

AB  - Occurrence of drought, as an inevitable natural climate feature, cannot be ceased while happening. However, costs of the consequences could be alleviated using mature scientific integrated approaches. To reduce the amount of damage, it is required to provide "Contingency" and "Mitigation" action plans. For this reason, development of efficient operating instructions for various regions based on weather conditions and field studies is needed as well as having a sophisticated understanding of socioeconomic situations. This paper describes an approach to provide the first national agricultural drought risk management plan for a river basin in Iran country as a pilot. The study lasted for 3 years as a national technical research project for the "soil conservation and watershed management research institute." To reach the objectives, besides holding workshops and specialized think-tank meetings, field researches were done. Based on the socioeconomic data sources in the basin and the results of meetings by participation of local managers and residents, the final plan was developed. Moreover, in order to carry out this research, different climatic, agricultural and local information were collected in the watershed. In the next steps, potential risks and vulnerabilities of various agricultural sectors due to the hazard were evaluated. In this study, a nine-step approach to develop an agricultural drought risk management plan proposing different scientific-managerial phases based on the latest experts' opinions, released international scientific best practices, and existing conditions governing the region was followed. With respect to the average income of US$ one million from agriculture and animal husbandry in the river basin, total drought loss varies from US$ 86,000 to US$ 258,000 for a range of light to very intense drought conditions, respectively. The setup of these nine executive phases defined monitoring, forecasting, and warning steps in working teams and managed the subprograms in partnership with stakeholders and decision-makers to mitigate the rate of drought damage from 30 to 47% (depending on the severity of the drought condition).

AB  - A 3.5-m gravity core (DJ6-93SF-6) from San Francisco Bay reveals a complex paleoclimatic history of the region over the last 3870 cal YBP. A polynomial equation based on 11 AMS C-14 ages provides an excellent age model for the core, and environmental proxies for water temperature Land salinity are derived from various foraminiferal abundances, stable carbon and oxygen isotopes, and Mg/Ca ratios. Two foraminiferal associations were identified by Q-mode cluster analysis. a colder-water Elphidium excavatum association and the warmer-water Ammonia beccarii-Elphidium gunteri association. The E. excavation association dominates the core for all but about 600 years out of the last four millennia.
   At 3870 cal YBP, water temperatures were warm (13.9 degrees C) and freshwater inflow was reduced compared with today. From 3,590 to 2860 cal YBP, temperatures dropped 0.5 degrees C and the climate remained dry. This was followed by a period of pronounced lower delta C-13 values, indicating that conditions became considerably wetter from 2860 to 2170 cal YBP. During this interval, the temperature oscillated frequently, peaking at 13.9 degrees C at 2710 cal YBP, then dropping shortly thereafter to 12.8 degrees C at 2420 cal YBP. Freshwater inflow gradually decreased between 2170 and 1950 cal YBP with a minimal rise in temperature, then changed quickly to colder and wetter conditions at 1900 cal YBP. Drier conditions then prevailed until 1480 cal YBP with water temperatures fluctuating between 13.1 degrees C and 13.8 degrees C, followed by wetter climate from 1480 to 1320 cal YBP.
   A significant faunal shift from the E. excavatum association to the A. beccarii-E. gunteri association occurred from 1.250 to 650 cal YBP, possibly clue to regional warming, decreased oxygen availability, and/or a change in the phyto-plankton community. Associated with this change in faunal composition were warm and dry conditions, representative of the Medieval Warm Period (Medieval Climatic Anomaly). A climatic shift coincident with the onset of the Little Ice Age (LIA I and LIA II) is evident from 650 to 280 cal YBP, with the return of the E. excavatum association and an extreme drop in delta O-18 values, all indicating increased precipitation and fresh water inflow. This was followed by generally drier conditions to the present, except for a brief wet period around 100 cal YBP, and fairly consistent water temperatures in the middle 13 degrees C, except for a drop to 12.8 degrees C at, 200 cal YBP.
   Two significant faunal changes occur near the top of the core. First, there is the reappearance of the A. beccarii - E. gunteri association suggesting that, once again, regional warming has taken place, oxygen availability has declined, and/or environmental conditions changed such that diatoms have become a scarce food source. Second, there is the first, appearance of the invasive Japanese foraminifera Trochammina hadai Uchio, a species that commonly lives in highly polluted areas and is an indicator of eutrophication in its native estuaries. At the same time, freshwater inflow decreased, which may be explained by global warming during the last 100 years, or more likely due to modern water diversion for agriculture in the central,alley of California.

AB  - The presence of primary iron sulfides that appear to be aqueously altered in CM and CR carbonaceous chondrites provides the potential to study the effects and, by extension, the conditions of aqueous alteration. In this work, we have used SEM, TEM, and EPMA techniques to characterize primary sulfides that show evidence of secondary alteration. The alteration styles consist of primary pyrrhotite altering to secondary pentlandite (CMs only), magnetite (CMs and CRs), and phyllosilicates (CMs only) in grains that initially formed by crystallization from immiscible sulfide melts in chondrules (pyrrhotite-pentlandite intergrowth [PPI] grains). Textural, microstructural, and compositional data from altered sulfides in a suite of CM and CR chondrites have been used to constrain the conditions of alteration of these grains and determine their alteration mechanisms. This work shows that the PPI grains exhibit two styles of alteration-one to form porous pyrrhotite-pentlandite (3P) grains by dissolution of precursor PPI grain pyrrhotite and subsequent secondary pentlandite precipitation (CMs only), and the other to form the altered PPI grains by pseudomorphic replacement of primary pyrrhotite by magnetite (CMs and CRs) or phyllosilicates (CMs only). The range of alteration textures and products is the result of differences in conditions of alteration due to the role of microchemical environments and/or brecciation. Our observations show that primary sulfides are sensitive indicators of aqueous alteration processes in CM and CR chondrites.

AB  - The stratigraphy of four peat sequences collected in two peat bogs located in the Eastmain River watershed (52 degrees N, 76 degrees W), James Bay lowlands, Quebec, Canada, was investigated to reconstruct past hydroclimatic conditions of peat accumulation and associated carbon dynamics during the late Holocene. Analyses of macrofossils, testate amoebae, peat humification, C/N ratio and bulk density were performed at high-resolution along each peat core, allowing the potential of each proxy indicator under varying nutrient status and hydroclimatic conditions to be evaluated. Some synchronous changes were recorded both within and between peatlands, suggesting the influence of allogenic factors in the development of these peatlands. Other reconstructed changes have highlighted autogenic succession processes related to the local geomorphic and hydrologic context. Highest peat carbon accumulation rates (LORCA) were correlated with either wet conditions or high woody debris percentages, suggesting that residence time of the biomass in the acrotelm and the nature of plant material can both influence carbon accumulation rates in peat bogs. This study provides the first high-resolution paleoecohydrological reconstructions from the mid-boreal ecoregion of eastern Canada, a region in which peatlands occupy 30 to 60% of the land surface.

AB  - Physical indicators of soil quality in relation to soil erodibility were evaluated in the submontaneous tract of Punjab (India). A field experiment was conducted with both natural and simulated rainfall conditions under four land usesbarren, cultivated, grassland, and forest. Sustainability index approach (Gomez, Kelly, Syers, and Coughlan, 1996) and cumulative rating approach (Shukla, Lal, and Ebinger, 2004) were used to measure the sustainability in terms of soil erodibility. According to the sustainability index approach at the Ballowal Saunkhri-I, Ballowal Saunkhri-II, and Saleran locations, only the forest land use system is sustainable. At the fourth locationKokowal Majariall four land uses were observed to be sustainable with respect to soil erodibility or soil physical quality. The mean sustainability indices were observed to be highly correlated with the respective soil erodibility values under natural (r=-0.83) and simulated (r=-0.87) rainfall conditions. The cumulative rating approach had a significant positive correlation with soil erodibility both under natural (r=0.75) and simulated (r=0.81) rainfall conditions. There was a strong correlation between the sustainability index and cumulative rating (r=-0.93). In conclusion, the sustainability index approach was found to be more suitable for assessing the sustainability of the system in terms of soil erodibility as it required less soil data input and had a higher correlation with soil erodibility. However, the sustainability index provided two categories of sustainability compared to the cumulative rating which produces five categories.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to standardize and to assess the predictive value of the cytogenetic analysis by MN test in fish erythrocytes as a biomarker for marine environmental contamination. MN frequency baseline in erythrocytes was evaluated in a number of fish species from a reference area (S. Teresa. La Spezia Gulf) and genotoxic potential of a number of common chemical contaminants and mixtures was determined in fish experimentally exposed in aquarium under controlled conditions. Fish (Scophthalmus maximus) were exposed for 3 weeks to 50 ppb of single chemicals (dialkyl plithalate. bisphenol A, tetrabromodiphenyl ether), 30ppb nonylphenol and mixtures (North Sea oil and North Sea oil with alkylated phenols). Chromosomal damage was determined as micronuclei (MN) frequency in fish erythrocytes. Nuclear anomalies such as blebbed, notched and lobed nuclei were also recorded. Significant increase in MN frequency was observed in erythrocytes of fish exposed to bisphenol A and tetrabromodiphenylether. Chemical mixture North Sea oil + alkylated phenols induced the highest MN frequency (2.95 micronucleated cells/1000 cells compared to 1 MNcell/1000 cells in control animals). The study results revealed that micronucleus test, as an index of cumulative exposure, appears to be a sensitive model to evaluate genotoxic compounds in fish under controlled conditions.

AB  - An exceptionally rich paleontological site containing thousands of mammalian fossils and well-dated with 18 radiocarbon samples provides evidence of late-Holocene ecological response to climatic change in northern Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. The mammalian fauna, composed of 10,597 identified specimens, shows surprising affinity to the local habitat with little evidence of long-distance transport of faunal elements, thus revealing the faithfulness of a fossil site to the community from which it is derived. The mammals illustrate ecological sensitivity to a series of mesic to xeric climatic excursions in the sagebrush-grassland ecotone during the past 3200 yr, From 3200 cal yr B.P. to a maximum of 1100 cal yr B.P., the species composition of mammals indicates wetter conditions than today. Beginning about 1200 cal yr B.P., the fauna becomes more representative of xeric conditions with maxima in xeric-indicator taxa and minima in mesic-indicator taxa, concordant with the Medieval Warm Period (circa 1000 Co 650 yr B.P.). Cooler, wetter conditions which prevailed for most of the Little Ice Age (700 to 100 yr B.P.) in general correspond to a return to a more mesic mammalian fauna. A warm period within the Little Ice Age is documented by a xeric fauna. These data show that mammalian ecological sensitivity to climatic change over this intermediate time scale holds promise for predictions about the impacts of future global Warming.

AB  - Background Birth weight, birth length, and gestational age are major indicators of newborn health. Several prenatal exposure factors influence the fetal environment. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of prenatal exposure factors, including socio-demographic, behavioural, dietary, physical activity, clinical and environmental on birth outcomes through the mediation of Favourable Fetal Growth Conditions (FFGC).
   Methods Data was obtained from six hundred and fifty-six Mother and Child in the Environment birth cohort study in Durban, South Africa from 2013 to 2017. We adopted structural equation models which evaluate the direct and indirect effects by allowing multiple simultaneous equations to incorporate confounding and mediation.
   Results A significant direct and indirect effect of FFGC on newborn weight, length, and gestational age was seen. Gestational weight gain and maternal body mass index in the first trimester exerted a mediation effect between maternal behavioural risk factors and FFGC. Similarly, the level of physical activity during pregnancy was associated with decreased gestational weight gain. The effects of maternal characteristics on newborn weight, length, and gestational age were largely indirect, operating through FFGC as a latent variable.
   Conclusions Gestational weight gain and maternal pre-gestational BMI were observed to mediate the association between prenatal behavioural risk factors and favourable fetal growth conditions.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to study the impact of key agrotechnical factors: seed inoculation Rhizobium meliloti, sowing date, row spacing, weed control, and pathogen control, on productiveness of fenugreek seeds in the environmental conditions of the north-eastern Europe. The results indicate that the average seed yield of fenugreek from 54 test technology variants was 759 kg ha(-1), within a 9% variation range. The primary decision-supporting criteria for classification of a given technology of growing fenugreek for seeds as a high yielding one under the environmental conditions of north-eastern Europe are: the earliest possible sowing date or the one delayed by no more than 10 days relative to the former, as well as the inter-row spacing of 15 cm; the second most important criteria include technological variants with chemical weed control and full antifungal protection. Among the yield-protecting treatments tested, weed control of fenugreek plantations as an agrotechnical factor was responsible for the highest variation of seed yields. Irrespective of a weeding technique (mechanical, chemical), the sowing of seeds at the earliest possible date or delayed by 10 days did not cause a significant decline in seed yield, although the sowing date postponed by 20 days might reduce the seed yield by 3-10% when mechanical weed control techniques are applied, and by 3-13% on fields treated with a herbicide.

AB  - Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) have been widely applied in climate parameter reconstructions over the past few years. MBT'(5ME) (the methylation of branched tetraethers based on the 5-methyl isomers) and CBT' (cyclisation of branched tetraethers that includes 6-methyl brGDGTs in the numerator) have proven to be useful brGDGT proxies for interpreting the mean annual air temperature (MAT) and soil pH of different climate condition areas in China. However, the application of MBT'(5ME) and CBT' for indicating altitudinal climate conditions is still open to discussion, e.g., the lack of comparisons between attitudinal results from mountain areas of different climate conditions. In this study, we compared soil brGDGT along three mountain transects in subtropical China, i.e., Mt. Gaoligong, Mt. Fanjing and Mt. Shennongjia. The brGDGT distributions of Mt. Gaoligong and Mt. Fanjing were similar to the subtropical surface soil brGDGT distribution pattern, featured by the dominance of chemical structures of brGDGTs Ia and IIa. However, Mt. Shennongjia was characterised by increasing brGDGTs IIIa', IIa', IIb' and Ib, much like the semi-humid/humid temperate climate area brGDGT distribution pattern. These results indicate that altitudinal climate indicators such as temperature and precipitation could be recorded by varied brGDGT distributions. Also, MBT'(5ME)-inferred MATs were negatively correlated with mountain altitude (R-2: 0.79-0.87). The MAT lapse rate increased from Mt. Shennongjia to Mt. Fanjing to Mt. Gaoligong (0.5 degrees C/100 m, 0.9 degrees C/100 m and 1.3 degrees C/100 m, respectively). The influence of the Qinghai Tibetan Plateau ice cover and differences in latitudinal temperature and/or moisture conditions might be the reasons for the various lapse rates. The soil pH was less correlated with altitude (R-2: 0.58-0.63) than to the regression of MAT and altitude, showing slightly different relations from those of horizontal studies. At Mt. Gaoligong and Mt. Fanjing, soil pH and altitude demonstrated positive linear regressions but with different slopes. The different reducing rate of soil pH as a function of altitude for the two mountains is probably caused by their dominating summer monsoons. For Mt. Shennongjia where the climate condition is less humid than Mt. Gaoligong and Mt. Fanjing, the soil pH did not significantly change with altitude, and thus no relationship was observed. This might probably be partially induced by the weakly alkaline parent rocks of Mt. Shennongjia.

AB  - This study aims to test whether environmental conditions including the trophic habitat and diet impact the biochemical composition of storage organs and affect the nutritional quality of eggs of Octopus vulgaris. Trophic habitat and gonad quality of neighbouring populations off the Portuguese coast, subject to different oceanographic regimes, were compared using the digestive gland and beaks as recorders of trophic and habitat preferences, and gonads as indicators of egg quality. Cholesterol, phospholipids and triacylglycerol content, essential fatty acid (EFA) profile of the digestive gland and stable isotopes, delta N-15 and delta C-13, in the buccal mass flesh and beaks were indicators of the differences in the trophic habitat between populations. For gonad quality, the same bio-indicators were used to identify differences with maturation. The study shows that, although diet influences the EFA profile of the gonads to a certain degree, the main lipid content, phospholipids and cholesterol content in the gonads are not influenced by habitat conditions. This, therefore, suggests that O. vulgaris is able to influence the quality of egg content independent of diet. The species is believed to be an income breeder which attains maturity upon reaching a sufficient condition level, then channelling energy directly from food to gonad development.

AB  - Spartina densiflora, an invader cordgrass living in polluted salt marshes of the Odiel estuary (SW Spain), was collected and cultured under controlled laboratory conditions. After acclimation to non-polluted soils for 28 days, both metabolites and enzymes activities used as indicators of oxidative stress were reduced significantly. Then, plants were exposed to 500 and 1000 ppm Fe-ethylenediamine-N,N'-2-hydroxyphenyl acetic acid (EDDHA) for 28 days. Our data demonstrate that iron content in leaves was enhanced by iron exposure. This iron increase caused an enhancement in the concentration of H2O2, hydroperoxides and lipid peroxidation, and a decrease in chlorophyll levels. Thus, iron exposure led to oxidative stress conditions. However, oxidative indicators stabilised after first 2 weeks of exposure, although the highest iron levels in leaves were reached at the end of treatments. Iron exposure induced an enhancement of catalase, ascorbate peroxidase and guaiacol peroxidase activities, together with an increase in total and oxidised ascorbate. This response may be defensive against oxidative stress and thus help to explain why cell oxidative damages were stabilised. Thus, by using a sensitive long-time protocol, iron-dependent oxidative damages may be controlled and even reverted successfully by the activation of the antioxidative defences of S. densiflora. This efficient antioxidative system, rapidly modulated in response to excess iron and other environmental stressors, may account for S. densiflora's successful adaptation to stress conditions in its habitat.

AB  - Calcite moonmilk, which is a cave deposit formed of calcite crystals and mater, is found in many caves in the Italian Alps. These modern and ancient deposits are formed of fiber calcite crystals, 50-500 nm wide and 1 to > 10 mu m long, and polycrystalline chains that have few crystal defects. Radiocarbon dating indicates that most moonmilk deposits in these caves are fossil and that for most precipitation ceased similar to 6400 cal years BP, at the end of the mid-Holocene Hypsithermal,
   In the caves of the Italian Alps, the optimal conditions for formation of calcite moonmilk are: (1) a temperature range of 3.5-5.5 degrees C, (2) low discharge volumes of seepage waters that are slightly supersaturated (SICAL = 0.0 to similar to 0.2), and (3) relative humidity that is at or close to 100%. Microbial activity apparently did not play an active role in the formation of the calcite moonmilk, Conditions for moonmilk formation are typically found in caves that are located beneath land surfaces, which are soil covered and support a conifer forest. Precipitation of the fiber calcite crystals apparently involved very slow how of slightly supersaturated fluids.
   The fact that moonmilk appears to form under a narrow range of environmental conditions means that this cave deposit has potential as a paleoclimatic indicator in high alpine karst areas.

AB  - The studied Radymno loess section is located in the large, fore-Carpathian San River valley (Sandomierz Basin, SE Poland) and shows the sequence building the Pleistocene cover of middle terrace of the San River. Such sequence is quite rare in loess deposits because it combines different depositional environments: subaqueous - the late Eemian-Early Vistulian alluvial-swamp facies of loess with inserts of gyttja type, and subaerial - the Plenivistulian aeolian loess. The main goal of the study was to reconstruct the Late Pleistocene paleoenvironmental changes recorded in this section. For this purpose, pollen and fossil Ostracoda analyses were conducted. These data were supplemented with sedimentological and pedo-lithological analyses. Additionally, the results of earlier investigations published so far have been used: lithological and malacological analyses as well as luminescence (IRSL and TL) dating. Based on the analysis of many indicators, the paleoenvironmental changes have been correlated with those recorded in pollen diagrams obtained from other regions. This correlation indicates that in the Radymno section there is evidence of the vegetation succession typical of the Eemian Interglacial with climatic optimum and of the short-term oscillations in the Early Vistulian and then in the Lower Pleniglacial of Vistulian. The analysis of fossil Ostracoda, which were found in some parts of the profile, provided information about short-term paleohydrological changes, and especially about the functioning of surface water bodies in changing periglacial conditions of the bottom of the San River valley in MIS 5d - MIS 2. High humidity in the environment was caused mainly by floods and high groundwater level, which indirectly conditioned the formation of water bodies in the valley bottom. Correlation with palynological data indicated that these water bodies existed also under dry climate conditions. This proves that the local conditions of the studied area strongly modified the environmental changes dependent on paleoclimate.

AB  - Background: Plant-parasitic nematodes (PPN) are major crop pests. On olive (Olea europaea), they significantly contribute to economic losses in the top-ten olive producing countries in the world especially in nurseries and under cropping intensification. The diversity and the structure of PPN communities respond to environmental and anthropogenic forces. The olive tree is a good host plant model to understand the impact of such forces on PPN diversity since it grows according to different modalities (wild, feral and cultivated olives). A wide soil survey was conducted in several olive-growing regions in Morocco. The taxonomical and the functional diversity as well as the structures of PPN communities were described and then compared between non-cultivated (wild and feral forms) and cultivated (traditional and high-density olive cultivation) olives.
   Results: A high diversity of PPN with the detection of 117 species and 47 genera was revealed. Some taxa were recorded for the first time on olive trees worldwide and new species were also identified. Anthropogenic factors (wild vs cultivated conditions) strongly impacted the PPN diversity and the functional composition of communities because the species richness, the local diversity and the evenness of communities significantly decreased and the abundance of nematodes significantly increased in high-density conditions. Furthermore, these conditions exhibited many more obligate and colonizer PPN and less persister PPN compared to non-cultivated conditions. Taxonomical structures of communities were also impacted: genera such as Xiphinema spp. and Heterodera spp. were dominant in wild olive, whereas harmful taxa such as Meloidogyne spp. were especially enhanced in high-density orchards.
   Conclusions: Olive anthropogenic practices reduce the PPN diversity in communities and lead to changes of the community structures with the development of some damaging nematodes. The study underlined the PPN diversity as a relevant indicator to assess community pathogenicity. That could be taken into account in order to design control strategies based on community rearrangements and interactions between species instead of reducing the most pathogenic species.

AB  - The aviation industry in India is on a growth path with annual passenger traffic growing at over fifteen percent. The government has backed this growth through the extensive development of airport infrastructure across the country. However, airline companies in India, periodically face financial distress as the internal and external environmental factors change dynamically. Company management, acting as the agent for all the stakeholders, needs to ensure that the distress condition does not develop into a bankruptcy situation. It needs to identify all those factors, which have a major impact on the financial condition of the company and monitor them continuously using various tools and techniques. These identified key factors could be from both the internal conditions of the company and from the external environment that the industry operates. By identifying these influencing factors early, management can take preventive measures before the distress condition becomes critical. Informed decisions can be taken when the value of these key parameters change over time. To identify and rank these key factors in terms of relative importance, this paper adopts a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach based on the technique of fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Processing (AHP). Robustness of the method is further tested through sensitivity analysis. The study finds that financial factors are the most critical and categorized as a major influence on the commercial stability of the airlines. Among these, operating revenue per air kilometer is the key variable for this sector. Operational factors, which are an indicator of the capacity and cost structure of the company, are ranked next, with the load factor taking the highest rank in this category. From the external environment aviation, fuel price per liter is ranked highest among all the factors and has a major impact on the profitability of the airline in India. Results also show that annual inflation and GDP growth rate in the country has a major influence on the sustainability of the airlines in India.

AB  - Wastewater treatment practices should pay more attention to their environmental performances due to their resources consumption and emissions' impact. While reclaimed water reuse seems to have become a promising practice, is it always feasible in any condition? To address this issue, this study carried out an extended emergy evaluation of a holistic wastewater treatment system. On one hand, this method was extended to include the emissions' impact. On the other hand, this study integrated a wastewater treatment plant, its excess sludge disposal system and treated water disposal system into an integrated wastewater treatment system (IWTS), so as to evaluate its performances more completely. And then several indicators, including cost per unit pollutant eliminated (CUPE), ratio of positive output (RPO), environmental load ratio (ELR), and sustainability index (SI), were proposed for evaluating the performances of an IWTS. Two scenarios (scenario A: wastewater treatment + sludge landfilling + treated water discharges; scenario B: wastewater treatment + sludge landfilling+ reclaimed water reuse) for a livestock wastewater treatment plant in Sichuan Agricultural University located in Ya'an City in Southwest China, as cases, were researched. The results show that scenario B has lower positive output efficiency and greater environmental load than scenario A. Meanwhile, the reclaimed water reuse raises cost per unit pollutant eliminated compared with the treated water being discharged directly; emissions' impact enhances the environmental load of the two scenarios to different degree; emissions' impact has decisive effect on the sustainability of the two scenarios. These results mean that the reclaimed water reuse should not be advocated in this case. This study provides some policy implications: (1) wastewater treatment process should be comprehensively evaluated from its resources consumption and impact of emissions; (2) reclaimed water reuse should be carefully evaluated from its pros and cons simultaneously; (3) the local conditions should be considered when implementing reclaimed water reuse, such as local water body conditions, market demands, the related laws and regulations, corporations' economic conditions, etc. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Flame chemiluminescence is widely acknowledged to be an indicator of heat release rate in premixed turbulent flames that are representative of gas turbine combustion. Though heat release rate is an important metric for evaluating combustion strategies in reciprocating engine systems, its correlation with flame chemiluminescence is not well studied. To address this gap an experimental study was carried out in a single-cylinder natural gas fired reciprocating engine that could simulate turbocharged conditions with exhaust gas recirculation. Crank angle resolved spectra (266-795 nm) of flame luminosity were measured for various operational conditions by varying the ignition timing for MBT conditions and by holding the speed at 1800 rpm and Brake Mean effective Pressure (BMEP) at 12 bar. The effect of dilution on CO2* chemiluminescence intensities was studied, by varying the global equivalence ratio (0.6-1.0) and by varying the exhaust gas recirculation rate.
   It was attempted to relate the measured chemiluminescence intensities to thermodynamic metrics of importance to engine research - in-cylinder bulk gas temperature and heat release rate (HRR) calculated from measured cylinder pressure signals. The peak of the measured CO2* chemiluminescence intensities coincided with peak pressures within +/- 2 CAD for all test conditions. For each combustion cycle, the peaks of heat release rate, spectral intensity and temperature occurred in that sequence, well separated temporally. The peak heat release rates preceded the peak chemiluminescent emissions by 3.8-9.5 CAD, whereas the peak temperatures trailed by 5.8-15.6 CAD. Such a temporal separation precludes correlations on a crank-angle resolved basis. However, the peak cycle heat release rates and to a lesser extent the peak cycle temperatures correlated well with the chemiluminescent emission from CO2*. Such observations point towards the potential use of flame chemiluminescence to monitor peak bulk gas temperatures as well as peak heat release rates in natural gas fired reciprocating engines.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) is a major nutrient for plant growth, and it is often the primary limiting nutrient in freshwater ecosystems controlling algal blooms. The Bronx River of New York City, New York, USA includes freshwater and coastal water systems. The water quality of both fresh and saline water is lower than the standard levels designated by New York State, and classified as Class B and Class I waters, respectively. Algal blooms and oxygen depletion within the river have degraded the water quality, endangered fishing, and limited recreational use. The internal loading of P, an important bioavailability indicator in the Bronx River, is determined by the sorption processes, i.e., cycling of P between solid and liquid phases. The objectives of this study were to understand how P sorption characteristics affect the internal loading of P and the conditions that might give rise to a flux of P from sediment to the water column, and to estimate the effects of physicochemical properties of the sediments on P sorption parameters. Bed sediments were collected from 15 sites along the Bronx River, from the origin in Westchester Davis Brook, Kensico Dam through the Bronx to the Sound View Park estuary. Phosphorus sorption maximum (S(max)) were significantly correlated with oxalate-extractable iron (Ox-Fe) and aluminum (Ox-Al), acid-extractable calcium (HCl-Ca) and magnesium (HCl-Mg), and total organic matter (OM), suggesting that not only metal ions affected P sorption characteristics, but OM also influenced the P sorption processes. This study also showed that originally sorbed P (S(0)) was significantly correlated with Ox-Fe, Ox-Al, HCl-Mg, and OM. The extremely high values of the percentage of sorbed P retained in sediments (>98% for all sites except the two estuary sites: site 13 of 88% and site 14 of 92%) suggest that a large flux of P to the water column from the sediments could potentially occur under changing hydro-climatic conditions, such as the changes in pH, ionic strength and redox conditions, which may, in turn, exacerbate eutrophic conditions and subsequent algal blooms.

AB  - Although the phytoplankton and protozoan assemblages of Lake Winnipeg are quite variable both, spatial and temporally, knowledge of their current distribution and ecology enables them to be used as indicators providing unique information concerning past and recent ecosystem conditions. Many of the main taxa have been similar throughout history although there have been dramatic changes in their abundance. Lake Winnipeg is currently very responsive to the climatic conditions in its drainage basin and it appears, historically, to have been a diatom-bluegreen algal lake with Tintinnids and thecate amoeba forming significant components of the protozoan community. A wide variety of microfossil remains have been used to infer past conditions in this large prairie lake.
   Microfossils reported from the long core 103 (8 m) taken from the north basin of LakeWinnipeg and short core Namao 7a taken from the south basin of the lake in August 1994 indicate that the lake has experienced several changes over its history. Diatom assemblages, low throughout the core 103 below 50 cm, except for a peak around 300-400 cm are virtually absent below 690-800 cm (Lake Agassiz). Stephanodiscus and Aulacoseira are the two major pelagic diatom genera represented throughout the lake's history. Species changes occur near the top of the core indicate increased anthropogenic eutrophication. Shallow water littoral taxa were never abundant at either coring sites. The presence of planktic cyanoprokaryote (cyanophyte, cyanobacteria, bluegreen algae) remains (akinetes) from 600 cm depth and the progressive increase in abundance from 400 cm to through the top 100 cm of the core indicates increasing phosphorus levels, warming summer temperatures and increasing summer nitrogen limitation in the lake. Nitrogen fixing bluegreens (especially Anabaena and Aphanizomenon akinetes) and the diatoms (Aulacoseira ambigua, A. granulata, A. islandica, S. binderanus, and S. niagarae) were abundant in the upper sediments and changes after 100 cm can be interpreted as the effects of human impact. These taxa indicative of increase eutrophication, in addition to S. agassizensis, Melosira varians and Cyclostephanos dubius, are representative of present day plankton.
   The short core Namao 7a was dated by (Pb)210 and the fossil remains also show a rise in the Aulacoseira (particularly A. granulata and A. ambigua) and bluegreen akinetes in the last 40 years as was seen in the upper sediments of the 103 core. There was an interesting peak in chrysophyte cysts during the 1930's which corresponds nicely with climatic conditions during this period. The fires accompaning the hot dry period in the mid 70's can be seen in the dramatic rise in charcoal during this period.
   Multiple types of micro fossils remains provides several useful tools for interpreting past lacustrine conditions.

AB  - On-farm anaerobic digestion (AD) has been promoted due to its improved environmental performance, which is based on a number of life cycle assessments (LCA). However, the influence of site-specific conditions and practices on AD performance is rarely captured in LCA studies and the effects on C and N cycles are often overlooked. In this paper, a new model for AD (SIMSWASTE-AD) is described in full and tested against a selection of available measured data. Good agreement between modelled and measured values was obtained, reflecting the model capability to predict biogas production (r(2) = 0.84) and N mineralization (r(2) = 0.85) under a range of substrate mixtures and operational conditions. SIMSWASTE-AD was also used to simulate C and N flows and GHG emissions for a set of scenarios exploring different AD technology levels, feedstock mixtures and climate conditions. The importance of post-digestion emissions and its relationship with the AD performance have been stressed as crucial factors to reduce the net GHG emissions (-75%) but also to enhance digestate fertilizer potential (15%). Gas tight digestate storage with residual biogas collection is highly recommended (especially in temperate to warm climates), as well as those operational conditions that can improve the process efficiency on degrading VS (e.g. thermophilic range, longer hydraulic retention time). Beyond the effects on the manure management stage, SIMSWASTE-AD also aims to help account for potential effects of AD on other stages by providing the C and nutrient flows. While primarily designed to be applied within the SIMSDAIRY modelling framework, it can also interact with other models implemented in integrated approaches. Such system scope assessments are essential for stakeholders and policy makers in order to develop effective strategies for reducing GHG emissions and environmental issues in the agriculture sector.

AB  - Biofilms are considered as good bioindicators of contamination by means of their capacity to react quickly to xenobiotics exposure, and their pivotal role in sustaining the aquatic trophic web. The exchanges of dissolved substances between water column and biofilm can be modulated by flow velocity. This study deals with toxicokinetic (transfer mechanisms) and toxicodynamic (effects) modelling of pesticides under two contrasted flow conditions.
   Diuron was used to run a 2-h kinetic study on mature biofilms in river channels. Two flow conditions were considered (<<<1 cm.s(-1): lentic environments such as ponds, 2 cm.s(-1): lotic environments such as watercourses). Three concentrationswere tested in order to estimate contamination levels in biofilms: 0, 5 (environmentally relevant concentration) and 50 (to determine the concentration effect) mu g.L-1. The effect of the above-mentioned factorswas also assessed on biofilms photosynthesis inhibition. For successive sampling times between 0 and 2 h, the raw biofilms and EPS tightly bound to cells plus microorganisms (T-EPS-M), were physically separated and analysed for diuron accumulation and structural and functional microbial descriptors.
   Diuron amounts accumulated in biofilm increasedwith increasing diuron exposure. Biofilms accumulated higher amounts of diuron at the lower flow velocity compared to high flow for raw biofilms, while accumulation in the T-EPS-M fraction was similar between flow conditions. Consequently, both flow velocity and diuron exposure had an influence on diuron bioaccumulation and distribution. Photosynthesis inhibition over time was directly linked to the exposure concentration of diuron recorded in the T-EPS-M fraction.
   These results suggest that flow causes a loss of organic matter in biofilms, decreasing the total accumulation of diuron, especially within diffusible EPS. As pesticide distribution in biofilm is amajor factor in the onset of toxicity, the novel fractioning method presented here will improve further toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic studies dealing with biofilms exposed to organic toxicants.

AB  - Bank filtration and other managed aquifer recharge techniques have extensive application in drinking water production throughout the world. Although the quality of surface water improves during these natural processes, residence time in the aquifer and length of the flow paths are critical factors. A wide range of data is available on the physical-chemical processes and hydraulic conditions, but there is limited knowledge about the top layer of the porous media. An investigation was conducted on the hydraulic behavior and on the change of microbiological indicator parameters in the filter cake. The purpose of the experiment was to: (1) investigate if the reverse osmosis is sustainable when fed with only slow filtered water, and (2) show that a short travel distance can provide extensive pathogen removal and beneficial conditions for the reverse osmosis. A slow sand filter was operated over a one-year long period while changes in head loss and microbiological parameters were being monitored. Head loss and membrane permeability were monitored between 3 November 2016 and 24 October 2018 and microbiological sampling was performed from 19 July 2017 to 6 November 2018. The filtered water was fed to a reverse osmosis (RO) filter as the water above the sand filter had been spiked with dissolved iron. Results show that even a thin biofilm cake of 1-3 mm thickness can result in a significant (10-100%) reduction in microbiological activity in the infiltrate, while favorable short retention times and oxic conditions are maintained. Avoiding anoxic conditions, subsequent iron and manganese dissolution and precipitation is beneficial for membrane processes. Building on these results, it can be stated that when reverse osmosis is directly fed with slow filtered or bank filtered water, (1) a short distance from the surface water body is required to avoid dissolved iron and manganese from entering the groundwater and (2) proper pathogen rejection can be achieved even over short distances.

AB  - The expression of elaborate sexual displays is associated with individual quality ensuring reliable information about the bearers. However, the associated cost of expressing enhanced sexual traits is expected to change according to environmental circumstances. Specifically, the cost of maintaining or producing a signal is predicted to increase when environmental conditions are unfavorable, which may lead to a reduction in signal expression as shown in several species. Here, we compared the calling behavior of male red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus living in an area of experimentally increased intra-sexual competition to that of males living in a control area. Levels of intra-sexual competition were experimentally manipulated by testosterone implants in a subset of captured males. In addition, we compared the association between two sexual traits, calling behavior and comb size, of males living in these two areas. Although call frequency was not affected by different levels of intra-sexual competition, males from the control area performed shorter calls than individuals from the treatment area. Additionally, a positive association between comb size and call duration was found only for males in the area of lower aggressiveness. We suggest that environmental conditions influence the expression of multiple plastic sexual traits, depending on the costs and the information conveyed about different individual qualities.
   Although sexual signals are considered reliable indicators of individual quality, environmental heterogeneity may modulate their expression and reliability. We experimentally manipulated levels of intra-sexual competition in a wild population of red grouse by increasing testosterone levels using implants in a subset of males. We observed that the social context shapes the expression of sexual traits. In less competitive conditions, males performed shorter calls and call length was positively related to the size of the supra-orbital comb, a relevant secondary sexual trait. Under higher intra-sexual competition, this relationship was decoupled and investment was directed at increasing call length.

AB  - An assessment procedure for determining the ecological quality status of soft-sediment benthic habitats requires the following aspects: (1) habitat assignation of the samples (habitat approach), (2) reference or target conditions for the benthic parameters (reference approach), and (3) the selection of indicator tools to assess the relative quality status (indicator approach). For all these aspects, different approaches exist, and the indicator selection and reference approaches are largely documented. The aspect of the habitat approach is sometimes neglected, but is essential in determining the reference conditions per habitat type. Benthic habitats differ in structure and function, and as such will show wide variations in statistics or measures between habitats. A major problem, mainly in coastal soft-bottom systems, is to track the deviation lines within data of the different benthic habitat types. This study shows that both a classical community analysis and the use of habitat suitability maps seem to be appropriate tools, but further fine-tuning is necessary. For the second assessment step, an objective assessment of reference conditions is a challenge in areas lacking pristine or minimally disturbed sites, and areas of which historic data are not available. This can be remedied by using a dataset of the area with a good spatial and temporal coverage of the benthic data, thereby avoiding data originating from highly impacted areas. For the third aspect in the assessment procedure, we recommend the use of different indicators with different properties (parameters, algorithms) since it indicates their weaknesses and strengths in the local region.
   In general, this study showed us that it is valuable to test different existing approaches for EcoQ assessment in a local area, revealing strengths, weaknesses and shortcomings within the assessment regarding data, habitat identification, monitoring strategy, reference settings and indicator use. All these aspects need to be taken into account within an ecological quality status assessment of an area in order to improve its confidence. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Recent work on non-human primates indicates that the allocation of social attention is mediated by characteristics of the attending animal, such as social status and genotype, as well as by the value of the target to which attention is directed. Studies of humans indicate that an individual's emotion state also plays a crucial role in mediating their social attention; for example, individuals look for longer towards aggressive faces when they are feeling more anxious, and this bias leads to increased negative arousal and distraction from other ongoing tasks. To our knowledge, no studies have tested for an effect of emotion state on allocation of social attention in any non-human species.
   Methodology: We presented captive adult male rhesus macaques with pairs of adult male conspecific face images - one with an aggressive expression, one with a neutral expression - and recorded gaze towards these images. Each animal was tested twice, once during a putatively stressful condition (i.e. following a veterinary health check), and once during a neutral (or potentially positive) condition (i.e. a period of environmental enrichment). Initial analyses revealed that behavioural indicators of anxiety and stress were significantly higher after the health check than during enrichment, indicating that the former caused a negative shift in emotional state.
   Principle Findings: The macaques showed initial vigilance for aggressive faces across both conditions, but subsequent responses differed between conditions. Following the health check, initial vigilance was followed by rapid and sustained avoidance of aggressive faces. By contrast, during the period of enrichment, the macaques showed sustained attention towards the same aggressive faces.
   Conclusions/Significance: These data provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence that shifts in emotion state mediate social attention towards and away from facial cues of emotion in a non-human animal. This work provides novel insights into the evolution of emotion-attention interactions in humans, and mechanisms of social behaviour in non-human primates, and may have important implications for understanding animal psychological wellbeing.

AB  - The deep-sea hydrothermal vent mussel Bathymodiolus azoricus has been the subject of several studies aimed at understanding the physiological adaptations that vent animals have developed in order to cope with the particular physical and chemical conditions of hydrothermal environments. In spite of reports describing successful procedures to maintain vent mussels under laboratory conditions at atmospheric pressure, few studies have described the mussel's physiological state after a long period in aquaria. In the present study, we investigate changes in mucocytes and hemocytes in B. azoricus over the course of several months after deep-sea retrieval. The visualization of granules of mucopolysaccharide or glycoprotein was made possible through their inherent auto-fluorescent property and the Alcian blue-Periodic Acid Schiff staining method. The density and distribution of droplets of mucus-like granules was observed at the ventral end of lamellae during acclimatization period. The mucus-like granules were greatly reduced after 3 months and nearly absent after 6 months of aquarium conditions. Additionally, we examined the depletion of endosymbiont bacteria from gill tissues, which typically occurs within a few weeks in sea water under laboratory conditions. The physiological state of B. azoricus after 6 months of acclimatization was also examined by means of phagocytosis assays using hemocytes. Hemocytes from mussels held in aquaria up to 6 months were still capable of phagocytosis but to a lesser extent when Compared to the number of ingested yeast particles per phagocytic hemocytes from freshly collected vent mussels. We suggest that the changes in gill mucopolysaccharides and hemocyte glycoproteins, the endosymbiont abundance in gill tissues and phagocytosis are useful health criteria to assess long term maintenance of B. azoricus in aquaria. Furthermore, the laboratory set up to which vent mussels were acclimatized is an applicable system to study physiological reactions such as hemocyte immunocompetence even in the absence of the high hydrostatic pressure found at deep-sea vent sites.

AB  - Testing for coliforms has a long history in the dairy industry and has helped to identify raw milk and dairy products that may have been exposed to unsanitary conditions. Coliform standards are included in a number of regulatory documents (e.g., the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Grade "A" Pasteurized Milk Ordinance). As a consequence, detection above a threshold of members of this method-defined, but diverse, group of bacteria can result in a wide range of regulatory outcomes. Coliforms are defined as aerobic or facultatively anaerobic, Gram negative, non-sporeforming rods capable of fermenting lactose to produce gas and acid within 48 h at 32-35 degrees C; 19 genera currently include at least some strains that represent coliforms. Most bacterial genera that comprise the coliform group (e.g., Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Serratia) are within the family Enterobacteriaceae, while at least one genus with strains recognized as coliforms, Aeromonas, is in the family Aeromonadaceae. The presence of coliforms has long been thought to indicate fecal contamination, however, recent discoveries regarding this diverse group of bacteria indicates that only a fraction are fecal in origin, while the majority are environmental contaminants. In the US dairy industry in particular, testing for coliforms as indicators of unsanitary conditions and post processing contamination is widespread. While coliforms are easily and rapidly detected, and are not found in pasteurized dairy products that have not been exposed to post-processing contamination, advances in knowledge of bacterial populations most commonly associated with post-processing contamination in dairy foods has led to questions regarding the utility of coliforms as indicators of unsanitary conditions for dairy products. For example, Pseudomonas spp. frequently contaminate dairy products after pasteurization, yet they are not detected by coliform tests. This review will address the role that coliforms play in raw and finished dairy products, their sources and the future of this diverse group as indicator organisms in dairy products.

AB  - Purpose. To substantiate the prospects for oil and gas presence in the Lower Cretaceous sediments of the Karkinit-Northern Crimean deep based on hydrogeological (hydrogeochemical, gas-hydrogeochemical and geobaric) features.
   Methodology. Investigations of formation waters and water-dissolved gases were based on the methods of chemical, elementary spectral and gas chromatographic analyses executed at the laboratories of subsidiary joint-stock company "Chornomornaftogaz", subsidiary "Crimean Geology" and the Institute of Geology and Geochemistry of Combustible Minerals of NASU. For the comparison of formation pressure we applied the hydrostatic coefficient (C-h). C-h is the ratio of measured formation pressure to conditionally hydrostatic at the depth of the measuring with gamma=1.000 (P-f/P-ch), which eliminates the influence of uneven depths of measurement and different water densities, that is, to get the reduced value. For processing materials Excell, Corell Draw and Surfer are used.
   Results. Regional features of formation waters in the Lower Cretaceous complex as well as their chemical composition formation conditions are established. According to retrospective data analysis on the Crimean Plains, using the information received on the Black Sea shelf, we come to a conclusion that formation waters of the Lower Cretaceous complex are mainly sedimentogenic.
   The sulfate-natrium (S.Na) waters of the basal horizon and the Lower Cretaceous aquiferous complex most likely are infiltrative. This is evidenced by the decrease in the indicators of metamorphism of rCa/rMg, r(Cl-Na)/rMg and the increase in Cl/Br to over 1000, the lowered content of iodine (J) and bromine (Br). Infiltrative (paleoinfiltrative) waters mixed with primary sedimentogenic waters. This was accompanied by the decrease in their mineralization and thalassogenic trace elements contents in them. Modern infiltration from the land of meteoric waters at depths of more than 2000-3000 meters through the hydrodynamic barriers of the elision water drive system is impossible, but it could be realized at the continental infiltration stages of the foreground development and before the late Cretaceous time. This is evidenced by the continuous continental conditions marked by denudation of rocks.
   The main processes in the chemical composition formation of formation waters of Cretaceous and Lower Cretaceous complexes could have been: leaching rocks, mixing of infiltrative fresh or saline waters with thalassogenic waters; mixing of these waters with waters of the high temperature (>200 degrees C) dehydration of clay rocks with formation of non-infiltrative (S.Na) and (Hyd.Car.Na) waters.
   Based on the analysis of the hydrostatic coeficient distribution (C-h) in the basal and Lower Cretaceous aquiferous complexes the existence of the elision water pressure system within the Karkinit-Northern Crimean deep is confirmed. The cause of overhydrostatic pressures is most likely to be the dehydration of clay rocks and the intrusion of deep gases.
   Geobaric conditions and filtration parameters suggest that the water flows of the elision water pressure system can move from the deepest parts of the Karkinit-Northern Crimean deep towards its sides.
   Originality and practical significance. The nature and forming conditions of formation waters have been substantiated. According to gas-hydrogeochemical and geobaric features it was possible to distinguish localities promising for hydrocarbon prospecting in the Lower Cretaceous deposits.

AB  - A controversial aspect of Pliocene (5.3-2.6 Ma) climate is whether El Nino-like (El Padre) conditions, characterized by a reduced trans-equatorial sea-surface temperature (SST) gradient, prevailed across the Pacific. Evidence for El Padre is chiefly based on reconstructions of sea-surface conditions derived from the oxygen isotope (delta O-18) and Mg/Ca compositions of shells belonging to the planktic foraminiferTrilobatus sacculifer. However, fossil shells of this species are a mixture of multiple carbonate phases-pre-gametogenic, gametogenic (reproductive), and diagenetic calcites-that formed under different physiological and/or environmental conditions and are averaged in conventional whole-shell analyses. Through in situ measurements of micrometer-scale domains within Pliocene-aged shells ofT. sacculiferfrom Ocean Drilling Program Site 806 in the western equatorial Pacific, we show that the delta O-18 of gametogenic calcite is 0.6-0.8 parts per thousand higher than pre-gametogenic calcite, while the Mg/Ca ratios of these two phases are the same. Both the whole-shell and pre-gametogenic Mg/Ca records indicate that average early Pliocene SSTs were similar to 1 degrees C warmer than modern, with present-day SSTs being established during the latest Pliocene and early Pleistocene (similar to 3.0-2.0 Ma). The measurement of multiple calcite phases by whole-shell delta O-18 analyses masks a late Pliocene to earliest Pleistocene (3.6-2.2 Ma) decrease in seawater delta O-18 (delta O-18(sw)) values reconstructed from in situ pre-gametogenic delta O-18 and Mg/Ca measurements. Our novel delta(18)O(sw)record indicates that sea-surface salinities in the west Pacific warm pool were higher than modern prior to similar to 3.5 Ma, which is consistent with more arid conditions under an El Padre state.
   Plain Language Summary The Pliocene (5.3-2.6 million years ago) is the most recent time in Earth history when atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations may have been modern-like and the continents were in their current configuration. Thus, Pliocene climate reconstructions are considered a useful indicator of future conditions. Several Pliocene reconstructions from the equatorial Pacific argue for a sea-surface temperature distribution that resembles modern El Nino events. Relevant to this study, modern El Nino events also produce drier conditions in the western equatorial Pacific. We investigate Pliocene permanent El Nino, or El Padre, in the west Pacific by using paired oxygen isotope and Mg/Ca measurements of marine microfossils (foraminifera) to reconstruct the oxygen isotope composition of surface water (delta O-18(sw)), which tracks sea-surface salinity. In situ analyses were used to measure tiny spots within individual shells of Trilobatus sacculifer to target only domains formed near the sea surface. These measurements indicate that the early Pliocene west Pacific was drier than today, which is similar to modern El Nino events and consistent with El Padre. The in situ-based delta O-18(sw) trend toward modern sea-surface salinities is not reconstructed by whole-shell measurements primarily due to the life cycle of T. sacculifer, which produces large oxygen isotope variability within individual shells.

AB  - Purpose. We investigated secondary serpentines in order to reconstruct the geodynamic conditions of the formation and transformations of the peridotites (Uholskyi complex), which are localized in the Marmarosh rocky zone in the Inner Eastern Ukrainian Carpathians and are most widely spread in the interfluve of Velyka and Mala Uholka-rivers. Methods. The work is based on the results of geological observations of the Uholskyi complex rocks in natural outcrops, as well as petrographic, mineralogical (including X-ray diffraction, thermal and microprobe analysis), and geochemical studies. For comparison, literary data on peridotites of the Ukrainian Carpathians and some studied in detail orogenic peridotite complexes have been used. Results. Peridotites form olistoliths in the Soimulska olistostrome-conglomerate strata (K-1) of the Marmarosh rocky zone (Vezhanskyi nappe) of the Inner Ukrainian Carpathians. The age of olistoliths of the Uholskyi complex peridotites of the Soimulska suite is T-2-K-1 (?). The rocks of the Uholskyi complex are represented by serpentinous peridotites and serpentinites. The metamorphic transformations of peridotites are revealed in the significant distribution of alpha-and beta-lizardite and antigorite. Two groups have been identified among the studied serpentines. Serpentines of the first group have a lenticular-looped texture and are mainly represented by alpha-lizardite and bastite, which have high chromium content and contain large non-altered grains of chrome-spinellids. Serpentines of the second group have a striped-shale texture; they are represented mainly by beta-lizardite and antigorite, which have high iron content and contain powdered particles of magnetite. Serpentines of the first group were formed under the conditions of regressive metamorphism of the greenschist facies upper part, which occurred under the geodynamic conditions of the spreading zone during raising and cooling of peridotites. Serpentines of the second group have the characteristics (albeit local) of progressive metamorphism of the lower greenschist-upper epidote-amphibolite facies. They were formed under the supersubduction conditions and confined to fragments of paleozones of shear-plastic deformations. This was accompanied by subduction-collision events between the terrains of Dacia and Tisza in the Jurassic-Early Cretaceous, which led to the closure of the TransylvanianMures paleocean. Selected groups of serpentines, which differ in mineral, chemical composition and structural and texture peculiarities, belong also to various geodynamic and genetic groups: the first tend to primary mantle protoliths of the ultrabasic composition, and the second - to lithospheric protoliths of the basic composition. Scientific novelty. The research of serpentines, which developed on the peridotites of the Uholskyi complex, made it possible to divide them into two groups whose representatives have different thermodynamic and geodynamic history. It is determined that structural, textural, mineral, and other features of serpentines are the indicators of geodynamic conditions for the transformation of peridotites of the Marmarosh rocky zone as well as other regions. A model of the phased transformation of the Uholskyi complex peridotites has been proposed. Practical value.
   The study of serpentinites developed on peridotites of the Uholskyi complex is important for the determination of the types of metamorphism in primitive mantle protoliths and the stage of formation of foldcovering structures lithosphere (on the example of the Ukrainian Carpathians). The obtained results can be used for prediction of serpentinite mineralization, since lizardite rocks (group 1) contain elements of the platinum group, and antigorite rocks (group 2) - magnetite.

AB  - Fire disturbance severely modifies ecosystem structure and functioning, and therefore predicting post-fire responses is pivotal to improve land management. Indicators that efficiently link post-fire recovery with a timely decision on landscape management can play a key role in the governance of fire risk. We describe a framework to evaluate post-fire recovery based on remotely-sensed measures of relative vegetation recovery, calculated from satellite NDVI time-series. Three indicators are proposed: the novel Cumulative Relative Recovery Index (CRRI), measuring the (mid-long term) extent and completeness of recovery; the Recovery Trend Index (RTI), measuring the steepness of the mid-term post-fire recovery trend; and the Half Recovery Time index (HRT), a measure of the short-term recovery rate. We used Random Forest (RF) models to predict the observed recovery patterns and ranked the predictive importance of several candidate explanatory factors. The performance of RF models ranged from good (CRRI, RTI) to moderate (HRT). Three sets of predictive variables consistently ranked higher: fire traits, landscape composition, and post-fire climatic conditions. The relative contribution of individual variables was different across recovery indicators. These results show that proposed indicators seem to capture different facets of the post-fire recovery process. The short-term recovery indicator (HRT) was linked to landscape composition and post-fire climate. Thus, HRT expresses the speed of initial recovery, related to differences in fire-response traits of vegetation and to climatic conditions immediately following fire. The mid-term recovery indicator (RTI) was mainly influenced by fire traits and post-fire climatic conditions. This indicator captures multiple interacting effects that shape the recovery process related to fire severity, vegetation type and post-fire conditions. Finally, the long-term recovery indicator (CRRI) was clearly more influenced by fire attributes related to severity than by vegetation type and structure or by post-fire climatic conditions. Overall, our results suggest that a combination of biotic processes (driven by plant life-history traits) and abiotic filters (e.g., post fire climate) determine the early post-fire recovery process. Conversely, the mid to long-term recovery response (expressing its completeness) is driven by the depletion of resilience capacity and by the amount of change in vegetation structure and functioning modulated by spatial differences in fire severity. Our results strongly suggest that an indicator-based approach grounded on satellite time-series of vegetation indices can effectively cover various facets of post-fire recovery. This will improve the monitoring and prediction of post-fire recovery dynamics, with valuable applications in fire hazard management and post-fire ecosystem restoration and monitoring.

AB  - Background: Subclinical mastitis is an important cause of economic losses in dairy cows in Rio Grande do Sul state (southern Brazil) because the deleterious effect on the health of the cow and on the quality of milk. The difficulty of early diagnosis of this problem had led to the study of early indicators of inflammatory conditions, as acute phase proteins, mainly haptoglobin and fibrinogen, in the case of bovines. The aim of this work was to study the relationship between plasma values of haptoglobin (Hp) and fibrinogen in dairy cows with somatic cell counting (SCC) in milk for testing the hypothesis that Hp or fibrinogen would be adequate early indicators of subclinical mastitis.
   Materials, Methods & Results: Milk and blood samples were collected in cows of herds from Rio Grande do Sul. Three groups of 50 cows each were separated according to milk SCC. Samples of group 1 (healthy mammary gland) had SCC below 600.000 cell/mL, samples of group 2 (subclinical mastitis) had SCC above 600.000 cell/mL without any signal of clinical mastitis and group 3 (clinical mastitis) was compound by samples from cows showing evident clinical signs of mastitis. Additionally, total bacterial count (TBC) and concentration of lactose, fat, protein and total solids were determined in milk using infrared spectrophotometer. Blood samples were collected by venipunction of the coccigeal vein for analysis of fibrinogen and Hp. Fibrinogen was determined by the heat precipitation method and Hp by a spectrophometric method. The results showed lower concentration of lactose, fat and total solids and higher concentration of protein in milk samples of cows with mastitis. Fibrinogen and Hp values were higher in the mastitis group, but no differences were observed between healthy and subclinical mastitis groups. Significant correlation coefficients were observed between plasma fibrinogen and milk SCC (r = 0.27) and between plasma Hp and milk SCC (r = 0.357).
   Discussion: The health condition of the mammary gland and therefore the somatic cell counting is determinant in the composition of milk so that an inflammatory condition may lead to decreasing values of lactose and fat as well as increment in total protein. Decrease in lactose and fat composition of milk have been reported in many works as a function of the deleterious effect of inflammation on the mammary tissue. Increase in milk total protein must be a direct effect of the inflammatory process, represented by somatic cells, bacteria and other substances leaking from the injured secretory tissue. The lack of difference of the plasma concentrations of haptoglobin and fibrinogen between subclinical mastitis and healthy mammary gland hinders the possibility of discriminating cows with the subclinical condition of the problem. Hp in plasma samples belonging to cows of low milk SCC is probably augmented by other factors than an inflammatory condition. The present study did not prove a clear usefulness for using plasma values of Hp for diagnosing subclinical mastitis in dairy cows. However, the significant correlation coefficient obtained between plasma Hp and milk SCC are worth of exploring more aspects of the relationships among acute phase proteins, clinical and subclinical mastitis condition and quality of milk.

AB  - Background, Aims and Scope. Dredged materials because of its variable but unique physical and chemical properties are often viewed by society and regulators as pollutants, but many have used these materials in coastal nourishment, land or wetland creation, construction materials, and for soil improvement as a soil amendment. Environmental impact assessment is an important pre-requisite to many dredging initiatives. The ability to reuse lake-dredge materials (LDM) for agricultural purposes is important because it reduces the need for offshore disposal and provides an alternative to disposal of the materials in landfills. Additional research on disposal options of dredged materials are much needed to supply information on criteria testing and evaluation of the physical and chemical impacts of dredged materials at a disposal site, as well as information on many other aspects of dredging and dredged material disposal. While preliminary efforts are underway to provide information to establish criteria for land disposal, testing procedures for possible land disposal of contaminated sediments are still in their developing stage. The objective of this study (Part 1) was to quantify the effect of applied LDM from Lake Panasoffkee (LP), Florida on soil physico-chemical properties (soil quality) at the disposal site. This series of two papers aims at providing assessment of the efficacy of lake-dredged materials from LP especially its implication to environment (soil quality, Part 1) and agriculture (forage quality and pasture establishment, Part 2).
   Methods. The experimental treatments that were evaluated consisted of different ratios of natural soil (NS) to LDM: LDM0 (100% NS:0% LDM); LDM25 (75% NS:25% LDM); LDM50 (50% NS:50% LDM); LDM75 (25% NS:75% LDM); and LDM100 (0% NS:100% LDM). Field layout was based on the principle of a completely randomized block design with four replications. The Mehlich 1 method (0.05 (N) under bar HCl in 0.025 (N) under bar H2SO4) was used for chemical extraction of soil. Soil P and other exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, K, Al, and Fe) were analyzed using an Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) Spectroscopy. The effects of dredged materials addition on soil quality and compaction were analyzed statistically following the PROC ANOVA procedures.
   Results and Discussion. Sediments that were dredged from LP have high CaCO3 content (82%) and when these materials were incorporated into existing topsoil they would have the same favorable effects as liming the field. Thus, sediments with high CaCO3 may improve the physical and chemical conditions of subtropical sandy pastures. The heavy and trace metal contents of LDM were below the probable effect levels (PEL) and threshold effect levels (TEL). Average values for Pb, Zn, As, Cu, Hg, Se, Cd, and Ni of 5.2 +/- 1.3, 7.0 +/- 0.6, 4.4 +/- 0.1, 8.7 +/- 1.2, 0.01 +/- 0.02, 0.02 +/- 0.02, 2.5 +/- 0.1, and 14.6 +/- 6.4 mg kg(-1), respectively, were below the TEL and the PEL. TEL represents the concentrations of sediment-associated contaminants that are considered to cause significant hazards to aquatic organisms, while, PEL represents the lower limit of the range of the contaminant concentrations that are usually or always associated with adverse biological effects. As such, the agricultural or livestock industry could utilize these LDM to produce forages. LDM should be regarded as a beneficial resource, as a part of the ecological system. Addition of LDM had significant (p less than or equal to 0.001) effects on soil physico-chemical properties and soil quality. Compared with the control plots, the soils in plots amended with LDM exhibited: (1) lower degree of soil compaction; (2) an increase in soil pH, Ca, and Mg; (3) decrease in the levels of soil Mn, Cu, Fe, Zn, and Si; and (4) no significant change in the level of Na in the soil. Results have shown the favorable influence that LDM had on soil compaction. The treatment x year interaction effect was not significant, but the average soil compaction varied widely (p: 0.001) with LDM application. In 2002 and 2003, soil compaction of plots was lowered significantly as a result of LDM additions. The least compacted soils in 2002 and 2003 were observed from plots with LDM75 with mean soil compaction of 300 x 10(3) and 350 x 10(3) Pa, respectively.
   Conclusion. Beneficial uses of dredged materials from LP, Florida are both economical and environmental. Often these materials can be obtained at little or no cost to the farmers or landowners in south Florida. Environmentally, dredging of sediments that are rich in CaCO3 should restore the 19.4-sq km LP by removing natural sediments from the lake bottom to improve the fishery, water quality, and navigation of the lake. The bottom sediment materials from lakes, river, and navigational channels usually are composed of upland soil enriched with nutrients and organic matter. These materials should be regarded as a beneficial resource to be used productively and not to be discarded as spoil materials.
   Recommendation and Outlook. Land application of LDM from LP may not only provide substantial benefits that will enhance the environment, community, and society in south Florida, but also in other parts of the world especially those areas having tropical and subtropical climate with forage-based beef cattle pastures. The heavy and trace metal contents of LDM from LP were below the PEL and TEL. As such, the agricultural or livestock industry could utilize these LDM to produce forages (Part 2 of this study). LDM should be regarded as a beneficial resource, as a part of the ecological system. Further studies are still needed to determine whether the environmental and ecological implications of LDM application are satisfied over the longer term.

AB  - Jiuzhaigou, characterized by its magnificent waterscapes and subalpine karstic features, is both a World Heritage Site and a World Biosphere Reserve in southwestern China. In recent years, this unique ecosystem has shown signs of stress due to increasing tourism activities within the reserve. The various routine methods, which monitor physical and chemical properties, do not fully reflect water quality in the subalpine and alpine lakes, while the indicators using aquatic organisms to evaluate the water quality or status of the subalpine lakes are poorly reported. Thus, in this study, benthic diatoms from multiple habitats in Jiuzhaigou were sampled and assessed for water quality monitoring. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed that the canonical coefficients for elevation, water temperature and total nitrogen on the first Canonical Correspondence Analysis axis were -0.84, 0.78 and -0.53, respectively, environmental variables associated with the distribution patterns of benthic diatoms. The dominance of diatom taxa indicative of nutrient enrichment indicates a clear trend toward eutrophication in the Pearl Shoal and Colorful Lake, two of the sites mostly visited by tourists. It was observed that the effect of the type of substratum on diatom community composition is not significant in subalpine lakes. The most dominant species in Jiuzhaigou lakes are the genera Achnanthes, Fragilaria, Cymbella, Cocconeis, Diatoma and Denticula. In combination with dominant and sensitive species in the benthic diatom communities, CCA and CA methods can be used to evaluate the impact of human activities on subalpine karstic lakes. The dominance of diatom taxa is indicative of nutrient enrichment and the results of CCA and CA indicate a clear trend toward eutrophication in the Pearl Shoal and Colorful Lake, two of the sites mostly visited by tourists.

AB  - Coagulation-precipitation techniques have been used successfully in the remediation of arsenic (As) contamination, but insufficient data exist to evaluate the side effects on lake environments (especially secondary pollution). Yangzonghai Lake, a deep lake located in southwest China that was treated with flocculants after an accident resulted in As-contamination, was selected as a case study. We attempted to elucidate how As migrates and transforms in the lake based on water simulation experiments. The results were expected to facilitate evaluation of the suitability and safety of the technology when used in a natural water body. The results showed that the As that had already been precipitated into the sediment by FeCl3 would be released again into the water body due to the increasing activity of anaerobic microorganisms, thereby causing secondary pollution. This phenomenon was especially evident during summer because water temperature stratification reduced the dissolved oxygen (DO) at the sediment surface and led to anaerobic conditions, which enhanced the anaerobic activity at the bottom of the lake. In summer, the concentration of As in the water column increased with increasing depth. In contrast, during winter, the concentration of As was quite similar at all depths of the lake because the water temperature was uniform during this period. As was released from sediments to the aqueous phase in the form of trivalent As [As(III)] upon anaerobic incubation and was oxidized gradually into pentavalent As [As(V)], by the higher DO in the upper layers of the lake water. Contrary to expectation, the disturbance (turnover in the fall) did not increase, but rather decreased the As concentration in the lake, which might result in further coagulation and precipitation through intensive mixture of the unsaturated flocculants from the sediments.

AB  - Specific land uses, many of them considered as traditional practices, have contributed to nature conservation in that they have given rise to a valued landscape and a high degree of biological and cultural diversity. The result is the rural cultural landscape, also characterised by its multi-functionality, stability and adaptation to local conditions. Nonetheless, the abandonment of rural cultural landscapes constitutes the current trend in many regions.
   Although one way to preserve rural cultural landscapes involves establishing protected areas, management often forgets, or even restricts, the traditional rural activities that had contributed to the high conservation values recognised in these areas.
   In the present paper we applied a quantitative model to examine changes in rural cultural landscapes and in the socioeconomy of local populations following the establishment of a protected area. We formalised the relationship of dependence between landscape change and socioeconomy by means of multivariate ordination analysis and multiple regression calculation. The simple equation obtained shows the socioeconomic parameters that best account for change in the landscape and indicate their sign and importance. The results show that providing Regional Park protection status has not prevented the decline of traditional farming activities and, in turn, ecological succession has led to an intense shrub encroachment process. Such a change could be considered to be the result of a nature protection policy inspired by ideas of naturalness and wilderness. Our model also helps us to establish and formalise the dependence of the cultural landscape upon a socio-cultural system, which is currently undergoing rapid change, and brings us to consider the parameters of this change as indicators for management.

AB  - 1. The Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires member states to establish 'type-specific biological reference conditions' for the assessment of surface waters and describes a method for establishing such biological targets. The methodology described in the Directive is based oil geographic and physical characteristics and similar to the 'multimetric' approach used widely in North America, but contrasts with the biological classification of the 'Multivariate' approach which is commonly used in Europe.
   2. An investigation was made of the relative efficiency of the multimetric and multivariate classification approaches in partitioning the observed biological variation of the macroinvertebrate communities of 22minimally disturbed lakes in Northern Ireland. Furthermore, the accuracy of predictive models based on the two approaches was compared.
   3. The WFD environmental typologies partitioned the observed biological variation poorly with a maximum ANOSIM R-value of 0.216 compared with 0.609 for a multivariate biological site classification. The WFD System B approach partitioned. more variation than the System A approach.
   4. The use of a predictive model, based on any of the site classification approaches, resulted in more accurate faunal predictions than a null model. However, the biological model produced the most accurate predictions.
   5. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that the environmental variables used in the biological classification model explained more variation (28%) than the best-performing environmental classification model (24%). The most important variable was pH, followed by surface area and altitude. The variables used in all approaches explained more variation when used as continuous rather than categorized parameters.
   6. The results of this work, the first such comparative study of predictive models in lakes, concur with similar studies in streams. It may be concluded that large-scale environmental classifications are

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) storage is an indicator of environmental quality for mineral soils because of the influence that organic matter has on key functional properties, such as fertility, soil structure and water relations. Historically, agricultural management has caused large losses of SOC relative to native ecosystems, leading to degradation. However, new technologies and conservation practices have been developed during the past few decades that can enhance SOC storage, and thus improve environmental quality. Our objective was to describe a national inventory procedure to estimate SOC storage for purposes of monitoring environmental quality. The major steps in this procedure include: (1) model selection/development, (2) model verification, (3) identification of model input data, (4) uncertainty assessment, (5) model implementation, and (6) validation of results. Applying this approach With a simple C accounting method, the upper 30 cm of US agricultural soils were estimated to have accumulated 10.8 Tg C yr(-1) between 1982 and 1997, with an uncertainty of +/- 40%. A simple index was developed to relate estimated SOC stocks to the potential amounts under native conditions and conventional agricultural management. An index value of 0% on the proposed scale would be equivalent to the SOC under conventional agricultural use, while an index value of 100% would be equivalent to native levels. With an estimated 1997 stock of 22400 Tg C, the index value for US agricultural soils was about 60%. Using this inventory procedure, environmental issues related to soil, water and air quality could be informed by SOC in combination with other key indicators, in addition to using the inventory for evaluating sustainability of agricultural lands for food and fiber production.

The survey also included other taxa and the motivation for it was to identify a species or group of species that could be used as indicators of management success for Protected Area Credits (PAC) under the Rainforest Standards (RFSTM) system. Four major ecosystems, moist forest, deciduous monsoon forest, savanna and an abandoned Teak plantation, were sampled over a period of 10 days, using belt transects and pitfall traps. We measured species richness, abundance and density, herpetofaunal diversity (Simpson's Index of Dominance and the Shannon Weiner Index) and community similarity. We also estimated the indicator value to determine which species, if any, might be suitable as indicators of environmental conditions. The survey yielded 30 species, 12 frogs and toads, 7 snakes and 11 lizards. Out of them there is an endangered gecko, Cyrtodactylus jatnai, a vulnerable frog, Microhyla orientalis, and a vulnerable tree-skink, Cryptoblepharus baliensis. Diversity was highest in the moist forest, followed closely by both the deciduous forest and the savanna. The greatest abundance was found in the savanna, followed by the moist forest and then the deciduous forest. Both diversity and abundance were extremely low in the abandoned teak plantation. Eleven species were identified as potential indicators of environmental deterioration if their numbers were to decrease. Frogs and toads were the best indicators in the moist forest, while lizards were the most suitable indicators for savanna and deciduous forest. No snakes were identified as indicators. It is concluded that herpetofauna can be useful and cost-effective indicators of environmental change. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. CC_BY_4.0

AB  - Vegetation phenology is an indicator of vegetation response to natural environmental changes and is of great significance for the study of global climate change and its impact on terrestrial ecosystems. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), extracted from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), are widely used to monitor phenology by calculating land surface reflectance. However, the applicability of the vegetation index based on 'greenness' to monitor photosynthetic activity is hindered by poor observation conditions (e.g., ground shadows, snow, and clouds). Recently, satellite measurements of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from OCO-2 sensors have shown great potential for studying vegetation phenology. Here, we tested the feasibility of SIF in extracting phenological metrics in permafrost regions of the northeastern China, exploring the characteristics of SIF in the study of vegetation phenology and the differences between NDVI and EVI. The results show that NDVI has obvious SOS advance and EOS lag, and EVI is closer to SIF. The growing season length based on SIF is often the shortest, while it can represent the true phenology of vegetation because it is closely related to photosynthesis. SIF is more sensitive than the traditional remote sensing indices in monitoring seasonal changes in vegetation phenology and can compensate for the shortcomings of traditional vegetation indices. We also used the time series data of MODIS NDVI and EVI to extract phenological metrics in different permafrost regions. The results show that the length of growing season of vegetation in predominantly continuous permafrost (zone I) is longer than in permafrost with isolated taliks (zone II). Our results have certain significance for understanding the response of ecosystems in cold regions to global climate change.

AB  - Crustaceans are major constituents of aquatic ecosystems and, as such, changes in their behavior and the structure and function of their bodies can serve as indicators of alterations in their immediate environment, such as those associated with climate change and anthropogenic contamination. We have used bioinformatics and a de novo transcriptome assembly approach to identify potential targets for developing specific antibodies to serve as nervous system function markers for freshwater prawns of the Macrobrachium spp. Total RNA was extracted from brain ganglia of Macrobrachium carcinus freshwater prawns and Illumina Next Generation Sequencing was performed using an Eel Pond mRNA Seq Protocol to construct a de novo transcriptome. Sequencing yielded 97,202,662 sequences: 47,630,546 paired and 1,941,570 singletons. Assembly with Trinity resulted in 197,898 assembled contigs from which 30,576 were annotated: 9,600 by orthology, 17,197 by homology, and 3,779 by transcript families. We looked for glutamate receptors contigs, due to their main role in crustacean excitatory neurotransmission, and found 138 contigs related to ionotropic receptors, 32 related to metabotropic receptors, and 18 to unidentified receptors. After performing multiple sequence alignments within different biological organisms and antigenicity analysis, we were able to develop antibodies for prawn AMPA ionotropic glutamate receptor 1, metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 and 4, and ionotropic NMDA glutamate receptor subunit 2B, with the expectation that the availability of these antibodies will help broaden knowledge regarding the underlying structural and functional mechanisms involved in prawn behavioral responses to environmental impacts. The Macrobrachium carcinus brain transcriptome can be an important tool for examining changes in many other nervous system molecules as a function of developmental stages, or in response to particular conditions or treatments.

AB  - Maximizing food production for feeding a rapidly growing human population while minimizing critical resource use and soil quality degradation is a major challenge for global sustainability. Sustainable agricultural practices based on low-external input is of paramount importance for reducing environmental trade-offs and planet healthy food production. Therefore, a critical assessment was made on viable low-input technologies aimed to reduce the negative effects of agricultural production as well as the use of various crop simulation models for forecasting the agricultural production under changing climatic scenario. While crop simulation models are helpful for predicting the growth and yield of individual crops under current as well as futuristic scenarios, it is difficult to model the response of multiple cropping systems under changing climatic conditions. As a matter of fact, the developing countries, majorly dependent on agriculture are most vulnerable to climate change. The increasing price of agrochemicals is another setback for subsistence farmers in resource-poor nations. In this backdrop, the current review aimed to assess the impact of climate change on agriculture, and the role of low input sustainable agriculture (LISA) for ensuring the food security while safeguarding the critical natural resources for human-wellbeing and also for attaining UN-Sustainable Development Goals. In addition, evidence-based impacts of LISA in emerging economies from Africa and South Asia are highlighted and suitable ecological indicators for measuring the sustainability of such LISA are addressed in brief. We conclude that the large-scale implementation of LISA will facilitate agricultural sustainability, and therefore, suitable policy frameworks are imperative for its worldwide adoption.

AB  - The Adyar estuary is one of the highly productive transitional zones of southeast India, situated in the southern part of Chennai city and acts as a nursery ground for several endemic flora and fauna. Since few decades, due to anthropogenic activities,indiscriminate dumping and discharge of domestic and industrial wastes and pollutants has environmentally damaged the Adyar estuary lowering many of its ecological and socio-economic attributes. In order to mitigate further environmental damage and to restore it to its earlier pristine condition, the Government and several non-Governmental agencies have undertaken ecological restoration measures to enhance its ecology and diversity. In order to evaluate the restoration process, our present study attempts to assess the diversity and abundance of zooplankton population in the restored and non-restored parts of the Adyar creek and estuary. 34 species belonging to 12 zooplankton groups from 4 stations of the Adyar creek and estuary were recorded. Copepods and rotifers were the dominant groups of zooplankton in Adyar estuary. The overall density of zooplankton from 4 stations ranged between 11.5 +/- 4.39 and 23,046.67 +/- 2872.68 Ind l(-1). In general, Adyar estuary recorded higher zooplankton abundance than creek. The relative percentage composition was maximum for rotifers with 85.67% at Station-IV. Copepods dominated Station-I, whereas rotifers dominated the other 3 stations. Overall results indicate that the restoration activities had beneficial effect on the hydrological parameters and in increasing the diversity of zooplankton in the restored part of the Adyar creek and estuary compared to the non-restored part. Ecological indices have been used to assess the present status of the restored and non-restored parts in the Adyar creek and estuary.

AB  - Agricultural practices affect the soil ecosystem in multiple ways and the soil microbial communities represent an integrated and dynamic measure of soil status. Our aim was to test whether the soil bacterial community and the relative abundance of major bacterial phyla responded predictably to long-term organic amendments representing different carbon qualities (peat and straw) in combination with nitrogen fertilization levels and if certain bacterial groups were indicative of specific treatments. We hypothesized that the long-term treatments had created distinctly different ecological niches for soil bacteria, suitable for either fast-growing copiotrophic bacteria, or slow-growing oligotrophic bacteria. Based on terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism of the 16S rRNA genes from the total soil bacterial community and taxa-specific quantitative real-time PCR of seven different groups, all treatments significantly affected the community structure, but nitrogen fertilization was the most important driver for changes in the relative abundances of the studied taxa. According to an indicator species analysis, the changes were largely explained by the decline in the relative abundances of Acidobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes and Verrucomicrobia with nitrogen fertilization. Conditions more favourable for copiotrophic life strategies were indicated in these plots by the decreased metabolic quotient, i.e. the ratio between basal respiration rate and soil biomass. Apart from the Alphaproteobacteria that were significantly associated with peat, no taxa were indicative of organic amendment in general. However, several significant indicators of both peat and straw were identified among the terminal restriction fragments suggesting that changes induced by the organic amendments were mainly manifested at a lower taxonomical level. Our findings strengthen the proposition that certain higher bacterial taxa adapt in an ecologically coherent way in response to changes induced by fertilization. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The main goal was to understand the dynamic process of vegetation colonizing an area degraded by the extraction of gold. The study area was stratified into three environments and, in each environment, contiguous ten plots of 100m(2) each were allocated. For the realization of the dynamics, two surveys of shrub-tree with level of inclusion (DAS(30) > 3 cm) were carried out. The first one was realized in 2008 and second in 2010. In 2010, the new individuals that met the criterion for inclusion ( recruits) were marked and measured, the dead registered and the survivors were measured again. The rates of mortality, recruitment, gain and loss in basal area of each environment were calculated and it became evident the importance of dynamics as a tool to help understand the relationships of ecological succession of species. The Shannon diversity index among the three environments were compared by t-test of Hutcheson and it was used the analysis of indicator species to determine species preferences of each of the three pre-determined environments. The total number of individuals passed of 707 to 909 in two years of interval, reinforcing the importance of natural regeneration processes of ecological succession. The environment II remained the most abundant one despite it presented a high mortality rate, which can be explained by the high rate of recruitment. The species Eremanthus incanus, Trembleya laniflora, Trembleya parviflora, Roupala montana, Coccoloba brasiliensis and Tibouchina candoleana, presented higher importance of value in the two surveys, showing superiority in the colonization of the area degraded by the extraction of gold and could be indicated in programs for the recuperation of degraded areas that are in similar conditions in the region of Diamantina municipality.

AB  - The Southern Ocean supports diverse and unique ecosystems that have been impacted by more than two centuries of exploitation and are now experiencing rapid changes in ocean temperature and seasonal ice cover due to climate warming. Understanding and projecting responses of Southern Ocean marine ecosystems to changing climate conditions and direct human impacts, such as fisheries, requires integrated ecosystem analyses at scales previously unexplored. Here we consider the main ecological and modelling challenges in predicting the responses of Southern Ocean ecosystems to change, and propose three inter-linked focus areas that will advance the development of integrated models for Southern Ocean ecosystems. The first focus area is development of fundamental understanding of the factors that determine the structure and function of the food webs at multiple scales. Ecological research in the Southern Ocean is often centred on key species or localised systems, a tendency which is reflected in existing food web and ecosystem models. To build on this, a systematic analysis of regional food web structure and function is required. The second focus area is development of a range of mechanistic models that vary in their resolution of ecological processes, and consider links across physical scales, biogeochemical cycles and feedbacks, and the central role of zooplankton. These two focus areas underlie the third, which is development of methodologies for scenario testing across a range of trophic levels of the effects of past and future changes, which will facilitate consideration of the underlying complexity of interactions and the associated uncertainty. The complex nature of interactions determining Southern Ocean ecosystem structure and function will require new approaches, which we propose should be developed within a scale-based framework that emphasises both physical and ecological aspects.

AB  - The study of adaptive genetic variation in natural populations is central to evolutionary biology. Quantitative genetics methods, however, are hardly applicable to long-lived organisms, and current knowledge on adaptive genetic variation in wild plants mostly refers to annuals and short-lived perennials. Studies on long-lived species are essential to explore possible life-history correlates of genetic variation, selection, and trait heritability. In this paper, we propose a method based on molecular markers to quantify the genetic basis of individual phenotypic differences in wild plants under natural conditions. Rather than focusing on inferring individual relatedness to estimate the heritability of phenotypic traits, we directly estimate the proportion of observed phenotypic variance that is statistically accounted for by genotypic differences between individuals. This is achieved by (i) identifying loci that are correlated across individuals with the phenotypic trait of interest by means of an amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)-based explorative genomic scan, and (ii) fitting multiple regression and linear random effect models to estimate the effects of genotype, environment and genotype x environment on phenotypes. We apply this method to estimate genotypic and environmental effects on cumulative maternal fecundity in a wild population of the long-lived Viola cazorlensis monitored for 20 years. Results show that between 56-63% (depending on estimation method) of phenotypic variance in fecundity is accounted for by genotypic differences in 11 AFLP loci that are significantly related to fecundity. Genotype x environment effects accounted for 38% of fecundity variance, which may help to explain the unexpectedly high levels of genetic variance for fecundity found.

AB  - As a self-organizing multi-hop network system, a wireless sensor network is composed of many low-cost micro sensor nodes used in the field of wireless communication monitoring. Wireless sensor networks are advanced scientific and technological achievements jointly created by the coordinated development of sensor technology and micro-electromechanical systems. The sensor network effectively connects the scientific and technological information network and the real society and transforms the interaction mode between people and the natural society. Their impact on humans can be compared with the impact of the Internet. Wireless sensors are one of the most innovative technologies that have changed the world. The temperature in the city is usually greater than that in the suburbs, and the humidity is less than that in the suburbs. And the differences within cities are also great. The temperature and humidity in different regions are also caused by differences in building floor area ratios and urban land use conditions. Urban green plants can improve the environment and improve air quality. It plays a very important role in today's urban thermal insulation effect is decreasing. Studying the relationship between green urban plants and urban thermal insulation is the basic starting point of this article. According to the role and principle of urban green space in reducing urban thermal temperature, this paper proposes an ecological assessment framework and method for green urban space and conducts a quantitative study on the effect of urban green space cooling. For English distance learning, some high-quality educational resources can be tilted to the vast rural and remote areas, so that more students can benefit. Therefore, distance learning will be an indispensable new education model in education and teaching in the future.

AB  - The merging of community ecology and phylogenetic biology allows us to link broader evolutionary processes to local ecological processes, thereby increasing our understanding of community assembly. A recurrent way to test how species assemblages respond to different abiotic conditions and evaluate the role of evolutionary constraints in community assembly is through using environmental gradients as natural treatments. Here, we combine phylogenetic and trait-based methods to evaluate how the phylogenetic diversity and composition of bird assemblages and their community-weighted traits vary along an elevational gradient in the Swiss Alps. For this purpose, we used four life-history traits considered to be key indicators of individual species response to environmental changes: clutch size, number of breeding attempts, dispersal capacity and lifespan. Controlling for phylogeny, we determined whether environmental filters (elevation, habitat type) act on these traits independently of the level of relatedness among species. We found that phylogenetic dispersion decreases with elevation, but the signature of phylogenetic clustering was weak. Phylogenetic fuzzy weighting showed that the distribution of bird species across plots was related to the two environmental gradients; nonetheless, such influence was not determined by the phylogenetic relationships in either case. That is, there are no specific clades associated with particular elevation or habitat types. We also found that high elevation communities around the treeline were composed of species with lower reproductive rates, reduced lifespan, and lower dispersal capacity, which would make them less resilient to environmental change. Although traits showed moderate phylogenetic signal, only the lifespan was phylogenetically structured. In the remaining cases, the trait-environment association was not mediated by the phylogenetic relationships among taxa. Our study indicates that evolutionary constraints do not represent a significant driver of community assembly in Alpine bird communities and support the notion that phylogeny may often not be a good proxy for traits subject to environmental filtering.

AB  - Glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium are the main herbicides used to control weeds in no-tillage agricultural fields in China. However, their leaching risk to groundwater and ecological risk to aquatic organisms remain unclear. From the agricultural basins among 10 provinces of China, glyphosate, its main metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), and glufosinate ammonium were detected in 1.01%, 0.86%, 0% of 694 groundwater samples with the maximum concentrations of 2.09, 5.13, and <0.05 mu g/L, and were detected in 14.3%, 15.8%, and 2.6% of 196 surface water samples with the maximum levels of 32.49,10.31 and 13.15 mu g/L Furthermore, to evaluate the main drivers of exposure to the targets in water bodies, the fate models were used. The model simulation indicated that spray drift and overflow runoff were the key factors affecting the exposure to targets in surface water adjacent to rice field, whereas the spray drift deposition, runoff, and erosion induced the exposure to the targets in pond water close to dry land crop fields under different meteorological conditions and soil characteristics. The targets in groundwater posed a low risk to water consumption, while fish embryos might be at unacceptable risk due to glufosinate ammonium exposure in surface water with median risk quotient (RQ) equal to 55.6. The results highlight the spatial and seasonal distribution of glyphosate, AMPA, and glufosinate ammonium in groundwater and surface water in agricultural basins of China, providing the first evidence to the environmental risk of the targets to drinking water consumption and aquatic organism safety in China agriculture system.

AB  - Raman spectroscopy can be used to effectively analyze submicron- to microsized microplastics, but Raman spectra of weathered microplastics commonly show deviations from those of unweathered microplastics and are often affected by fluorescence. However, studies of weathering-induced surface changes in microplastics have been limited to laboratory simulations. To systematically study Raman spectra and surface changes of microplastics weathered under natural environments, we collected microplastics from sediments around waste plastics processing and recycling industries in Laizhou City, Shandong Province, East China. Raman spectra of weathered microplastics differ greatly from standard spectra of unweathered plastic material. Peaks in the Raman spectra of weathered microplastics are weakened and even invisible. A preliminary Raman database of weathered microplastics (RDWP) including 124 Raman spectra of weathered microplastics was built to accurately identify microplastics in natural environments, and it is open to all users. FTIR spectroscopy revealed the presence of oxygen-containing functional groups and C=C bonds related to oxidation and chain scission. SEM showed that weathered microplastics had rough surfaces and that PP was more easily fractured than PE. Complementary C and O elemental maps suggested that the O/C ratio is a potential indicator of oxidation degree. EDS revealed titanium on PET and PVC surfaces, which is related to titanium dioxide typically used as a light-blocking aid. Our data document that Raman spectroscopy has great potential in the identification of naturally weathered microplastics and that combined spectral and elemental analyses can be useful in deciphering the degradation processes of microplastics under natural conditions.

AB  - Workplace architectural lighting conditions that are biologically dim during the day are causing healthy individuals to experience light-induced health and performance-related problems. Dynamic lighting was reported beneficial in supporting individuals' psychological behavior and physiological responses during work period in Europe. It has yet to be investigated in workplaces with minimal/no natural daylight contribution in tropical Malaysia. Hence, an exploratory experimental study was initiated in an experimental windowless open-plan workplace in Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang. The aim was to identify dynamic lighting configurations that were more supportive of a morning boosting effect than the control constant lighting, to support dayshift individuals' psychophysiological wellbeing indicators during the peak morning work period. The immediate impact of a 2-hour morning exposure to overhead white LED (6500 K) with different horizontal illuminance levels and oscillations (lighting patterns) were investigated on physiological indicator limited to urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin, and psychological indicators for alertness, mood, visual comfort, cognitive and visual task performance. Not all of the investigated dynamic lighting configurations were supportive of a morning boost. Only configurations 500(increased) (to)750 and 500(increased to)1000 lx therapeutically supported most of the indicators. Both these configurations suppressed urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin, and improved alertness, cognitive performance, positive affect, and visual comfort better than 'visit 1: 500(constant)500' lx (control). The increasing oscillation was observed more beneficial for the morning boost in tropical Malaysia, which is in reverse to that specified in the human rhythmic dynamic lighting protocol developed by researchers from the Netherlands for application during winter. The findings from this study present the feasibility of dynamic architectural lighting acting as an environmental therapeutic solution in supporting the individuals' psychophysiological wellbeing indicators in windowless open-plan workplace in tropical Malaysia. Further investigations on the two prospective configurations are recommended to determine the better supportive one for the morning boosting effect in Malaysia.

AB  - The use of borrowed indices to assess stream health has limitations and research suggests a need to develop more reliable regionally based indices that are sensitive to the relationship between taxa and environmental conditions. Implementing this is challenging in the Southern Hemisphere given the scarcity of diatom indices, specifically in sub-tropical areas. The purpose of this study was to develop a regionally based diatom index to assess freshwater lotic systems in sub-tropical eastern Australia and compare the results with borrowed indices to derive meaningful inferences on river health. A total of 119 epilithic diatom and water samples were collected during 2014-2015 from the Richmond River Catchment in Northern NSW Australia. Statistical analysis indicated that total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) were strong variables influencing the data set and subsequently TP was chosen as a nutrient proxy for the index. Analysis of diatoms resulted in TP sensitivity values (1-5) being assigned to 105 species with relative abundance of > 1% in the data set. These species were used to calculate the Richmond River Diatom Index (RRDI) for 45 sites within the Catchment. The index effectively scored sites along the environmental gradient with sites in the upper catchment generally scoring lower (healthier) than the mid and lower catchment sites. The index compared positively with both the Diatom Species Index for Australian Rivers (DSIAR) (r = 0.76) and the Trophic Diatom Index (TDI) (r = 0.65). Further research is suggested to test the RRDI on independent sites in neighbouring catchments and develop class boundaries from the RRDI so that the index can be readily used by water managers to assess and monitor freshwater systems in sub-tropical Australia.

AB  - 1. Protection of places important for aesthetic, ecological, and cultural values has been a goal of conservationists for over 150 years. Cornerstones of place-based conservation include legal designations, international agreements, and purchase by public or non-profit organizations.
   2. In the Salmon River catchment, Oregon, protections were initially developed in the 1930s for the freshwater riparian corridor and forestry research in the uplands. Over time, additional protections in the estuary and nearshore marine environments were added, motivated by local desire to protect and restore habitats and fish populations.
   3. Removal of three levees in the Salmon River estuary occurred over three consecutive 9-year time-steps, and provided the opportunity for research on tidal marsh recovery in the framework of a space-for-time chronoseries. Elevation, channel morphology, and vegetation all exhibited trajectories toward reference conditions. Fish and macroinvertebrates also served as indicators of tidal marsh recovery, although their recovery patterns were not strictly related to the chrono-series trajectories. The extent of restoration provided a novel opportunity to measure a significant response of biotic indicators at the site and catchment scales.
   4. Salt marsh restoration augmented protected freshwater habitats by expanding rearing habitats for juvenile salmonids and increasing expression of life-history diversity for both Chinook and coho salmon. This finding highlights linkages between freshwater and marine habitats and populations, and has the potential to influence important policy advances and changes in management of Pacific salmon.
   5. Restoration promoted collaborations among stakeholders, community involvement, and inspiring educational opportunities that enabled more comprehensive research than any single sponsor could have accomplished.
   6. Protected status designations have fostered a wealth of opportunities that were not specifically envisioned when the protections were first put in place. In particular, dedicated scientific investigation of landscape-scale change did not occur by design, but was pieced together as funding opportunities arose over time.

FX  - Some extremely dedicated individuals looked at the Salmon River catchment as a unique research opportunity, beginning with Bob Frenkel of Oregon State University starting in the late 1970s. In many instances they worked at Salmon River despite institutional resistance and lack of dedicated funding. Funding gaps were filled by a suite of organizations, most notably Oregon Sea Grant, but also the Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board, National Science Foundation, USFS, and the ODFW. The dedication by graduate students and undergraduates who have participated in the research in the Salmon River catchment has been instrumental in data collection, analyses, and developing research topics and interests.

AB  - The southwestern Gulf of Mexico constitutes an important subsystem within a Large Marine Ecosystem. Due to its high biodiversity, living resources and energy resources, this region is strategic in the national plans for social and economic development of Mexico. The discovery of fossil fuel reserves in the seabed of Campeche Sound in the 1970s promoted the rapid expansion of the national oil industry in offshore waters. Unfortunately, the accidental blowout of the most productive well (Ixtoc-I) in June of 1979, caused the first world massive oil spill in a tropical marine environment. More than 3.4 million of barrels of crude oil were liberated in an ecosystem formerly renowned for its pristine conditions. In the aftermath of this dreadful accident, a growing concern emerged not only for the oil acute effects but also for the long-term environmental consequences derived from the residual hydrocarbon compounds accumulated in coastal environments of the southern Gulf of Mexico. The attempts to assess the magnitude of the environmental damage were strongly precluded by the lack of pre-spill information. Natural variability in the ecosystem and oil weathering-factors contributed to attenuate the acute pollution effects that lasted nearly 9 months. However, the post-spill environmental alterations caused by the Ixtoc-I blowout still remain unanswered. The sinking of the Deepwater Horizon oil platform in the deep-waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico, in 2010 rekindled our concern for the significant risk involved for human lives and the health of shallow and deep marine habitats. The authors of this contribution offer their views on this environmental riddle from their own perspective as direct witnesses of the Ixtoc-I environmental tragedy.

AB  - During the last 20 years, the Amazon region has been at the same time a place of massive ecological and social change and a laboratory of experiments aimed at promoting sustainable development. Policies and project initiatives involving diverse social groups and environmental contexts have been implemented across the region. They have resulted in mixed outcomes and trade-offs between social and environmental dimensions, making their impact at the local level difficult to assess and their successes difficult to generalize. The objective of the DURAMAZ research project was to provide a better understanding of these impacts. It produced a multi-dimensional indicator system designed to allow a holistic view of sustainable development at local and subregional levels and a comparative perspective across 12 research sites, from an isolated indigenous village to smallholders and agribusiness areas in Mato Grosso. The results of the first observation campaign (2007-2009) show that despite the claim of promoting sustainable development, no project was able to untie the 'Gordian knot' of development in the Amazon. Communities continue to face the old dilemma of either enjoying a preserved ecosystem but enduring adverse life conditions, or enjoying better living at the expense of forest cover. Another finding is that the subregional context is very important in shaping the impacts of regional policies. Thus, the same policy will not always have the same effect, depending on in which context it is applied. Finally, we found that cultural factors and a sense of place play a more important role than economic factors when it comes to the way people evaluate their own situation. This research provides the basis for a second phase of the project (2012-2016) in which we will continue to expand our sample and to refine our methodologies with the goal of transforming the initiative into a network of observatories of sustainable development in the Amazon.

AB  - Background and Purpose: The succession of forests in the Posavina region follows a pattern from forests of black alder and ash through stands of pedunculate oak to pedunculate oak-hornbeam forests. In the past hundred years, this lowland area has been affected by a number of factors, among which anthropogenic influences hold a primary, position. This has resulted. in a considerable deviation from normal, natural succession. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the present condition, the degree of destabilisation and the future developmental trends of pedunculate oak stands by drawing on previous pedological, hydrological and vegetational research. One of the best indicators of the above is the ecoindicator values of the floristic composition
   Materials and Methods: Phytocoenological releves were taken in 25 localities of both stable and destabilised forest ecosystems of pedunculate oak, in Zutica Forest. The principles of the Zurich-Montpellier School were applied for this process. The numerical analysis was carried out by, means of SYN-TAX 2000 software. JUICE 6.3 and CANOCO 4.5 were also used to process the releves, construct the phytocoenological tables and correlate species compositions and vegetation types with ecological factors. The obtained results Were compared with the results of earlier ecological research.
   Results: Phytocoenological research revealed significant changes in the floristic composition. Ecoindicator values of plant species indicate a substantial change in ecological parameters and increased destabilisation, which leads to larger quantities of light, thermophilicity and humidity in sites. In addition, the sites are richer in nitrogen and the soil reaction becomes more basophilic, while central European species replace intermediary ones.
   Conclusions: The investigated plots show a regression process contrary to the normal direction of vegetation development in lowland areas. A return has been observed from the final community to transitional communities, and in some localities even to initial and pioneer communities.

AB  - Anthropogenic forests, particularly conifer monocultures, today constitute a large proportion of Central European woodland. Conversion of such forest stands into abundantly structured mixed-species woodland is within the focus of ecosystem restoration and is considered to affect forest biodiversity. Short-lived tree species play an important role in such conversion processes and may serve as focal species. However, not much is known about their relationship with forest biodiversity. In this study, the short-lived tree species, European mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia L.), European white birch (Betula pendula Roth), Downy birch (B. pubescens Ehrh.), and Glossy buckthorn (Frangula alnus P. Mill.), commonly occurring throughout Central Europe, are investigated with regard to their relationship with plant diversity. The focus is on their occurrences in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)-dominated forests in the Northeast German lowlands. A significant increase in vascular plant diversity is revealed in stands with the selected species' presence, in comparison to stands without them. Increase in plant species numbers is highest where the respective species occurs in the tree and/or shrub layer, compared with their presence only in the herb layer. For bryophyte species, there is a less strong inverse relationship. An analysis of different species groups, such as threatened, woody, and typical forest species of higher plants, reveals no decrease in species numbers in these groups if short-lived tree species are present. It is concluded that short-lived tree species can be indicators for plant diversity assessment within forest restoration processes. As to causal explanations, effects of differing site conditions, assessed by use of Ellenberg indicator values, are discussed as well as possible active effects of the tree species changing their environment.

AB  - The study investigated the effect of strip management in alfalfa on the abundance and diversity of spiders. In strip management, narrow strips were left unmown in the crop, which were then shifted at next mowing. In an experimental field, out of the six 50 x 50-m blocks, three received strip management and three were managed traditionally (ie the whole block was mown). Our main hypothesis was that unmown strips will contain a more diverse and abundant spider assemblage, which will increase spider numbers in the mown parts of the crop. Over the 3 years of the study, unmown strips contained a spider assemblage of more than 50% higher abundance than in control alfalfa. Species diversity was also greater in the strips, and the presence of specific indicator species could be shown. We found that five dominant species comprised over 75% of spiders in the strips, and they were the same species as those that are dominant in alfalfa, where they represent 85% of an spiders. In contrast, a neighbouring meadow, which was a control in the study, also had high diversity, but different dominant species. The main result of the experiment was negative in that elevated abundance of spiders in unmown strips did not raise spider numbers in the mown strips of alfalfa, where abundance was only marginally higher than in the control alfalfa. We can speculate that better ecological conditions in unmown strips attract and conserve spiders from neighbouring areas and from the crop at mowing. We suggest that if diversification is more interspersed within the crop, we have a higher chance of increasing the number of natural enemies and bringing them closer to pests, so that they can interact more intensively.

AB  - Bioaccumulation of lead in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis from Pb-210-labeled bulk seawater (dissolved and particulate pathways combined) was examined over 21 days. The lead bioaccumulation factor (BAF) at equilibrium was estimated to be 211 +/- 10 ml g(-1). This value was two orders of magnitude lower than BAFs reported in the literature for other trace metals in this bivalve indicating that lead is not efficiently accumulated by mussels from bulk seawater. The resultant lead distribution in mussels was 49 +/- 10% in soft tissues and 46 +/- 16% in the shell suggesting similar uptake rates (Bq day(-1)) in both compartments throughout the exposure. Total elimination for lead in mussels was adequately described by a short-term compartment with a biological half-life for loss of 1.4 +/- 0.3 days and a long-term compartment which released lead only very slowly (Tb-1/2 = 2.5 +/- 0.7 months). No difference was noted for lead elimination rates in shell and in soft parts. When experimentally exposed to lead under conditions representative of natural environmental lead levels in water, including both that in the dissolved phase and in the food, the shell compartment was shown to contain the major fraction of the total lead accumulated by mussels. Therefore mussels may be considered as good bioindicators of lead contamination accumulated from the dissolved rather than from the particulate source. Furthermore, the relatively slow uptake and the long depuration half-life of lead will limit the ability of mussels to accurately record short-term variations in lead concentrations in the surrounding waters, a fact which should be taken into consideration in order to define the appropriate sampling frequency for mussels used in biomonitoring programs involving lead.

AB  - Understanding the consequences of the combined effects of multiple stressors including stress from man-made chemicals is important for conservation management, the ecological risk assessment of chemicals, and many other ecological applications. Our current ability to predict and analyse the joint effects of multiple stressors is insufficient to make the prospective risk assessment-of-chemicals more ecologically relevant because we lack a full understanding of how organisms respond to stress factors alone and in combination. Here, we describe a Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) based bioenergetics model that predicts the potential effects of single or multiple natural and chemical stressors on life history traits. We demonstrate the plausibility of the model using a meta-analysis of 128 existing studies on freshwater invertebrates. We then validate our model by comparing its predictions for a combination of three stressors (i.e. chemical, temperature, and food availability) with new, independent experimental data on life history traits in the daphnid Ceriaclaplinia duhia. We found that the model predictions are in agreement with observed growth curves and reproductive traits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the combined effects of three stress factors on life history traits observed in laboratory studies have been predicted successfully in invertebrates. We suggest that a re-analysis of existing studies on multiple stressors within the modelling framework outlined here will provide a robust null model for identifying stressor interactions, and expect that a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms will arise from these new analyses. Bioenergetics modelling could be applied more broadly to support environmental management decision making. k.V, (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The "Rade de Cherbourg" (RdC, Cotentin) hosts the only marine salmon fish farm along the French coasts. High hydrodynamic regime would limit, there, organic matter (OM) accumulation directly under the cages, and enhance the transport of OM in the surrounding of the cages. This study was aiming at (1) monitoring the impact of a salmon fish farm on ecological quality statuses (EcoQs) of the RdC based on a benthic foraminiferal biotic index, (2) comparing EcoQs assessment results between foraminifera and macrofauna, and (3) in fine assessing the potential for benthic foraminifera to become an alternate biological quality element. In 2014 and 2015, bottom sediments of the RdC were sampled at 13 stations under and outside the farm for sedimentary (grain size and OM), and living foraminiferal and macrofaunal analyses. For benthic foraminifera, Exp(H'bc) was used to determine EcoQs, while H', AMBI and BO2A indices were used for benthic macrofauna. Rank-frequency dis-tributions (RFDs) were calculated for both groups. Ecological quality statuses based on foraminifera and mac-rofauna indicated a moderate degradation of the environmental conditions, shifting from excellent outside the farm to poor under the cages for foraminifera and from excellent to moderate for macrofauna. This study showed that benthic foraminifera are as reliable as macrofauna to assess EcoQs in the RdC. It offers interesting per-spectives to monitor the health of marine systems based on benthic foraminifera. Furthermore, results obtained with RFDs suggested that this approach should be considered in the assessment of the good environmental status within the European marine strategic framework directive. Finally, diversity proved to be efficient in monitoring the health of the RdC, suggesting that it should not be set aside for the benefit of sensitivity-based indices.

AB  - The sub-Antarctic Namuncura Marine Protected Area at Burdwood Bank (NMPA/BB) is an area of favorable conditions for the development of planktonic organisms and the sustenance of numerous species of ecological importance. The current study aimed to evaluate the spatial distribution of the abundance, biomass, community structure, and functional diversity of the mesozooplankton from the NMPA/BB during spring 2014. We also assessed the potential of zooplankton as prey for upper trophic levels, in particular the larvae of the Fuegian sprat (Sprattus fuegensis), a key species in the food web of the NMPA/BB. A total of 26 zooplankton taxa were identified. Nauplii and copepods evidenced the highest abundances, with the latter representing the dominant group in terms of biomass. Copepods showed a strong eastward gradient in their abundance, biomass, and diversity. This spatial structure in the community composition seems to be modulated by a west-to-east decreasing trend in the size of available preys, with nano- and picoplankton playing a major role in the eastern part of the NMPA/BB. Such pattern would be, in turn, a consequence of productivity gradients along hydrographic features. The high abundance of nauplii and copepods suggests that spring is an appropriate time for their reproduction and, given their size structure, they represent an adequate food source for Fuegian sprat larvae. This would be enhanced by anticyclonic cells present in the NMPA/BB, which can gather and retain sprat larvae along with their zooplanktonic preys. The results of our study, which is the first comprehensive approach addressing the zooplanktonic indicators of the NMPA/BB, serve as a baseline for future ecosystem-based policies aiming to manage and protect the natural marine resources sheltered here.

AB  - The construction of roads is one of the most widespread forms of natural landscape modification. Over the last 20 years, dozens of road constructions have been assessed in Slovakia, which makes it possible to talk about methodological positives and negatives. A special feature of Slovakia is that many planned or renovated roads are located in-protected areas or are in contact with them (including Natura 2000 sites). Therefore, it is important to understand the scope of the roads' ecological impacts and find ways for their appropriate evaluation and incorporation into the Environmental Impact Assessment process. For this reason, the Ecological Impact Assessment methodology can be used as a basis for our research, which consists of three stages. In the first stage (scoping), a buffer circumventing the proposed road is created to determine the area for impact prediction and evaluation. Subsequently, the landscape structure and baseline landscape conditions are discussed, a map of current landscape structure is created and the current ecological status of the affected area is calculated. In the second stage (the evaluation of ecological resources), important ecological parts of the landscape are delineated. This step is based on the importance of previous information and its vulnerability, and leads to the mapping of the road ecological impact zone. In the third stage (impact assessment), important ecological parts are spatially correlated with the proposed road construction. Finally, the significance of ecological impacts of the activity is evaluated by applying specific criteria (duration, reversibility, magnitude, size and road ecological impact zone significance). A scale is proposed for each criterion to evaluate the total significance of impacts. In this way, detailed significant ecological impacts can be found which will help lead to proposed correct mitigation measures and a post-project analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Using data from analyses of stomach contents and stable isotopes, we examined high-resolution variations in the feeding habits and trophic position of Dolphinfish Coryphaena hippurus during 2005-2007. In total, 418 specimens were collected off the southern Baja California peninsula, Mexico. Based on analysis of stomach contents (% index of relative importance [%IRI]), Dolphinfish consumed mainly epipelagic prey, with the red crab Pleuroncodes planipes as the most abundant prey species. The diet was highly similar between sexes but differed between size-classes: Dolphinfish smaller than 65cm FL fed mainly on Pacific Sardine Sardinops sagax caeruleus (%IRI = 30), whereas those larger than 110cm FL fed mainly on jumbo squid Dosidicus gigas (%IRI = 45) in addition to red crabs. Dietary differences between the smallest and largest specimens were mainly related to changes in morphology and spatial stratification by size (i.e., to avoid cannibalism). Trophic positions estimated by both methods indicated that the Dolphinfish is a secondary to tertiary carnivore with a high degree of trophic plasticity, and thus it plays different trophic roles within the area. Elevated variability in delta N-15 and Shannon-Wiener diversity index values on an annual scale revealed that Dolphinfish are opportunistic predators. Interannual diet variation related to the availability and abundance of prey species can be explained by changes in environmental conditions due to climate anomalies associated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation events. We highlight that the Dolphinfish is a good indicator of changes occurring in the food web structure of pelagic ecosystems. The observed variations in feeding habits and trophic position are critical to understanding the ecology and role of Dolphinfish in marine ecosystems by providing knowledge on feeding locations, seasonal prey utilization, and prey availability and allowing predictions of possible ecological responses to environmental change.

T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - We compiled and analyzed past time-series data to evaluate changes in oceanographic conditions and marine ecosystems near the Ieodo ocean research station (IORS) in the East China Sea (N 31A degrees 15'aEuro"33A degrees 45', E 124A degrees 15'aEuro"127A degrees 45') in relation to longterm changes in climate and global warming. The environment data we used was a depth-specific time-series of temperature and salinity for the water columns at 175 fixed stations along 22 oceanographic lines in Korean waters, based on bimonthly measurements since 1961 taken by the National Fisheries Research & Development Institute. As an indicator for the ecosystem status of the waters off Ieodo, we analyzed species composition in biomass of fishes caught by Korean fishing vessels in the waters near the IORS (1984-2010) and summarized the data in relation to the environmental changes using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). To detect step changes in the time-series of environmental factors, we applied a sequential t-test analysis of regime shift. Correspondence analysis detected a major shift in fish assemblage structure between 1990 and 1993: the dominant species was filefish during 1981-1992, but chub mackerel during 1992-2007. This shift in fish assemblage structure seemed to be related to the well-established 1989 regime shift in the North Pacific, which was confirmed again with respect to temperature in the Yellow Sea and the Korea Strait (but not in the waters off the IORS). In overall from 1984 to 2010, salinity was more important than water temperature in CCA, implying that the fluctuation of the Tsushima warm current is a most important force driving the long-term changes in fish assemblage structure in the waters off the IORS. Further multidisciplinary researches are required to identify oceanographic and biological processes that link climate-driven physical changes to fish recruitment and habitat range fluctuations.

AB  - Reliable descriptions of the status of offshore seabed habitats usually require substantial investment in field data collection and sample analysis. While assessment of, for example, biogenic reef habitat can often include simple physical parameters (e.g. spatial extent), comparative measures for soft sediment habitats generally rely on the distribution and relative abundance of species, with a description of the associated sedimentary environment. To investigate the power of surveys to detect significant trends in assemblage structure, samples of meiofauna, macroinfauna and megafauna (i.e. representing ecological components from nematodes to demersal fish), were collected from four offshore mud and sand habitat sites in western UK shelf seas during July 2004 and 2005. Spatial arrays of samples within these sites, up to 23 km apart, were designed to optimise descriptions of assemblage structure and the patterns of spatial distribution at a local scale. Analyses of species abundance, biomass and taxonomic relatedness of the species complement at each site suggested that most assemblages represented relatively unimpacted regional conditions. The power of the sampling programme to detect a significant change in univariate community attributes was assessed. The variability in many of the community attributes indicated that intensive replicate sampling would be required to detect ecologically important changes. Improving the power of such benthic surveys to detect trends would therefore require substantial additional time and effort to be invested in sample collection and analysis. Resource analysis showed that the time from gear deployment to complete sample identification was gear-dependent, lowest per sample for meiofauna (10 h) and megafauna (6-12 h), and highest for macroinfauna (12-22 h). These results have implications for the development of meaningful indicators of habitat status for offshore soft sediment habitats, and the resources required for effective monitoring of change.

AB  - The Mahalanobis distances have been introduced in habitat selection studies for the estimation of environmental suitability maps (ESMs). The pixels of raster maps of a given area correspond to points in the multidimensional space defined by the mapped environmental variables (ecological space). The Mahalanobis distances measure the distances in this space between these points and the mean of the ecological niche (i. e., the hypothesized optimum for the species) regarding the structure of the niche. The map of these distances over the area of interest is an estimated ESM. Several authors recently noted that the use of a single optimum for the niche of a species may lead to biased predictions of animal occurrence. They proposed to use instead a minimum set of basic habitat requirements, found by partitioning the Mahalanobis distances into a restricted set of biologically meaningful axes. However, the statistical approach they proposed does not take into account the environmental conditions on the area where the niche was sampled (i. e., the environmental availability), and we show that including this availability is necessary. We used their approach as a basis to develop a new exploratory tool, the Mahalanobis distance factor analysis (MADIFA), which performs an additive partitioning of the Mahalanobis distances taking into account this availability. The basic habitat requirements of a species can be derived from the axes of the MADIFA. This method can also be used to compute ESMs using only this small number of basic requirements, therefore including only the biologically relevant information. We also prove that the MADIFA is complementary to the commonly used ecological-niche factor analysis (ENFA). We used the MADIFA method to analyze the niche of the chamois Rupicapra rupicapra in a mountainous area. This method adds to the existing set of tools for the description of the niche.

AB  - A substantial proportion of the primary productivity in grassland ecosystems is allocated belowground, sustaining an abundant and diverse community of microbes and soil invertebrates. These belowground communities drive many important ecosystem functions and are responsive to a variety of environmental changes. Nematodes, an abundant and diverse component of grassland soil communities, are particularly responsive to altered environmental conditions, such as those associated with reduced fire frequency and nitrogen enrichment, with the most consistent responses displayed by microbial-feeding nematodes. However, much of the available research characterizing nematode responses to environmental change has been carried out at the taxonomic level of family or by broad trophic categories (e.g. fungivores, bacterivores). The extent to which differential responses to environmental change occurs at the genus level or below is unclear. Therefore, the objective of this study was to use molecular methods to quantify the response of microbial-feeding nematodes, at the lowest levels of taxonomic resolution, to nitrogen enrichment and changes in fire frequency. Using sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) probes for the 18S ribosomal RNA gene and the ITS1 region, we identified 19 microbial-feeding nematode taxa across four families. When nematodes were sampled across treatments, we found that some nematode taxa within a family responded similarly to nitrogen and burning treatments, while other taxa within the same family respond quite differently. Additionally, although nematodes from different families on average responded differently to nitrogen enrichment and burning, similar responses were seen in nematode taxa that span three taxonomic families. Thus, if nematodes are to be used as indicators of environmental change, care should be taken to assess the response at the lowest taxonomic level possible.

This study investigated the current vegetative status of sand dunes on three representative coasts of the Korean peninsula, and on the coasts of Cheju Island, and assessed the conditions caused by invasive plants. The relationships between the degree of invasion and 14 environmental variables were studied. Plots of sand dunes along fine transects perpendicular to the coastal lines were established to estimate vegetative species coverage. TWINSPAN (Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis), CCA (Canonical Correspondence Analysis), and DCCA (Detrended Canonical Correspondence Analysis) were performed to classify communities on sand dunes and assess species composition variation. Carex kobomugi, Elymus mollis, and Vitex rotundifolia were found to be the dominant species plotted on the east. the west. and the peripheral coasts of Cheju Island, respectively. Vegetation on the south coast was totally extinct. The 19 communities. including representative C. kobomugi, C. kobomugi-Ixeris repens, C. kobomugi-Oenothera biennis, E. mollis, Lolium multiflorum-Calystegia soldanella, and V. rotundifolia kobomugi, were all classified according to TWINSPAN. Oenothera biennis and L. multiflorum were exotics observed within these native communities. CCA showed that invasive native and exotic species distribution was segregated significantly, according to disturbance level, exotic species number, gravel, sand and silt contents. as well as vegetation size. It further revealed that human disturbance can strongly favor the settlement of invasive and exotic species. Restoration options to reduce exotic plants in the South Korean sand dune areas were found to be the introduction of native plant species from one sand dune into other sand dune areas. prohibition of building and the introduction of exotic soils, and conservation of surrounding sand dune areas.

AB  - Subfossil Pediastrum, a genus of green algae (Chlorophyceae) which is sensitive to changes in the aquatic environment, is a potential proxy indicator of the evolution of aquatic ecosystems and climate change. We synthesized subfossil Pediastrum records from arid central Asia (ACA) and the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) region in order to characterize their hydro-climatic evolution during the Holocene. In ACA, low concentrations of subfossil Pediastrum during the early Holocene resulted from the higher salinity caused by a dry climate or lower lake levels. The increasing trend of subfossil Pediastrum content during the middle-late Holocene is consistent with the occurrence of wetter regional climatic conditions. In the marginal areas of the Asian summer monsoon (MASM) region of northern China, the variations in subfossil Pediastrum concentration coincide with increased summer monsoon rainfall during the middle Holocene, but concentrations were generally lower during the late Holocene as a result of increased salinity or alkalinity associated with a weakened summer monsoon. In the Tibetan Plateau, the variations in subfossil Pediastrum abundance are more complicated due to divergent moisture/precipitation patterns influenced by both the ASM and the mid-latitude westerlies. In the Indian summer monsoon-dominated region, subfossil Pediastrum abundance was high during the early Holocene and then gradually decreased after similar to 8 cal kyr BP. The observed asynchronous changes in subfossil Pediastrum in ACA and the MASM region during the Holocene may reflect the specific moisture/precipitation patterns of the monsoon- or westerlies-dominated climatic regimes. We suggest that high evaporation in arid and semi-arid areas would have rapidly increased the salinity and/or alkalinity of lakes, while aquatic environments may have been more stable in more humid areas.

AB  - Historically, environmental research and monitoring in the Alberta oil sands region (OSR) located in northeastern Alberta, Canada, have largely neglected, meaningful Indigenous participation. Through years of experience on the land, Indigenous knowledge (IK) holders recognize change on the landscape, drawing on inextricable links between environmental health and practicing traditional rights. The cumulative impacts of crude oil production are of great concern to Indigenous communities, and monitoring initiatives in the OSR provide unique opportunities to develop Indigenous community-based monitoring (ICBM). A review of ICBM literature on the OSR from 2009 to 2020 was completed. Based on this review, we identify best practices in ICBM and propose governance structures and a framework to support meaningful integration of ICBM into regulatory environmental monitoring. Because it involves multimedia monitoring and produces data and insights that integrate many aspects of the environment, ICBM is important for natural science research. ICBM can enhance the relevance of environmental monitoring by examining relationships between physical and chemical stressors and culturally relevant indicators, so improving predictions of long-term changes in the environment. Unfortunately, many Indigenous communities distrust researchers owing to previous experiences of exploitive use of IK. In the present paper, we recommend important practices for the integration of IK into regional environmental monitoring programs. ICBM is important to communities because it includes conditions to which communities can exercise traditional rights, and highlight how industrial activities affect this ability. Equally important, ICBM can generate a resurgence of Indigenous languages and subsequently traditional practices; it can also revive the connection with traditional lands and improve food security.

AB  - The Negev desert features numerous unique geologic phenomena, the most prominent being crater-like valleys which have formed in a complex erosional process. These erosional craters expose a large variety of ancient rocks and geologic phenomena that reveal details of a rich geologic history. The unique conditions within the erosional craters provide shelter for endemic vegetation and animals and have influenced the development of the region's cultures and human heritage. The well-preserved and thoroughly studied erosional craters of the Negev provide a great example of the geodiversity and geoheritage values encompassed in such rare geologic features. Worldwide acknowledgment of their importance has brought to the acceptance of the Hebrew term for a crater, makhtesh (literally a mortar), as the universal term for erosional craters. In recent years, the increasing importance of geotourism and environmental-education activities to the local communities brought upon a coalition of scientists, tour guides, residents, and stakeholders to support the establishment of a geopark in the Negev Craterland. The work presented here is a synthesis of current knowledge and new advancements in the study of erosional craters and their geoheritage value. In particular, we propose a revised definition of the term "makhtesh" to better represent different types of erosional craters while acknowledging the common features which make these structures so rich in geodiversity. We chose Makhtesh Ramon, the largest crater in the Negev, to demonstrate the great potential geoheritage value of craters worldwide. Finally, we developed a new method to systematically assess and compare the scenic value of the various craters and their morphologic features. We hope that the establishment of a grading scale for the key structural, scenic, and cultural aspects of craters may lay the foundation for future economic, ecologic, and touristic assessments of such unique landscapes and environments.

AB  - Our understanding of mechanisms governing soil organic matter (OM) stability is evolving. It is gradually becoming accepted that soil OM stability is not primarily regulated by the molecular structure of plant inputs, but instead by the biotic and abiotic properties of the edaphic environment. Moreover, several experimental studies conducted in artificial systems have suggested that mechanisms regulating OM stability may differ with depth in the soil profile. Up to now however, there is very limited field-scale evidence regarding the hierarchy of controls on soil OM dynamics and their changes with soil depth.
   In this study, we take advantage of the high heterogeneity of ecological conditions occurring in the alpine belt to identify the major determinants of OM dynamics and how their significance varies with depth in the soil profile. Aboveground litter, mineral topsoil, and subsoil samples originating from 46 soil profiles spanning a wide range of soil and vegetation types were analysed. We used Rock-Eval pyrolysis, a technique that investigates the thermal stability of OM, as an indicator of OM dynamics.
   Our results show a clear divergence in predictors of OM thermal stability in the litter, topsoil, and subsoil layers. The composition of OM correlated with its thermal stability in the litter layer but not in mineral soil horizons, where the supply rate of fresh organic material and the physical and chemical characteristics of the pedogenic environment appeared important instead. This study offers direct confirmation that soil OM dynamics are influenced by different ecosystem properties in each soil layer. This has important implications for our understanding of carbon cycling in soils under a changing climate.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation, overexploitation of natural resources, the introduction of alien species and environmental degradation in aquatic environments are the main causes of reductions in aquatic biota diversity. Phytoplankton represent good ecological indicators because they are highly diverse and rapidly respond to a wide array of environmental disturbances. We investigated the interannual variation in alpha diversity of the phytoplankton community in lakes of an alluvial floodplain. We predicted that the phytoplankton diversity decreases over time in lakes and rivers subjected to human activities, whereas those biotopes in areas under pristine environmental conditions do not show a reduction in alpha diversity. Phytoplankton samples were taken quarterly over a period of eleven years (2000-2010), from ten localities associated with three large rivers, which showed different uses of the watershed. The time series of alpha diversity was analysed, to assess the temporal trend, in addition to their relationships with environmental factors. Phytoplankton alpha diversity in the Upper Parana River floodplain ranged between 4 and 87 species and showed a mean of 30 (+/- 16.5). Sites associated with the Parana River showed a decline in diversity, which was associated with transparency, nitrogen and phosphorus forms. These results reflect a combination of seston retention by damming and an increase in the N:P ratio, which appears to negatively affect phytoplankton diversity. If temporal trends in environmental variation and the phytoplankton community remain, the future consequences for phytoplanktonic diversity in the Parana subsystem will be severe, which might cause changes in the trophic structure and dynamics, and therefore in the functioning of environments, since this community is one of the main sources of energy for other trophic levels.

AB  - The utility of taxonomic and functional approaches in assessing the structure of fish communities is tested in the hypersaline estuary of the Casamance river using data from surveys of commercial fisheries conducted between April and July of 2005. Both taxonomic and functional diversity decrease from downstream to upstream regions of the estuary. In terms of species composition, marine-estuarine species (33.3-46.3%, depending on the site) and estuarine species of marine origin (29.3-41.7%) dominate the exploited population in the Casamance estuary. In contrast, the proportion of strictly estuarine species observed upstream is twice that observed downstream.
   Quantitative analysis based on biomass landed distinguishes two groups in the population: (1) a group of species that is dominant downstream, containing primarily terminal predators and secondary consumers categorised as marine species that are occasional or accessory in estuaries, estuarine marine species, and estuarine species of marine origin; and (2) a group of species characteristic of the upstream region, dominated by a few species (Sarotherodon melanotheron, Tilapia guineensis, and Mugil cephalus) mainly of strictly estuarine and/or herbivorous categories and Elops lacerta, a carnivore fish. The outcomes of the two approaches are similar, and both indicate that the fish community in this estuary is under the influence of strong environmental disturbance. However, the scales at which the specific and functional approaches most reliably reflect environmental conditions are different. The taxonomic approach, i.e., the use of specific biomass is more appropriate at the ecosystem scale and therefore more accessible to local human communities, whereas the functional approach is better suited to regional and sub-regional studies because of the change in species composition from one environment to another.

AB  - Agroecosystems cover vast areas of land worldwide and are known to have a large impact on the environment, yet these highly modified landscapes are rarely considered as candidates for landscape design. While intentionally-designed agricultural landscapes could serve many different functions, few resources exist for evaluating the design of these complex landscapes, particularly at the scale of the whole-farm. The objective of this paper is to introduce an evolving framework for evaluating the design of agroecosystems based on a critical review of the literature on landscape rnultifunctionality and agroecology. We consider how agroecosystems might be designed to incorporate additional functions while adhering to agroecology principles for managing the landscape. The framework includes an assessment tool for evaluating farm design based on the extent of fine-scale land use features and their specific functions, to consider the present state of the farm, to plan for future conditions, or to compare alternative futures for the design of the farm. We apply this framework to two farms in Vermont that are recognized locally as successful, multifunctional landscapes. The Intervale Center, an agricultural landscape located within the city limits, serves as an incubator for new farm startups and provides unique cultural functions that benefit the local community. Butterworks Farm, a private operation producing organic yogurt and other food products, achieves important ecological functions through an integrated crop-livestock system. These farms and many others in Vermont serve as models of a framework that integrates landscape multifunctionality and agroecology in the design of the landscape. In the discussion section, we draw from the literature and our work to propose a set of important themes that might be considered for future research. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Groundwater is not only a vital resource, but also one of the largest terrestrial aquatic ecosystems on Earth. However, to date, ecological criteria are often not considered in routine groundwater monitoring, mainly because of the lack of suitable ecological assessment tools. Prokaryotic microorganisms are ubiquitous in groundwater ecosystems even under the harshest conditions, making them ideal bioindicators for ecological monitoring. We have developed a simple, inexpensive approach that enables ecological groundwater monitoring based on three microbiological parameters that can be easily integrated into existing routine monitoring practices: prokaryotic cell density (D) measured by flow cytometry; activity (A) measured as prokaryotic intracellular ATP concentrations using a simple celllysis-luminescence assay; and, as an optional parameter, the bioavailable carbon (C) measured as the concentration of assimilable organic carbon in a simple batch growth assay. We analyzed data for three case studies of different disturbances representing some of the main threats to groundwater ecosystems, i.e. organic contamination with hydrocarbons, surface water intrusion, and agricultural land use. For all three disturbances, disturbed samples could be reliably distinguished from undisturbed samples based on a single index value obtained from multivariate outlier analyses of the microbial variables. We could show that this multivariate approach allowed for a significantly more sensitive and reliable detection of disturbed samples compared to separate univariate outlier analyses of the measured variables. Furthermore, a comparison of non-contaminated aquifers from nine different regions across Germany revealed distinct multivariate signatures along the three microbial variables, which should be considered when applying our approach in practice. In essence, our approach offers a practical tool for the detection of disturbances of groundwater ecosystems based on microbial parameters which can be seamlessly extended in the future by additional parameters for higher sensitivity as well as flexibility.

AB  - Saronikos Gulf, including the industrial zone of Elefsis Bay and the Port of Piraeus, is one of the most anthropogenically impacted coastal regions of Greece. Distinct assemblages of benthic foraminifers in sediment samples, collected from this gulf in February 2012, defined three zones that reflect abiotic parameters of the sediments (e.g., organic carbon, metal content). A low-diversity assemblage, dominated by stress-tolerant Ammonia tepida and Bulimina spp., was characteristic of samples from Elefsis Bay. Samples from the western and central part of Saronikos Gulf were the most variable with respect to both abiotic parameters and the foraminiferal assemblage, characterized by a mix of stress-tolerant and more sensitive taxa, especially Bolivina spp. and Nonion fabum. Samples from the coast of Salamis and at the eastern sector of the gulf were characterized by a diverse assemblage that included Peneroplis pertusus, miliolids, and a variety of small, epiphytic rotaliid taxa. A new biotic index, the Foram Stress Index (FSI), is based on the relative percentages of two ecological groups of benthic foraminiferal species, grouped according to their tolerance/sensitivity to organic matter enrichment and weighted proportionately to obtain a formula to define five ecological-status classes. The PSI produced three rankings for these samples (Poor, Moderate and Good), that strongly correlate with the macroinvertebrate-classification tool known as the BENTIX Index. The FSI provides a new tool to assess sediment or substrata quality based upon the benthic foraminiferal assemblages, which are a significant component of living meiobenthic communities that are generally not considered in most biotic benthic indices.

AB  - Although generally considered environmentally friendly, wind power has been associated with extensive mortality of birds and bats. In this perspective, there is a need for reliable estimates of fatalities at wind farms, where the heterogeneity of the basic information, used among environmental assessment studies, is unlikely to support an accurate universal estimation method. We tested the applicability of the Stochastic Dynamic Methodology (StDM) to estimate bat fatalities, based on multifactorial cause-effect relationships (by integrating multi-model inference statistical analysis and dynamic modelling) between mortality estimates, detected fatalities and the selected key-components of the reality, such as the real number of bat mortalities simulated, the rate of carcasses removal, the searcher efficiency, the monitoring periodicity and the number of turbines for different realistic scenarios associated with particular wind farm conditions. Although some existing mortality estimators are considered accurate, the choice of a given universal formula for all mortality assessments, based on deterministic parameters and assumptions, may originate unsuspected errors. Therefore, we propose a flexible dynamic modelling framework, the StDM estimator, where the obtained algorithms are adaptable to the universe of application intended. The StDM estimator takes into account random, non-constant and scenario dependent parameters, providing bias-corrected estimates. The StDM estimator was applied for the European wind farm context and validated in the most cases tested, through the confrontation with independent data. Overall, this approach is considered a valuable tool to improve the quality of mortality estimates at onshore wind facilities, within the local, environmental and methodological gradients (including the cases where no mortality is detected), namely in the scope of environmental impact assessments and general ecological monitoring programmes.

AB  - Munition manufacturing, disposal, testing, training and other operations at military sites produced elevated levels of explosives and related materials in soil. The effects of these persistent and highly mobile in the environment energetic materials on soil biota have not been sufficiently investigated. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in conjunction with stakeholders, is developing Ecological Soil Screening Level (Eco-SSL) benchmarks for ecological risk assessment (ERA) of contaminants at Superfund sites to identify those contaminants in soil that warrant additional evaluation in a Baseline ERA, and to eliminate those that do not. Eco-SSLs are developed from literature values whenever sufficient quantity and quality of data exist. Insufficient data were available on the toxicity of energetic compounds, RDX and HMX, to soil invertebrates, necessitating toxicity testing. Tests were conducted under conditions preferred for Eco-SSL benchmarks, using a Sassafras sandy loam soil that supports relatively high bioavailability of test compounds. Toxicity testing was performed using enchytraeid reproduction test (ISO/16387 2001) measuring adult survival and juvenile production by the potworm Enchytraeus crypticus in freshly amended soil and weathered/aged amended soil. RDX or HMX had no effect on adult survival in the definitive tests in all treatment concentrations. Juvenile production EC20 values were 3,715 and 8,797 mg kg(-1) RDX in freshly amended and weathered/aged amended soils, respectively. Juvenile E. ctypticus production was not adversely affected by exposure to HMX in freshly amended and weathered/aged amended soils. Juvenile production was stimulated in freshly amended soil up to 21,750 mg kg(-1) HMX. Results of these toxicity studies will be submitted to the Eco-SSL Task Group for quality control review, and pending approval will be included in the Eco-SSL database for Eco-SSL derivation.

AB  - The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is one of the most currently acclaimed ecological topics. One remarkable aspect of tree communities in tropical forests and savannas is the concentration of individuals into few species or simply the species stem dominance. In addition, species dominance in biomass and productivity are indicators of how much it can affect ecosystem processes. Here, we investigated if tree species dominance in abundance is followed by a dominance in biomass and productivity, and if there is consistence in the functional traits associated to dominance in biomass, productivity, and stem abundance in neotropical savannas of Central and Southeastern Brazil. Our findings showed slightly stronger functional (biomass and productivity) dominance compared to the abundance dominance, with 3.4 and 4.2% of the species accounting for 50% of the biomass and productivity, respectively, and 4.3% of the species accounting for 50% of the individuals. There were overlaps, but mostly mismatches, between dominant species lists for biomass, productivity, and abundance, especially in the top three species. We found that the same traits which make a species capable to deal with savanna environmental odds (i.e., adaptations) and achieve high abundance, also make it possible for this species to reach larger diameters and consequently dominance in biomass. Species relative contributions to productivity responded to bark thickness, wood density and maximum potential size. The fact that just a few species concentrate most savanna trees, biomass, and productivity show a high level of adaptation of this species to the environmental conditions found in this biome. Regardless, the conservation of the entire pool of species is crucial because climate change, land use and species invasion might cause shifts in the vegetation structure and function.

AB  - Ecological interactions are rarely taken into account in environmental risk assessment. The objective of this work was to assess how interspecific competition affects the way plant species react to herbicides and more specifically how it modifies the concentration-response curves that can be built using ecotoxicological bioassays. To do this, we relied on the results of ecotoxicological bioassays on six herbaceous species exposed to isoproturon under two conditions: in presence and in absence of a competitor. At the end of the experiments, eleven endpoints were measured. We modelled these data using a hierarchical modelling framework designed to assess the effects of competition on each of the four parameters of the concentration response curves (e.g. the level of response at the control or the concentration at the inflection point of the curve) simultaneously for the six species. The modelled effects could be of three types, 1) competition had no effect on the parameter, 2) competition had the same effect on the parameter for all species and 3) competition had a different effect on the parameter for each species. Our main hypothesis was that different species would react differently to competition. Results showed that about a half of the estimated parameters showed a modification under competition pressure among which only a fourth showed a species-specific effect, the three other fourth showing the same effect between the different species. Our initial hypothesis was thus not supported as species tended to react in the same way to competition. The competition effect on plants was mainly negative, thus showing that they & nbsp;of (2021) were more affected by isoproturon under competition pressure. This study therefore establishes how competition modifies plant responses to chemical stress and how this interaction varies from one species to the other.& nbsp; (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Body size plays a key role for the productivity and resilience of marine populations. This work analyses the variation in body size indicators taken from similar to 400 000 individuals during the period 2000-2018 for a set of 20 key commercial species of the small-scale fishery of Galicia (SW Europe). Mean body size showed relatively stable inter-annual trends during the study period, and, at the year level, mean body size for most species followed seasonal cycles. Body size was negatively related to the number of individuals caught per haul. Bathymetry also explained part of the variation in individual body size with species-specific depth affinities. Common trends in the species' body size showed an increasing trend in the northern region while decreasing in the south suggesting differences in local environmental conditions and/or in the dynamics of the fishery. The skewness of body size distributions varied slightly from year to year, although some species showed significant trends. The annual trend of the species-specific skewness was negatively related to the proportion of immature individuals in the catch and positively related to the rate of change in abundance, suggesting a reduction of recruitment success in response to differences in size-selective exploitation patterns probably ascribed to minimum landing size being generally below size at maturity. The combination of body size and abundance indicators revealed a relatively stable performance of some of the most important resources targeted by the Galician small-scale fishery sector during the last two decades. However, our study highlights also the need to align management measures with biological reference points in order to prevent long-term reductions in stock productivity.

AB  - Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) have the potential to alter fish reproduction at various levels of organization. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a natural environment with heavily anthropogenic influence on the physiological processes involved in reproduction in the freshwater fish lambari (Astyanax fasciatus) using different biomarkers. Adult males and females were collected in different seasons from two distinct sites in the same watershed: Ponte Nova Reservoir (PN) considered a pristine or small anthropogenic influence reference point; and Billings Reservoir (Bil), subjected to a large anthropogenic impact. Biological indices, such as hepatosomatic index and gonadosomatic index (GSI), gonadal histomorphology, fecundity, and biomarkers such as plasma levels of estradiol (E2) as well as hepatic gene expression of its alfa nuclear receptor (ER alpha), were analyzed. Hepatic vitellogenin (VTG) gene expression was evaluated in both sexes, as an indicator of xenoestrogen exposure. Females collected at PN presented a typical annual variation reflected in GSI, whereas for those sampled at Bil the index did not change through the seasons. The higher concentration of E2 in males collected at Bil during spring/2013, together with the detection of VTG gene expression, suggest the presence of EDCs in the water. These EDCs may have also influenced fecundity of females from Bil, which was higher during winter and spring/2013. Gene expression of ERa and ovarian morphology did not differ between fish from both sites. Water conditions from Bil reservoir impacted by anthropic activity clearly interfered mainly with biomarkers of biological effect such as plasma E2 levels and absolute and relative fecundity, but also altered biomarkers of exposure as VTG gene expression. These facts support the notion that waterborne EDCs are capable of causing estrogenic activity in A. fasciatus.

AB  - Research on neonicotinoids and honeybees have changed focus from direct mortality to sublethal effects. In the present study, a published honeybee model, BEEHAVE, is used to compare induced colony level impact of pesticides including direct mortality, poor brood care, disorientation, and increased handling time in oilseed rape and sunflower crops. Actual effects on individual bees will depend on exposure concentrations, but in the present study large effects were enforced. In oilseed rape, poor brood care had the largest colony impact, because it created a bottleneck for spring build-up of the workforce, and colony impact for all effect types peaked 1 mo after exposure ceased. In sunflower, the later exposure changed the response so colony impact peaked during exposure, and the bottleneck was honey store build-up. In all scenarios, good forage mitigated effects substantially. It is concluded that field studies should continue at least 1 mo after exposure to ensure detection of ecologically relevant sublethal effects. The results indicated that even if a sublethal effect is difficult to detect in the field, subsequent ecologically relevant colony level impacts would be clear if studies are continued for 1 mo after exposure. Guidance for regulatory studies recommends extended observation periods, and published field studies already use extended observation periods, so it is concluded that current methods are adequate for detecting ecologically relevant sublethal effects. Although published laboratory and semifield studies conducted under controlled exposure conditions suggest that sublethal effects may occur, published field studies with neonicotinoid seed treatments, naturally foraging bees, and extended observation periods do not report colony-level effects, suggesting that in these studies no ecologically relevant sublethal effects occurred.

AB  - A 4.1 million m(3) coal ash release into the Emory and Clinch rivers in December 2008 at the Tennessee Valley Authority's Kingston Fossil Plant in east Tennessee, USA, prompted a long-term, large-scale biological monitoring effort to determine if there are chronic effects of this spill on resident biota. Because of the magnitude of the ash spill and the potential for exposure to coal ash-associated contaminants [e.g., selenium (Se), arsenic (As), and mercury (Hg)] which are bioaccumulative and may present human and ecological risks, an integrative, bioindicator approach was used. Three species of fish were monitored-bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), redear sunfish (L. microlophus), and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides)-at ash-affected and reference sites annually for 5 years following the spill. On the same individual fish, contaminant burdens were measured in various tissues, blood chemistry parameters as metrics of fish health, and various condition and reproduction indices. A multivariate statistical approach was then used to evaluate relationships between contaminant bioaccumulation and fish metrics to assess the chronic, sub-lethal effects of exposure to the complex mixture of coal ash-associated contaminants at and around the ash spill site. This study suggests that while fish tissue concentrations of some ash-associated contaminants are elevated at the spill site, there was no consistent evidence of compromised fish health linked with the spill. Further, although relationships between elevated fillet burdens of ash-associated contaminants and some fish metrics were found, these relationships were not indicative of exposure to coal ash or spill sites. The present study adds to the weight of evidence from prior studies suggesting that fish populations have not incurred significant biological effects from spilled ash at this site: findings that are relevant to the current national discussions on the safe disposal of coal ash waste.

AB  - Because lately the low bioindicative value of tolerant species from different taxonomic groups is often questioned, in this study, we hypothesized that tolerant diatoms may be used for effective temporal assessments of human pressure. We tested this on the lowland Bzura River in central Poland, on 156 diatom samples (DSs) from two study periods of 1972 with extremely severe point-source water pollution and of 2002-2004, where the complex wastewater management in the river catchment improved water quality considerably. Out of the total 295 diatom species recorded in the samples, only 133 tolerant ones were included in the study. Patterns in their abundance were recognized with a Kohonen artificial neural network (self-organizing map, SOM), whereas the species significantly associated with each SOM cluster of diatom samples were identified with the indicator value (IndVal) index and the Monte Carlo test. If the hypothesis tested was not supported, the assignation of DSs to the SOM clusters would be random. However, the separation of DSs from 1972 and 2002-2004 was almost perfect because the number of exceptions was as low as 4.5%. In addition, the relatively high number (64 out of 133) of tolerant species significantly associated with any SOM cluster (and respective environmental conditions at sites from which samples assigned to it come) supports the hypothesis tested. This means that almost half of the studied species are not evenly distributed in particular clusters as might be expected for highly tolerant species. The study proves that the abundances of many diatom species, currently classified as tolerant, carry quite precise information on the differences in the quality of the environment, and indicates those tolerant diatom species whose bioindicative potential may be highest.

AB  - To evaluate nitrogen (N) saturation in xeric environments, we measured hydrologic N losses, soil N pools, and microbial processes, and developed an N-budget for a chaparral catchment (Sierra Nevada, California) exposed to atmospheric N inputs of approximately 8.5 kg N ha(-1) y(-1). Dual-isotopic techniques were used to trace the sources and processes controlling nitrate (NO3-) losses. The majority of N inputs occurred as ammonium. At the onset of the wet season (November to April), we observed elevated streamwater NO3- concentrations (up to 520 mu mol l(-1)), concomitant with the period of highest gaseous N-loss (up to 500 ng N m(-2) s(-1)) and suggesting N-saturation. Stream NO3- delta N-15 and delta O-18 and soil N measurements indicate that nitrification controlled NO3- losses and that less than 1% of the loss was of atmospheric origin. During the late wet season, stream NO3- concentrations decreased (to <2 mu mol l(-1)) as did gaseous N emissions, together suggesting conditions no longer indicative of N-saturation. We propose that chaparral catchments are temporarily N-saturated at <= 8.5 kg N ha(-1) y(-1), but that N-saturation may be difficult to reach in ecosystems that inherently leak N, thereby confounding the application of N-saturation indicators and annual N-budgets. We propose that activation of N sinks during the typically rainy winter growing season should be incorporated into the assessment of ecosystem response to N deposition. Specifically, the N-saturation status of chaparral may be better assessed by how rapidly catchments transition from N-loss to N-retention.

AB  - Beach sand is a habitat that supports many microbes, including viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa (micropsammon). The apparently inhospitable conditions of beach sand environments belie the thriving communities found there. Physical factors, such as water availability and protection from insolation; biological factors, such as competition, predation, and biofilm formation; and nutrient availability all contribute to the characteristics of the micropsammon. Sand microbial communities include autochthonous species/phylotypes indigenous to the environment. Allochthonous microbes, including fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and waterborne pathogens, are deposited via waves, runoff, air, or animals. The fate of these microbes ranges from death, to transient persistence and/or replication, to establishment of thriving populations (naturalization) and integration in the autochthonous community. Transport of the micropsammon within the habitat occurs both horizontally across the beach, and vertically from the sand surface and ground water table, as well as at various scales including interstitial flow within sand pores, sediment transport for particle-associated microbes, and the large-scale processes of wave action and terrestrial runoff. The concept of beach sand as a microbial habitat and reservoir of FIB and pathogens has begun to influence our thinking about human health effects associated with sand exposure and recreational water use. A variety of pathogens have been reported from beach sands, and recent epidemiology studies have found some evidence of health risks associated with sand exposure. Persistent or replicating populations of FIB and enteric pathogens have consequences for watershed/beach management strategies and regulatory standards for safe beaches. This review summarizes our understanding of the community structure, ecology, fate, transport, and public health implications of microbes in beach sand. It concludes with recommendations for future work in this vastly under-studied area.

AB  - Tropical storm-related pulsed events in estuarine and coastal ecosystems have drawn increased attention to seek mechanisms for mitigating the aftermath of climate-driven natural disasters on community structure and ecosystem functions. Over the last few decades, two major hurricanes struck one of the largest estuaries in the Gulf of Mexico (Galveston Bay, Texas, USA) with the relatively remarkable magnitude of disturbances from the storm surge of Hurricane Ike in 2008 and the torrential rainfall and floods associated with Hurricane Harvey in 2017, which provided a natural experiment to examine the community resilience and ecosystem recovery in terms of external perturbations. Using a set of estuarine ecological indicators collected before and after the two hurricanes, we examined time-varying impacts of hurricanes on estuarine pelagic communities including hydrography, zooplankton and juvenile fish, estimated the recovery of zooplankton communities, and explored the relative importance of storm surge and floods with potential implications for the estuarine ecosystem function. Our findings showed: (1) significant acute changes in zooplankton community structure a few days after hurricanes mainly reflected the extreme floodwater discharge and intense physical actions; (2) zooplankton abundance displayed relatively faster recovery than the community structure and persistence of pulsed effects after hurricanes; (3) aftermaths of the two hurricanes exhibited distinct spatial arrangements of zooplankton assemblages associated with hydrographic factors largely signifying the relative impact of floodwater discharge and storm surge on pelagic communities; (4) extreme flooding appeared more devastating than storm surging with significant implications to community resiliency and functions of estuarine ecosystems. Given the predicted increasing frequency and intensity of hurricane activities, this study contributes to the improved understandings of hurricane-induced estuarine pelagic dynamics in support of better restoration and management of estuarine ecosystems in the face of anticipated climate-driven future disasters.

AB  - Kongsfjorden-Krossfjorden twin fjord ecosystem in Svalbard (Arctic), is facing enhanced warm Atlantic water intrusion from ocean as well as intensified melting from glaciers. It is an interesting ecosystem to study phytoplankton productivity under the two opposing processes. For phytoplankton productivity, pigments are used as potential photosynthetic biomass indicators and taxonomic biomarkers. However, due to labile nature of pigments, degradation - preservation distribution must be investigated to form essential framework for biomarker studies. With this motivation, we have undertaken the present work to study the spatial distribution of surface sedimentary pigments in the twin-fjord ecosystem. The pigments were analysed using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detector. A total of fifteen pigments were identified, which belonged to different classes - chlorophylls, pheopigments and carotenoids. Chlorophyll-a and pheophorbide-a were major pigments with concentration up to 700-800 ng g(-1) dry weight of sediment. Among carotenoids, fucoxanthin, diatoxanthin and prasinoxanthin were abundant with maximum concentration recorded up to 400-600 ng g(-1) dry weight. The distribution of the pigments varied significantly between the two fjords as well as in different regions of the fjord. Most of the pigments were significantly high in their concentration at Krossfjorden stations. Within Kongsfjorden, outer region showed higher concentration of pigments than inner. However, preservation was lesser for the outer fjord pigments than inner as confirmed by various pigment indices. Further, the overall distribution of phytoplankton communities derived from taxonomic biomarker pigments in Kongsfjorden-Krossfjorden sediments, was coherent with that of water during spring and summer. The distribution was dominated by diatoms, dinoflagellates, prasinophytes and prymnesiophytes.

AB  - Resource managers at Fort Benning, Georgia, must maintain environmental conditions necessary for military training as well as promote longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) habitat. Understory vegetation controls the eventual species composition of these forests but is also sensitive to military activity. Past research from an observational study at this site suggests that impacts from military activity are best indicated by understory plant families and Raunkiaer life forms - specifically an increase in cryptophytes (plants with underground buds) and therophytes (annual plants). Our study tests that conclusion experimentally using a tracked vehicle to manipulate an oak-pine forest occurring on an upland-riparian gradient. In May 2003, a D7 bulldozer removed extant vegetation and surface soil organic matter along three treatment transects. Braun-Blanquet vegetation surveys were conducted within plots in mid and late summer during 2003 and 2004. The response of total understory cover, bare ground cover, litter cover, species richness, family richness, Fabaceae cover and life-form cover was analyzed using repeated measures analyses of variance. Total understory cover, bare ground cover, species richness, family richness and cryptophyte cover showed a significant treatment x time interaction reflecting the transient response of these metrics to this isolated disturbance as most metrics returned to control values within two growing seasons. Although therophyte cover did not display significant interactions in this experiment, the increase in cryptophyte cover supports the use of life forms as indicators of mechanized disturbance to understory structure. While further experimental testing is needed across ecosystems and training activities, Raunkiaer life forms show potential to serve as part of a suite of indicators of understory structure and diversity in forest environments subject to military training.

AB  - Wetlands provide many important services throughout the world, with an estimated economic value that, in comparison to other ecosystems, far exceeds their relatively small global extent. In recognition of their importance, both national and international regulations exist to protect the world's remaining wetlands. Of growing interest is the "no-net-loss'' policy which permits unavoidable destruction of wetlands if compensated by restoration of degraded wetlands or creation of new wetlands. The fundamental assumption of no-net-loss is that wetlands can be created which function equivalently to natural wetlands. One integral function that wetlands perform is cycling of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. Here we demonstrate that loss of this nutrient-related function is not being mitigated by creation or restoration of wetlands. We compare indicators of plant-and microbial-mediated functions, as well as abiotic (e. g., soil character, hydrology) and biotic (e. g., plant community composition) structure, between 10 created or restored and 5 natural freshwater depressional wetlands in central Ohio, USA. Nutrient stocks were generally smaller and transformations slower in created wetlands than in natural wetlands, with little development over time. Of particular concern were differences in C-and N-related function. Created wetlands stored 90% less C within litter and 80% less C within soil and processed 60% less N through denitrification, on average compared to natural wetlands. Our study suggests that subversion of natural wetlands into restored or created wetlands could have large-scale environmental consequences such as reduced capacity for nitrate removal and C sequestration.

AB  - Considering the growing concern about the impact of anthropogenic inputs on coral reefs and coral reef lagoons, surprisingly little attention has been given to the relationship between those inputs and the trophic status of lagoon waters. The present paper describes the distribution of biogeochemical parameters in the coral reef lagoon of New Caledonia where environmental conditions allegedly range from pristine oligotrophic to anthropogenically influenced. The study objectives were to: (i) identify terrigeneous and anthropogenic inputs and propose a typology of lagoon waters, (ii) determine temporal variability of water biogeochemical parameters at time-scales ranging from hours to seasons. Combined ACP-cluster analyses revealed that over the 2000 km(2) lagoon area around the city of Noumea, "natural" terrigeneous versus oceanic influences affecting all stations only accounted for less than 20% of the spatial variability whereas 60% of that spatial variability could be attributed to significant eutrophication of a limited number of inshore stations. ACP analysis allowed to unambiguously discriminating between the natural trophic enrichment along the offshore-inshore gradient and anthropogenically induced eutrophication. High temporal variability in dissolved inorganic nutrients concentrations strongly hindered their use as indicators of environmental status. Due to longer turn over time, particulate organic material and more specifically chlorophyll a appeared as more reliable nonconservative tracer of trophic status. Results further provided evidence that ENSO occurrences might temporarily lower the trophic status of the New Caledonia lagoon. It is concluded that, due to such high frequency temporal variability, the use of biogeochemical parameters in environmental surveys require adapted sampling strategies, data management and environmental alert methods.

AB  - Riverine ecosystems are some of the most biologically diverse on earth, but are also among the most threatened by anthropogenic actions. Lack of local-scale studies monitoring changes in riverine populations makes it difficult to determine how communities respond to region-specific anthropogenic threats. In this study, we compared fish assemblage structure in six rivers in the Lake Victoria Basin (LVB), Kenya. Data collected during different periods between 2004 and 2018 were used to derive abundance size-spectra parameters and community diversity metrics as proxies for ecosystem condition and function. Species dominance in the rivers was high with only five species accounting for > 72% of cumulative relative abundance while, 33 species contributed < 10% of all individuals sampled. One-way analysis of similarity test (ANOSIM) indicated significant dissimilarity in fish composition between the rivers (Global R = 0.405, p = 0.0187) while, similarity percentage analysis (SIMPER) partitioned differences to variations in relative abundance of mainly two species (Labeobarbus altianalis, and Labeo victorianus). Eight species were restricted to single river basins suggesting presence of local endemism. Abundance size-spectra parameters (intercepts and slopes) used as proxies for food-web capacity and ecological efficiency fluctuated over time with periods of relative stability, indicating spatial (among rivers) and temporal (yearly) variations in ecological processes in the rivers. The food-web capacity and ecological efficiency indices showed basin-specific relationships with community metrics (dominance, richness, evenness, Shannon-Weiner and Simpson diversity indices) and catch per unit effort (CPUE), suggesting their potential use as indicators of ecosystem structure. The findings of this study show promise in the use of size-spectra parameters as proxies for riverine ecosystem structure and functioning under a gradient of perturbation.

AB  - Ecosystem regime shifts are abrupt changes from one dynamical state to another, such as the shift from a clear-water state to an algal bloom state in lakes. These transitions are hard to forecast but theory suggests that early warning indicators can predict impending regime shifts that may allow for management intervention to prevent or mitigate an unwanted change. The efficacy of early warning indicators has been demonstrated in modeling and laboratory experiments, but rarely in the field, where environmental drivers are numerous and interacting. It is unclear if early warning indicators are observable or timely enough to allow for intervention under these conditions. We performed six whole-lake experimental nutrient additions to test the utility of early warning indicators for predicting the regime shift from a clear-water state to a cyanobacteria-dominated state. The lakes were monitored for increases in resilience indicators including rises in standard deviation and autocorrelation of algal pigments and dissolved oxygen saturation. A statistical method, quickest detection, determined when resilience indicators in manipulated lakes deviated substantially from those in a reference ecosystem. Blooms occurred in five of the six lake-years. Although there was substantial variability in bloom size and timing, at least one indicator foreshadowed the peak chlorophyll a concentration in all instances. Early warnings occurred 1-57 d prior to a bloom, which in some instances, may allow managers to notify the public or intervene to prevent blooms. The resilience indicators generally identified changes in resilience over time within a lake and also ranked large differences in resilience among lakes. Our findings suggest that resilience indicators can be useful for classifying ecosystems on a landscape and across time with respect to proximity to a critical threshold.

AB  - This study aimed to assess anthropogenic impact of surrounding population in the Private Reserve of Natural Heritage at Pantanal, the world's largest freshwater wetland ecosystem located in the centre of South America. Viral aetiological agents of acute gastroenteritis as rotavirus A (RVA), noroviruses, human adenoviruses, klassevirus and of hepatitis, as hepatitis A virus, were investigated in different aquatic matrices. Annual collection campaigns were carried out from 2009 to 2012, alternating dry and rainy seasons. Viral particles present in the samples were concentrated by the adsorption-elution method, with negatively charged membranes, and detected by qualitative and quantitative PCR. From a total of 43 samples at least one virus was detected in 65% (28) of them. Viruses were detected in all matrices with concentrations ranging from 2x10(2) to 8<bold></bold>3x10(4) genome copies per litre. A significant higher RVA frequency was observed in the dry season. Our data revealing dissemination of human enteric viruses in water matrices both inside and outside the reserve could be useful to trace faecal contamination in the environment and to minimize the risk of infection by exposure of susceptible individuals.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyThis study is part of a collaborative project designed to investigate the environmental and health conditions of the Private Reserve of Natural Heritage at Pantanal, the largest seasonally flooded wetland in the world. The project aimed to promote health and quality of human and wildlife extending technical-scientific knowledge about pathogens present in the region. By assessing the occurrence of human enteric viruses in different water matrices we demonstrated the anthropogenic impact of surrounding population and pointed out the potential risk of infection by exposure of susceptible individuals.

AB  - We explored the potential of airborne laser scanner (ALS) data to improve Bayesian models linking biodiversity indicators of the understory vegetation to environmental factors. Biodiversity was studied at plot level and models were built to investigate species abundance for the most abundant plants found on each study site, and for ecological group richness based on light preference. The usual abiotic explanatory factors related to climate, topography and soil properties were used in the models. ALS data, available for two contrasting study sites, were used to provide biotic factors related to forest structure, which was assumed to be a key driver of understory biodiversity. Several ALS variables were found to have significant effects on biodiversity indicators. However, the responses of biodiversity indicators to forest structure variables, as revealed by the Bayesian model outputs, were shown to be dependent on the abiotic environmental conditions characterizing the study areas. Lower responses were observed on the lowland site than on the mountainous site. In the latter, shade-tolerant and heliophilous species richness was impacted by vegetation structure indicators linked to light penetration through the canopy. However, to reveal the full effects of forest structure on biodiversity indicators, forest structure would need to be measured over much wider areas than the plot we assessed. It seems obvious that the forest structure surrounding the field plots can impact biodiversity indicators measured at plot level. Various scales were found to be relevant depending on: the biodiversity indicators that were modelled, and the ALS variable. Finally, our results underline the utility of lidar data in abundance and richness models to characterize forest structure with variables that are difficult to measure in the field, either due to their nature or to the size of the area they relate to.

AB  - This article examines the impact of recreational activities on herbaceous cover of forests on the example of an urban environment in Central Podolia. The features of changes in environmental conditions of ecotypes of an urban forest have been shown through the systematic, biomorphological and ecomorphic structure of the herbaceous cover, the ratio of ecological groups, changes in type of ecological strategy of species, assessment of ecological fractions valences, and phytodiversity. We found 78 species of vascular plants. The most diverse families are Asteraceae, Poaceae and Lamiaceae. The biomorphological range of phytodiversity of the intensive recreational zone is characterized by a high proportion of adventive and ruderal species, dominance of vegetative mobile species, forming of monodominant groups and disturbed distribution of all spectrum types for coenotic morphs. Perennial hemicryptophytes dominate in the spectrum of life forms. The share of therophytes increased along the gradient of recreational transformation. Unrosellate herbal plants dominate in the structure of aboveground shoots and leaf placement, plants that don't have special modifications dominate in the structures of underground shoots. Helophytes dominated in the analysis of heliomorphic plants. Mesophytes dominated almost everywhere. The share of hydrocontrastophobes increased with a gradual removal from places of recreation. Changes in acidomorphic and nitromorphic structures of plants were not found. Types of transitional groups of ecological strategies, including CR-, CS-, and CRS-strategies prevailed. The share of patiens diminished. Exsplerents from all types of primary ecological strategies dominated. Analysis of ecological valence fractions showed that species of hemi-euryvalent and euryvalent fractions dominate among hydromorphes, hemi-euryvalent species dominate among ecogroups of scale variability humidification of soil, hemystenovalences species dominate among trophomorphes. Euryvalenct fractions were absent in soil aeration ecogroups. The overall measure of phytodiversity is at its maximum in the zone of weak recreational transformation.

AB  - In water-limited environments, transpiration may minimize deep drainage on engineered covers used for hazardous waste disposal. However, comparative studies investigating plant ecophysiology and water use on engineered covers and natural sites are limited. Water use patterns and plant-water relations of evergreen shrubs were monitored in semi-arid Western Australia to (1) investigate the response of plant-water relations and shrub transpiration to soil moisture changes and (2) quantify stand transpiration and its contribution to the water balance. The shrubs showed conservative (<20cmhr-1) but persistent transpiration. Differential response to rainfall pulses was evident among species; sap velocity for Acacia bivenosa and Acacia inaequilatera increased by 20-103% (p<0 center dot 05) after rainfall events exceeding 15mm but declined rapidly to pre-storm levels. On the contrary, sap velocity for Acacia pruinocarpa increased by 61% after large pulse (83 and 127mm) associated with cyclonic activity and remained high (10-15cmhr-1) thereafter. These transpiration patterns suggested contrasting rooting patterns among the species. Sap velocity was low (<20mmhr-1) for all species, even when moisture was readily available. Annual shrub transpiration was 65 (engineered cover) and 81mm (natural shrubland), accounting for 16 and 20% of annual rainfall (395mm). Stand characteristics, plant ecophysiology and shrub transpiration were comparable for both sites, demonstrating the importance of using topsoil as a growth medium and seedbank in revegetation. Overall, the study provided insights on ecophysiological behaviour of artificial landforms, and the first empirical evidence suggesting rapid and successful restoration of mined lands can be achieved under semi-arid conditions.

AB  - Since the 1970s liming has been practised on a large scale in Sweden to mitigate acidification and several thousand lakes and streams are limed repeatedly. The Swedish monitoring program ISELAW (Integrated Studies of the Effects of Liming Acidified Waters) studies the long-term effects of liming. This paper summarizes the paleolimnological part of the program. Sediment cores from 12 lakes were analysed to study the development of the lakes from pre-industrial time until the present, and address questions about natural conditions and the effects of early human impact, acidification, and liming. Diatoms were used to reconstruct the pH history and to study shifts in species composition due to acidification and liming. Analyses of lead and spheroidal carbonaceous particles were applied for indirect dating and as indicators of the atmospheric deposition of pollutants associated with acid rain. Pollen analysis was performed in eight of the lakes to study the vegetation and agricultural history. The natural pH (prior to human disturbance) was between 5.3 and 6.5 in the eight lakes where the complete post-glacial sediment sequence was recovered. Pollen from anthropochores and apophytes indicated early agricultural land use in the vicinity of the lakes from 1000 to 2000 years ago, and pH increased with land use in six of these lakes. Five of the lakes have been acidified during recent decades, and in all 12 lakes some effects of liming were recorded in the diatom assemblage. The lakes show different responses to liming, including a return to a pre-acidification diatom composition or a shift to a state previously not recorded in the lake's histories. This study accentuates the complexity of biological response to acidification and liming, and highlights the importance of historical perspectives to assess the current state of a lake's ecosystem and to establish adequate restoration goals.

AB  - The potential of applying the analysis of freshwater midges (Chironomidae) for current questions in geographical research is examined. Chironomids are cosmopolitan in distribution and frequently the most abundant insects found in freshwater ecosystems. The capacity of the family to tolerate large gradients of pH, salinity, depth, oxygen concentration, temperature and productivity enables members of the Chironomidae to occupy virtually every available niche present in freshwater environments. In addition to wide distribution and abundance, Chironomidae are well suited for paleolimnological studies because the larvae possess chitinous head capsules which are well-preserved in lake sediment and relatively easily recovered and identified. As a result, chironomids are increasingly being used to track a number of natural and anthropogenically induced limnological changes resulting from atmospheric contamination, eutrophication and increased lake water salinity. Other areas in which subfossil chironomid analysis has provided valuable insight include climate change, phylogentics and biogeography and aquatic ecosystem dynamics and development. Details describing the biology and ecology of the Chironomidae that are directly relevant to their use in paleoenvironmental and biogeographical studies are presented. The methodology describing the recovery and identification of subfossil chironomid remains is reviewed. A generalized overview of the statistical methods that are commonly employed in relating the modern distribution of chironomids to specific aspects of the environment, i.e., the calibration dataset approach, is briefly discussed. Case studies that highlight the various uses and applications of chironomid analysis in areas of paleoenvironmental and biogeographical research relevant to geographers are described. Lastly, the current status of chironomid research in academic geography is discussed and suggestions of potential future research directions are made.

AB  - This paper illustrates an integrated physical-biological approach to investigate the effects on the coastal environment of the construction of a large embankment along the shore of Monterosso Bay, NW Italy. The embankment protrudes from the natural shoreline for more than 100 meters and has deflected the longshore current toward the offshore, as indicated by grain-size and mineralogical areal distributions of bottom sediments, and by the orientation of bedforms. Consequently, the downcurrent portion of the beach relative to the embankment has become sediment-starved and the site of finer-grained sedimentation, and severe shoreline retreat has occurred, as indicated by sequential analysis of topographic maps and by the comparison of non-parametric photographs. This trend is recorded by the areal distribution of two seagrasses (marine phanerogams) along the bay: Posidonia oceanica-whose slow growth requires stable environmental conditions and a preference for coarse-grained sandy substratum-is present as dense and healthy meadows in the upcurrent portion of the bay whereas Cymodocea nodosa-an opportunistic, pioneer species capable of surviving in stressful environments-is present only along the downcurrent (eastern) portion of the bay where it is replacing a progressively retreating Posidonia meadow. This is substantiated by (i) direct underwater observation of the remnants of a dead P. oceanica meadow along the eastern portion of the bay and (ii) interviews with the local population pointing to a more extensive Posidonia meadow along the eastern portion of the bay prior to the construction of the embankment. Thus, biological parameters such as the density and health of marine phanerogams match physical parameters (grain-size distribution patterns) more traditionally employed in coastal studies and can provide significant clues on both natural and anthropogenic medium-term coastal dynamics.

AB  - Understanding the metal pollution can help governments and estuary management groups manage metal inputs. Here, we comprehensively analyzed the behaviors of seven metals Cd, Zn, Cu, As, Pb, Cr, and Hg in water and the responses of these metals to hydrological connectivity in the Pearl River Estuary. The analyses were based on the field measurements of August-2016 in the estuary and January-2016 in the upper river mouth. We also assessed the ecosystem health of these metals. Overall, this estuary had an overall moderate pollution level, with occasional severe perturbations. The mean concentration of individual metal was in the order of Zn > As > Cu > Cr > Pb > Cd > Hg. The eastern estuary was more heavily polluted by metals (notably, Zn, Cd, and Cu) than the western estuary; this condition was attributable to sewage and industrial effluent discharges from the eastern urban cities of Dongguan and Shenzhen. Longitudinally, high levels of Cd and Zn appeared in the upper estuary, while elevated levels of Cu, As, Pb, Cr, and Hg were found in the middle and lower estuaries. The riverine inputs and estuarine mixing significantly influenced the distribution and movement of trace metals in the estuary, and have contributed to phytoplankton productivity (chlorophyll-a > 10 mu g/L). River inflow inhibited the vertical diffusion of metals, and tidal currents facilitated surface-to-bottom mixing. Cu and Cd posed ecological risks. We determined the source contributions and transport routes of the metals using principal component analysis combining with multiple linear regression. The results of this study suggest that the source apportionment of metals can help to manage the source input entering into the estuary. Further, identified hydrological connectivity of metals can inform water quality managers in the highly anthropogenically influenced estuary.

AB  - Secondary succession involves dynamic feedback among vegetation, environmental conditions and biota. Nevertheless, the recovery of tropical forests after anthropic management is often evaluated based solely on vegetation cover, which is easier to measure and requires less equipment and expertise than the assessment of soil and microclimate, but does not always reflect synchronic and integrative recovery. Given the convenience of measuring vegetation properties, this study aimed to identify the vegetation traits that could best inform on the progress of integrative recovery through the exploration of correlations among changes in soil, vegetation and microclimate over the course of succession and by the selection of the most informative and suitable vegetation indicators. We measured vegetation, soil and microclimate properties along a successional gradient in the tropical dry forest region of the coast of Jalisco, Mexico. Biand multi-variate analyses revealed clear correlation between changes in soil and microclimate components. Bivariate and stepwise regressions indicated that basal area, litterfall, plant richness and litter mass were the vegetation properties that were the most related to soil and microclimate recovery. Basal area was the most closely related to soil and microclimate recovery, and it was also related to the recovery of soil P, a key soil property. However, litter mass, which was highly correlated with basal area, is a less time-consuming alternative measurement that may be more manageable for assessing many sites. Litter mass is also a key variable connecting aboveground and belowground recovery processes, making it a particularly useful variable for evaluating integrative recovery. Since all indicators can be affected by natural or human disturbance, the choice of indicators to be used in each evaluation should be cautious and, whenever possible, consider the history of the plot. We discuss and suggest the complementary use of several indicators when disturbance has occurred during secondary succession.

AB  - The present study was carried out in a metals smelting area to identify the phase associations of metals in solid matrix with the application of mBCR procedure of sequential extraction and to assess the elemental mobility, probable bioavailability and their ecological risks in relation to soil contamination levels. pH (5.73-6.85) of the studied soil is acidic to neutral in nature and showed some effects on the distribution pattern related to extent of contamination. The study revealed that the mean Pb (790 +/- 112 mg/kg), Cd (21.02 +/- 3.26 mg/kg) and As (60.33 +/- 6.30 mg/kg) exhibited the high concentration due to the severe impact of smelting activities, which is with high impact than the level Ill standard of soil quality prescribed in Mainland China (GB15618-1995). The overall percentage of metal content in different fractions is in the sequence of Residual > Oxidixable > Reducible > Exchangeable fraction. Though, an appreciable amount of Pb is fastened in the reducible fraction, Cu and As are tied in the oxidizable fraction and lastly, Cd is in exchangeable fraction. Under changing environmental conditions these non-residual metals may be released back to the surrounding soil environment by various processes of remobilization. The percentage of metal in the exchangeable and carbonate fractions (% F1 for BCR) can be measured by Risk assessment code (RAC), which is used to assess the environmental risks and the potential risk levels of heavy metals like As, Pb, Cd and Cu ranged 4.09-11.52, 10.05-15.26, 29.54-42.08 and 8.50-16.54 and respectively. According to soil pollution indices and risk assessment criteria the metals had the following order: Cd > Pb > Cu > As. The results indicate a high environmental mobility for heavy metals in the studied region which represents high degree of potential risk in ecology.

AB  - Fish domestication is an evolutionary process arising in captivity through genetic and developmental mechanisms, producing organisms performing more poorly than wild conspecifics in the natural environment. Culture conditions could be suboptimal for fish at particular life cycle stages, presenting environmental disturbances leading to developmental instability. The limited size of captive lots, moreover, can result in the loss of genetic variation, and the resulting homozygosity (as well as hybridization and mutation) could have strong harmful effects on developmental stability. Rainbow trout are the most widely-cultured species in Europe and North America, having been in culture for more than a century. Prolonged artificial selection for desired traits and incidental effects of domestication has led to the development of a farmed type'. Fluctuating asymmetry, variations in meristic counts, and skeletal anomalies were examined in several rainbow trout captive and wild clonal lines as indicators of developmental instability. Differences in developmental stability were identified among lines and correlated with different degrees of exposure to captivity. Some relationship between meristic counts and domestication level was found in the present study, with the number of vertebrae and of dorsal pterygiophores and rays being the strongest predictors of the domestication level. However, the occurrence of skeletal anomalies and fluctuating asymmetry were apparently not related to the level of exposure to captivity. The findings of the present study will facilitate the selection of clonal lines with divergent phenotypes for subsequent quantitative trait loci analyses aimed at identifying genome regions linked with morpho-anatomical and physiological adaptive responses to captivity.(c) 2015 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2015, 114, 608-628.

AB  - There is a need to develop efficient tools to prevent damage to marine ecosystems due to pollution. Since microalgae play a key role in marine ecosystems, they are considered potentially useful for quick and sensitive toxicity bioassays. In this study an integrative analysis has been carried out of the anti-oxidant enzyme activities of marine microalgae species. Three marine microalgae species (Cylindrotheca closterium, a benthic diatom; Phaeodactylum tricomutum, a diatom which has been used as model organism in toxicity bioassays; and Rhodomonas salina, a cryptophyceae which is considered to present a certain level of heterotrophy) were exposed to selected concentrations of three. model pollutants: copper (5 and 10 mu g L-1), atrazine (25 and 50 mu g L-1) and Irgarol (0.5 and 1.0 mu g L-1). These pollutant concentrations are environmentally relevant for coastal ecosystems, and have been selected for checking the efficiency of the reactive oxygen intermediate (ROI) scavenging enzyme system of these organisms. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APx) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities were measured at the end of 24 h exposure. The integrated biomarker response (IBR) index - in our case for oxidative stress - has been employed to evaluate the ROI-scavenging enzyme system for each species and each treatment. In general, the SOD and CAT enzyme activities measured were higher in exposed populations than in controls, whereas APx and GPx activities showed the opposite trend. These microalgae showed significant responses of oxidative stress biomarkers at environmentally relevant concentrations for the assayed pollutants and short exposure periods, conditions that most other model organisms cannot match. Therefore microalgae present clear advantages over other species for their prospective employment in an "early warning system". (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and aim - Mountain streams represent sensitive ecosystems of prime importance for biodiversity conservation. However, the knowledge of the impact of sewage pollution related to intensive recreational exploitation is still limited in these habitats. Our aim was to assess the response of stream diatom assemblages to sewage pollution in the Giant Mountains and the Bohemian Forest, and to find the main factors influencing the community structure.
   Methods - Epilithic samples from sixteen streams were collected, both in unaffected stream sections and at sites downstream of sewage outflows from mountain cottages or small villages. Basic physical and chemical parameters were measured and relative abundances of diatoms were determined using light microscopy.
   Key results - A total number of 153 diatom taxa belonging to 44 genera were identified. Based on species data, samples were divided into two groups: the first belonged mainly to sites influenced by pollution, whereas the second consisted of not or slightly affected sites. Both groups were further divided into several subgroups characterised by specific ecological conditions and assemblage composition. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed five environmental parameters with significant influence on diatom species composition, some of which were related to sewage pollution (pH, water temperature, discharge volume and concentrations of nitrate nitrogen and organic nitrogen).
   Conclusions - As a consequence of sewage pollution, oligo- to mesotraphentic taxa were outcompeted by pollution tolerant taxa. However, pollution had no significant influence on diatom diversity, which was similar at sites both upstream and downstream of the outflows. In this study, diatom assemblages performed well as indicators of sewage pollution, and biomonitoring proved to be a useful tool in the detection of environmental stress in mountain streams. Overall, the response of diatom assemblages showed that an increase of recreational activities might significantly alter the ecological status of these ecosystems.

AB  - Urine uranium concentrations are the best biological indicator for identifying exposure to depleted uranium (DU). Internal exposure to DU causes an increased amount of urine uranium and a decreased ratio of U-235/U-238 in urine samples, resulting in measurements that vary between 0.00725 and 0.002 (i.e., natural and depleted uranium's U-235/U-238 ratios, respectively). A method based on inductively coupled plasma dynamic reaction cell mass spectrometry (ICP-DRC-MS) was utilized to identify DU in urine by measuring the quantity of total U and the U-235/U-238 ratio. The quantitative analysis was achieved using U-233 as an internal standard. The analysis was performed both with and without the reaction gas oxygen. The reaction gas converted ionized U-235(+) and U-238(+) into (UO2+)-U-235 (m/z = 267) and (UO2+)-U-238 (m/z= 270). This conversion was determined to be over 90% efficient. A polyatomic interference at m/z 234.8 was successfully removed from the U-235 signal under either DRC operating conditions (with or without oxygen as a reaction gas). The method was validated with 15 urine samples of known uranium compositions. The method detection limit for quantification was determined to be 0.1 pg U mL(-1) urine and an average coefficient of variation (CV) of 1-2% within the sample measurements. The method detection limit for determining U-235/U-238 ratio was 3.0 pg U mL(-1) urine. An additional 21 patient samples were analyzed with no information about medical history. The measured U-235/U-238 ratio within the urine samples correctly identified the presence or absence of internal DU exposure in all 21 patients.

AB  - The paper analyzes the integrated fuzzy model with minimal latency in the location routing inventory of perishable multi-product materials, taking into account environmental constraints. Due to the corrupt nature of some items, minimizing the latency is very important in designing the supply chain systems of perishable items. On the other hand, considering environmental constraints provides a model for adapting as much as possible to real-world conditions. For this purpose, according to the above, a multi-period model was designed with three main objective functions, including minimizing the total supply chain costs, minimizing networks time, and minimizing the amount of pollution caused by chain activities. Due to the complex nature of the problem, the need to use metaheuristic approaches is inevitable. Therefore, two genetic algorithms NSGA II and PESA II were used in large, medium and small scales and the Epsilon constraint approach was used for small-scale problems. The results of the performance of algorithms based on standard indicators show better performance of NSGA II in small sizes and higher efficiency of PESA II in medium and large dimensions in terms of solution time and proximity to the Pareto boundary. Also, according to the results obtained through sensitivity analysis on the two main parameters of the problem, it was found that increasing the duration of corruption does not change costs and pollution, but increases the time of arrival of goods. On the other hand, by reducing the cost of transporting goods, we see a significant reduction in costs, but there is no change in the second and third objective functions, i.e. the time of arrival of goods and pollution.

AB  - The complex relationships that exist between terrestrial mammals and their habitats make African ecosystems highly interactive environments. Anthropogenic activities including climate change have altered geochemical cycles, which influence nutrient availability and deficiency at local, regional and global scales. As synergistic and antagonistic interactions occur between essential elements at both deficiency and excess concentrations, the differences in feeding strategy between trophically distinct groups of terrestrial vertebrates are likely to influence the degree to which overall nutrient needs are met or may be deficient. The overall aim of this study was to investigate and compare quantitative differences of nine essential elements in terrestrial vertebrates occupying different trophic levels within two protected areas; Tswalu Kalahari Reserve (TKR) and Manyeleti Nature Reserve (MNR) South Africa, using faeces as an analytical matrix. Results from linear mixed effects models highlight that concentrations varied widely between individuals. Overall, measured concentrations above their respective means were evident for B and Mn in herbivores, Fe in omnivores and Cu, Co, Fe, Se and Zn in carnivores. Measured concentrations of Mo and Ni did not differ significantly between trophic groups. Although site-specific differences were evident for specific elements, measured mean concentrations of B, Co, Cu, Fe, Mo, Ni, Se and Zn were significantly higher overall at the MNR study site compared to the TKR site. This is the first study to noninvasively assess essential element concentrations across trophic levels in free ranging African wildlife species within protected areas of the savannah biome. Combined with the assessment of environmental matrices, this approach can be used as an effective diagnostic tool for the assessment of animal welfare and the management of protected areas globally.

AB  - This paper examines the identification of key indicators that could be used to measure the success of reclamation plants in post-exploration oil and gas mining areas. The main objective of this research was to . find key indicators or variables for evaluating the level success of reclamation results in the post-mining of oil and gas area. In this study, 44 environmental variables of the physical, biological, soil, water and air indicators were analyzed from 70 field plots of 6 reclamation and 2 natural forest sites. The analysis methods included (1) cluster analysis using the Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering method with the Ward's method, and (2) quadratic discriminant analysis. The results of the clustering analysis showed that there were some clusters due to variation of biomass, water, soil and air conditions. The three clusters developed based on water and/or air variables provided high cophenetic correlation (0.80) with low within-cluster (14.5%) and high between-cluster variations (85.5%). Based on the multicollinearity analysis, average vector difference test, variance matrix variance test, unidimensional test of each variable and quadratic discriminant function, this study found that there were 3 key indicators determining variations of the quality of the reclamation plantations within the study sites, namely, biological indicator of biomass volume (Bio_B); soil indicator of P content in the soil (Tnh_P), saturation base of soil (Tnh_Kb), Manganese (Mn) content in the soil (Tnh_Mn), Sulfur content in the soil (Tnh_S), percentage ofash in the soil (Tnh_Ab), percentage of clay in the soil (Tnh_Li), and water indicator of chloride content in the surface water (Air_Cl). The examination on four classes of the reclamation quality showed that the classes were successfully classified having excellent cross-validation error matrix with overall accuracy more than 90%.

AB  - Drinking water reservoir is threatened globally due to anthropogenic contamination and thus in need of more attention. Here, we comprehensively investigated the occurrence, distribution and risk assessment of representative antibiotics in a large drinking water reservoir (Fengshuba Reservoir, China). The total concentrations of antibiotics in the water phase, porewater phase, sediment phase and soil phase (drawdown area) were in the ranges of 195-569 ng/L, 47.1-333 ng/L, 114-272 mu g/kg and 2.84-77.2 mu g/kg, respectively. The dominant antibiotic was CIP in both the water and porewater phases, while it was OTC in the sediment phase. For the water phase, seasonal factor consisting hydrologic condition and pattern of antibiotic use could influence the occurrence level and environmental fate of antibiotics. In contrast, exogenous particles derived from the soils that had used manures during the spring planting season coupled with heavy rainfall was responsible for the occurrence level and composition of antibiotics in the sediment phase. Moreover, Chl-alpha, NO3-,TP and EC were the most dominant factor influencing the antibiotic distributions in the water phase, porewater phase, sediment phase and soil phase, respectively. Pseudo-partitioning coefficients indicated that PENV and PENG might accumulate more easily into the sediments from the aqueous phase compared with other antibiotics. Risk assessments suggested that TC might pose high risks to the aquatic ecosystem, but the antibiotics presented no risk to the health of consumers. Generally, TC could be used as a promising indicator for evaluating the occurrence and potential risk of antibiotics in Fengshuba Reservoir. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - According to climate science, ocean warming is one of the current and future greatest threats to coastal ecosystems. Projection scenarios for the end of this century show that tropical intertidal ecosystems are particularly at risk. In this study we optimized and tested a holistic method for bio-monitoring present and projected thermal pressure in such ecosystems, in order to assess organism vulnerability to ocean warming. Several species representative of different animal groups (fish, crustaceans and gastropods) were collected from the field and subjected to an experimental trial for 28 days, testing two temperatures: control (present seawater summer temperature) and elevated temperature (+3 degrees C, projected seawater temperature anomaly for 2100). Muscle samples were collected weekly to quantify several biomarkers of: i) macromolecular damage (protein unfolding and denaturation, and lipid peroxidation), ii) reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers (antioxidant enzymes), and iii) body condition (energy reserves and body mass). These biomarkers were combined in integrated biomarker response (IBR) indices, either in three separate stress response categories (as previously defined) or in a unique combined analysis of overall physiological performance. Both approaches suggest that temperature affected IBRs, with increasing temperatures significantly impairing the overall health of individuals. Biomarkers of lower levels of biological organization indicated deleterious effects of temperature, whereas biomarkers of higher levels suggested maintenance of performance after chronic exposure. Overall indices combining the estimates of biomarkers across levels of biological organization are essential to predict the vulnerability of species, or populations, to climate warming. Such indices may assist managers and stakeholders in the establishment of monitoring programs and environmental policies toward the conservation of fragile coastal systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - 1. Cover crop mixtures with complementary plant functional traits including biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) may supply nitrogen (N) to farm fields while simultaneously providing other ecosystem functions such as N retention and weed suppression (i.e., multifunctionality). Understanding variation in these relationships across farms can help advance trait-based research in agroecology and ecological approaches to nutrient management.
   2. This on-farm experiment explored the contributions of two-and three-species cover crop mixtures, which combined legumes, brassicas and cool season grasses, to ecosystem functions across a gradient of soil fertility levels driven by farm management history.
   3. I evaluated the predictions that functional trait diversity of the cover crops would explain variation in multifunctionality, and that legume biomass and BNF within mixtures would be inversely correlated with indicators of soil N availability from organic matter across the farm gradient.
   4. Ecosystem functions varied widely across farms. As expected, functional diversity was a significant predictor of multifunctionality, although the relationship was weak. Cover crop mixtures had significantly greater multifunctionality than a cereal rye monoculture, though not at the highest observed levels of each function, indicating trade-offs among functions. Linear regression models showed that legume biomass and BNF were negatively correlated with soil properties indicative of N availability from soil organic matter, whereas non-legume and weed biomass were positively correlated with other measures of soil fertility.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Cover crop mixtures can increase functional diversity within crop rotations. Designing mixtures with complementary plant traits may be particularly effective for increasing multifunctionality and agroecosystem sustainability. On-farm research to understand variation in biological nitrogen fixation, which is both a plant trait and a key ecosystem function, across heterogeneous soil conditions, can inform management of soil fertility based on ecological principles.

AB  - Adopting macrobenthic process indicators with clear connections to ecosystem function should facilitate assessments of inherently variable estuarine ecosystems. Most current macrobenthic indicators do not directly reflect ecosystem function because they rely on taxonomic based metrics including diversity and the occurrence of indicator taxa. The goal of the present study was to evaluate prospective macrobenthic process indicators in relation to organic enrichment and hypoxia. Organic enrichment combined with hypoxia typically engenders depauperate macrobenthic communities consisting mostly of small short-lived opportunistic organisms. Thus, indicators predicated upon body-size descriptors potentially concur with effects of eutrophication. In the present study, two orthogonal complex indicators, or benthic functions (BFs), comprised a suite of eight macrobenthic metrics from 133 sampling events representing 29 sites over four years within three central Gulf of Mexico (GoM) estuarine systems. Benthic Function 1 (BF1) exemplified community maturity, whereas BF2 conveyed secondary production potential. Three complex macrobenthic indicators, including the two BFs and the benchmark Benthic Index (BI) for the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), were related to four environmental functions (EFs) comprising a suite of 15 environmental variables. The two BFs related more robustly to the EFs than the BI. Moreover, BF2 related strongly to the dissolved oxygen (DO) driven EF2. Notwithstanding a somewhat nonlinear relationship between BF2 and EF2, monotonic variation in BF2 relative to DO-driven EF2 ensured the interpretability of the relationship. A significant correlation between BF1 (i.e., community maturity) and the BI implied a link between benthic function and biodiversity. Other significant relationships involving the complex macrobenthic indicators and trophic structure underscored the ecological relevance of functional diversity. Implementing macrobenthic process indicators to gauge estuarine condition offers a compelling approach to coastal ecosystem management. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Geodiversity is a determinant of mining patterns, because its nature defines the interaction with humans, type of exploitation, and, consequently, ecosystem services (ES) of the final landscape. The environmental recovery obligations defined in the legislation serve as a good guidance, but sand mining companies are not always able to finalize their activity entirely and to comply with the laws. To take this into account, the present study was developed with an objective of analyzing the changes observed in the ES after 70 years of sand exploitation in the Paraiba do Sul River Valley, Brazil. The services of the floodplain soil formation and associated components, such as the quality and quantity of water and refuges provided by the riparian forest, are highlighted in this study. To evaluate the different ESs modified by mining, socio-environmental variables were studied, and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method was applied to assign significance to each variable in the phase of closing activities, thus creating a compound index for ES evaluation at mine closure. The closure conditions were analyzed against the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 6, 8, 9, and 11. The results showed that the companies are small, that they met the legislation in equal criteria of environmental rehabilitation, and that they were induced to a closure standard, reflecting the reforestation with native forest variable, related to the ES of provisioning of habitat to wild fauna. However, the mine facilities variable, associated with the cultural ES of recreation, predominated, because the buildings and access roads were preserved, even though the movable assets were demobilized quickly. It was concluded from the analysis that the scenario of the ES at mine closure is generally linked to geodiversity, company size, and compliance with legal duties.

AB  - Port Biological Baseline Surveys (PBBS) are standardized surveys of the indigenous and non-indigenous marine biodiversity within harbour activities. They provide a baseline for monitoring changes in the structure and function of harbour communities. This study conducted in 12 fishing and industrial harbours from January to December 2018 was the first initiative of a Port Baseline Survey aimed to assess the impact of biological invasions in harbours of the Gulf of Gabes (GG), Tunisia. A total of 174 macrobenthos species were recorded, belonging to eight phyla, with a dominance of crustaceans (32%), molluscs (31%) and polychaetes (20%). Among these species, 57 were non-indigenous species (NIS) for Tunisian waters, while 27 species were recorded for the first time in GG harbours, and three decapods (Dyspanopeus sayi, Hippolyte prideauxiana and Pilumnus minutus) and one amphipod (Hamimaera hamigera) were newly recorded from Tunisian waters. Two main categories of harbours are distinguished according to their macrobenthic communities and environmental conditions. The industrial harbours yield higher richness and abundance of NIS than the fishing harbours. The ALEX metric is used to evaluate the biological invasion status of the Gulf of Gabes harbours and shows that their status ranges from unaffected in fishing harbours to extremely affected in industrial harbours. Three biotic indices (AMBI, BO2A and BENTIX) are applied to assess the ecological status of harbours, which varies from moderate to good. ALEX and the other biotic indices are significantly correlated with harbour characteristics, maritime traffic and edaphic factors (organic matter and chemical contamination). The present study provides a data baseline for the implementation of environmental policies and management plans in the future.

AB  - The headwaters of the Volga River exhibit large reaches with near-pristine conditions, and therefore long-term biodiversity monitoring of this catchment can provide rare and valuable information on a European lowland river. More specifically, freshwater fish species assemblages are a good indicator of ecosystem status, as they are particularly sensitive to environmental changes and hydromorphological alterations. Historical records show that the fish fauna of the Upper Volga has changed over time, both in species composition and in abundance. The construction of the Volga-Kama cascade (a series of large dams) has specifically affected the migration of diadromous species. Environmental DNA metabarcoding offers a non-invasive approach to determine the number of species in an aquatic ecosystem, as well as their identity and distribution. This approach is especially useful for fish fauna surveys along large rivers and long-term biomonitoring, with the advantage of having no impact on the species and their habitats. To infer the current fish species diversity and the spatial distribution of each species in the free-flowing section of the Upper Volga River, as well as in selected tributaries, an environmental DNA metabarcoding approach was applied, using three mitochondrial DNA markers. This method allowed the positive identification of 23 fish species and their respective distributions in the headwaters of the Volga. This assessment provides a valuable example of the application of environmental DNA metabarcoding in a large river system, and constitutes a starting point for future investigations and long-term biomonitoring in the Upper Volga system. In addition, the results can also serve as a reference for fish diversity assessments of other large European lowland rivers, and can guide future conservation and management measures in the headwaters of the Volga.

AB  - The urbanization in Campinas, Sao Paulo state, and the surrounding region had occurred in a fast and intensive way, causing big changes in the landscape and resulting in an expressive devastation of the forest areas and its natural vegetation cover. This circumstance had given rise to the forest fragmentation process. Therefore, mapping these fragments and evaluating them according to some environmental indicators is very important because it allows to evaluate the basin conditions and to identify the priority areas for the implementation of recovery and management actions. Thus, this work presents a classification of the forest fragments identified in 'Ribeirao Anhumas' watershed, Campinas, SP state, using as indicators the following landscape metrics: size, nuclear area and circularity index. Therefore, a Group Analysis was carried out using the statistical software XSTAT, as a way to identify the similarities between the fragments, considering the aforementioned indicators, and grouping them into classes. A correlation between them has also been developed in order to identify possible relationships of interdependence. It was found that this river basin is highly urbanized, where there are fewer fragments with smaller sizes and in most cases isolated. Although the fragments were generally classified as good, there is a considerable aggravating factor for the environmental quality of these fragments: the nuclear area index was quite low, about 25%, this implies that much of the area covered by fragments is subject to edge effects. Furthermore, through the cluster analyses the fragments had been grouped into three classes, where the size had been one of the most determinant factor. It was also identified the sub-basin of the low course as the less urbanized region, with larger fragments and greater potential for the implementation of management and recovery actions on the forest fragments, such as ecological corridors.

AB  - Structurally complex habitat is declining across temperate marine environments. This trend has been attributed to changes in land use and increasing coastal development, which are activities likely to continue with governments supporting ongoing economic growth within the marine realm. This can compromise biodiversity, and biodiversity offsetting is increasingly being heralded as a means to reduce the conflict between development and conservation. Offset schemes are often evaluated against targets of 'ecological equivalence' or 'like-for-like' but these terms can be difficult to define and quantify. Although targets of equivalence have been generally shown to be feasible in terrestrial environments, the complex and dynamic nature of the marine and coastal realms present difficulties when aiming for strict equivalence targets as measures of success. Here, we investigated four intertidal biogenic reef habitats formed by the tube worm Sabellaria alveolata within, and in proximity to, Swansea Bay (Wales, UK). The aim was to identify measurable biodiversity components for S. alveolata reef habitat, and to investigate the natural spatio-temporal variation in these components, to determine whether a target of equivalence was feasible. We also looked to identify the most important drivers of species assemblages within the reefs. Results showed that biodiversity both S. alveolata formation and tube aperture condition showed a significant interaction between site and season, with community composition varying significantly by site only. Site was found to explain the highest variation in community composition, followed by substrate type, and geographical position. These results highlight how widely coastal habitats can vary, in both space and time, and therefore calls into question a strict target of ecological equivalence when planning biodiversity offsets in coastal environments.

AB  - Anthropogenic impacts on lake ecosystems have increased substantially towards the present. However, the strength and timing in most cases are not evaluated in detail, missing valuable information on the response and recovery of an aquatic system. In this study, we use the sediment total organic carbon/total nitrogen ratio (C/N) and inductively coupled-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) elements and the available information about the biological processes to explore anthropogenic land use impact on the lake ecosystem. As a case study we selected a hemiboreal lake Trikatas (Latvia, NE Europe). The Pearson correlation was used to statistically test the correlations of all variables. Our results show that the C/N ratio lowered immediately with the onset of crop cultivation at 500 BCE. Extensive forest clearance and an abrupt increase in land use are reflected through the associated chemical elements from ICP-OES and the increasing presence of herbivore dung spores since 1200 CE. These changes concur with the excess of fish remains suggesting a decrease in fish populations. Interestingly, anthropogenic land use driven erosion and accompanied calcium carbonate (CaCO3) matter influx favoured the abundance of Chara spp. in Lake Trikatas since 500 CE, which currently forms the protected specific habitat-type (H3140) of the European Union. At present, specific submerged macrophyte Chara habitat-type diminished almost entirely due to increased nutrient input, phytoplankton blooming, hypertrophic conditions and reduced light availability. The continued land use practices led to a switch in organic matter source in the lake from macrophytes to solely algal origin. The current study underlines the need of additional methods used to detect the sensitivity of lake ecosystem to external disturbances such as minor anthropogenic land use that might not necessarily be apparent in more traditional analyses such as palynology.

AB  - Water-use efficiency (WUE), defined as the ratio of net primary productivity (NPP) to evapotranspiration (ET), is an important indicator to represent the trade-off pattern between vegetation productivity and water consumption. Its dynamics under climate change are important to ecohydrology and ecosystem management, especially in the drylands. In this study, we modified and used a late version of Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS), to quantify the WUE in the typical dryland ecosystems, Temperate Eurasian Steppe (TES). The Aridity Index (AI) was used to specify the terrestrial water availability condition. The regional results showed that during the period of 1999-2008, the WUE has a clear decreasing trend in the spatial distribution from arid to humid areas. The highest annual average WUE was in dry and semi-humid sub-region (DSH) with 0.88 gC mm (-1) and the lowest was in arid sub-region (AR) with 0.22 gC mm (-1). A two-stage pattern of WUE was found in TES. That is, WUE would enhance with lower aridity stress, but decline under the humid environment. Over 65% of the region exhibited increasing WUE. This enhancement, however, could not indicate that the grasslands were getting better because the NPP even slightly decreased. It was mainly attributed to the reduction of ET over 70% of the region, which is closely related to the rainfall decrease. The results also suggested a similar negative spatial correlation between the WUE and the mean annual precipitation (MAP) at the driest and the most humid ends. This regional pattern reflected the different roles of water in regulating the terrestrial ecosystems under different aridity levels. This study could facilitate the understanding of the interactions between terrestrial carbon and water cycles, and thus contribute to a sustainable management of nature resources in the dryland ecosystems.

AB  - Diatoms are used as indicators of water quality as they respond predictably to many water chemistry variables and their ecology is relatively well known. However, temporal variation in diatom assemblages remains poorly resolved and studies covering large temporal and spatial scales are urgently needed. Here, we studied how diatom assemblages vary within and between three years at eight boreal stream sites located in Finland using Mantel tests and ordination analyses. Our study streams differed greatly in their trophic level and size: Vantaanjoki is mesotrophic to eutrophic and large, whereas Luutajoki and Evojoki are oligotrophic and smaller. We found that species composition reflected well the status of the sampled streams. In Vantaanjoki, the most common diatoms were all typical species for mesotrophic to eutrophic streams, whereas oligotrophic streams were characterized by species with narrow ecological niches confined to nutrient-poor water. According to Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS), the between-year variation was nearly comparable at all sites, eutrophic sites generally showing slightly higher between-year variation. The reasons for large between-year differences in assemblages were probably related to different weather conditions between the years. The Mantel tests also showed a notable degree of within-year variation in all assemblages. Therefore, we suggest that ecosystem size and productivity act in different directions in the data, resulting in no major differences in the turnover rates at sampled sites. However, NMDS analyses conducted simultaneously for the whole diatom data showed that temporal variation does not confound the large differences in assemblages between eutrophic and oligotrophic streams and that temporal variation may add slightly less noise in spatial assemblage variation in oligotrophic streams. This suggests that site classifications based on diatoms may be overall slightly more robust in oligotrophic waters, whereas in mesotrophic to eutrophic waters, misclassifications may be more likely due to large temporal variation in assemblages.

AB  - The relationship between living benthic foraminiferal faunas and the grain-size distribution of surface sediments was studied in three Sardinian coastal areas: a) the shallow inner shelf between Portoscuso and S. Pietro and the S. Antioco islands; b) the Porto Torres harbour; and c) the La Maddalena Archipelago. This investigation forms part of the research project "EU MOMAR".
   Benthic foraminifera were identified in 17 samples collected from the three analysed areas. Biotic parameters (Species' Richness, Foraminiferal Density and the Fisher-a index) were calculated to quantify the foraminiferal assemblages within the context of environmental parameters. Grain-size analyses were performed to verify the granulometric nature of the bottom sediments. On the basis of the data obtained, the spatial distribution of the foraminiferal assemblages has allowed highly to less stressed environments to be distinguished and the ecological quality status to be evaluated.
   The most abundant taxa are Quinqueloculina ungeriana d'Orbigny, 1846, Peneroplis pertusus (Forskal, 1775) and Ammonia tepida (Cushman, 1926) from the Portoscuso samples, P. pertusus, Quinqueloculina seminula (Linnaeus, 1758) and Q. laevigata d'Orbigny, 1839 from the Porto Torres samples and P. pertusus, Bolivina spathulata (Williamson, 1858) and Bolivina striatula Cushman, 1922 from the La Maddalena samples. Among these dominant species, Ammonia tepida and bolivinids appear to show tolerance to environmental disturbance and are therefore particularly suitable as bio-indicators in coastal areas. The sampling sites characterised by better environmental conditions present an epiphytic biocoenosis with Lobatula lobatula (Walker & Jacob, 1798), Planorbulina mediterranensis d'Orbigny, 1826, Elphidium crispum (Linnaeus, 1758) and peneroplids.
   Correlations are still ongoing between sedimentological features, benthic foraminiferal assemblages and chemical data from these sampled areas, with a view to understanding the environmental anthropogenic impact on coastal systems.

AB  - Macroinvertebrate community assemblages were examined in three areas of the littoral zone of an impacted, drowned river mouth lake in west Michigan, USA. Muskegon Lake has an extensive history of environmental abuse, resulting in its listing as a Great Lakes Area of Concern. A multi-organizational, shoreline restoration initiative was started in 2009 and completed in 2012. Despite pre- and post-restoration monitoring of water quality, fish assemblages, and macrophytes, no studies had examined the shifts in the littoral zone macroinvertebrate community. Using Hester-Dendy samplers, we collected macroinvertebrates monthly in submergent, emergent, and open macrophyte zones, at two restored sites and one reference site from August 2018 to October 2019. No pre-restoration samples were collected at these sites but we could examine the changes in restored vs. reference sites. In total, 22,931 individuals were observed, with Gammarus spp., Echinogammarus spp., Chironominae, and Dreissena polymorpha being among the most abundant taxa. NMDS results revealed overlap among macroinvertebrate communities between the two restored sites and separation from the reference site, with some overlapping seasonal differences and communities influenced by macrophyte habitat type. Principal components analysis revealed that the environmental factors were strongly influenced by seasonal changes and drove habitat-level differences, rather than spatial variations among sites. Our results indicate that although the macroinvertebrate community composition at the restored sites differed from that at the reference site, the macroinvertebrate assemblage at each site was dominated by tolerant generalist species. Pollution-sensitive macroinvertebrate taxa may have been reduced or eliminated in the lake due to decades of environmental abuse. Periodic monitoring is recommended to determine if these sensitive taxa return, as Muskegon Lake conditions continue to improve.

AB  - The article presents the situation of a company of the Manufacturing Sector located in the state of Guanajuato, Mexico, which is dedicated to the manufacture of harnesses (wiring) for heavy equipment, supplies the needs of Mexico, the United States and Canada. We proceeded to start with the bases to begin Occupational Health and Safety Management in order to comply with the regulatory framework in the country of Mexico. The study includes the application of the HAZID methodology for the identification of hazards in the workplace, carrying out a Health and Safety Diagnosis and Program to establish the preventive and corrective measures that control, eliminate or replace the hazards detected in the following order: the design intention and the normal operating conditions of the areas through the recognition of the work environment and its processes, identify possible causes and consequences of the danger, identify the existing safeguards, mitigations and control, carry out a classification of the hazards according to their safety or environmental impacts through the priority of intervention for detected danger and identify recommendations and parts of action. As a result, 28 hazards were identified in the production, warehouse and administrative areas; the risks observed were electrical, mechanical, physical, chemical, biological, ergonomic, psychosocial, surrounding, natural and locative. 43 % of the dangers are moderate, 22 % important, 21 % tolerable, 7 % trivial and 7 % intolerable, therefore, it is proposed to comply with the requirements applicable by official Mexican standards, those responsible for acting and indicators of compliance measurement. To improve the in-depth situation of the organization, it is important to conduct a study on each of the applicable Normas Oficiales Mexicanas in occupational health and safety issues issued by the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare according to the regulatory framework of Mexico.

AB  - Tillage systems in conservation agriculture such as no-tillage (NT) and crop-livestock integration (CLI) have been proposed to limit the negative impacts of intensive agriculture. Soil organisms such as Collembola are good indicators because they respond to a variety of environmental and ecological factors and their community structure indicates a change in land management. In this study, we propose to assess the relationships between springtail biodiversity in management systems with a history of NT and CLI. For both management systems, nine points were sampled, distributed in a 30x30m sampling grid, in three municipalities on the Southern Santa Catarina Plateau, Brazil. Springtails were collected using a metal cylinder (5 cm diameterx5 cm deep) and identified at the species level. At the same point, samples were collected to evaluate soil properties (chemical, physical and microbiological). In total, 538 individuals were collected, distributed in 24 species, 293 individuals (18 species) in NT and 245 individuals (17 species) in the CLI system. Soil management systems studied did not affect the total number of individuals and richness. The NT system had a greater association with epigeic species, while the CLI system was more associated with hemiedaphic and edaphic species, which is related to the site-specific differences in soil conditions. In both soil management systems, the species were influenced by a range of soil properties. The species Isotomurus sp. 1 and Lepidocyrtus sp. 1 were more influenced by soil properties in the NT system, while the species Proisotoma sp. 1, Sminthurinus sp. 1 and Tullbergia antarctica were more influenced by soil properties in the CLI system, compared to the others. Collembola community structure and species diversity were modified by the soil management systems. Our results suggest that the Collembola community may indicate changes across land management systems in conservation agriculture.

AB  - Background. Mangrove forests provide many ecosystem services, including the provision of habitat that supports avian biodiversity. However, hurricanes can knock down trees, alter hydrologic connectivity, and affect avian habitat. In 1995, Hurricanes Opal and Roxanne destroyed approximately 1,700 ha of mangrove forest in Laguna de Terminos, Mexico. Since then, hydrological restoration has been implemented to protect the mangrove forest and its biodiversity.
   Methods. Since avian communities are often considered biological indicators of ecosystem quality, avian diversity and species relative abundance were evaluated as indicators of mangrove restoration success by comparing undisturbed mangrove patches with those affected by the hurricanes. Using bird surveys, similarity analyses, and generalized linear models, we evaluated the effects of water quality variables and forest structure on the relative abundance and diversity of the avian community in disturbed, restored, and undisturbed mangrove patches.
   Results. Higher bird species richness and relative abundances were found in disturbed and restored sites compared to the undisturbed site. After restoration, values of frequency of flooding, water temperature, tree density, and the number of tree species were more similar to that of the undisturbed site than to the values of the disturbed one. Such variables influenced the relative abundance of bird guilds in the different habitat conditions. Furthermore, some insectivorous bird species, such as the Yellow Warbler and Tropical Kingbird, were found to be similarly abundant in both undisturbed and restored sites, but absent or very low in occurrence at the disturbed site.
   Conclusions. Collectively, our results strongly suggest that hydrologic restoration helps to enhance niche availability for different bird guilds, including water and canopy bird species. Our work can help inform management strategies that benefit avian communities in mangrove forests and wetland systems.

AB  - Headwater streams accumulate, process, and export organic materials for use in downstream environments. Decomposition of organic material, an important ecosystem function, may be sensitive to land cover changes in urbanizing regions since headwater stream processes tend to be tightly coupled with riparian and catchment characteristics. Headwaters represent 70-80% of total stream length in watersheds but are disproportionately converted to drainage infrastructure or buried with urban development. Cumulatively, this loss may result in substantial changes to physical and biological downstream processes. From a monitoring perspective, headwaters are largely ignored compared with fishable/navigable waterways for planning decisions, so their structural and functional variability is not well understood. Here, we engaged citizen scientists to contribute data on this variability and to evaluate the sensitivity of standardized cotton-strip decomposition rates to multiscale factors across headwaters with varying landscape conditions in the Greater Toronto Area (York Region), Canada. These factors included stream, riparian vegetation, and catchment characteristics. We expected decomposition rates to be similarly sensitive to local- and catchment-scale factors because of the strong links between headwater catchment and stream processes. We also expected a hump-shaped distribution of decomposition rates across a gradient of urban cover, with stimulating effects at low to moderate cover but deleterious effects at high urban cover. We found that decomposition rate was most sensitive to local-scale factors (e.g., strip burial, stream velocity, and both local upland riparian vegetation density and topography) rather than whole catchment properties. We did not find the expected hump-shaped distribution with urban cover and suggest that more mechanistic studies are needed for understanding cotton-strip decomposition to control for local factors in determining the scale at which decomposition rate is most sensitive to land cover change.

AB  - Small mammals (Rodentia, Soricomorpha and Erinaceomorpha) play a crucial ecological role for their distribution and importance in food chains, as well as for being considered environmental bioindicators. Thus, they represent excellent models for understanding the evolutionary processes of ecosystems, population dynamics under changing environmental conditions, and habitat vulnerabilities. However, some rodents may help the spread of human diseases and are responsible for impacts on agriculture, forestry, and ecosystems. Consequently, small mammal species are often neglected in conservation biology, and only a few of them are protected according to national and European laws and directives. In this work, we summarize open questions related to Italian small mammals and analyze conservation issues linked to these species. We address research, management and conservation priorities by considering ongoing activities and the novelties as regards the taxonomy and zoogeography. In Italy, 39 native species, including four out of six Italian endemic mammal species and one questioned as native, and 10 alien species are currently included within the category "small mammals" Although several studies revealed that small mammals may be heavily impacted by habitat loss and fragmentation as well as forest management, only three rodents are listed in IUCN red list as "Near Threatened", the remaining being "Least Concern". We suggest that this may be due to the fact that pertinent information, is not translated in assessments in line with those of other taxonomic groups (e.g. bats). Conservation strategies are still inadequate, impacts of alien species still partly unknown or neglected. Thus, wide monitoring projects, ecological studies and general public involvement in conservation effort should be implemented, with the aim to amend national legislation, thus providing native small mammals with adequate protection status.

AB  - Bioremediation has proven successful in numerous applications to petroleum hydrocarbons or chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons contaminated soils. There is increasing interest in application of biotoxicity tests for ecological assessment and for supporting management decisions for remediation. Luminescent assays, light-emitting bacteria in particular, can be a suitable tool for environmental analysis, and in vivo luminescence is a rapid and precise indicator of the toxic effects of xenobiotic on micro-organisms. In this study, three different strains of marine bioluminescent bacteria have been employed to follow the changes in biotoxicity occurring during the laboratory scale bioremediation of water and soil samples contaminated by hydrocarbons and collected at an industrial area. The degradation was made by hydrocarbons degrading bacteria, both of commercial sources and isolated from polluted water and soils. The samples were treated for 45 days. The toxicity of the samples, before and after the bioremediation, was determined directly on water samples or on the extracts of soil samples. The yield of extraction by different solvents (acetone, dioxane, ethanol and dichloromethane) was evaluated by the bioluminescent test. The measurements were carried out using a microplate format both for short time of contact (60 minutes, acute toxicity) and for longer time intervals (24 hours, chronic toxicity). The results have been expressed as percentage of inhibition with respect to the blank emission (100% emission). Original and treated samples have been analysed by gas chromatography to assess the hydrocarbons (C > 12 and Poly Chlorinated Biphenyls, PCB) content. The autochthonous bacteria isolated from polluted samples proved less effective, due to the short time for selection in remediation activity with respect to the commercial ones, but their capacity to degrade long chain hydrocarbons was satisfactory. The presented laboratory study can be applied also in case of on-field conditions.

AB  - A suite of seagrass indicator metrics is developed to evaluate four essential measures of seagrass community status for Florida Bay. The measures are based on several years of monitoring data using the Braun-Blanquet Cover Abundance (BBCA) scale to derive information about seagrass spatial extent, abundance, species diversity and presence of target species. As ecosystem restoration proceeds in south Florida, additional freshwater will be discharged to Florida Bay as a means to restore the bay's hydrology and salinity regime. Primary hypotheses about restoring ecological function of the keystone seagrass community are based on the premise that hydrologic restoration will increase environmental variability and reduce hypersalinity. This will create greater niche space and permit multiple seagrass species to coexist while maintaining good environmental conditions for Thalassia testudinum, the dominant climax seagrass species. Greater species diversity is considered beneficial to habitat for desired higher trophic level species such as forage fish and shrimp. it is also important to maintenance of a viable seagrass community that will avoid die-off events observed in the past. Indicator metrics are assigned values at the basin spatial scale and are aggregated to five larger zones. Three index metrics are derived by combining the four indicators through logic gates at the zone spatial scale and aggregated to derive a single bay-wide system status score standardized on the System-wide Indicator protocol. The indicators will provide a way to assess progress toward restoration goals or reveal areas of concern. Reporting for each indicator, index and overall system status score is presented in a red-yellow-green format that summarizes information in a readily accessible form for mangers, policy-makers and stakeholders in planning and implementing an adaptive management strategy.

AB  - Concrete is one of the most widely used construction materials for basic infrastructure worldwide, especially in developing areas undergoing rapid urbanization. However, concrete inhibits energy exchange between soil and other ecosystem components. To enhance the fluxion of information between ecosystems, surface vegetation, and basement soil, this paper aims to explore the tolerance of plants growing on PC. Therefore, we investigated two different PC sample groups with aggregate particle diameters of 5-10 and 15-20 mm. After curing, the samples were used to plant three ground cover plants (Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers, Agrostis stolonifera, and Sasa argenteostriatus, e.g., Camus), and the results were compared with those from normal soil without PC underneath as a reference. During an observational period of 12 weeks, the growth and height of the plants were documented and analysed. The physiological indexes of free proline (Pro), malondialdehyde (MDA), chlorophyll (Chl), relative electrical conductivity (REC), and soluble protein (SP) were investigated. The correlations and significant differences between these indexes based on the treatments were analysed. Then, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to determine the main variables affecting plant growth. The results showed that there were significant differences between the PC groups and the natural growth group. The growth and height of the three plant species under near-natural (nonconcrete) conditions were better than those of the plants in the PC treatments. The plants in the large-particle concrete (LC) treatment group showed better adaptability than those in the small-particle concrete (SC) treatment group in terms of growth, although both PC treatments resulted in various degrees of damage. PCA showed that SP, REC, and MDA were the most influential factors on plant growth in this study.

AB  - Anthropogenic pressures are causing a global decline in biodiversity. Successful attempts at biodiversity conservation requires an understanding of biodiversity patterns as well as the drivers and processes that determine those patterns. To deepen this knowledge, neoecologists have focused on studying present-day or recent historical data, while paleoecologists usually study long-term data through the composition of various biological proxies and environmental indicators. By establishing standard protocols or gathering databases, research infrastructures (RIs) have been instrumental to foster exchange and collaboration among scientists within neoecology (e.g. Global Information Biodiversity Facility or National Ecological Observatory Network) and paleoecology (e.g. Paleobiology Database, Neotoma Paleoecology Database or European Pollen Database). However, these two subdisciplines (and their RIs) have traditionally remained segregated although both provide valuable information that combined can improve our understanding of biodiversity drivers and underlying processes, as well as our predictions of biodiversity responses in the future. For instance, integrative studies between paleo- and neoecology have addressed the global challenge of biodiversity loss by validating climate and ecological models, estimating species fundamental niches, understanding ecological changes and trajectories, or establishing baseline conditions for restoration. Supporting and contributing to research infrastructures from both paleo- and neoecology, as well as their further integration, could boost the amount and improve the quality of such integrative studies. We argue this will enable improved capabilities to anticipate the impacts of global change and biodiversity losses. To boost such integration and illustrate our arguments, we (1) review studies integrating paleo- and neoecology to advance in the light of global changes challenge, (2) describe RIs developed in paleoecology, and (3) discuss opportunities for further integration of RIs from both disciplines (i.e. paleo- and neoecology).

AB  - Long-term spontaneous combustion of coal has caused serious ecological and environmental problems. Only in recent years has it received growing popularity to undertake relevant researches. In order to study the impact of combustion by-products on atmosphere in the Sandaoba fire field, Xinjiang, a region-scale field survey was firstly conducted to investigate the gaseous-solid emissions in separated fire sections. The evaluation method and model have been proposed to describe the underground combustion and the related air pollution. Every year, the total estimates of the gaseous emission are approximately 4030 t of CO2, 113.6 t of SO2 and 57.3 t of CO. The emission pollution varies considerably from regions, and is substantially attenuated with the advancement of fire control. Principal component analysis (PCA) refines the thermophysical parameters into three attributions: the intrinsic thermophysical property, atmospheric dynamics, and combustion degree. PCA score distribution shows that thermophysical parameter is dominated by the combustion condition at severely polluted areas. Factor Analysis is used to extract four contaminant indicators, which suggests the local air suffers sulfur oxides pollution the most. The air quality index of the eight study sections calculated are all below 60, ranging from 24 to 58. It indicates that coal fire air pollution is in the medium-to-severe stage. By Canonical Correlation Analysis, it is noted that thermophysical indicator performs outstanding explanatory for contaminant variates. On the whole, the higher the level of thermophysical properties in the fire area, the greater the intensity of pollutant emission. Underground coalfield fire is dominated by smoldering, and the overall combustion efficiency is lower than 0.8 which generally declines as the excess air coefficient increasing.

AB  - Cities all over the world are confronting intertwined environmental, social and economic problems and aim to become resilient to climate change and promote wellbeing for all their citizens. Nature-based solutions have been proposed as a promising policy approach to addressing urban problems for the potential they have to deliver multiple benefits and foster wellbeing for individuals and communities. However, the evidence for their multiple benefits is rather scarce and highly fragmented, and more robust frameworks for the monitoring and assessment of their impacts are needed to guide urban policy-making. This paper focuses on the current state of impact assessment of nature-based solutions in Europe and through a systematic review of the literature identifies four conceptual problems and three empirical gaps that impede the accumulation of solid evidence regarding of the impacts of different types of nature-based solutions for different social groups; as well as of the contextual conditions that contribute to their performance and delivery of multiple outcomes. Based on the identified mis-conceptualizations and gaps, we derive a series of principles that should guide the development of robust impact assessment frameworks for nature-based solutions. We discuss the policy implications of these gaps and principles. We conclude by making a series of recommendations that should inform the design of impact monitoring and evaluation frameworks in cities, in order to develop the comparative evidence base on the effectiveness of nature-based solutions. This, in turn, can inform urban decision-making on the appropriate design, implementation, and long-term regeneration of nature-based solutions, to ensure long-term delivery of important ecosystem services for different social groups.

AB  - The Pietra del Pertusillo freshwater reservoir is a major artificial lake of environmental, biological, and ecological importance located in the Basilicata region, southern Italy. The reservoir arch-gravity dam was completed in 1963 for producing hydroelectric energy and providing water for human use, and nearby there are potential sources of anthropogenic pollution such as urban and industrial activities. For the first time, the minero-chemistry of the lake and fluvio-lacustrine sediments of the reservoir have been evaluated to assess the environmental quality. Moreover, the composition of fluvial sediments derived from the peri-lacual zone of the reservoir and of local outcropping bedrock were also studied to understand the factors affecting the behavior of elements in the freshwater reservoir, with particular attention paid to heavy metals. In Italy, specific regulatory values concerning the element threshold concentration for lake and river sediments do not exist, and for this reason, soil threshold values are considered the standard for sediments of internal waters. The evaluation of the environmental quality of reservoir sediments has been performed using enrichment factors obtained with respect to the average composition of a reconstructed local upper continental crust. We suggest this method as an innovative standard in similar conditions worldwide. In the studied reservoir sediments, the trace elements that may be of some environmental concern are Cr, Cu, Zn, As, and Pb although, at this stage, the distribution of these elements appears to be mostly driven by geogenic processes. However, within the frame of the assessment and the preservation of the quality of aquatic environments, particular attention has to be paid to As (which shows median value of 10 ppm, reaching a maximum value of 26 ppm in Quaternary sediments), constantly enriched in the lacustrine samples and especially in the fine-grained fraction (median = 8.5 ppm).

AB  - The Poplar Ecological Retreat (PER) project is a significant environmental protection initiative implemented to protect the Dongting Lake wetlands ecosystem in China, and the ecological impacts of this project have gradually become a hot topic. In this study, water conservation was selected as an indicator of ecosystem function to explore the impact of the project by using the water yield module of the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model and geographic statistical methods. Water yield and land-use changes were quantitatively evaluated, and significant changes in the wetland landscape configuration occurred after the PER project because forest beach, moss marshland and mudflat areas were transformed into a poplar-retreat area. Thus, the proportion of the poplar-retreat area and average water yield increased. By using the principal component and cluster analysis methods, climate change and landscape patterns were shown to be the dominant driving factors affecting water conservation under stable meteorological conditions. Moreover, the landscape heterogeneity that resulted from the landscape patterns had a greater impact than climate change, which means that reducing human activities can enhance water conservation. Additionally, the correlation between landscape heterogeneity and water yield indicated that reducing landscape fragmentation and improving aggregation also benefit water conservation. Therefore, the PER project is successful at enhancing ecological functions and protecting wetland environments, and it represents a good example of maintaining ecological sustainability despite local economic performance restrictions. This project serves as an important reference for the establishment of sustainable wetland ecological policies by national governments, and the results can provide theoretical support for landscape ecology and eco-hydrology research.

AB  - The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (DCF) threatens the health of aquatic animals and ecosystems. In the present study, different biological endpoints (mortality, development and growth, abnormalities, cardiotoxicity, neurotoxicity and antioxidant system) were used to characterize the acute and chronic effects of DCF (at concentrations ranging between 125 and 4000 mu g L-1) on two amphibian species from Argentina (Trachycephalus typhonius and Physalaemus albonotatus). Results showed that the larval developmental, growth rates, and body condition of DCF-exposed individuals of both species were significantly reduced. DCF-exposed individuals also showed several morphological abnormalities, including significantly altered body axis, chondrocranium and hyobranchial skeleton, and organ and visceral abnormalities including cardiac hypoplasia, malrotated guts, asymmetrically inverted guts, and cholecystitis. DCF also had a significant effect on the swimming performance of both species: at low concentrations (125 and 250 mu g L-1), swimming distance, velocity and global activity decreased, whereas, at high concentrations (1000 and 2000 mu g L-1), these behavioral responses increased. Regarding cardiac function and rhythm, at DCF concentrations higher than 1000 mu g L-1, the heart frequency and ventricular systole interval of both specieswere significantly reduced. Regarding the antioxidant system, the activity of acetylcholinesterase indicated that DCF is neurotoxic and thus related to the changes in behavioral performance. The DCF concentrations studied produced a biochemical imbalance between radical oxygen species production and antioxidant systems. The sensitivities to sublethal and chronic DCF exposure in both anuran species were similar, thus indicating the inherent complexity involved in understanding the biotoxic effects of DCF.

AB  - In the present article, the patterns of the geographic variability in yields of rye within Polesia and the Forest-Steppe zone of Ukraine are presented and the correlation of the factors and dynamics of an agroeconomic and agroecological nature was determined. The dynamics of rye yields in the study area over time were determined as being characterized by three extreme points: two local maxima and one local minimum. Specific terms of the polynomial curve of the fourth order can be meaningfully interpreted and applied to describe the dynamics of productivity. Free members of the polynomial indicate culture productivity in the starting period. Dynamics of the productivity that can be explained by the regression indicate that agrotechnological and agrecological conditions of agricultural production are a pervasive factor that determines the presence of a general trend. The determination coefficient of the regression total trend can be interpreted as an indicator of the role of the agrotechnological and agroeconomic factors in the dynamics of productivity. The residue of the trend regression model can be interpreted so as to include the agroecological component of the rye yields dynamics. Their analysis revealed seven key components that together explained 58.4% of the total variability of the space feature. The principal components of vibrational patterns reflect the specific nature of variation of rye yields over time, which are spatially defined. Vibrational effects are environmental in nature. Geographically weighted principal component analysis showed the transience of environmental spatial modes which determine the oscillating component of rye yield variation over time. Spaces within which the structure of ecological interactions remains unchanged can be considered as the basis of agroecological zoning areas.

AB  - Along the river network, water, sediment, and nutrients are transported, cycled, and altered by coupled hydrological and biogeochemical processes. Our current understanding of the rates and processes controlling the cycling and removal of dissolved inorganic nutrients in river networks is limited due to a lack of empirical measurements in large, (nonwadeable), rivers. The goal of this paper was to develop a coupled hydrological and biogeochemical process model to simulate nutrient uptake at the network scale during summer base flow conditions. The model was parameterized with literature values from headwater streams, and empirical measurements made in 15 rivers with varying hydrological, biological, and topographic characteristics, to simulate nutrient uptake at the network scale. We applied the coupled model to 15 catchments describing patterns in uptake for three different solutes to determine the role of rivers in network-scale nutrient cycling. Model simulation results, constrained by empirical data, suggested that rivers contributed proportionally more to nutrient removal than headwater streams given the fraction of their length represented in a network. In addition, variability of nutrient removal patterns among catchments was varied among solutes, and as expected, was influenced by nutrient concentration and discharge. Net ammonium uptake was not significantly correlated with any environmental descriptor. In contrast, net daily nitrate removal was linked to suspended chlorophyll a (an indicator of primary producers) and land use characteristics. Finally, suspended sediment characteristics and agricultural land use were correlated with net daily removal of soluble reactive phosphorus, likely reflecting abiotic sorption dynamics. Rivers are understudied relative to streams, and our model suggests that rivers can contribute more to network-scale nutrient removal than would be expected based upon their representative fraction of network channel length.

AB  - Riparian zones (RZs) functionally connect aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, and have azonal and geographically widespread plant communities that differ from those of the neighboring terrestrial zone (TZ). Although well studied botanically, RZs are not well understood in terms of their terrestrial insect diversity, including grasshoppers. The Cape Floristic Region (CFR) is a global biodiversity hotspot with small rocky rivers running through highly diverse sclerophyllous vegetation. It has high levels of endemism among many taxa, including grasshoppers, making it ideal for testing the effect of azonal vegetation on grasshopper assemblages of the RZ, and determining whether conservation efforts should be focused on the RZ as well as the TZ. We determine grasshopper dispersion patterns along the RZ of an important CFR river, and compare these patterns with those of the TZ to understand the habitat occupancy relative to 27 environmental variables of the zones and geographical distribution of the grasshoppers. Forty percent of individuals we collected were CFR endemics. We found only weak differences in the grasshopper assemblages between the RZ and TZ, apparently driven by deep history, complex geomorphology, stressful environmental conditions, a diverse vegetation and land mosaic, and probable high predator pressure. There were two groups: large-sized, well-flighted, geographically widespread generalists that were overall more abundant in the RZ than TZ, and small, flightless or poorly-flighted, vegetation-specialists which are narrow-range endemics adapted to both RZ and TZ, but still more abundant in the TZ. We conclude that although the vegetation of this riparian zone may require some special conservation attention, this is not so for the grasshoppers which overall are best conserved in the TZ.

AB  - We devised a participatory modeling approach for setting management thresholds that show when management intervention is required to address undesirable ecosystem changes. This approach was designed to be used when management thresholds: must be set for environmental indicators in the face of multiple competing objectives; need to incorporate scientific understanding and value judgments; and will be set by participants with limited modeling experience. We applied our approach to a case study where management thresholds were set for a mat-forming brown alga, Hormosira banksii, in a protected area management context. Participants, including management staff and scientists, were involved in a workshop to test the approach, and set management thresholds to address the threat of trampling by visitors to an intertidal rocky reef. The approach involved trading off the environmental objective, to maintain the condition of intertidal reef communities, with social and economic objectives to ensure management intervention was cost-effective. Ecological scenarios, developed using scenario planning, were a key feature that provided the foundation for where to set management thresholds. The scenarios developed represented declines in percent cover of H. banksii that may occur under increased threatening processes. Participants defined 4 discrete management alternatives to address the threat of trampling and estimated the effect of these alternatives on the objectives under each ecological scenario. A weighted additive model was used to aggregate participants' consequence estimates. Model outputs (decision scores) clearly expressed uncertainty, which can be considered by decision makers and used to inform where to set management thresholds. This approach encourages a proactive form of conservation, where management thresholds and associated actions are defined a priori for ecological indicators, rather than reacting to unexpected ecosystem changes in the future.

AB  - Wood fuels are recognized as a crucial energy source whose sustainable use should be ensured. To ensure sustainability, the calculation of the annual available biomass is one of the bases of forest management. The novelty of our study stem from an extended evaluation of the carrying capacity for taking into account different site-specific - as well condition-specific - aspects usually neglected. In the case of natural mixed forests, local management plans define the criteria to be adopted in the land management identify the main functions of the forest plots. However, for ensure sustainable forest management, ecological and technical local constraints should be assessed in details in order to quantify wood potentially available. As a standardized procedure for this comprehensive wood availability is missing, the present study propose a GIS-based decision support system (DSS) and methodology for calculating the biomass availability while supporting the local resource planning. In particular, we focus on the environmental sustainability of bio-energy production. In fact, applying the DSS, it is possible to calculate three indicators: operational carrying capacity (OCC), chip potential (CP) and technical potential (TP). Those indicators are related, respectively, to the availability of wood from forests according to local plans criteria, the potential of wood chips production, and the comparison of total available biomass with current uses. The DDS considers the actual uses of the resource, supporting local planners in properly assess the forestry sector and its possible developments. Two case studies on alpine mountain areas are presented and discussed in light of contributing to face the challenge of energy planning at local scale. The DOS allow calculating the number of chip fueled boilers which could be installed in the areas, using local resource below their carrying capacity. DSS application helps highlighting some challenges in resource planning and use at local scale. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rangeland ecosystems have vital role in Balochistan due to many direct services to the society like food, forage, medicines, fuel, building materials, industrial products, and indirect services of maintaining the composition of the environment, mitigating climate and moderating weather, fertilizing and stabilizing soils, disposing of wastes, cycling nutrients, storing and purifying water. Rangelands degradation in Balochistan is a major issue and affecting not only the direct users of pastoral communities but many others benefiting from the environmental services. Some of the indicators of rangelands degradation include reduction in vegetation cover, above ground plant productivity, soil erosion, elimination of soil seed bank, and shift in species composition. Rangeland degradation is site specific due to spatial, temporal variation of vegetation and utilization practices. Studies on recovery of natural vegetation, re-generation of native species, seasonal biomass variations, evaluation of fodder shrubs and community based efforts are being carried out by the Arid Zone Research Centre (AZRC), Quetta in various districts of Balochistan. Above ground dry biomass production varies from 40 to 200 kg/ha in open areas as compared to 200 to 865 kg/ha in protected areas. Heavily grazed grasslands have good recovery potential under favourable climatic conditions. Re-generation potential of native range species is limited due to weak persistent soil seed bank and insufficient rainfall distribution during germination and establishment of seedlings. Biomass availability gradually declines and winter months are critical for grazing. Fodder shrubs like Atriplex canescens and Salsola vermiculata have potential for establishment of forage reserve blocks with micro-catchment water harvesting techniques. Communities degraded rangelands can be rehabilitated either by grazing management or plantation of drought tolerant fodder shrubs on appropriate sites. A viable and sound rangeland policy and implementation strategies are mandatory for conservation and utilization of the rangeland resources on sustainable basis.

AB  - Hydrological classification constitutes the first step of a new holistic framework for developing regional environmental flow criteria: the "Ecological Limits of Hydrologic Alteration (ELOHA)". The aim of this study was to develop a classification for 390 stream sections of the Segura River Basin based on 73 hydrological indices that characterize their natural flow regimes. The hydrological indices were calculated with 25 years of natural monthly flows (1980/81-2005/06) derived from a rainfall-runoff model developed by the Spanish Ministry of Environment and Public Works. These indices included, at a monthly or annual basis, measures of duration of droughts and central tendency and dispersion of flow magnitude (average, low and high flow conditions). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) indicated high redundancy among most hydrological indices, as well as two gradients: flow magnitude for mainstream rivers and temporal variability for tributary streams. A classification with eight flow-regime classes was chosen as the most easily interpretable in the Segura River Basin, which was supported by ANOSIM analyses. These classes can be simplified in 4 broader groups, with different seasonal discharge pattern: large rivers, perennial stable streams, perennial seasonal streams and intermittent and ephemeral streams. They showed a high degree of spatial cohesion, following a gradient associated with climatic aridity from NW to SE, and were well defined in terms of the fundamental variables in Mediterranean streams: magnitude and temporal variability of flows. Therefore, this classification is a fundamental tool to support water management and planning in the Segura River Basin. Future research will allow us to study the flow alteration-ecological response relationship for each river type, and set the basis to design scientifically credible environmental flows following the ELOHA framework.

AB  - P>1. Protected area networks for river ecosystems must account for the highly connected nature of river habitats and the fact that conditions in distant locations can influence downstream habitats and biota. We used Marxan conservation planning software to address the unique constraints of reserve design in river ecosystems and structure a reserve network to overcome key challenges to freshwater conservation.
   2. The range limits of 63 fish species in Mesoamerica were predicted and used in Marxan to design a network of conservation focal areas that encompasses 15% of the range of each species in areas with low risk of environmental degradation. Upstream risk intensity was estimated by propagating landscape-based sources of stress downstream along the direction of flow in GIS. We constrained Marxan solutions to account for basin divides, and we defined critical management zones to include important habitats that contribute to species persistence and mitigate threats.
   3. The proposed reserve network encompassed 11% of the study area, half of which was contained within existing protected areas. Our exercise also identified important gaps in protection. Because terrestrial-based environmental risks were propagated through the river network and considered in the solution, focal areas were constrained to catchments with low levels of upstream human activity. Addition of critical management zones - riparian buffers and fish migration corridors - expanded the network area by one-fifth.
   4. Our application of Marxan allowed longitudinal connectivity and topographic barriers to species movement to be considered. Adding critical management zones expanded the size of the reserve network, but is crucial to the network's conservation efficacy. We call for an evaluation of the added management capacity needed to conserve critical management zones and suggest ways to further improve the reserve design process.

AB  - The potential compatibility with biological control of transgenic insecticidal plants expressing the biotin-binding protein avidin was investigated in tri-trophic experiments with the predatory carabid beetle, Ctenognathus novaezelandiae. Beetles were provided with pure and mixed diets of 33%, 67% or 100% of Spodoptera litura larvae, fed either avid in-expressing or isogenic control tobacco, and invertebrates field-collected from the forest floor. Beetles given only tobacco-fed S. litura, whether avidin was present or not, had lower fecundity, egg fertility, body mass and male survival than beetles that received some field food. Fewer of the avidin tobacco-fed prey were consumed than the control tobacco-fed, whatever mixture or proportion offered, probably as a result of the reduced quality of biotin-deprived prey. Beetles consuming 100% avidin tobacco-fed prey had lower fecundity than those given 100% control tobacco-fed prey, although predation on eggs as well as reduced prey quality could have contributed to this result. Despite the nutritionally limiting nature of an exclusive diet of tobacco-fed prey, there was no effect of avidin on fecundity in beetles consuming 67% or 33% avidin prey, or any effect on female or male mass, survival or egg fertility, even in the 100% avidin prey treatment. Fecundity in beetles fed 33% field food with 67% tobacco-fed prey was lower than in those fed 67% or 100% field food. However, there was no added impact of avidin on fecundity, mass or survival, or egg fertility of the 33% field food diet, suggesting that under field conditions, where a mixture of prey is available, negative impacts of avidin-fed prey are unlikely.

AB  - Within the past few years plant functional trait analyses have been widely applied to learn more about the processes and patterns of ecosystem development in response to environmental changes. These approaches are based on the assumption that plants with similar ecologically relevant trait attributes respond to environmental changes in comparable ways. Several methods have been described on how to analyse a priori defined trait sets with respect to environment. Irrespective of the statistical methods used to contrast ecosystem responses and environmental conditions, each functional trait approach depends strongly on the initial trait set. In nearly all recent studies on functional trait analysis a test, if a trait is responsible, is applied independently from the core analysis. In the current study we present a method that extracts those traits from a wider set of traits which are optimal for describing the ecosystem response to a given environmental gradient. This was done by the use of iterative three-table ordination techniques with each possible trait combination. We further concentrated on the effect of the inclusion of too many traits in such analyses.
   As examples the method was applied to three long term studies on abandoned arable fields. The approach was validated by comparing the results with literature-knowledge on arable field succession. Although the trait pre-selection was only based on a statistical procedure, our method was able to identify all relevant processes of ecosystem responses. All three sites show comparable ecosystem responses; the importance of the competitive ability of plants was highlighted. We further demonstrated that the use of too many traits results in an over-fitting of the trait-environment model.
   The presented method of iterative RLQ-analyses is adequate to identify responding traits to environmental changes: the discovered processes of successional development of abandoned arable fields are consistent with our knowledge from the literature.

AB  - Phenology is an important indicator of the biological responses to climate change, and previous studies have reported divergent phenological responses of grasslands in Inner Mongolia from the analyses of in-situ measurements and satellite observations; thus, robust phenology models are required to understand and simulate the relationship between ecosystems and climate change. However, phenology models for natural grasslands in which heating accumulation, chilling requirements, precipitation effects and other climate factors are introduced at the same time are relatively deficient; as a result, the accuracy of the herbaceous plant phenology model and its universality across different species and regions are restricted. We proposed an improved phenology model (unified model combined with precipitation driving, UMPD) that reflects the combined effect of temperature and precipitation at the forcing unit level. Green-up evaluation based on satellite observations shows that the UMPD phenology model achieves better accuracy than previous models (RMSE < 10 days), and the simulated spatial distribution of green-up date change is more consistent with the ground observation, which means that the inclusion of the precipitation driving effect in the temperature-based phenology model improves model applicability at a regional scale and under complex climatic conditions. Based on the UMPD model and its parameters, spatial and temporal changes in green-up dates for Leymus chinensis steppe in Inner Mongolia from 1962 to 2017 were simulated, and the results showed an overall advancing trend with obvious spatial differences and complex stage characteristics. We demonstrate the feasibility of combining temperature and precipitation driving effects to develop and refine phenology models, and the improved model provides wide potential for characterizing the spatiotemporal patterns of grassland green-up date variations.

AB  - Robust assessments of ecosystem stability are critical for informing conservation and management decisions. Tidal marsh ecosystems provide vital services, yet are globally threatened by anthropogenic alterations to physical and biological processes. A variety of monitoring and modeling approaches have been undertaken to determine which tidal marshes are likely to persist into the future. Here, we conduct the most robust comparison of marsh metrics to date, building on two foundational studies that had previously and independently developed metrics for marsh condition. We characterized pairs of marshes with contrasting trajectories of marsh cover across six regions of the United States, using a combination of remote -sensing and field -based metrics. We also quantified decadal trends in marsh conversion to mudflat/open water at these twelve marshes. Our results suggest that metrics quantifying the distribution of vegetation across an elevational gradient represent the best indicators of marsh trajectories. The unvegetated to vegetated ratio and flood -ebb sediment differential also served as valuable indicators. No single metric universally predicted marsh trajectories, and therefore a more robust approach includes a suite of spatially-integrated, landscape -scale metrics that are mostly obtainable from remote sensing. Data from surface elevation tables and marker horizons revealed that degrading marshes can have higher rates ofvertical accretion and elevation gain than more intact counterparts, likely due to longer inundation times potentially combined with internal recycling of material. A high rate of elevation gain relative to local sea -level rise has been considered critical to marsh persistence, but our results suggest that it also may serve as a signature of degradation in marshes that have already begun to deteriorate. This investigation, with rigorous comparison and integration of metrics initially developed independently, tested at abroad geographic scale, provides a model for collaborative science to develop management tools for improving conservation outcomes.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) aim at safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystem services in the long term. Despite the remarkable growth in area covered by PAs in recent years, biodiversity trends continue to worsen as a result of serious global pressures such as habitat destruction and degradation. One main cause of habitat destruction and degradation is land development that implies the replacement of natural land uses-land covers (LULCs) with artificial ones. Here, we assessed the effectiveness of four PA networks at preventing land development in Spain, a biodiversity-rich country that has experienced recent rapid environmental transformations, using two models of increased validity: an original model and a biophysically enhanced model. We applied a before-after control-impact (BACI) design whereby absolute artificial area increase (AAI) and relative artificial area increase (RAI) were compared across PA categories (nature reserves [NRs], nature parks [NPs], Sites of Community Importance [SCIs], and Special Protection Areas [SPAs]), study zones (coastal and inland), and climates (Atlantic and Mediterranean) using CORINE Land Cover (CLC) data and two control zones: 1- and 5-km buffers around protected polygons. NRs prevented land development, whereas other categories reduced it moderately to very substantially in the assessed period. AAI was especially intense in inland SPAs and NPs. NRs and NPs were the most effective PA categories inland, whereas NRs and SPAs were the most effective ones on the coast. Land development was greater on the Spanish coast than inland inside and outside PAs, especially around Macaronesian and Mediterranean PAs. Atlantic PAs experienced similar or greater land development values than surrounding areas. Our results are intended to guide future conservation efforts in Spain, chiefly on its heavily pressured coastal environment.

AB  - Degradation of slopes due to shallow landslide and the subsequent erosional processes are a big challenge on the application of soil bioengineering techniques; that is the use of plants as main structural components of a slope protection and conservation system. An optimal application of soil bioengineering techniques should include not only the technical factor of plants as structural components but also the ecology of species and the plant adaptations to disturbances, which is crucial if a longterm successful slope restoration system is intended. Ferns are a dominant understory vegetation species in the forest of Japan, but its characteristics and influences on the recovery of shallow landslide scars have not been fully studied yet. This study aims to find out the ecological characteristics of fern species through the calculation of ecological indicators and the quantification of the morphological features of specimens growing on disturbed and non-disturbed forest slopes in Japan. Gleichenia japonica was found as the vegetation species with biggest ecological indicators on both slopes. The analysis of morphological characteristics of the specimens growing on both sites showed that the development of the specimens is focused in below-ground characteristics. The pull-out force of Gleichenia japonica root system as an indicator of ecological adaptation to a constraint environment and morphological characteristics quality is influenced by height and root length according to the principal component analysis. The eco-morphological characteristics of species can be used as an indicator of an optimal element in soil bioengineering establishment for slope conservation proposes. The long and fibrous root system could be placed on forest roads, steep or small slopes where space limitation is an issue for the establishment of bigger species and if the slope conditions allow it, it can control soil losses due to rainfall and provide stability.

AB  - Ultraviolet (UV) filters and preservatives, which are common constituents of sunscreens and other cosmetics, are reported as a threat for coastal coral reef ecosystems; however, few studies have assessed the effects of these compounds on coral health. This study presents the chronic effects (of measured, long-term and low concentrations) of some preservatives (ethylparaben, butylparaben), mineral UV filter (zinc oxide, ZnO) and organic UV filters (terephthalylidene dicamphor sulfonic acid, drometrizole trisiloxane, ethylhexyltriazone, butylmethoxydibenzoylmethane and 2-ethylhexyl 2-cyano-3,3-diphenylacrylate) on the maximal photosynthetic efficiency (F-v/F-m) of the symbionts associated with the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata. It first shows that for many organic filters, measured concentrations were significantly lower than nominal concentrations, due to the lipophilic nature of the compounds. In addition, the F-v/F-m was more sensitive to ZnO than all other sunscreen ingredients, with exposure to 90 mu gL(-1) ZnO for 35d, reducing F-v/F-m by 38% compared with controls. The other UV filters tested showed no adverse effect on coral symbionts or animal tissue up to the concentration corresponding to their water solubility limit (and even above). Similarly, no adverse effect was observed in our conditions with the preservative ethylparaben, but the preservative butylparaben decreased the F-v/F-m by 25% at the highest concentration of 100 mu gL(-1). None of the sunscreen ingredients were as toxic to corals as the reference pollutants tributyltin, diuron and monuron, which significantly inhibited F-v/F-m at 10, 1 and 0.1 mu gL(-1), respectively. Overall, this study highlights the need to improve our knowledge on the in situ concentrations of UV filters and preservatives as well as their individual and combined effects on corals.

AB  - Organic contaminants with designed molecular bioactivity, such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals, originate from human and agricultural sources, occur frequently in surface waters, and threaten the structure and function of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Congaree National Park in South Carolina (USA) is a vulnerable park unit due to its location downstream of multiple urban and agricultural contaminant sources and its hydrologic setting, being composed almost entirely of floodplain and aquatic environments. Seventy-two water and sediment samples were collected from 16 sites in Congaree National Park during 2013 to 2015, and analyzed for 199 and 81 targeted organic contaminants, respectively. More than half of these water and sediment analytes were not detected or potentially had natural sources. Pharmaceutical contaminants were detected (49 total) frequently in water throughout Congaree National Park, with higher detection frequencies and concentrations at Congaree and Wateree River sites, downstream from major urban areas. Forty-seven organic wastewater indicator chemicals were detected in water, and 36 were detected in sediment, of which approximately half are distinctly anthropogenic. Endogenous sterols and hormones, which may originate from humans or wildlife, were detected in water and sediment samples throughout Congaree National Park, but synthetic hormones were detected only once, suggesting a comparatively low risk of adverse impacts. Assessment of the biodegradation potentials of 8 C-14-radiolabeled model contaminants indicated poor potentials for some contaminants, particularly under anaerobic sediments conditions.

AB  - Phenology studies the cycle of events in nature that are initiated and driven by an annually recurring environment. Plant phenology is expected to be one of the most sensitive and easily observable natural indicators of climate change. On the Tibetan Plateau (TP), an accelerated warming since the mid-1980s has resulted in significant environmental changes. These new conditions are accompanied by phenological changes that are characterized by considerable spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Satellite remote sensing observed widespread advance in the start of the plant growing season across the plateau during the 1980s and 1990s but substantial delay over 2000-2011 in the southwest although it continued to advance in the northeast regions of the TP. Both observational studies and controlled experiments have revealed, to some extent, the positive role of higher preseason temperature and even more precipitation in advancing the leaf onset and first flowering date of the TP. However, a number of rarely visited research issues that are essential for understanding the role of phenology in ecosystem responses and feedback processes to climate change remain to be solved. Our review recommends that addressing the following questions should be a high priority. How did other phenological events change, such as flowering and fruiting phenology? What are the influences from environmental changes other than temperature and precipitation, including human activities such as grazing? What are the genetic and physiological bases of plants phenological responses? How does phenological change influence ecosystem structure and function at different scales and feedback to the climate system? Investigating these research questions requires, first of all, new data of the associated environmental variables, and consistent and reliable phenological observation using different methodologies (i.e. in situ observations and remote sensing).

AB  - The Proportion of Sediment-sensitive Invertebrates (PSI) index is a biomonitoring tool that is designed to identify the degree of sedimentation in rivers and streams. Despite having a sound biological basis, the tool has been shown to have only a moderate correlation with fine sediment, which although comparable to other pressure specific indices, limits confidence in its application. The aim of this study was to investigate if the performance of the PSI index could be enhanced through the use of empirical data to supplement the expert knowledge and literature which were used to determine the original four fine sediment sensitivity ratings. The empirical data used, comprised observations of invertebrate abundance and percentage fine sediment, collected across a wide range of reference condition temperate stream and river ecosystems (model training dataset n = 2252). Species were assigned sensitivity weights within a range based on their previously determined sensitivity rating. Using a range of weights acknowledges the breadth of ecological niches that invertebrates occupy and also their differing potential as indicators. The optimum species-specific sensitivity weights were identified using non-linear optimisation, as those that resulted in the highest Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between the Empirically-weighted PSI (E-PSI) scores and deposited fine sediment in the model training dataset The correlation between percentage fine sediment and E-PSI scores in the test dataset (n = 252) was eight percentage points higher than the correlation between percentage fine sediment and the original PSI scores (E-PSI r(s) = -0.74, p < 0.01 compared to PSI r(s) = -0.66, p < 0.01). This study demonstrates the value of combining a sound biological basis with evidence from large empirical datasets, to test and enhance the performance of biomonitoring tools to increase confidence in their application.

AB  - Biological activity in arid grasslands is strongly dependent on moisture. We examined gas exchange of biological soil crusts (biocrusts), the underlying soil biotic community, and the belowground respiratory activity of C-3 and C-4 grasses over 2 years in southeast Utah, USA. We used soil surface CO2 flux and the amount and carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) of soil CO2 as indicators of belowground and soil surface activity. Soil respiration was always below 2 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and highly responsive to soil moisture. When moisture was available, warm spring and summer temperature was associated with higher fluxes. Moisture pulses led to enhanced soil respiration lasting for a week or more. Biological response to rain was not simply dependent on the amount of rain, but also depended on antecedent conditions (prior moisture pulses). The short-term temperature sensitivity of respiration was very dynamic, showing enhancement within 1-2 days of rain, and diminishing each day afterward. Carbon uptake occurred by cyanobacterially dominated biocrusts following moisture pulses in fall and winter, with a maximal net carbon uptake of 0.5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), although typically the biocrusts were a net carbon source. No difference was detected in the seasonal activity of C-3 and C-4 grasses, contrasting with studies from other arid regions (where warm-versus cool-season activity is important), and highlighting the unique biophysical environment of this cold desert. Contrary to other studies, the delta C-13 of belowground respiration in the rooting zone of each photosynthetic type did not reflect the delta C-13 of C-3 and C-4 physiology.

AB  - Annual differences in ecological interactions between hatchery origin fish and the taxa that interact with them should be considered when managing hatcheries because of the potential for impacts to target and non-target taxa (i.e., taxa that are not the target of a management action). A major component of the traditional hatchery paradigm is to release approximately the same number of fish of the same species every year from the same location(s) regardless of ecological conditions. This paradigm occurs in integrated and segregated hatchery programs and generally ignores ecological feedback mechanisms within the environment that can reduce survival of hatchery and wild fish. In addition, it assumes that the carrying capacity of the environment is static and underseeded, which if incorrect can result in replacement of wild fish by hatchery con-specifics. Furthermore, practitioners of the paradigm may not consider impacts to other species that are not the target of enhancement or assumes impacts to be acceptable. To address these issues, I describe an alternative approach that prescribes stocking in places and times when: (1) ecosystem indicators suggest that risks to non-target taxa are acceptable, (2) the environment is near or below carrying capacity or density-dependent impacts are considered acceptable, and (3) ecological feedback mechanisms are in a desirable state. Indicators can also be used to refine fish rearing and stocking practices to enhance ecosystem benefits. According to this concept, fish would not be stocked in places and at times where ecosystem indicators are unfavorable. Although there are many potential ecological, genetic, and economic benefits of context-specific hatchery releases, the concept should be tested before it is applied broadly. This concept may be untenable in areas with legally-mandated release locations and numbers, or unnecessary for hatchery programs where all management goals are met.

AB  - Marine biotic indices (AMBI, BENTIX) and the statistical tool M-AMBI (Multivariate AMBI) were applied as a comparative approach in assessing the Ecological Quality Status (EcoQS) of two Mediterranean coastal lakes (Caprolace and Fogliano lakes) situated in the Circeo National Park (Central Italy). The macrobenthic community was analysed using univariate indices (community structure), correspondence analysis (CA) and taxonomic distinctness indices (Delta(+) and Lambda(+)). The community composition showed a dominance of lagoonal species in both coastal lakes, while in Caprolace lake marine taxa were also found. Diversity index (H') complies to ranges found in Mediterranean lagoons and taxonomic distinctness indices demonstrated that taxonomy structure is in accordance with natural variability ranges. Principal component analysis (PCA) on chemical parameters of water and sediment showed that both coastal lakes differ mainly in their organic matter composition. In fact, the protein fraction of bio-polymeric carbon prevails in Fogliano lake, while the 'refractory' component represented by carbohydrate fraction is predominant in Caprolace lake. The difference between the two coastal lakes was also demonstrated by co-inertia analysis (COIA) performed using abundance of species and concentrations of chemical parameters. The results from the application of the three biotic indices do not highlight a clear distinction between the two lagoons. However, the AMBI index provided a more suitable evaluation of EcoQS corresponding to 'slightly polluted' lagoons while M-AMBI and moreover BENTIX indices indicated a worsening situation. The biotic indices are widely used in assessing the EcoQS in marine environments, but their proper application in transitional waters would depend on a resettlement; thresholds established in the biotic index scale values need to be modified according to natural variability of transitional waters referring to abiotic conditions and abundance of tolerant species.

AB  - This study deals with the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), which is a systematic identification and evaluation of the potential impact of a proposed project or any action that may affect of the environment directly or indirectly in temporary or permanent terms, of off shore oil spill on desalination plants. Sources of off shore oil spill, fates and effects on different environmental items are discussed. The setting conditions and ecological life around Umm Al Nar desalination station, Abu Dhabi, UAE, are discussed. A hypothetic case of oil spill is assumed around the desalination station and the hydrodynamic model was used to predict the direction and concentration of oil around the station with emphasis on the places where seawater was used as feed water to the station. Based on predicted concentrations, the EIA was evaluated via the Rapid Impact Assessment Matrix (RIAM) model. The RIAM model seeks to overcome the problems of recording subjective judgments by defining the criteria and scales against which these judgments are to be made and by placing the results in a simple matrix that allows for permanent records of the arguments in the judgment process. In the EIA, the influence of oil contaminated seawater, when it is used as the feed water to the desalination plant, on the performance of system equipments and production water has been discussed. System units such as heat transfer tubes, temperature control, brine heater, vacuum system and evaporation chamber were utilized for evaluating the system performance. Production water quality was evaluated in relation to chlorination and organo-halogenic compounds, formation of trihalomethane (THM) by chlorination of product water, and corrosion of plant materials. Various remedial measures were proposed and evaluated in view of their technical, environmental (physical, chemical and biological), social and economic aspects.

AB  - The use and utility of the no observed effect concentration (NOEL) in ecological risk assessment is a contentious issue. One concern is that the NOEC is not representative of a concentration at which no biologically significant effect is occurring. A new method has been developed to estimate the threshold of toxicity, or a true NOEC, for aquatic plants. The method involves determining the effective concentration (ECx) of a number of endpoints from one species. These ECx values are plotted on a log-probability scale. The x-intercept, or a low centile, of the distribution can be interpreted as the threshold of toxicity for that plant at that response level. This threshold is the concentration at which no effects should be observed for any endpoint above that response level. It is based on the assumptions that multiple effect measures from a single species will be log-normally distributed and that the distribution contains all possible endpoints for that species. The thresholds and the distributions can then be used as a substitute for the NOEC or ECx in risk assessment techniques, such as hazard quotients and probabilistic ecological risk assessment. This new method of estimating toxicity thresholds is more realistic than the use of arbitrary uncertainty factors, is more conservative than current probabilistic risk assessment methods, allows for simple comparison between species and exposure duration to a toxicant, and may be useful for assessing mixture toxicity. This technique was applied to field derived data with Lemna gibba, Myriophyfum spicatum, and M. sibiricum to assess potential risks from monochloroacetic acid (MCA). Using this new risk assessment method, we conclude that MCA does not appear to pose a risk to aquatic macrophytes under field conditions at current environmental concentrations.

AB  - Extrapolating the effects of toxicants with either the fixed application factor approach or one of the species sensitivity distribution models currently in widespread use presumes that toxicant effects on single, individual-level endpoints (e.g., survival, fecundity, and growth) reflect effects at the population level. Here, we consider if extrapolations derived on the basis of individual-level endpoints might be misleading with regard to risk assessment and, hence, risk management decisions for ecosystems. Both analytically and by simulation, we demonstrate that for populations with multiplication rates close to one, effects of toxicants at the population level likely are less than or equal to effects on individual life-cycle traits, suggesting that risk assessments based on the latter likely are protective of population-level impacts. We used Monte Carlo simulations to explore how both the frequency of different life-cycle types in a community as well as their relative sensitivity to toxicants influence the toxicant sensitivity distribution of the community as a whole. We compared the output of our simulations with predicted no-effect concentrations derived by an application factor approach and a log-normal distribution-based model, using no-observed-effect concentrations for juvenile survival as input variables in both cases. Our analyses suggest that current extrapolation approaches appear to be protective, and may often be very overprotective, but we have identified conditions in which this may not be the case. We recommend that additional consideration be given to the relative frequency of different life-cycle types, to the proportions of sensitive and insensitive taxonomic groups in communities, and to the role of density-dependent influences on population dynamics to ensure that we develop environmental quality criteria that are sufficiently-but not overly-protective.

AB  - Environmental impact studies often involve monitoring and using bioindicators to evaluate the restoration stage of impacted areas. We aimed to assess ant assemblages' response to the ecological succession of previously disturbed areas in the Brazilian Amazon. We sampled epigeic ant assemblages in five bauxite mining areas, representing different restoration stages, and compared them with two pristine areas. We also compared trends in species richness at the same mine site investigated 14 years earlier. Ten pitfall traps and four Winkler samples of litter were taken along a 100-m transect in each area. We expected that ant species richness would increase with the amelioration in habitat condition (i.e., environmental surrogates of ecological succession, including litter depth, soil penetrability, the circumference of trees, the distance of trees to adjacent trees, and percentage of ground cover). We also compared the efficacy of both sampling methods. Due to more significant sampling effort, pitfall traps captured more ant species than Winkler sacks. However, Winkler samples' addition allowed the collection of more cryptic species than by pitfall traps alone. We sampled a total of 129 ant species, with increases in ant species richness in more mature rehabilitation. Nevertheless, similarity analysis indicated a significant difference between ant assemblages of rehabilitated areas and pristine ones. Assemblages differed mainly by the presence of specialist and rare species, found only in pristine plots. Rehabilitated areas exhibited a significant increase in tree circumference as they reached more ecologically advanced stages, which contributed to increasing ant species richness. These trends and comparison with the earlier study indicate that although there are favorable increases in ant species richness, in terms of species composition, rehabilitated areas were far from achieving an ant assemblage composition or environmental status that closely resembles pristine areas.

AB  - Avian species can be regarded as a bioindicator of environmental change. However, limited analysis are available on the effect of climate change on the distribution of birds in India. During recent years the distribution of the Indian Peafowl, (Pavo cristatus), a dryland species was observed to be expanding in Kerala, southern India, a region falling under the humid tropics. A study was conducted to understand the reasons for this expanding distribution, the influence of climatic variables and the future extent of distribution using MaxEnt. A Mean ensemble of five CMIP5 models were used to predict the potential distribution for the period 2050s (2041-2060) and 2070s (2061-2080) under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. The study identified that seasonality of temperature and precipitation during the driest quarter will be the major factors which determine the distribution of P. cristatus. The model showed that in current conditions 19.15% of the study area provides a suitable habitat for P. cristatus, whilst future predictions suggest that there may be a range expansion of 41.44% and 55.33% during the 2050s under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. In the 2070s, area of habitat range may decline to 22.09% and 32.22% under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. Comparison of various RCP scenarios showed high habitat suitability under RCP 8.5. Central Kerala is found to be the hotspot for the Indian Peafowl population expansion and the distribution may be prominent towards southeast and northwest during the 2050s and 2070s respectively. The study reveals that the Indian Peafowl acts as a bioindicator of the changing climate in Kerala.

AB  - This study diagnoses temporal and spatial variations in the performance of different social-ecological systems (SES) in coastal floodplain management in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta. We go beyond common pool resource management problems and address the management of local public goods. In the assessment, we consider recent developments in the framework initially developed by Elinor Ostrom. The main variables of the framework that we use are resource systems, the environment, the governance system and actors. The focal SES is defined based on guiding questions relating to the definition of the key problem, system boundaries, and action situations. According to our results, the performance of resource systems and the environment deteriorated in 1960-79 compared to the performance prior to 1960. The condition reached a low point during 1980-1999 but improved slightly after 1999. The horizontal network structure of local governance was active until 1960. Due to the introduction of the 'tidal river management' approach in the 90 s, the performance of the resource system and the environment has slightly improved, as has the involvement of government and non-government organizations. Our results also show that overall SES performance is comparatively better <in the case of locally managed floodplains than it is for those managed by government agencies. Our new approaches, such as the recent development of the diagnostic framework, the guiding questions for defining focal SES, and application of the framework to local public goods can potentially be used in the fields of sustainability science and SES science. The qualitative performance of each of the selected indicators is useful for identifying intervention options to achieve a sustainable outcome for the coastal floodplain SES.

AB  - The diversity relationship between tree and herb layer has often been investigated, but the results are contradictory. Moreover, few studies of deciduous European species have been conducted to date in natural or near-natural forests, while such studies in old-growth forest with considerable co-dominance of oak are missing.
   In one of the best preserved natural European beech-sessile oak forests (Runcu-Grosi Natural Reserve, Western Romania) we investigated whether there is a correlation between canopy-layer diversity and herb-layer diversity. Structural diversity, vegetation composition, ecological and functional traits were evaluated. Our results show that the herb-layer diversity is higher under canopy with greater tree-layer diversity, and the diversity of both layers depend on whether the overstorey is dominated by beech or sessile oak. Herb layers of plots with oak co-dominance showed higher indicator values for light and temperature, and a higher proportion of graminoides and shrub species. In contrast, herb-layer in beech plots is dominated by juvenile trees, mainly beech and competitive herb species. Oak plots are characterised by a generally more evenly distributed herb-layer composition. Species richness of herb-layer was higher under a diversely structured overstorey, which was mainly achieved when oak was present in the canopy, and correlated negatively with litter thickness, which was highest in beech plots. We conclude that the identity of the dominant canopy species is most important for herb layer species composition and diversity. Furthermore, the plots with oak occurrence in the overstorey even with weak proportion (around 20% of stand basal area) features a higher biodiversity of species in the understorey.

AB  - The increasing contamination of fresh water resource by toxic metals and Persistence Organic Pollutants (POPs) is a major environmental concern globally. In the present investigation, surface sediments collected from three main rivers named, Makelele, Kalamu and Nsanga, draining through the city of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo, were characterized for grain size, organic matter, toxic metals, POPs (including organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs)), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Furthermore, enrichment factor (EF) and geoaccumulation index (Igeo) were performed to determine metal source and pollution status. The results highlighted high concentration of toxic metals in all sediment samples, reaching the values (mg kg(-1)) of 325 (Cu), 549 (Zn), 165 (Pb) and 1.5 (Cd). High values of PCBs and OCPs were detected in sediment samples, e.g. in Makelele river, PCB values ranged from 0.9 to 10.9 with total PCBs (Sigma 7 PCBs x 4.3): 169.3 mu g kg(-1); OCPs from 21.6 to 146.8 with Sigma OCPs: 270.6 mu g kg(-1). The PBDEs concentrations were higher in investigated rivers comparatively with values detected in many rivers from Sub-Saharan Africa. The EPAHs value ranged from 22.6 to 1011.9 mu g kg(-1). River contamination may be explained by local intense domestic activities, urban and agricultural runoff, industrial and hospital wastewaters discharge into the rivers without prior treatment. This research provides not only a first baseline information on the extent of contamination in this tropical ecosystem but also represents useful tools incorporated to evaluate sediment quality in the river receiving systems which can be applied to similar aquatic environments.

AB  - I investigated whether the morphological traits of Neotropical ants can be used to infer food resource use by individual species and by entire communities, and whether these relationships are related to habitat type and/or by morphological differences between ant subfamilies. I attracted ants using food baits that represented different ecological processes (e.g. predation, granivory, detritivory, nectarivory) in five habitat types along a land-use gradient (from forests to gardens). I assessed ant activity at the baits and characterized 64 species from six subfamilies according to their food use and community-level resource exploitation intensity in the different habitats. Next, I performed a Mantel test to reveal the relationships between 13 morphological measures and resource use at the species level. I then used ant clades (i.e. subfamily) and habitat to rank the ants along three axes of variation in relation to their morphology and food resource use. Finally, I tested whether associations existed between the community-level exploitation intensity for such resources and the distribution of morphological trait values using the "4th-corner" analysis. Morphological traits were closely linked to the species' ability to exploit different resources. These relationships were affected by subfamily and, to a lesser extent, by habitat type. The characterization of trait sets for entire communities was not useful, however, in predicting the intensity of the exploitation of different types of resources in varying environmental conditions. I conclude that morphological traits are accurate predictors of the ecology of species, but they should be used with caution when trying to understand community-level patterns. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The hypothesis that soil chemistry is a main constraint for the vigour of Norway spruce trees on calcareous soils is scrutinised based on data from 60 existing and new intensive study sites in the Bavarian Alps, where comprehensive information on soils, climate, foliar nutrient concentration, ground vegetation, and tree growth is available. We characterised ecological gradients of the response variables site index (SI), foliar nutrient level and needle weight by constrained ordination, identified nutrient limitations based on regression trees and modelled SI based on vegetation-based mean Ellenberg indicator values. Our study confirms the assumption that soil development and concurrent acidification are key determinants for the vitality and growth of spruce in the Bavarian Alps, which surpass the importance of climate on nutrition and growth. Pools and availability of P and N are limiting nutrition and growth of spruce in this region. We hypothesize that N-limitation persists despite considerable deposition inputs because N tends to be locked up in organic horizons with low biological activity. K and trace elements, especially Fe, can also be deficient in some cases but do not appear as major limiting factors. High foliar Mn concentrations are a reliable indicator of mature soils and favourable site conditions in the Bavarian Alps, but Mn itself is usually not limiting. P must be regarded as the most critical macronutrient in the Bavarian Alps, particularly in the face of biomass harvesting. Consequently, at sites with shallow soils forest, management should focus on sustaining or restoring humus stocks. SI of spruce can be predicted from composition of ground vegetation and Ellenberg indicator values with remarkable precision (R (2) = 0.75).

AB  - Ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management (EBM) attempt to account for fishing, climate variability and species interactions when formulating fisheries management advice. Ecosystem models that investigate the combined effects of ecological processes are vital to support the implementation of EBM by assessing the effectiveness of management strategies in an ecosystem context. In this study, an individual-based ecosystem model was used to demonstrate how species at different trophic levels and of different life histories responded to climate regimes and how well different single- or various multi-species fisheries at different intensities perform in terms of human benefits (yield) and trade-offs (fishery closures) as well as their impacts on the ecosystem. In addition, other performance indicators were also used to evaluate management strategies. The simulations indicated that under no fishing, each species responded to the regimes differently due to different life history traits and different trophic interactions. Fishing at the level of natural mortality (F = M) produced the highest yields within each fishery, however, an F adjusted for the current productivity conditions (regime) resulted in much fewer fishery closures compared with F = M, indicating the advantage of implementing a policy of a regime-specific F from the stand point of conservation and fishery stability. Furthermore, a regime-specific F strategy generally resulted in higher yield and fewer fishery closures compared with F = 0.5M. Other performance indicators also pointed to the advantage of using a regime-specific F strategy in terms of the stability of both ecosystem and fishery production. As a specific example, fishing the predators of Pacific herring under all multi-species fisheries scenarios increased the yield of Pacific herring and reduced the number of herring fishery closures. This supports the conclusion that an exploitation strategy which is balanced across all trophic levels produces better outcomes, as advocated by other researchers.

AB  - Most ecological effect assessment methodologies use effect concentrations derived from single-species testing (EC(x,single-species-test)) as the basis to estimate 'safe' environmental concentrations (such as environmental quality criteria). Here, we examined to what extent such EC(x,single-species-test) are representative for population-level effect concentrations in a community setting (EC(x,multi-species-test)). Data from USEPA's ECOTOX database revealed the existence of considerable scatter around the relationship between EC(x,single-species-test) (endpoint: mortality) and EC(x,multi-species-test) (endpoint: population abundance). However, we demonstrate that this scatter is reduced when EC(x,single-species-test) and EC(x,multi-species-test) are determined simultaneously and by the same research group. Indeed, if these conditions are fulfilled, the quotient of both ECx values for invertebrates approaches 1 for chemicals that directly target invertebrates. Unfortunately, comparable data for other classes of chemicals and/or taxonomic groups were not found. However, theoretical ecosystem model simulations, which confirmed the results based on the above-mentioned analysis of the ECOTOX database, indicated that for phytoplankton, EC(10,single-species-test)>EC(10,multi-species-test), for chemicals that directly target invertebrates. For chemicals that directly target phytoplankton, the ecosystem model simulations suggest that EC(x,single-species-test)>EC(x,multi-species-test) for both phytoplankton and invertebrates. Hence, our observation based on the analysis of existing experimental data that the EC(x,single-species-test) is similar to the EC(x,multi-species-test) may be biased by the fact that only data were available for invertebrates and for chemicals targeting invertebrates. Experimental research is required to test the predictions made by the model simulations for phytoplankton as well as for chemicals directly targeting phytoplankton. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - 1. A novel protocol was developed for ecological prioritization of coral reefs for inclusion in a marine reserve network. Standard benthic survey data were normalized and combined in a conservation priority index (CPI) which rates individual candidate sites according to their ecological values and their potential contributions to an effective network. 2. The CPI differentiates between sites on the basis of strength or weakness of surrogates for desirable attributes such as benthic biodiversity, reef-building capacity and hard-coral resilience. 3. Biodiversity and reef-building attributes (more is better) were assigned progressive weightings (high abundance, high score), whereas neutral or detrimental attributes (less is better) were assigned regressive weightings (high abundance, low score). 4. Abundance of small corals (new recruits and remnants) was included as an indicator of a site's potential for recovery following disturbance. 5. The CPI rankings were used in conjunction with multidimensional scaling to prioritize candidate sites for a proposed reserve network near Salvador, Brazil. The information is complementary to considerations of existing uses and socio-economic considerations, in the prioritization of reefs for protection. 6. The approach ensured that ecological inputs to the broader marine spatial planning process embraced both representativeness of biodiversity per se and the investigator's evaluation of key qualitative site attributes (amount, size, and resilience indicators for the critical architectural components hard coral and encrusting coralline algae).

AB  - Tropical and subtropical rivers are being subjected to multiple stressors from human disturbance (e.g., water pollution and habitat degradation). Understanding the relationship between environmental conditions and the river ecosystem is important for improving river management. We built 14 Ecopath models composed of 28 functional groups (trophic levels [TLs] of 1.0-3.8) along a subtropical urban river to explore the influence of environmental changes on system attributes. From headwaters to downstream, the model outputs showed that the transfer efficiency (TE), energy flow parameters, and ecosystem theory indices exhibited significant (P < 0.05) differences across a longitudinal gradient of disturbance, indicating heterogeneous attributes of local river segments. The high TE values of TLs I, II, and III separated the upper, middle, and lower reaches, respectively, which could be attributed to the shift in dominant consumption flows from upstream 'periphyton - aquatic insects - insectivorous fish' to midstream 'detritus - shrimp - crustaceavorous fish' and to downstream 'phytoplankton - filter feeding invertebrates/fish'. Structural equation modelling was used to test the causal relationships among environmental variables and demonstrated that abiotic factors directly influenced biomass composition and indirectly influenced trophic networks. Water quality, including dissolved oxygen and flow velocity; habitat characteristics, such as riffles, cobble-gravel substrate, and seasonal floodplain; and biological indicators, including the relative contributions (%) of decapods, insectivorous fish, and insect scrapers to biomass composition, had significant (P < 0.05) positive impacts on system maturity (evaluated by omnivory, connectance, and cycling indices).

AB  - Anthropogenic activities in the Krishna River have altered its flow regime and affected the ecosystems in the river. It is essential to maintain an optimum Environmental Flow (EF) in the river to recover from its deteriorated ecosystem. The present study is to estimate Environment Flow Requirement (EFRs) and the Hydrological Alteration (HA) (Flow changes) that take place on the Krishna River at five dam sites. Pre and post construction impact flow data are collected at five gauge stations which are located downstream of these five dams. The flow data which are impacted by climate variability are removed and the study is focussed on the impact of human activities. These EFRs are estimated using statistical relationships between the Krishna River flow regime and ecological indicator with the help of the Global Environmental Flow Calculator (GEFC). HA is used to analyse how the recommended EFRs are different in the post-impact period (after the dam construction). Hydraulic indicators like water depth and velocity are determined by importing estimated EF values into a Hydrologic Engineering Centre's - River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) model. The habitation analysis is carried out to check whether the hydraulic indicators are providing an acceptable habitation for aquatic species in the study area. The results from HA analysis showed that the required EFRs in the Krishna River were not maintained for almost 43% of the time in the post impact period. The hydraulic analysis showed that recommended EFR is providing velocity in the range of 0.12 m/s to 1.08 m/s and water depth in the range of 0.23 m to 3.16 m throughout the basin. From the habitation study, it is observed that the results obtained from the GEFC approach is providing excellent habitation under the dams of Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar. Good habitation conditions are seen under Narayanapur, Ujjani, and PD Jurala dams.

AB  - The process of developing a socioenvironmental report card through transdisciplinary collaboration can be used in any system and can provide the foundation for collaborative solutions for sustainable resource management by creating a holistic assessment that balances environmental, economic, and social concerns that incorporates multiple perspectives from multisectoral actors. We demonstrated this in the Mississippi River watershed, USA with the ultimate goal of promoting holistic management of the region's natural resources. But working at the scale of the Mississippi River watershed presents the challenge of working across geographical, organizational, and disciplinary boundaries. The development of a socioenvironmental report card served as the focus for efforts to foster a shared vision among diverse stakeholders in the watershed and to promote transdisciplinary collaboration. The process engaged more than 700 participants from environment, flood control, transportation, water supply, economy, and recreation sectors, from more than 400 organizations representing local, state, and federal government agencies, businesses and trade associations, and private, nonprofit, and academic institutions. This broad engagement in the selection of important themes, indicators, measures, and assessment methods as part of the cocreation of boundary objects aimed to foster social and mutual learning and to develop common understanding and shared visioning among stakeholders with differing perspectives. The process was facilitated by boundary-spanning organizations, creating an atmosphere of trust by utilizing "third places" for knowledge exchange and integration. This transdisciplinary process also led to collective action through collaboration and selection of restoration and management activities that could improve conditions for multiple sectors simultaneously and/or recognize potential tradeoffs for informed decision making.Integr Environ Assess Manag2020;16:494-507.

AB  - Sport fishing is a growing segment in the fishing sector in Brazil. It is, however, an activity that depends upon young shrimp and fish offer to supply live bait demand, its extraction might result on overfishing and compromise natural stock. The intensive cultivation in water recirculation system is a worldwide trend for aquaculture, which, in addition to increasing productivity, minimizes the impact of effluent emission on the environment, reinforcing sustainability. This study analyzed the economic viability of establishing farms for the cultivation of lambari (Deutorodon iguape) in water recirculation system to meet the market demand of sport fishing for live baits. Twelve fiberglass tanks with a volume of 1500 L and a unit area of 1.32 m(2) (production units - PU) were installed in a total area of 130 m(2). There were also six fiberglass tanks of 2,000 L capacity each, filled with water and 600 kg of clamshells acting as biological filter. Three production cycles were performed, each lasting 60 days. In each cycle 10,800 D. iguape fingerlings were added, acquired from local fish farming, at a 600 fish m(-3) density, totalizing 900 fish per PU, with medium size and weight of 10 +/- 1.2 mm e 1.1 +/- 0.29 g. We used the following indicators: modified internal rate of return (MIRR), net present value (NPV), annualized net present value (ANPV) and payback period (PP). The best scenario, with 90% survival rate and unitary selling prices of US$ 0.30, showed MIRR 33.19%, NPV (10%) US$ 42,174.03, ANPV (10%) US$ 6,863.63 and PP 0.9 years, demonstrating be interesting the production of live baits in the conditions proposed in this study.

AB  - Understanding how reclamation practices influence plant community assembly and succession is an important step in developing realistic indicators and targets for reclamation of oil sands mine sites to upland forest ecosystems. We currently have a poor understanding of factors affecting plant community assembly and succession in reclaimed oil sands sites. Through synthesis of research completed over the last 24 years, we identify four key findings: (i) use of surface soil and forest floor material salvaged from mined areas increases plant species cover, richness, and diversity relative to the use of various other cover soil materials (such as clay subsoil); (ii) stockpiling of salvaged surface soils decreases the abundance of native plant propagules and delays early vegetation community development; (iii) differences in plant community composition between reclaimed and adjacent mature forests remain two decades after placing cover soils; however, differences are smaller with use of forest floor-mineral mix than peat-mineral mix; and (iv) plant community assembly is in progress but communities remain different to those found in natural undisturbed conditions. Our review identified critical knowledge gaps for further research to improve understanding of: (i) long-term (60 to 100 years) plant community composition in reclaimed oil sands sites; (ii) how residual forest patches near disturbed oil sands sites act as seed and propagule sources in newly reclaimed sites; (iii) plant community assembly processes in reclamation sites; (iv) the effect of micro-topographic heterogeneity on plant community development; and (v) how soil nutrient availability in different substrates influences plant community development over the long term. Ongoing support for selected existing studies and establishment of new studies focusing on plant community development through long-term monitoring are highly recommended.

AB  - Most evaluations of agri-environment policies conducted in Europe have focused on biodiversity improvement effects. Their effectiveness with respect to protecting existing biodiversity has been less investigated. Biodiversity and landscape protection effects can be expected in marginal agricultural areas, where farming has been less intensive.
   We investigated (i) the effectiveness of the Ecological Compensation Area (ECA) scheme for biodiversity protection according to different evaluation criteria and (ii) how the effectiveness of the scheme was influenced by climate, socio-economic conditions and farming structures. Vegetation surveys were carried out in 18 municipalities across the Swiss Alps on 162 randomly selected meadows managed as ECAs and on 162 conventionally managed meadows. Average species richness of ECA-meadows per municipality ranged between 27 and 46 vascular plant species per 25m(2) (conventionally managed meadows: 16-35 species per 25 m(2)). In lower altitude municipalities (mainly fulltime farming) where ECA meadows constituted 20% of farmland, the difference in species richness between the two land-use types was highly significant and the contribution of ECA-meadows to the grassland species pool was highest. In higher altitude municipalities (mainly part-time farming) where ECA meadows constituted at least 40% of farmland, higher species richness was found. This was associated with a strong botanical similarity of ECA and conventionally managed meadows.
   We conclude that at lower altitudes, where farming is relatively intensive, the ECA scheme protects a few, economically marginal, species rich and botanically complementary sites, important for maintaining the species pool. At higher altitudes the ECA scheme contributes to protecting existing biodiversity at the landscape scale. As it is more efficient to protect than to restore biodiversity, the protection effect of agri-environmental schemes needs to be adequately recognized. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Previously published multidisciplinary studies in the Miramichi and Bouctouche rivers (New Brunswick, Canada) noted significant changes in fish health parameters, including elevated tissue levels of organic contaminants and a wide range of physiological disturbances, in mummichog Fundulus heteroclitus (L.) from a site on the Miramichi River that received bleached kraft pulpmill and municipal effluent. The present study reports differences in the abundance of individual parasite species, as well as parasite infracommunity and component community composition, in mummichog from both rivers. These differences were evaluated in relation to host (size, condition, immune function, tissue organochlorine contaminant levels) and environmental (faecal coliform counts, salinity, temperature) data derived from the previously published studies. Overall, 18 parasite species were identified, the most common of which were Ascocotyle sp. larv., Ornithodiplostomum sp. larv., Posthodiplostomum sp. larv., and Proteocephalus filicollis (Rudolphi, 1802). There were broad differences in parasite community structure and composition between rivers and within rivers, the most prominent pattern being a pronounced difference between sites in the upper and lower estuary of each river that was likely driven by salinity. Mean infracommunity richness was also positively related to faecal coliforms (considered here as a surrogate measure of eutrophication via municipal sewage), and both were highest at the most polluted site. We noted no other significant relationships. Thus our data suggest that the parasite communities in these two estuaries were primarily structured by large upstream / downstream ecological gradients in salinity, and secondarily by eutrophication due to pollution by municipal and industrial effluents. Overall, our results highlight the value of coordinated multidisciplinary studies for understanding the factors that shape parasite abundance and community structure.

AB  - Two Tunisian lagoons and a coast location, diversely subject to anthropogenic activities and differing according to their degree of communication with the sea, were studied seasonally. The principal environmental variables (temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen) were measured ill situ. Jointly, main benthic macrofauna factors and the AZTI Marine Biotic Index (AMBI) were determined and analyzed. Results show that the seasonal fluctuations of the benthic communities Structure differ in the three studied sites and are controlled mainly by the pollution and the hydrodynamic flow. In the first almost enclosed area (southern lagoon of Tunis) where measured environmental factors are more fluctuating and anthropogenic activities are important, the benthic community is more affected all year. The total abundance varies from 1279 to 7547 ind./m(2) and the specific richness from 31 to 61 species, however the evenness does not exceed 0.25 all year. In the other almost enclosed area (lagoon of Ghar El-Melh) which is less exposed to anthropogenic activities, fauna synthetic factors are less fluctuating, the abundance varies from 362 to 959 ind./m2, the specific richness from 29 to 52 species and the evenness from 0.33 to 0.61. Also, in this site, first signs of degradation appear only in autumn in most stagnant waters. However, in the bay of Tunis and despite the strong anthropogenic pressures, the benthic community seems to be in satisfactory environmental conditions due, certainly, to the stronger hydrodynamic flow. In this coastal area, fauna synthetic factors are clearly less fluctuating between the two studied seasons, winter and summer. They are respectively 236-799 ind./m(2) for the abundance, 50-54 species for the specific richness and 0.43-0.73 for the evenness.

AB  - Ecological risk assessment of O-3 impact requires consideration of many factors that, perhaps, are not of concern in human health risk assessment. The episodic nature of O-3 exposure, functional complexity of species assemblages, and the broad spatial and temporal scales characteristic of natural ecosystems make ecological risk assessment extremely difficult. The majority of exposure studies using plants have examined the sensitivity of individual species, growing under controlled conditions. Research has shown that individuals growing in plant mixtures may not respond the same way to O-3 as when growing alone. In addition, other naturally occurring stresses can modify plant response to O-3. Understanding the effect of O-3 on natural systems and protecting vegetation resources represent significant scientific and regulatory challenges.
   Here we review several factors that need to be considered when evaluating ecosystem response to O-3. Then we briefly present two examples of controlled seedling studies that were conducted to better understand mechanisms of tree response to O-3. In the first example controlled exposure studies revealed responses in tree roots that led to hypothesis testing in the field in ponderosa. pine ecosystems. Field experiments have confirmed a similar response in root biomass and carbohydrates across a natural O-3 gradient in S. California, suggesting at least a partial role for O-3 in the response. The second example illustrates the difficulty of understanding mechanistic interactions to O-3 stress even in controlled chamber studies. The second example also illustrates the difficulty of using chamber studies to understand responses in the field. While our knowledge of vegetation response to O-3 is extensive and compelling, important questions remain about how to quantify these effects in the field, assess their magnitude, and establish a suitable standard that is protective of ecosystems.

AB  - Wildlife habitats in the United Kingdom are both limited, and severely threatened by development. Legislation on Environmental Assessment (EA) offers opportunities for ecological considerations to be taken into account in the planning and design of new developments, but the ability to quantify potential ecological impacts has been hampered by the complexities of dealing with large volumes of spatially referenced data. Linear developments such as roads present particular problems for ecological assessment, because they often affect many habitat types and exert influences at a range of scales. This paper describes an approach to the ecological assessment of proposed road developments based on systematic spatial analysis of the relationship between roads and selected categories of land cover derived from satellite imagery. The impacts of two hypothetical route options on the distribution and area of these categories are assessed both in relation to each other and to regional baseline conditions, in order to estimate cumulative impacts of road development in the region. Local and regional impacts are quantified in terms of land-take and habitat fragmentation for those categories considered most important for nature conservation: broadleaved woodland and lowland heathland. The results of the study suggest that remotely sensed land cover data, in conjunction with a geographical information system (GIS), can be used to improve the effectiveness of ecological assessment techniques for certain habitat types at the landscape level. By developing cost-effective methods for ecological assessment of route options, it is hoped that ecological considerations can be incorporated into the design and planning process for new road developments at an earlier stage, making it possible to avoid cumulative loss of vulnerable habitats at the regional level, and to incorporate effective mitigation measures into the design of preferred options.

AB  - The biodiversity of headwater streams is gradually degrading as a result of urbanization. Although not always successful, ecosystem restoration can be useful in reversing such kind of degradation. In this study, chironomid pupal exuviae (Diptera) were be used as an indicator of riparian vegetation recovery success in the urban headwater streams of the Cerrado biome. Based on the "field of dreams" hypothesis, it was predicted that chironomid communities would significantly respond to this vegetation recovery through the colonization of urban habitats. Chironomids were collected using the surface-floating pupal exuviae technique in 10 urban and 10 reference sites (n = 60) during the dry season. The streams were characterized with the help of variables such as the Riparian Channel and Environmental Inventory (RCE) protocol, pH level, dissolved oxygen, depth, width of stream channel, flow velocity, land use composition, and the time elapsed after the vegetation in the streams were restored and measured. The urban headwater sites were wider and had a higher stream flow velocity owing to the bank erosion process, which resulted in low RCE scores. There weren't any differences in the total taxa richness, abundance, beta diversity, and community composition between the urban and the reference sites. In urban streams, chironomid abundance was significantly and positively associated with the width and depth of the stream channel. Taxa richness responded positively to the physical and biological condition of the stream habitat (i.e., the sum of RCE scores), whereas turnover (beta diversity) responded significantly and negatively to land use. According to the indicator species analysis, different taxa richness was associated with each type of site, Pentaneura in urban, while Stenochironomus and Stempellinella in reference sites. The pool species of local streams and the recovery of vegetation through restoration (which improves habitat heterogeneity) were important factors in recovering the chironomid communities.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are a growing threat to marine biota and ecosystems, and zooplankton are at high risk of ingesting MPs. The seasonal changes in MPs in zooplankton and the key environmental factors influencing the retention of MPs in zooplankton are largely unknown. For the first time, the characteristics of MPs in copepods across four seasons in Jiaozhou Bay. The abundance, shape, size, and chemical composition of the MPs in copepods were investigated, and the relationships between the MP/copepod value and key environmental factors were analyzed. The results revealed a significant seasonal difference in MP/copepod values in Jiaozhou Bay. MP/copepod values were 0.26, 0.23, 0.14 and 0.16 in February, May, August and November, respectively. The MP/copepod value was significantly higher in winter and spring than in summer and significantly higher in the estuarine zone than in other zones. Seawater temperature was negatively correlated with the MP/copepod value. No significant seasonal differences were detected in the characteristics of MPs in copepods in Jiaozhou Bay. The size of MPs in copepods ranged from 90 to 2485 ?m, with an average of 454 ? 376 ?m. Fiber MPs were the most risky to copepods, accounting for 92% of the total ingested MPs. In terms of the chemical composition of the MPs, a total of 11 polymers were detected in copepods in Jiaozhou Bay in the four seasons. The main components were polyester and cellophane (41.9% and 25.7%, respectively). This study provides the key parameters of the MPs in copepods in Jiaozhou Bay and is an important basis for further ecological risk assessments of MPs. The chronic effects of low-level MP retention on copepods, the impact of fibers on copepods, and appropriate assessments of MP risk under different environmental conditions are recommended as research topics

AB  - Introduction: Radon-induced biological effects have been studied mainly through epidemiological investigations, and well-controlled in vitro and in vivo experiments. To provide data explaining radon exposure-induced harmful effects in natural environment, exposure assessment under these conditions is needed. The objective of the study was to examine the level of genetic damage assessed with biomarkers of DNA single- and double-strand breaks (SSBs and DSBs) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from individuals continuously exposed to Rn in homes. Naturally elevated Rn concentrations in homes can be found in the South of Poland, in Kowary city.
   Methods: Measurements of expression of phosphorylated histone gamma H2AX was used as a marker of DNA double strand breaks. To detect DNA single and double-strand breaks and alkali labile sites, the alkaline comet assay was used. Oxidative damage of DNA was evaluated by formamidopyrimidyne (FPG)-modified comet assay. The blood was collected from 94 volunteers living in Kowary. Subjects were grouped according to their status of living in radon concentration >= 100 Bq/m(3) (n = 67), and <100 Bq/m(3) (n = 27).
   Results: The statistically significant differences in levels of DNA damage in peripheral lymphocytes assessed with comet assay were found to be associated with levels of radon exposure in indoor air (p = 0.034). DNA damage in the comet assay was significantly correlated with DNA damage assessed with gamma H2AX staining.
   Conclusions: Results of the present study indicate the suitability of alkaline comet assay for the detection of DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes of people environmentally exposed to radon. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the context of global precipitation anomalies and climate warming, the evolution of fragile desert ecosystems, which account for one-third of the world's land area, will become more complex. Studies of regional climate change and ecosystem response are important components of global climate change research, especially in arid desert regions. Zygophyllum xanthoxylum and Ammopiptanthus mongolicus are two dominant but endangered shrub species in the Alxa Desert in the arid region of central Asia. Using dendrochronological methods, we studied the response of radial growth of those two species to climate factors, and the adaptability of the two shrub populations under a regional warming trend. We found that radial growth of both shrubs was mainly affected by precipitation during the growing season. In additionally, along with the decrease of precipitation and the increase of temperature from east to west of Alxa desert Plateau, the limiting effect of drought during the growing season on radial growth increased. The climate response characteristics and changes between diy and wet periods exhibited spatial and temporal heterogeneity due to micro-level geomorphological factors. Under a regional climate warming trend, individual growth and population development of the two endangered shrubs will be adversely affected. In areas where these species are naturally distributed, populations will gradually become concentrated in micro-geomorphic regions with better soil moisture conditions, such as low-lying areas in the gullies that develop in alluvial fans. This finding has important scientific significance for understanding the development of the region's dominant shrub populations and protection of these and other endangered plants in arid desert areas.

AB  - Sustainable development aims to enhance the quality of life by improving the social, economic and environmental conditions for present and future generations. A sustainable engineering decision-making strategy for design and assessment of construction works (i.e., civil engineering and buildings) should take into account considerations regarding the society, the economy and the environment. This study presents a novel approach for the life cycle assessment (LCA) of a case-study building subjected to seismic actions during its service life, accounting for structural reliability.
   A methodology is presented that evaluates the time-dependent probability of exceeding a limit state considering the uncertainty in the representation of seismic action. By employing this methodology, the earthquake-induced damages are related to the environmental and social losses caused by the occurrence of the earthquake. A LCA of a case-study building accounting for the time-dependent seismic reliability is conducted using a damage-oriented LCA approach.
   The contributions of the different life cycle phases to the total environmental impact related to the building lifetime are in agreement with previous results in this field of study. However, the LCA results revealed significant risk-based contributions for the rehabilitation phase due to the induced damage resulting in seismic events. Particularly, the rehabilitation phase is expected to contribute to the total environmental impact with around the 25 % of the initial environmental impact load (related to the pre-use phase) as a consequence of seismic damage.
   The probability of occurrence of seismic events affects the LCA results for various life cycle phases of a building in terms of all the indicators adopted in the analysis. The time-dependent probability of collapse in a year can represent a benchmark indicator for human safety in the context of social sustainability for the building sector. The proposed approach can be implemented in a sustainable decision-making tool for design and assessment.

AB  - The ocean ecosystems around the west Antarctic Peninsula and South Georgia are two of the best described regional ecosystems of the Southern Ocean. They therefore provide a useful basis for developing comparative analyses of ocean ecosystems around the Antarctic. There are clear and expected differences in seasonality and species composition between the two ecosystems, but these mask an underlying similarity in ecosystem structure and function. This similarity results from the two ecosystems being part of a continuum, from more ice covered regions in the south to open water regions in the north. Within this continuum the major factors affecting ecosystem structure and function are the sea ice, the biogeochemical conditions and the connectivity generated by the flow of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Antarctic krill are central to the food web in both ecosystems, but the other species of plankton and predators present are different. These different species provide alternative pathways of energy transfer from primary production to the highest trophic levels. The relative dominance of these species can provide indicators of change in ecosystem structure and function. Both ecosystems are changing as a result of physically and biologically driven processes, and the ecological responses being observed are complex and variable across different species and within the two regions. Species in parts of the northern Antarctic Peninsula are being replaced by species that currently dominate farther north in more oceanic areas such as at South Georgia. The similarity of structure and strong connectivity, mean that projections of future change will require generic models of these ecosystems that can encompass changes in structure and function within a connected continuum from ice covered to open water in winter.

AB  - Institutional and federal ethics committees regulate research on live vertebrate animals. Current regulations require researchers to provide environmental enrichment for laboratory animals. The intention is that such enrichment reduces stress and prevents atypical behavior of captive animals, enhancing the ethical treatment of these individuals, as well as providing more robust scientific results. Enrichment can take various forms but most frequently mimics aspects of the animal's natural environment, such as the inclusion of plant life, shelters, conspecifics, or providing challenges to keep the animals occupied. These approaches have proven effective for mammals and birds; however, we know little about the effectiveness of environmental enrichment for other common research taxa, such as reptiles and amphibians. These taxa are more phylogenetically distant from humans, making intuition an unreliable guide upon which to base decisions about ethics best practice, including the benefits of environmental enrichment. The eastern fence lizard, Sceloporus undulatus, spends much of its time off the ground. Therefore, we provided climbing enrichment to captive fence lizards to allow them the opportunity to carry out this common natural behavior in captivity, and tested its effect on a range of ecologic- and scientifically relevant physiological and behavioral parameters. The provision of environmental enrichment, in the form of raised basking platforms, did not affect survival (P=0.25), baseline levels of plasma corticosterone (an indicator of physiological stress; P=0.81), activity (P=0.19), basking behavior (P=0.89), time spent hiding (P=0.59), growth (mass: P=0.44; snout-vent length: P=0.47), or overall body condition of these lizards (P=0.61). This lack of an effect highlights the need for researchers to objectively test the effectiveness of enrichment, rather than relying on subjectivity and anthropomorphism when making decisions about their use.

AB  - Process-based models are increasingly applied for simulating long-term forest developments in order to capture climate change impacts and to investigate suitable management responses. Regarding dimensional development, however, allometric relations such as the height/diameter ratio, branch and coarse root fractions or the dependency of crown dimension on stem diameter often do not account for environmental influences. While this may be appropriate for even-aged, monospecific forests, serious biases can be expected if stand density or forest structure changes rapidly. Such events occur in particular when forests experience disturbances such as intensive thinning or during early development stages of planted or naturally regenerated trees. We therefore suggest a calculation of allometric relationships that depends primarily on neighbourhood competition. Respective equations have been implemented into a physiology-based ecosystem model that considers asymmetric competition by explicit simulation of resource acquisition and depletion per canopy layer. The new implementation has been tested at two sites in Germany where beech (Fagus sylvatica) saplings have either been planted below a shelterwood of old spruces (Picea abies) or grown under clear-cut conditions. We show that the modified model is able to realistically describe tree development in response to stand density changes and is able to represent regeneration growth beneath a gradually decreasing overstorey of mature trees. In particular, the model could represent the faster crown size development in saplings until full ground coverage is established and a faster height growth afterwards. The effect enhances leaf area and thus assimilation per tree and increases carbon availability for stem growth at early development stages. Finally, the necessity to consider dynamic allometric relations with respect to climate change impacts is discussed, and further improvements are suggested.

AB  - The process of agricultural production is associated with a complex of factors of a different nature: systemic, technological, biological, socioeconomic, climatic, reproductive, environmental. All of them influence the size and stability of economic and financial results. There is a threshold level of enterprise management complexity, the excess of which motivates agribusiness to switch to computerized methods. Management of an agricultural enterprise should be based on planning results, updated in a rolling mode. When developing the annual plan, it is necessary to take into account a lot of heterogeneous information and tend to the optimal solution - the achievement of the target indicators with the minimum expenditure of resources. As the basis of the optimal annual planning system, the article proposes an economic-mathematical model for optimizing the production and industry structure of an agricultural enterprise, which includes the following modules: assessment of the parameters of the yield production functions based on field history, the formation of a fertilizer application plan with justification of economically feasible yield levels, solving the problem of optimizing the sectoral structure of crop production, taking into account the forecrop influence in the crop rotation. The algorithm for finding an effective and stable production structure under various combinations of environmental conditions implements the following sequence of procedures: generation of parameter combinations of the economic-mathematical model; obtaining the optimal solution for each combination of these parameters; assessment of the mathematical expectation of the efficiency criterion and variance for each optimal solution on a variety of parameter combinations; choice of a highly effective solution with a low dispersion of this efficiency. To implement this algorithm, the method of simulation experiments in the space of system parameters is used. The optimal solution is chosen by minimizing the distance to the "ideal point" (maximum efficiency, minimum dispersion).

AB  - In recent years, OP-FTIR spectrometry has been successfully used to monitor hazardous air pollutants, greenhouse gases and other emission products. This ground-based remote sensing method has proven itself to be a flexible long-path technique for the characterization of large atmospheric volumes, enabling simultaneous detection of various volatile atmospheric compounds relevant for environmental assessment via a single rapid measurement. Within our research, we applied both active and passive ground-based OP-FTIR spectroscopy as a screening tool for the detection of fugitive greenhouse gas emissions. The method was proven as offering a suitable 'compliance toolbox' for continuous monitoring of the complex systems at the ground surface-atmosphere boundary, allowing large-scale identification and quantification of atmospheric composition over large areas to be achieved, in terms of identifying zones of higher leakage vulnerability. In this paper, we compiled our research results and highlight the adaption options of the field technology, illustrated measuring options and case studies at urban, natural and industrial sites. Furthermore, this technology was validated regarding its applicability in environmental atmospheric monitoring. The results show that passive OP-FTIR measurements offer the chance to achieve robust and reliable surveys in various arbitrary measurement directions to gain a comprehensive overview. However, to improve quantitative analysis in the case of weak sources, the application of an active open-path spectrometer is recommended. It should be noted that our investigations demonstrate that site-specific parameters such as prevailing wind directions, meteorological conditions, topographic influences, infrastructure, other artificial emission sources, and biological background need to be measured both prior to and during atmospheric monitoring and should be taken into account for comprehensive interpretation.

AB  - The ancient scientific Sanskrit texts of Ayurveda (science of longevity) deal with waters, plants, and animals in relation to human health. Based on the studies mentioned in Ayurveda and modern literature, biological responses of grazing animals in Mangampeta barite mining area in Kadapa District, Andhra Pradesh, were studied. A non-mineralized Tirupati area in Chittoor District, Andhra Pradesh, was selected for the purpose of comparison. In these areas, certain animal products of selected grazing animals were studied if they could be used as tools in mineral exploration. Samples of dung, urine, and milk from cow, bullock, she-buffalo, he-buffalo, sheep, and goat were collected from these two areas during winter and summer seasons. Goat dung was found to have lowest moisture content and highest organic matter while goat urine contained highest amounts of organic matter and ash content. All these animal products were analyzed for 11 trace elements. The concentration of trace elements released through dung, urine, and milk widely varied in different animal species with seasonal variations. The elemental concentration was higher in dung and lower in urine, when compared to that of milk. The concentration of all elements in dung, urine, and milk of all animals, in both the areas, was higher in winter than that in summer. Dung represents the metabolic process of the whole animal and reflects the dietary conditions whether fed on natural or inorganic supplement. It can be inferred that dung, urine, and milk of any animal can be used as tools in mineral exploration during winter, while during summer, only dung can be useful. The dung of goat when compared to that of the other cattle serves as a better tool in environmental studies as goat depends almost entirely on natural vegetation without human interference.

AB  - In the last decades, the sharp increase of human activities on sandy beaches has introduced several detrimental impacts on these ecosystems, highlighting the importance of developing environmental quality assessments and sustainable management and protection plans for these environments. The study of key species at the population level represents an adequate and important approach to the ecosystem's ecological quality if the impacts of environmental disturbances, namely derived from human activities, are to be assessed. Talitrid and Tylid crustaceans often form abundant populations in temperate exposed sandy beaches, and might represent the bulk of the macrofaunal communities. In the present case study, the comparison of distinct Talitrid and Tylid populations on Atlantic (Portugal) and Mediterranean (Italy and Tunisia) beaches allowed to assess the adaptation of these animals on local and macro scale scenarios and evaluate the importance of bioecological studies as auxiliary tools in environmental monitoring and in the ecological quality assessment of sandy beaches. The results revealed that Talitrid and Tylid populations have a strong plasticity over geographic gradients and to local environments, presenting a high degree of variation on population ecology, namely latitudinal dines on several life history traits. Also, since the studies were performed on sandy beaches with similar degrees of exposure to wave action and low degrees of human disturbance, the present work may play a relevant role as reference knowledge in environmental monitoring studies and as an ecological quality assessment tool that might be used to evaluate the impacts of environmental disturbances on sandy beach ecosystems, namely from human origin.

AB  - P>1. The effects of acidification on ecological status of rivers in Northern Europe must be assessed according to the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). Several acidification metrics based on macroinvertebrates already exist in different countries, and the WFD requires that they be comparable across northern Europe. Thus, we compiled macroinvertebrate monitoring data from the U.K. (n = 191 samples), Norway (n = 740) and Sweden (n = 531) for analysis against pH.
   2. We tested new and existing acidification metrics developed nationally and used within the Northern Geographical Intercalibration Group. The new metrics were based on the acidification sensitivity of selected species and are proposed as a first step towards a new common indicator for acidification for Northern Europe.
   3. Metrics were assessed according to responsiveness to mean pH, degree of nonlinearity in response and consistency in responses across countries. We used flexible, nonparametric regression models to explore various properties of the pressure-response relationships. Metrics were also analysed with humic content (total organic carbon above/below 5 mg L-1) as a covariate.
   4. Most metrics responded clearly to pH, with the following metrics explaining most of the variance: Acid Water Indicator Community, Number of ephemeropteran families, Medin's index, Multimetric Indicator of Stream Acidification and the new metric 'Proportion of sensitive Ephemeroptera'.
   5. Most metrics were significantly higher in humic than in clear-water rivers, suggesting smaller acidification effects in humic rivers. This result supports the proposed use of humic level as a typological factor in the assessment of acidification.
   6. Some potentially important effects could not be considered in this study, such as the additional effects of metals, episodic acidification and the contrasting effects of natural versus anthropogenic acidity. We advocate further data collection and testing of metrics to incorporate these factors.

AB  - Forests provide a wide range of ecosystem services, and ecosystem models can be applied to assess the contribution of different forest management strategies to climate mitigation and adaptation. Complex model output and trade-offs between environmental, economic, and social sustainability dimensions are difficult to convey. To facilitate stakeholder communication, we developed composite indicators based on ten ecosystem service indicators obtained from ecosystem model simulations representing 19 forestry management strategies across three ecoregions and climate scenario projections in Sweden. Eight alternative composites were generated around a central framework addressing sustainability aspects in terms of wood production, preservation of biodiversity, climate change mitigation and adaptation (risk management). A combination of principal component analysis, exploratory factor analysis, Cronbach's coefficient alpha, and hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to account for the statistical relationships between indicators. Z-score normalization was superior to min-max normalization in capturing differences among management strategies. Two weighting schemes were applied, based on policy prioritization between sub-components that reflected 1) current policy with an equal emphasis on production and biodiversity, and 2) a stronger focus on nature protection. Equal emphasis generated a larger range of scores (76.0 +/- 21.2) than the focus on nature protection (32.0 +/- 5.8), as the latter would provide less production benefits and thereby fewer trade-offs between production and other aspects. The final scores of the 19 management strategies fell within a variance boundary of each other, showing their contribution to different policy targets and the usefulness of combining strategies at the landscape level. The composites displayed agreement across regions and scenarios. They indicated that a shift from even-aged conifer monocultures towards a combination of continuous cover, broadleaf-mixture, and unmanaged would work well for balancing goals under changing climate conditions.

AB  - Salt marsh ecosystems are extremely impacted by human activities whilst also acting as sinks of contaminants such as heavy metals. Halophytic plant species can survive and thrive in estuarine and coastal areas with higher salt conditions that are generally not favourable to most plants. Halophyte distribution and abundance clearly relate to anthropogenic pressure levels and thus the impact of heavy metals needs to be rapidly assessed and monitored in a fast-developing world. To assess and manage this impact the search for suitable and efficient biomarkers is of great importance, aiming to produce a clear picture of environmental quality. The present work aimed to evaluate the application of optical tools, like non-invasive chlorophyll a pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry, in four halophytic species (Halimione portulacoides, Sarcocornia fruticosa, Spartina maritima and Spartina patens), from three salt marshes of the Tagus estuary with different degrees of contamination, to investigate biomarkers for inclusion in a Multivariate Photochemical Pressure Index (Multi-PPI) destined for ecological quality assessment. The application of this index allowed to distinguish between less (Alcochete) and more (Rosario and Seixal) heavy metal contaminated salt marshes. This was observed particularly for S. maritima, in which Multi-PPI was lower for the higher contaminated sites, albeit this pattern was similarly observed in S. patens and S. fruticosa. On the other hand, the Multi-PPI index for H. portulacoides, a phytoextractor species, increased with the contamination gradient along the three salt marshes, and therefore this strategy should be considered when applying this index. Therefore, since these species are well represented in the Mediterranean, the use of optical tools to generate an easy fast index will have a great impact on the future of transitional ecosystem pollution impact assessments as well as in ecotoxicology research.

AB  - Economic analyses incorporating ecological and hydrological benefits are useful in guiding and justifying large and complex environmental restoration programs. The Greater Everglades region in Florida, USA is a large area of freshwater and estuarine wetlands adjacent to dense human populations undergoing an extensive restoration effort. Six Everglades restoration scenarios were modeled involving combinations of decompartmentalization (removal of canals and levees), extent of seepage control, and volume of water storage (296-3084 mil-lion m(3))-all core components of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. Under these scenarios, we simulated changes in ecological indicators across the Everglades, including Everglade snail kites and apple snails, wading birds, American alligators, and spotted seatrout. We also evaluated reductions of harmful discharges from Lake Okeechobee to the St. Lucie and Caloosahatchee estuaries in each scenario. Results were structured as options in a willingness-to-pay survey to aid in quantifying the benefits of restoration. Overall, we found Everglades restoration would increase ecosystem service benefits by $1.18 billion to $1.53 billion annually. A moderate amount of water storage improved ecosystem service benefits for Everglade snail kites and apple snails, American alligators, and wading birds, but additional storage led to equal or reduced benefits. For discharge reduction and spotted seatrout, ecosystem service benefits increased in proportion to the volume of water storage. Moderate water storage (1850 million m(3)) led to the greatest total ecosystem service benefits for the entire region, while the highest water storage volume led to the greatest benefits for specific Everglades regions like Florida Bay, St. Lucie, and Caloosahatchee estuaries. These results demonstrate the importance of economic valuation in estimating the potential ecosystem service benefits from large-scale environmental restoration and as a decision-support tool for prioritizing projects.

AB  - Pigments in lake surface sediments integrate both benthic and pelagic primary producer composition at the whole-lake ecosystem level. We gathered a comprehensive set of water chemistry, morphometric, physical and biological lake variables, catchment and climate characteristics, and geographical descriptors. We used multiple regressions to relate whole-lake algal pigment concentration to environmental conditions and multivariate statistical analyses to assess the factors most associated with photoautotrophic algal and bacterial community composition. The relative influence of environmental factors and spatial distribution was assessed by variance partitioning analysis among three groups of variables: (1) in-lake factors, (2) external factors, and (3) geographic descriptors. Pigment concentration and community composition were most sensitive to in-lake factors. Pigment-inferred abundance of algae, including cyanobacteria, tended to be highest in shallower systems with high nutrient concentrations, independent of the latitudinal temperature or irradiance gradients. Pigment-inferred community composition was best explained by nutrients and biotic composition (zooplankton and fish communities). Only in maritime temperate lakes did a link with regional location occur due to their low dissolved inorganic nitrogen to soluble reactive phosphorus ratios (1.5 atomic ratio), suggesting nitrogen limitation of phytoplankton growth; accordingly, the sediment pigments revealed cyanobacteria to be the dominant group, although this may also be a consequence of the overall high nutrient levels in these lakes. Despite the large climate gradient covered, in-lake rather than external factors were associated with the patterns observed in pigment concentration (from benthic and pelagic microorganisms) and inferred composition and abundance in these shallow lakes. Our results suggest that pigment assemblages in sediments, which integrate both benthic and pelagic microbial photoautotrophic community and processes, are valuable indicators of changes in shallow (0.75-12 m depth) lake ecosystems.

AB  - Climate change is impacting environmental conditions, especially with respect to temperature and ice cover in high latitude regions. Predictive models and risk assessment are key tools for understanding potential changes associated with such impacts on coastal regions. In this study relative ecological risk assessment was done for future potential introductions of three species in the Canadian Arctic: periwinkle Littorina littorea, soft shell clam Mya arenaria and red king crab Paralithodes camtschaticus. These species occur in locations connected to Canadian Arctic ports through shipping and have the potential to be introduced via ballast water discharge. The methodology proposed in this study is unique in the sense that it considers not only ballast water origin, but also the distribution of the species being assessed and the sensitivity of the receiving habitat. It combines detailed information (ballast water source of each tank, transit time, time of the year when the water is released, environmental suitability of receiving habitat, impact, and habitat sensitivity) in order to assess ecological risk. Through the use of this approach it is highlighted that domestic discharge events pose a higher relative overall risk on a vessel-specific and cumulative annual bases than international discharges. The main ports of Deception Bay and Churchill were classified as being at moderate to high relative risk for L. littorea and M. arenaria, especially from domestic vessels, while relative overall risk for P. camtschaticus was low for international vessels and null for domestic vessels due to few ships transiting from its range of distribution to Canadian Arctic ports. This work can serve as an approach to help build a list of potential high risk species-a "grey" watch list-for the Canadian Arctic, and provides useful information for consideration in future decision making actions such as the identification of high risk pathways, species and ports.

AB  - <list list-type="1" id="jpe12304-list-0001"> In this work, we hypothesized that in urban areas with reduced pollution levels, local climatic conditions can be an important driver of lichen diversity. Thus, lichen functional groups could be used to study the effects of the urban heat island, characterized by higher temperature and lower humidity in urban than in peri-urban areas. To test this hypothesis, we sampled functional groups of epiphytic lichens in 48 forest remnants of a Mediterranean urban area (Almada, Portugal). Of all tested functional groups (including those most closely associated with air pollution), groups related to water requirements showed the most significant correlations with surrounding artificial areas, roads and forest. These results suggest that the current major driver of lichen diversity is the climate within the urban area rather than air pollution, as frequently assumed. The analysis of local climate using meteorological data of temperature and humidity confirmed the existence of urban heat island in the study area.Synthesis and applications. The analysis of lichen functional groups gave an integrated response to the climatic modifications occurring in urban areas, namely to the urban heat island, suggesting that lichens can be used as a tool to evaluate the impact of urban areas on local climate and the effectiveness of mitigation and adaptation strategies if pollution levels are low.

AB  - Findings from nitrogen (N) manipulation studies have provided strong evidence of the detrimental impacts of elevated N deposition on the structure and functioning of heathland ecosystems. Few studies, however, have sought to establish whether experimentally observed responses are also apparent under natural, field conditions. This paper presents the findings of a nationwide field-scale evaluation of British heathlands, across broad geographical, climatic and pollution gradients. Fifty two heathlands were selected across an N deposition gradient of 5.9 to 32.4 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). The diversity and abundance of higher and lower plants and a suite of biogeochemical measures were evaluated in relation to climate and N deposition indices. Plant species richness declined with increasing temperature and N deposition, and the abundance of nitrophilous species increased with increasing N. Relationships were broadly similar between upland and lowland sites, with the biggest reductions in species number associated with increasing N inputs at the low end of the deposition range. Both oxidised and reduced forms of N were associated with species declines, although reduced N appears to be a stronger driver of species loss at the functional group level. Plant and soil biochemical indices were related to temperature, rainfall and N deposition. Litter C: N ratios and enzyme (phenol-oxidase and phosphomonoesterase) activities had the strongest relationships with site N inputs and appear to represent reliable field indicators of N deposition. This study provides strong, field-scale evidence of links between N deposition - in both oxidised and reduced forms - and widespread changes in the composition, diversity and functioning of British heathlands. The similarity of relationships between upland and lowland environments, across broad spatial and climatic gradients, highlights the ubiquity of relationships with N, and suggests that N deposition is contributing to biodiversity loss and changes in ecosystem functioning across European heathlands.

AB  - In temperate forest ecosystems, management is one of the most relevant factors that can drive the temporal pattern of species. As species in an ecosystem show susceptibility to stress and disturbance, it is useful to take into account the plant community "compositional dimension", which derives from species behaviour and ecological attributes and provides information on the mechanisms underlying species assemblages. Taking into account the influence of environmental factors on species diversity and composition, in order to determine the most suitable ecological behaviour type of each species, the research aim was to generate a model for Ostrya carpinifolia coppiced woods (central Italy) that describes forest ecosystem regeneration after coppicing by the assessment of change in the composition of ecological behaviour types.
   Vascular species cover percentage, field data, soil data, light intensity at the undergrowth, dominant tree layer cover and time since last logging were recorded for 63 plots covering 400 m(2) each (20 x 20 m), randomly selected within a set of homogeneous macro-environmental conditions. Low species richness is related to stressing factors (acid soil, high soil skeleton percentage), while high species richness is linked to high light intensity at the undergrowth level due to scarce canopy cover soon after coppicing. The driving forces affecting floristic composition, highlighted through multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP) were light intensity at the undergrowth, regenerative phase, dominant tree layer cover, acidity, presence/absence of outcropping rock or rock fragments and total nitrogen content. Six species groups, each one characterized by homogeneous ecological behaviour, were defined by indicator species analysis (ISA) and tested using bioindication values analysis. Floristic successional change, related to time since last coppicing, turned out to follow an ecological cycling process characterized by cyclical occurrence/disappearance of species belonging to the six groups.

AB  - Three adjacent areas in the Urdaibai Estuary (NW Spain) comprising a reclaimed salt marsh, a natural salt marsh and a regenerated salt marsh were sampled in order to study edaphic processes and changes in organic matter (OM) composition related to reclamation and regeneration of soils and sediments in estuarine environments. For this, a general analytical description of the soil and sediment profiles was carried out and the OM was characterized using solid state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and analytical pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). The reclaimed salt marsh displayed very different characteristics from the natural salt marsh throughout the whole profile, indicating an important degree of change in soil quality and, particularly, in OM composition caused by the reclamation. At this reclaimed site, characterized by oxic conditions and a lack of tidal influence, transformation of the former salt marsh to grassland resulted in input of OM richer in carbohydrates and with a lower contribution of aromatic compounds than the OM in the salt marsh soils. On the other hand, the edaphic characteristics of the regenerated marsh were similar to those of the natural marsh and the vegetation cover was the same. However, the natural marsh accumulated twice the amount of organic carbon at the surface as the regenerated marsh. Furthermore, the natural marsh contained more aromatic material, as detected with NMR and the Py-GC/MS results indicated a greater presence of microbial material. These differences indicate that the regenerated marsh has not completely recovered its natural characteristics, despite the long period (more than 40 y) since the beginning of the regeneration process. We propose the composition of soil OM as a suitable long term indicator of reclamation and regeneration processes in the salt marsh environments. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - While phenological shifts and migration of isolated species under climate change have already been observed on alpine summits, very few studies have focused on community composition changes in subalpine grasslands. Here we use permanent plots monitored since 1954 and precisely located phytosociological censuses from 1970 to study compositional changes of subalpine grasslands in two distinct regions of the Swiss Northern Alps. In both areas, warming trends during the monitoring period were associated with changes in land management (abandonment of goat and sheep pasturing or grazing replaced by mowing). Old and recent inventories were compared with correspondence analyses (CA). Ecological indicator values, community-affinities and biological traits of the species were used to infer the factors responsible for triggering the observed changes. In both regions, subalpine grasslands were stable with smaller changes than have previously been observed in alpine environments. Only a few species appeared or disappeared and changes were generally limited to increasing or decreasing frequency and cover of certain taxa. At one site, grazing abandonment favored fallow species. Some of these species were located at their upper altitudinal distribution limits and may have spread because of rising temperatures. In both areas, declining species were predominantly alpine and low-growing species; their decline was probably due to increased competition (e.g., shadow) with more vigorous subalpine taxa no longer limited by grazing. We conclude that vegetation communities can respond rapidly to warming as long as colonization is facilitated by available space or structural change. In the subalpine grasslands studies, changes were mainly driven by land management. These communities have a dense vegetation cover and newly arriving herbaceous species preferring warmer conditions may take some time to establish themselves. However, climate disturbances, such as exceptional drought, may accelerate community changes by opening gaps for new species.

AB  - Introduction: Enough scientific evidence is available on the harmful effects of air pollution on the health of human beings, fauna, flora, and ecosystems in general. The mechanical and electronical monitoring networks are the first option for the air quality diagnosis, but they do not allow a direct and precise assessment of the impacts in living organisms that may result from the exposure to air pollutants.
   Objective: To evaluate the changes in the composition of corticulous lichen communities as a response to various stress factors in areas with different levels of air quality to diagnose the state of pollution or intervention in an area with a more complete option.
   Methods: Air quality contrasts and changes in richness and coverage of corticulous lichens in response to different stress factors, such as land use and distance to roads, in three different biomonitoring areas, were evaluate using GIS, and the data are presented in an easy-to-understand grey scale coded isoline map.
   Results: Indicators such as lichen coverage (R- -0.4) and richness (R- -0.7) are inverse correlated with PM2.5 concentrations in each area. A total of 110 lichen species were identified, being Phaeophyscia chloantha (1ch.) Moberg and Physcia poncinsii Hue the most frequent species (present in 38 and 33% of the 86 sampled phorophytes, respectively). The intra-area relationships of lichen richness exhibit significant relationships with regards to the land use and distance to roads (with correlations coefficients greater than 0.5) and the Simpson index was higher than 0.9, in places with better conditions in terms of air quality and microenvironments, likewise the resistance factors calculated suggest that the most sensitive species can be found in environments with a lesser degree of disturbance.
   Conclusion: These evaluations represent more criteria elements for the diagnosis of the environmental health in the biomonitoring areas.

AB  - The water-energy-ecosystem nexus represents a complex interlinkage that depends on the flow regime type. Inadequate environmental flows setting may adversely affect the riverine ecosystem and/or hydropower revenue. This issue was addressed quantitatively in this study by considering a run-of-river hydropower plant located in a river of the Tagus basin characterised by a pluvial winter flow regime. Three models: a hydropower, a hydrologic, and an ecohydraulic model were integrated to estimate the influence of nine hydrologically-based environmental flow methods on hydropower production, flow regime alteration and fish habitat conditions. The target fish species was a native cyprinid fish, the Iberian barbel (Luciobarbus bocagei), considering three life-stages. Results show that high environmental flow releases did not necessarily provide the highest habitat availability and suitability at all seasons and fish life-stages. The adult life-stage resulted in being more vulnerable to water diversion, particularly during Spring season. Shallow-water hydromorphological units suffered the highest habitat loss. Some of the environmental flow methods demonstrated inconsistent results over seasons and fish life-stages by either allowing for higher environmental flow releases whereas highly restricting hydropower production or vice versa. However, results also suggest that combined and dynamic environmental flow methods promoted reasonable hydropower production while inducing less than 50% habitat loss and flow regime alteration, regarding the three life-stages over all seasons. This study contributes to the identification of the relationship between conflicting objectives, such as hydropower production and riverine ecosystem conservation. Also, it provides strategic recommendations on energy-ecosystem regulation for sustainable hydropower operation. This study also highlights the importance of considering seasonal flow discharge variability when analysing the water-energy-ecosystem nexus.

AB  - The study aimed at contributing to the development of methods to assessing the effects of human disturbance on coralligenous reefs. The effects of the presence of a fish farm on coralligenous reefs were evaluated using the STAR (STAndaRdized coralligenous evaluation procedure) sampling procedure. An asymmetrical sampling design was used to compare the aquaculture site with two reference sites in areas unaffected by human pressure. The response of different ecological indices (ESCA, Ecological Status of Coralligenous Assemblages; ISLA, Integrated Sensitivity Level of coralligenous Assemblages; COARSE, COralligenous Assessment by Reef Scape Estimate) and descriptors (alpha-diversity, beta-diversity and Sensitivity Level) of this kind of disturbance was compared. Results indicate that coralligenous reefs are vulnerable to aquaculture fish cages, and differences in the structure of coralligenous assemblages between the disturbed and the reference sites were mostly due to the decrease in beta-diversity. On the contrary, no significant differences in the number of taxa/groups were highlighted. Encrusting Corallinales, erect Rhodophyta, Dictyotales, Fucales and Halimeda tuna were more abundant in reference sites than in disturbed site, while Peyssonnelia spp. and algal turfs had the opposite trend. Conversely, no significant differences between conditions were found in the abundance of sessile invertebrates. The study supports the suitability of the STAR approach to be employed in impact evaluation assessments, such as in monitoring programs. The present study is a first attempt to combine three different ecological indices (ESCA, ISLA and COARSE) within a unified approach, in order to assess the status of coralligenous reefs subjected to a moderate human-induced disturbance. The inconsistent response of the different indices highlights the advantage of applying different indices and descriptors to evaluate the variable human pressures on natural systems.

AB  - Climate change poses a key threat to marine ecosystems and fisheries resources as well as to communities that depend on these systems for food and livelihoods. This paper reports on a community-based rapid vulnerability assessment (RVA) methodology developed and applied in eight small-scale fishing communities in the Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem region. This participatory methodology was designed to be applied in a workshop setting and draws on the observations, perceptions and local knowledge of fishers in order to better understand the extent to which their livelihoods are susceptible to various socio-ecological changes and their ability to respond to these changes. The paper highlights selected key findings and aims to demonstrate the type of information that can be elicited from an RVA. Although there were differences between the three countries involved in the study, findings suggest that key stressors are mainly associated with socio-economic and governance issues. Climate-related changes were seen to exacerbate existing vulnerabilities. Despite differences in spatial and temporal scales of data provided by scientists and fishers, changes in environmental conditions that could be attributed to climate change observed by fishers resonated with available science. Fishers identified a number of adaptation strategies that could address vulnerabilities and enhance resilience but require support from government and other stakeholders. Strengthening local organizations, rebuilding fisheries through local co-management plans, securing access rights, involving fishers in data collection and analysis, developing complementary livelihoods and addressing the broad socio-economic rights of communities were identified as necessary to address vulnerabilities. Participation in these community-level vulnerability assessments enhances understanding, builds capacity, generates knowledge for management, and allows communities to identify locally appropriate adaptation strategies.

AB  - Questions: Does the vegetation composition of the forests of Nandiar Valley correlate with climatic, topographic and edaphic variables? Is it possible to identify plant communities through indicator species in relation to environmental gradients? Can this approach of classification and ordination will be helpful for conservation planning?
   Location Forests of Nandiar Valley, Moist temperate Western Himalayas Pakistan.
   Methods: Eighty stands were selected for quantitative and qualitative characteristic of vegetation between an elevations of 525-3817 m. Species composition was recorded by using 400 m long transects. GPS, climatic, edaphic and topographic data were recorded for each sampling site. The relationship between habitat types, species composition and distribution along with climatic, edaphic and topographic variables were analyzed using TWINSPAN, Cluster analysis and DCA ordination.
   Results: Sum 325 vascular plants species belonging to 97 families were recorded. Diversity index and species richness was maximum in the moist temperate zone. Classification and ordination showed that the variance in species data was 7.07. Two-ways indicator species analysis classified the vegetation into eight plant communities. Indicator species analysis revealed that slope aspect, wind speed, temperature, dew point, wet bulb, pH, organic matter and phosphorous were the strongest parameters (p <= 0.05) determining plant community composition and indicator species in each habitat. The results also show the strength of the environment species relationship using Monte Carlo procedures. DCA ordination grouped different species having similar habitat and habitats having common species.
   Conclusions: The multivariate analysis of the vegetation along with environmental variables of Nandiar valley confirmed the indicators of each sort of vegetation communities/microclimatic zones which could further be used in conservation planning and management not only in studied area but also in the adjacent regions as well as in the areas exhibit similar sort of climatic, edaphic and topographic conditions.

AB  - Marine legislation world-wide has, as a recent final objective, the maintenance of a good environmental or ecological status for marine waters, habitats and resources. The concept of environmental status takes into account the structure, function and processes of marine ecosystems, bringing together physical, chemical, physiographic, geographic and climatic factors: subsequently, integrating such conditions, with anthropogenic impacts and activities undertaken in the area concerned. Such an approach is intended to permit an assessment of the environmental status at the ecosystem level, i.e. ecosystem-based approach', or 'ecosystem-based management'.
   Such legislation emphasises the need for the development of methodologies, to assess environmental status. As such the knowledge acquired within Regional Seas, discussed at International Symposia and, finally, published as Special Issues, can serve as the basis for a regional ecosystem-based approach to management and the integrative assessment of marine systems. Hence, the Bay of Biscay is used in this contribution, as an example, to show past and present research, together with perspectives for the future. It is concluded that collaboration between institutions (marine research institutes, universities) and countries (France, Spain, Portugal, the United Kingdom and Ireland) could result in an interesting 'case-study', for the further implementation of the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive, at the level of this particular Regional Sea. In this way, the experience gained in the implementation of the Water Framework Directive within the ecoregion, together with the information collated in the eleven International Symposia of Oceanography of the Bay of Biscay, celebrated until now, can be very useful, for an ecosystem-based management approach for this Regional Sea.

AB  - This paper reviews the use of seabirds in fisheries management around the world, and provides a comprehensive overview of the many factors that should be considered in order to identify the most appropriate species and parameters. There are a growing number of examples where seabird monitoring programs are providing valuable information on the health of particular fish stocks, the health of the ecosystem, and on the effects of climatic change. Despite this, their suitability and usefulness as ecological performance indicators is still being developed in many marine systems. This is due largely to the many challenges involved in identifying the direct links between changes in prey composition and availability and measurable components of seabird ecology. A species ability to respond and cope with changing environmental conditions differs due to the combined influence of their time/energy budget, dietary preferences, and specific life-history traits. These factors should be considered in order to identify the most suitable species to monitor, given their level of sensitivity or resilience to a given level of change. The most useful ranges of adult, chick, breeding or population parameters are outlined, and examples are provided of their application to fisheries management as environmental, ecological and fisheries-based indicators. The value of seabird data in investigating the mechanisms underlying the population dynamics of prey species is also discussed, and areas of future research suggested. By integrating information on this topic this review will assist future studies in identifying the most appropriate species and suite of parameters that are most appropriate to monitor, in order to detect potential environmental and fisheries related impacts. This review also outlines many of the uncertainties that must be considered before they are applied as ecological performance indicators and management tools. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Natural Range of Variability is a concept used under the ecosystem management paradigm that means understanding the disturbance-driven spatial and temporal variability of the ecological systems and mimicking them in management strategies. With this project, we developed a framework that permitted addressing biodiversity issues under the lens of the Natural Range of Variability (NRV) for a managed public forest in central-west Alberta. To do so, we brought together a spatial harvest scheduler, a fire and succession landscape simulator, and a toolbox of biodiversity indicator models. Indicator models, that encompass landscape configuration, ecosystem diversity, stand internal habitat features and species-specific habitat supply models, were applied on the outputs of the landscape dynamics simulator to define the NRV. The risk of losing biodiversity values in applying the forest management strategy was addressed by comparing indicators outputs over the simulation horizon with their respective NRV. Results demonstrate that no forest-age-related indicator evaluated on the harvest scheduler output shows an important deviation from the NRV. However, in regards to forest cover types there is obviously a loss in ecosystem diversity, as a direct effect of the stand composition control of the silvicultural strategies. We found that patch size distribution is generally compliant with the NRV, although we observed more large patches and better connectivity for old growth patches under fire-driven landscapes. We also found that downed woody debris volume and many understory vegetation (ground lichen, herb and shrub) covers were at risk. Over the seventeen wildlife species, we detected nine species that could be jeopardized by important loss of habitats. Back-tracking bottleneck forest conditions that put these biodiversity values at risk has allowed development of recommendations with regards to landscape design and adapted practices.

AB  - A revised Holocene sea-level curve for the southeast coast of New South Wales, Australia, is presented based on a review of previously published geochronological results for fossil molluscs, organic-rich mud, mangrove roots and fixed biological indicators. It is supplemented by new radiocarbon and amino acid racemization-derived ages on fossil molluscs from transgressive sandsheet facies in back-barrier settings within shallow incised valleys along the southern coast of New South Wales. This data base has been limited to fossils with accurate descriptions of their facies associations and stratigraphic relationships to present mean sea level. Results show that sea level during the Holocene marine transgression rose to between -15 and -11 m at 9400-9000 cal. yr BP. Sea level then rose to approximately -5 m by 8500 cal. yr BP and to approximately -3.5 m between 8300 and 8000 cal. yr BP inundating shallow incised valleys resulting in the deposition of shell-rich transgressive sandsheets within shallow incised bedrock valleys. Present sea level was attained between 7900 and 7700 cal. yr BP, approximately 700 - 900 years earlier than previously proposed. Sea level continued to rise to between +1 and +1.5 m between 7700 and 7400 cal. yr BP, followed by a sea-level highstand that lasted until about 2000 cal. yr BP followed by a gradual fall to present. A series of minor negative and positive oscillations in relative sea level during the late-Holocene sea-level highstand appear to be superimposed over the general sea-level trend. However, the precise nature of the oscillations are difficult to quantify because of problems associated with accurately determining palaeotidal and wave regimes, climatic conditions and the antecedent morphology of the shallow marine environments during the mid Holocene.

AB  - This paper reports new multi-proxy palaeoenvironmental data on the late Glacial-Holocene transition (c. 14.8-9.3 ka) in equatorial East Africa, in the form of microfossil assemblages (chironomids, diatoms and ostracods) recovered from the sediment record of Lake Emakat, Empakaai Crater, northern Tanzania. In the context of available palaeoclimatic and palaeoecological information from the region and previously published fossil pollen and carbon and nitrogen isotopic data for the same sediment sequence, we here reconstruct local lake-system response to regional climatic and hydrological instability during the period of post-glacial warming. The aquatic biological proxy indicators suggest that the water level and chemistry of Lake Emakat evolved, first from a shallow freshwater body at 14.8 ka to a deeper freshwater phase between c. 14.4 and 10.3 ka and then to a markedly shallower, alkaline-saline environment after c. 10.3 ka. The lake appears to have been deepest between 13.2 and 12.0 ka, at a time of climatic drying when moist montane forest vegetation within the lake's crater catchment was being replaced by open wood-and scrubland. Some palaeohydrological changes reconstructed for Lake Emakat are in phase with lake evolution elsewhere in the region and thus apparently track broad-scale climate changes, but some are not. Collectively these multi-proxy paleolimnological data indicate a complex adjustment of the local aquatic ecosystem to temporal variations both in total annual effective precipitation and its seasonal distribution. The lake's hydrological response was further conditioned by local factors, notably its geological and topographic setting. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Teleosts are exposed, in the environment, to a number of chemicals that are capable of inducing hepatic cytochrome P450 monooxygenase activity. This induction has been described as a most sensitive biological indicator of the presence of certain classes of chemicals in water. The concept of a bioindicator, as applied here, is derived from the idea that a toxic effect will be manifested at the subcellular level before effects will be apparent at higher levels of biological organization. Laboratory and environmental induction of hepatic cytochrome P450 CYP1A1 (P450IA1) was investigated using catalytic activity, immunodetection and nucleic acid hybridization. Rainbow trout and largemouth bass were exposed, underflow-through conditions, to beta-naphthoflavone (beta-NF), a known CYP1A1 inducer, at concentrations ranging from 0-625 to 500 mug beta-NF/liter for periods of 1 to 21 days. At concentrations of 50-500 mug beta-NF/liter, ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity and immunoreactive CYP1A1 levels were induced, but the induction was inversely related to the beta-NF concentration. At these same concentrations, hybridizable CYP1A1 mRNA was increased at all concentrations over time and was induced at least up to 7 days of beta-NF treatment. At concentrations of 0.625-10.0 mug beta-NF/liter, EROD activity, immunoreactive protein and hybridizable mRNA were increased in a concentration-dependent manner. Environmental exposure of largemouth bass, placed in cages in water known to be contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls, had elevated (six-fold) EROD activity at 3 and 7 days. Killifish taken from a TCDD-contaminated site had three-fold higher EROD activity and CYP1A1 mRNA, as well as increased immunoreactive protein, than killifish from a 'clean' site. These data indicate the efficacy of using nucleic acid hybridization of CYP1A1 mRNA as a bioindicator of environmental contamination.

AB  - Empirical studies of risk-induced overgrazing have been rarely reported in northern China grasslands, thus, the risk indicators that act as proximate drivers of herders stocking rate (SR) are poorly understood. This paper investigates the impact of the Chinese Grassland Eco-compensation Reward and Subsidy Policy implementation (2011-2015) in Inner Mongolia on overgrazing as a consequence of SR. We used a linear mixed-effects model to develop the relationship between SR and designated risk indicators. The best-fit models obtained were used to evaluate the role of each indicator on the tendency of herdsmen to overgraze grasslands. The major drivers of SR identified prior to the policy implementation are the area of grassland owned, living expenses, and the area of grassland rent-out. Subsequent to the policy implementation, the area of grassland owned and the area of grassland rent-in emerged as the principal factors that induce herders to use high SR on grassland, indicating the persistence of overgrazing. Our most promising finding was that the policy eliminated living expenses from the factors that compel herdsmen to use high SR on grassland. This represents a significant positive impact on herders' welfare, which is one of the objectives of the subsidy and reward policy. Therefore, to sustain the success recorded in the first phase of the policy implementation, we advocate for an improved grassland rental market that will encourage livelihood diversification, better funding, herdsmen cooperation, consideration of local ecological condition and herders' perspective in policy design, and consistent education of herders' about the merits of reducing SR on grasslands. To achieve the desired target of reducing overgrazing, we recommend an independent process of policy inspection that will strengthen effective bottom-up feedback and village level governance.

AB  - The main terrestrial ecosystems dominated by lichens and mosses, which represent important ecological indicators of climatic changes in high polar latitudes, are found in the Antarctic continent. However, little is known about how environmental filtering shapes cryptogamic communities' assemblages at fine-scale. In this study, we analysed changes in non-vascular species richness, species composition and plant coverage along a pedoenvironmental gradient in Maritime Antarctica. We hypothesized that pedoenvironmental filters (i.e. soil texture and chemistry properties) drive the non-vascular assembly community. We classified soils according to the World Reference Base for Soil Resources, selecting ten different pedoenvironments at fine-scale. The plant inventory data from 206 plots across these pedoenvironments was used to evaluate the main effect of plant coverage, soil texture and soil chemistry on non-vascular species richness and composition. The ecological value of the species was determined and the type of community it occurred in was characterized, then the associations of the species were classified in each pedoenvironment. Differences in species richness, species composition and plant coverage were detected along the pedoenvironmental gradient. However, plant coverage, soil chemistry, soil texture and soil variables did not affect species richness and species composition, with the exception of clay content that was particularly an important predictor of species composition. High pedoenvironmental filtering apparently has no effect on species richness but determined differences in species composition. Therefore, we assumed that pedoenvironmental filtering determined high beta diversity in this island from maritime Antarctica. This study reveals that fine scale heterogeneity contributes to specific species associations along a pedoenvironmental gradient; thus, pedoenvironmental filtering not only determines diversity pattern in non-vascular plants, but also type of communities.

AB  - In recent years, species distribution models have been used to gain a better understanding of past and future range dynamics of species. Here, we focus on a keystone species of the North African forest ecosystem (Cedrus atlantica) by calculating a consensus model of the species current geographic potential distribution in North Africa, based on a weighted average method aiming to decrease uncertainty. The consensus model is obtained using seven species distribution model algorithms taking into account 24 environmental variables. The model is then applied to several past and future time slices. Past projections refer to the Middle-Holocene and the Last Glacial Maximum, whereas those of future are related to expect conditions around 2050 and 2070. We found that the current potential distribution of Cedrus atlantica is larger than its actual geographical distribution. For some explanatory variables, the analysis revealed their importance for the species current distribution. Among all obtained models, that for the Middle-Holocene showed the maximum expansion of the species potential distribution. The Last Glacial Maximum model provided new putative glacial refugia of Cedrus atlantica, not shown by other mechanistic models and palaeorecord localities. Future projections revealed a significant and fast contraction with shifting in altitude of the species range, showing more fragmented areas and even species disappearance in many North African localities. These findings can help to restore cedar forests and conserve them by ex situ strategies according to the future defined refugia in North Africa. Attention should be paid to the resolution of related output maps, the current biotic interactions, and those that may arise under climate change.

AB  - Can dust and tarry substances that are rich in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are deposited on leaves, cause changes in the water retention of tree crowns? It is hypothesized that the contact angle between droplets and a leaf's surface and water capacity changes because of the content of PAHs. This angle is treated as a bioindicator of environmental pollution. The goal of this study was to analyse the relationship between rainfall water capacity and wettability of small-leaved lime and poplar in different zones in a city centre during the period from April through November. We implemented a series of simulated rainfall and angle measurements under laboratory conditions of tree twigs collected at three locations inside the city centre and one from an area outside the city. The background for the water capacity values were results acquired from selected PAHs contents determined in leaves using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and images of the leaves' surface were acquired via Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Based on the obtained results, we concluded that there were significant differences in water capacity between the areas for each month. In the city centre, water capacity from April to July was lower than that in the forested area. From July to the end of the growing season, the water capacity was lower in the city compared to the forest area. The contact angle was strongly correlated with water capacity. With a decreasing contact angle, the raindrops increasingly adhered to the leaf surface, and water capacity increased.
   It was found that the effects of pollution on water capacity cannot be ignored in developing forecasts or in models describing ecosystem and hydrological changes in natural and urbanized environments.

AB  - Aldabra Atoll has the largest population of giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) in the world. As such an important biological resource, it is necessary to understand how the effects of climate change will impact this keystone species; in particular the frequency of drought, which is likely to affect tortoise habitat. To assess whether drought frequency has changed over the last 50 years on Aldabra, we calculated the standardized precipitation index (SPI) to identify drought periods using monthly rainfall data collected during 1969-2013. We found that drought frequency has increased to more than six drought months per year today compared with about two months per year in the 1970s (t = 2.884, p = 0.006). We used MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a proxy for vegetation activity, to determine how vegetation has responded to the changing drought frequency between 2000 and 2013. We found that Aldabra's vegetation is highly responsive to changes in rainfall: anomalies in long-term mean monthly NDVI across Aldabra were found to decrease below the mean during most drought periods and increase above the mean during most non-drought periods. To investigate the response of tortoise habitat to rainfall, we extracted mean NDVI anomalies for three key habitat types. Open mixed scrub and grasslands, the preferred habitat of tortoises, showed the greatest decrease in vegetation activity during drought periods, and the greatest increase in average greenness during non-drought periods. Recent analysis has shown vegetation changes on Aldabra in recent decades. If these changes are caused by decreased precipitation, then the increased frequency of drought could impact the tortoise population, in both the short and long term, by limiting the quality and quantity of forage and/or shade availability within favoured habitats, and by changing the habitat composition across the atoll.

AB  - In southern Aragua state, Venezuela-an area regarded as high priority for local and national development-important sources of income and traditions are related to a history of manufacturing wood products including furniture and woodcraft made of the native tree species Samanea saman. However, scarcity of wood has recently become a major constraint for people of Magdaleno, putting at risk traditional knowledge and employment opportunities. Based on an integrated approach taking into account biophysical, ecological, social and technological issues, a broad group of potential tree species were assessed in a landscape-scale analysis to promote a plantation project. Analysis of policy implications is made in the context of national legislation, socio-economic, institutional and environmental issues. The role of research and communication to improve decision-making processes at all scales are also examined. At least three wood species (Samanea saman, Acacia mangium and Gmelina arborea) with a total of 37 sites and an aggregate area of approximately 26,600 ha (266 km 2), were found to be potentially able to sustain a local development initiative for all five municipalities located in southern Aragua state. In terms of implementation, small-scale forestry (SSF) is viewed as a new policy shift for forest management according to the new national forest legislation where local development is a central element. SSF faces several constraints and faces a wide variety of political issues. Critical among these issues are: (a) how SSF approaches deal with legislation and land tenure regulations; (b) the creation of community-based forest enterprises based on simplified management plans, (c) a broad assessment of potential ecosystem services delivered by forest plantations; and (d) improving communication of research for decision-making. Decentralization and institutional strengthening are identified as two basic conditions for pursuing sustainable management.

AB  - A long-term study of a molluscan-trematode community in the Basingstoke Canal, UK, was undertaken over the period 1970-2003 which coincided with a significant restoration program involving substantial anthropogenic changes to the canal's ecosystem. The aim of this study was to correlate these changes with alterations in the molluscan-trematode community, focusing on fluctuations in the prevalence and species richness of the trematode population as a good indicator, in terms of biodiversity, of ecosystem health. Molluscs were sampled at four time periods (1970, 1982, 1983, 2003) and examined for trematode parasites. The molluscan population over the sampling period demonstrated a limited stability with few species being present during all time periods. During 1982 and 1983, when restoration of the sampling site was being undertaken, Lymnaea stagnalis dominated the molluscan fauna, possibly because it was best able to take advantage of the disturbed conditions, while other species such as Bithynia tentaculata were absent. In the trematode population, the prevalence and diversity of both cercarial and metacercarial infections was high in 1970 prior to the period of restoration work. However, during 1982 and 1983, the trematude community was significantly reduced with cercarial prevalence declining to less than 1%. By 2003, more than 12 years after restoration had been completed, the trematode population had shown only a modest recovery. Trematodes use a wide range of different host species for completing their life-cycles and may be used as bioindicators of ecosystem diversity and health. An interpretation of the structure of the molluscan-trematode community over the sampling period suggests that the restoration project had an initial negative effect on ecosystem health, in terms of biodiversity, but this has subsequently only shown modest signs of recovery suggesting continuing problems in ecological functioning and stability.

AB  - Adaptive management is a key component of a forest project being implemented across all of Weyerhaeuser's coastal forest tenures. This project uses two main tools to accomplish the British Columbia (BC) Coastal Group's ecological and socio-economic goals: variable retention (VR) harvesting and broad zoning of the land base. The adaptive management program was designed to examine the effectiveness of retention systems and zoning in maintaining those forest attributes necessary to sustain biological richness and essential ecosystem functions, such as nutrient transfer, energy flow, decomposition, and dispersal of seeds, spores, and animals. The program is grounded on three biological indicators evaluated in both operational and experimental contexts: 1) representation of habitat types in a relatively unmanaged state to ensure that little-known species are retained; 2) structure of stands and landscapes to ensure that key elements are present through time; and 3) indicator organisms to track whether retaining structures and patterns, while addressing representation, will maintain species and populations whose life needs are well understood. Representation of ecosystems in unmanaged conditions has been examined. Habitat structure is being assessed in VR blocks and in unmanaged blocks. Studies on several organisms (breeding birds, owls, gastropods, amphibians, bryophytes, lichen, squirrels, mycorrhizae, and carabid beetles) have been underway for various lengths of time. These studies collected baseline information to begin comparisons of the effectiveness of the various types of VR for maintaining biological richness. The current focus in the adaptive management program is refining the lists of specific elements to monitor and beginning to create tools to help extrapolate relationships and findings over large areas and long time frames, with the expectation of operational implementation in 2003. The first two years of pilot work are also being used to examine how the results will link to management practices to strengthen areas that most need improvement. This paper describes three indicators used in Weyerhaeuser's adaptive management program.

AB  - To expand the knowledge on the tempo-spatial patterns of zooplankton and the key modulated factors in urban aquatic ecosystem, we investigated zooplankton and water quality from April 2018 to January 2019 in the hinterland of the Three Gorges Reservoir area, Wanzhou City of China. The results indicated that water quality indicated by the trophic state index (TSI) reached a state of mesotrophication to light eutrophication in the Yangtze River, and a state of moderate- to hyper- eutrophication in its tributaries. Based on the biomass of zooplanktons, Asplanchna priodonta was the most common specie in April; Encentrum sp., Filinia cornuta and Epiphanes senta were the most noticeable species in summer; Cyclopoida Copepodid, Sinocalanus dorrii and Philodina erythrophthalma became the dominant species in winter. Generally, rotifers prevailed in April and August, and copepods became the most popular in January. According to canonical correspondence analysis, nitrate, temperature (T), ammonia, water level and permanganate index (CODMn) significantly influenced the community structure of zooplankton (p < 0.05). The dominant species shifts of zooplankton were partly associated with nutrient level (nitrate and ammonia) under periodic water level fluctuations. Rotifers and protozoans were characterized as high T adapted and CODMn-tolerant species comparing with cladocerans and copepods. The ratio of microzooplankton to mesozooplankton (P-micro/meso) has presented a strongly positive relationship with T (p < 0.001), as well as P-micro/meso and CODMn (p < 0.001). It implied that zooplankton tended to miniaturize individual size via species shift under high T and/or CODMn conditions induced by global warming and human activities. The information hints us that climate change and human activities are likely to produce fundamental changes in urban aquatic ecosystem by reorganizing biomass structure of the food web in future.

AB  - Hydromorphological rehabilitation is increasingly being used to reverse degradation of stream and river ecosystems. River rehabilitation projects have nevertheless been criticised for not meeting their goals or for not being monitored sufficiently well to assess whether their goals were met. There is therefore an urgent need to develop robust approaches to assessing treatment efficacy and to thus guide the increasing investment in rehabilitation. A headwater tributary of the River Welland in Leicestershire, UK was rehabilitated in summer 2014. Rehabilitation included removal of weirs and the creation of a distinct and meandered low-flow channel with pool-riffle sequences. Macroinvertebrates were collected in random sampling protocols stratified at in-stream biotope level. The rehabilitated reach was compared with a semi-natural upstream reach as a reference, and a similarly degraded reach as a control. This study demonstrated that rehabilitation of the River Welland had clear beneficial effects on ecological processes. It demonstrated that active re-creation of lost biotope heterogeneity improved macroinvertebrate biodiversity and secondary production, which is the formation of heterotrophic biomass through time. The rehabilitated reach yielded higher production estimates for Gastropoda, Bivalvia, Malacostraca, Odonata, Arachnida and Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera, and a lower estimate for Chironomidae relative to the control reach. The rehabilitated reach also had higher estimates of production for Shredder, Scraper, Filter-feeder and Predator feeding groups relative to the control reach. Rehabilitation works transformed the reach from a condition more akin to the degraded reach to being more similar to the semi-natural reach. These outcomes demonstrate recovery of the reach's entire macroinvertebrate community structure and function after rehabilitation. The results provide a clear message to river rehabilitation practitioners: rehabilitation of the function of a physically degraded river ecosystem is possible if the rehabilitation is planned to actively restore the lost in-stream biotope diversity.

AB  - One of the key principles for modeling future impacts of anthropogenic and climate changes on vegetation is to identify clear patterns and trends between plant functional traits and ecological drivers. The global spectrum of plant form and function outlines the major axes of variation and coordination among plant traits. We hypothesized that inter-specific plant trait variation at the regional scale should match axes of plant adaptation highlighted by the global spectrum, and that plant trait-environmental associations should be evident over ranges of environmental indicators corresponding to key drivers of future climate and land use changes in Southern Europe. To test our hypotheses, we analyzed a sample of 1095 plant species from Northern Italy, also characteristic of Southern European vegetation. We analyzed trends for four plant traits (canopy height, leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen content) along meso- (temperature, continentality) and micro-climatic (light) ranges, as well as along soil ranges (moisture, reaction and nutrient content), by means of Landolt's environmental indicators. At the regional scale, the inter-specific variation of mean plant traits over ranges of environmental indicators confirmed the main axes of plant adaptation emphasized by the plant global spectrum. Leaf area and specific leaf area showed the largest sensitivity over ranges of all environmental indicators, while canopy heights were the most responsive to temperature values. Temperature, light conditions and nutrients were associated with clear effects on plant traits, underlining that responses to changes in land use and increased soil nutrient loading (sudden and abrupt changes) could trigger and strengthen responses to climate alteration (gradual changes). Scenarios for the next few decades in Southern Europe indicate increased temperature, nutrient availability and forest coverage that, according to our findings, will favor more 'acquisitive and fast growing' plants, also represented by subtropical invasive species.

AB  - The effects of sediment contamination on fish are of high significance for the protection of ecosystems, human health and economy. However, standardized sediment bioassays with benthic fish species, that mimic bioavailability of potentially toxic compounds and comply with the requirements of alternative test methods, are still scarce. In order to address this issue, embryos of the benthic European weatherfish (Misgurnus fossilis) were exposed to freeze-dried sediment (via sediment contact assays (SCA)) and sediment extracts (via acute fish embryo toxicity tests) varying in contamination level. The extracts were gained by accelerated solvent extraction with (i) acetone and (ii) pressurized hot water (PHWE) and subsequently analyzed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans. Furthermore, embryos of the predominately used zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to extracts from the two most contaminated sediments. Results indicated sufficient robustness of weatherfish embryos towards varying test conditions and sensitivity towards relevant sediment-bound compounds. Furthermore, a compliance of effect concentrations derived from weatherfish embryos exposed to sediment extracts (96 h-LC50) with both measured gradient of sediment contamination and previously published results was observed. In comparison to zebrafish, weatherfish embryos showed higher sensitivity to the bioavailability-mimicking extracts from PHWE but lower sensitivity to extracts gained with acetone. SCAs conducted with weatherfish embryos revealed practical difficulties that prevented an implementation with three of four sediments tested. In summary, an application of weatherfish embryos, using bioassays with sediment extracts from PHWE might increase the ecological relevance of sediment toxicity testing: it allows investigations using benthic and temperate fish species considering both bioavailable contaminants and animal welfare concerns.

AB  - Peatlands ale a specialized type of organic wetlands, fulfilling essential roles as global carbon sinks, headwaters of rivers and biodiversity hotspots. Despite their importance, peatlands are being lost at an alarming rate due to human disturbance and climatic variability. Both the scientific and regulatory communities have focused considerable attention on developing tools for assessing environmental changes in peatlands. Diatoms are widely used in biomonitoring studies of lakes, rivers and streams as they have high abundance, specific ecological preferences and can respond rapidly to environmental change. However, diatom-based assessment studies in peallancls remain limited. The aims of this study were to identify indicator species and genus for three types of habitats (hummocks, hollows and ditch edges) in peatlands (central China), to examine the effects of physiochemical factors on diatom composition at genus and species levels, and to compare the efficiency of species- and genus-level identification in environmental assessment. Our results revealed that hummocks were characterized by drought tolerant diatoms, while hollows were dominated by species and genus preferring wet conditions. Ditch edges were characterized by diatoms with different life strategies. Depth to water table, redox potential, conductivity and calcium were significant predictors of both genus- and species-level composition. According to ordination analyses, pH was not correlated with species composition while it was a significant factor associated with genus level composition.

AB  - Er Roseires Dam plays a key role in controlling the Blue Nile flow in Sudan. This study explores the influence of the dam on the hydrological regimes, which in turn have implications for the ecosystem. The Range of Variability Approach (RVA) - based on a set of 32 indicators - was applied over the period 1965 to 2014 to establish a safe range of river flow. Moreover, remotely-sensed data of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to analyse the spatio-temporal variation of the dam's reservoir area over the period 2000-2014. Significant influence on the dry-season hydrological indicators is expressed by high negative hydrological alteration of the range from -47% to -100%, but the dam contributes positively through flow regulation during the flood season. Impounding water procedure and fluctuation of water flow caused by the dam are found to induce significant alterations. Releasing less water during the dry season and more gradual impounding process, which are not expected to affect the power generation or irrigation practices, are recommended for better ecological restoration. The total surface area of the reservoir has changed post the implementation of the dam heightening project. Since 2012, the lake surface area has expanded by 250%. Relationships between the lake size and the head have been developed to help in the monitoring of the hydrological conditions and, accordingly, in managing the dam operation. A field survey showed that the dam plays a positive social role as the reservoir supports local activities, such as fishery, farming, and collection of wood and fruits. But increased humidity and health problems have also been noted. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) would have a direct effect on Er Roseires Dam and the river flow downstream. High level of coordination among the riparian countries is recommended for better river water management. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - As part of the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program for Great River Ecosystems (EMAP-GRE), sediment samples were collected from 447 randomly selected littoral sites along the main channels of the Ohio, Missouri, and Upper Mississippi Rivers between 2004 and 2006. Toxicity of these sediment samples was measured using a 7-day Hyalella azteca survival and growth test. Sixty-five sites (14.5%) exhibited lethal toxicity, and 130 sites (29.1%) exhibited decreased growth. In the EMAP-GRE probabilistic sampling design, each sampled site had a weight associated with it that determined the length (and proportion) of the river represented by that sample point in the population. Weighted whole-river estimates indicated that of the 4721 river km sampled, sediment from 15.9 +/- 3.0% of the river (752 +/- 50 km) were lethally toxic, 27.4 +/- 3.5% (1289 +/- 57 km) were toxic by way of growth inhibition, and 40.0 +/- 3.7% (1887 +/- 68 km) exhibited either lethal or growth toxicity. Selected toxic samples were analyzed for 21 pesticides, 20 polychlorinated biphenyl congeners, and 6 polybrominated diphenyl ether congeners. For all of the samples tested, the concentration levels of these analytes were mostly lower than known toxicity thresholds, and neither unionized ammonia concentration nor osmotic stress (as measured by conductivity) could account for the toxicity found in sediments. The spatial pattern of sediment toxicity cannot be readily explained by urbanization or agricultural land use at the subcatchment scale. We speculate that the distribution of toxic sediment is more likely due to a combination of localized sources, including polluted tributaries, and the redistribution of contaminated sediments from upriver. The sediment toxicity results from this study will be used, in combination with other sediment, biologic, and habitat metrics and indicators collected in the EMAP-GRE study, to help interpret and assess the condition of the Ohio, Upper Mississippi, and Missouri Rivers.

AB  - Australia's largest river system, the Murray-Darling Basin, is the focus of scientific and political attention, due mainly to the competing issues of economic productivity versus environmental flows. Central to this dialogue is the need to know about the Basin's natural condition and the degree to which the system has deviated from this pre-disturbance, baseline status. This study examines the patterns of ecological change in Lake Cullulleraine, a permanently connected artificial wetland adjacent to Lock Nine on the Murray River, south-east Australia. A 43-cm sediment core was collected in January 1998 and diatoms were analysed at 1-cm intervals for use as aquatic ecological indicators. The sediment core was dated using Pb-210. Changes in the diatom community have occurred since the time of lake formation in 1926, particularly shifts between Aulacoseira subborealis, Staurosira construens var. venter, Aulacoseira granulata, Staurosirella pinnata and Pseudostaurosira brevistriata. An electrical conductivity (EC) transfer function was applied to the fossil diatom assemblages and inferred EC values were compared to long-term, historical EC data from the River. Despite the presence of good analogues between fossil and modern diatom assemblages, inferred EC did not reflect measured EC accurately. In recent decades, patterns in the two data sets were reversed. Despite clear changes in the fossil record, quantitative palaeo-environmental interpretation was limited because the dominant taxa occupy broad ecological niches. Despite these limitations, changes in the Lake Cullulleraine record, particularly in the planktonic taxa, can be interpreted in terms of landscape change. Furthermore, because of the good chronology from the site, the record may be useful for dating changes observed in sites with poor chronological control.

AB  - Environmental risk assessments of human pharmaceuticals and other 'emerging contaminants' should integrate both population-relevant endpoints and biomarkers of potential modes of action in a range of species. Adult Mytilus galloprovincialis were exposed to the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol or to the anti-inflammatory drug acetaminophen (paracetamol), both commonly used therapeutic drugs present in aquatic ecosystems. Mussels were exposed under semi-static conditions for 10 days to either acetaminophen (CAS number 103-90-2; mean measured concentrations 23 and 403 A mu g/L) or propranolol hydrochloride (CAS number 318-98-9; mean measured propranolol concentrations 11 and 147 A mu g/L) at 15 A +/- 1 A degrees C sea water. Feeding rate was assessed as an indicator of general toxicity. For propranolol, the 10-day no-observed effect concentration ((NOEC)-N-feeding rate) and lowest observed effect concentration ((LOEC)-L-feeding rate) were 11 and 147 A mu g/L, respectively. For acetaminophen, feeding rate was increased at both 23 and 403 A mu g/L, suggesting a 10-day (NOEC)-N-feeding rate of 403 A mu g/L. Primarily, phase I carboxylesterase (CbE), phase II glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the anti-oxidant catalase activities were evaluated in digestive gland. Gill GST and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities were also measured. Lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels were measured in both tissues to assess oxidative stress. Some enzymatic activities in liver were also reduced after propranolol exposure whilst acetaminophen enhanced them (CbE p < 0.05). Acetaminophen exposure significantly increased hepatic LPO levels and inhibited AChE activity in gill (10-day NOEC and LOEC of 23 and 403 A mu g/L, respectively), whereas propranolol (11 A mu g/L) enhanced gill GST.

AB  - Three Tunisian coastal and lagoon sites, variously affected by human activities. and differing according to their degree of communication with the sea, were studied. The total organic matter content and the granulometry of the sediment were measured and the macro-invertebrates were sampled and identified. Currently due to the lack of an efficient single biotic index for quality assessment, indications from these measurements can contribute to enrich our knowledge of the southern Mediterranean areas. Several biotic indices (AMBI, BENTIX, BOPA, BOPA modified, 12EC, ITI), most of which have been used in the context of the European Water Framework Directive, and some other structural parameters were used. The results show that the Bizerte lagoon, an almost closed area characterized mainly by extreme salinity/temperature and with a strong fluctuation of nutrients, appears biologically more impoverished. The Dkhila coast, which is more open to the sea, however, appears to be less dominated by the principal species. Biotic indices showed that the most polluted areas included the region exposed to urban inputs of Bizerte, the mouth of Hamdoun wadi and the harbour areas. In these locations, benthic macrofauna is dominated by opportunistic species like Capitella capitata, Scolelepis fuliginosa, Prionospio malmgreni, Polydora sp., Cirratulus cirratus and Cirriformia tentaculata. Other stations, which are farther from the sources of disturbance such as the mouths of the principal Wadis, the south of the Bizerte ship canal and the south of the Tunis bay, appear to be in good ecological condition and hosted a variety of sensitive species, Other stations were classified differently by the biotic indices used mainly because of the lack of a real inter-calibration of the various classification methodologies used by these indices.

AB  - One purpose of the science of ecotoxicology is to provide information for protecting ecosystems. Understanding the hazards of chemicals is essential to wise decision making, and it is now clear that community structure changes are closely linked to altered ecosystem function. Uncertainty is high when decisions are made from a small biological (toxicological) database. Individual bioassays provide little insight into biological interactions that are important in sustaining ecosystems. Artificial ecosystem experiments with herbicides demonstrate the limited predictive power of bioassays and ecological risk assessment methods that are heavily dependent on animal testing. Many herbicides interfere with unique pathways in photosynthetic organisms but are not very toxic to animals. For example, the herbicide atrazine is not considered toxic to fishes, because atrazine interferes with electron transport in photosystem II. But, adding atrazine at low levels (3-100 mu g/L) to aquatic microcosms demonstrated significant increases in algal biomass, concurrent enhancement of nutrient recovery systems, and increases in the detectable number of heterotrophic microbial species. Higher levels of atrazine (100-300 mu g/L) produced general collapse of these laboratory ecosystems. Low levels of atrazine capable of producing ecosystem-level effects can occur from days to weeks in streams of midwestern agricultural areas. Conversely, the herbicide diquat is rapidly immobilized in the field if fine sediments are present. Laboratory bioassays tend to overestimate diquat toxicity if sediments are not present because the material rarely persists in the water column. A variety of measures of ecosystem condition are available for assessment of chemical effects. Community structure changes (especially of nontarget groups) and changes in ecosystem process variables have technical importance and are not assessed in current risk assessment paradigms. Regulators need to draw on a more comprehensive data set than is presently used to make risk assessment decisions. Sometimes, this may require using methods other than those considered standard for data development.

AB  - Climate change and human activity can cause remarkable hydrological variation. Traits of hydrological series such as runoff before and after the change points could be significantly different, so the calculation of instream ecological water requirements (EWRs) is confronted with more challenges. Taking the Xitiaoxi River (XTXR) in the upper reach of the Taihu Lake Basin as an example, this paper investigates the calculation of EWRs using the range of variability approach (RVA) under changing environment. The change point diagnosis of the natural and observed runoff series are conducted for XTXR. Then, differences in the hydrological alternation indicators and instream EWRs processes obtained from various daily runoff series are compared. It was found that the natural and observed annual runoff series in XTXR from 1957 to 2018 both show significant variations, and the change points are in 2007 and 1999 respectively. If runoff data before the change points or all runoff data are used, the instream EWRs obtained from natural runoff are significantly lower than those obtained from the observed runoff. At the monthly time step, EWRs differences within a year mainly occurred from May to August. Also, calculation results of the instream EWRs are strongly related to the selected period of runoff series. The EWRs obtained using runoff series after the change points have rather acute fluctuation within a year. Therefore, when the RVA method is used under changing environment, the instream EWRs should be prudently determined by comparing different calculation results on the basis of river runoff restoration and variability analysis. To a certain extent, this paper enriches our understanding about the hydrological method for EWRs estimation, and proposes new ideas for future research on EWRs.

AB  - Current trends emphasize the importance of the examination of the functional composition of lichens, which may provide information on the species realized niche diversity and community assembly processes, thus enabling one to understand the specific adaptations of lichens and their interaction with the environment. We analyzed the distribution and specialization of diverse morphological, anatomical and chemical (lichen secondary metabolites) traits in lichen communities in a close-to-natural forest of lowland Europe. We considered these traits in relation to three levels of forest ecosystem organization: forest communities, phorophyte species and substrates, in order to recognize the specialization of functional traits to different levels of the forest complexity. Traits related to the sexual reproduction of mycobionts (i.e., ascomata types: lecanoroid apothecia, lecideoid apothecia, arthonioid apothecia, lirellate apothecia, stalked apothecia and perithecia) and asexual reproduction of mycobionts (pycnidia, hyphophores and sporodochia) demonstrated the highest specialization to type of substrate, tree species and forest community. Thallus type (foliose, fruticose, crustose and leprose thalli), ascospore dark pigmentation and asexual reproduction by lichenized diaspores (soredia and isidia) revealed the lowest specialization to tree species and substrate, as well as to forest community. Results indicate that lichen functional trait assemblage distribution should not only be considered at the level of differences in the internal structure of the analyzed forest communities (e.g., higher number of diverse substrates or tree species) but also studied in relation to specific habitat conditions (insolation, moisture, temperature, eutrophication) that are characteristic of a particular forest community. Our work contributes to the understanding of the role of the forest structure in shaping lichen functional trait composition, as well as enhancing our knowledge on community assembly rules of lichen species.

AB  - In face of increasing anthropogenic disturbance in the deep sea, it is a priority to better understand the regional distribution of cold-water corals (CWC). These organisms create some of the most species-rich habitats in the deep sea and, for this reason, they must be properly protected and managed. In this study, we aimed to identify suitable habitat for multiple CWC taxa off the Brazilian continental margin and compare their environmental niches. Habitat suitability models were developed using the Maxent approach, which allowed for the prediction of species distribution and for the identification of potential 'hot spot' areas that may be important for biodiversity conservation. Ecological niches were determined by a PCA-env approach, and niche similarity and equivalence were evaluated based on niche overlap using the Schoener's D metric. Potentially suitable habitat for Octocorallia covered a broad latitudinal range encompassing nearly the entire Brazilian continental margin, whereas Scleractinia had greater potentially suitable habitat in the Central and Southern areas. Scleractinian species were observed to slightly differ in their environmental niche, with non-reef-forming species being more tolerant to a wider range of environmental conditions in comparison with reef-forming species, inhabiting a wider area of the South American continental margin. Due to the high potential suitability for several CWC species, the Central and Southern parts of the Brazilian continental margin should be considered as potential areas high CWC diversity. Considering the current state of the art and strategic assessment tools, these areas are important targets for conservation, management, and environmental impact assessment. Most reef-forming species had similar but not directly equivalent ecological niches, indicating that mapping efforts and management planning should consider CWCs at the species level.

AB  - Paleoecological assessment is challenging in highly dynamic environments such as estuaries, where sedimentation of material derived from the catchment interferes with marine processes. In this study we analyzed sedimentary heavy metal contents of the last decades to assess the impact of recent industrialization and changes in land use of the Thi Vai Estuary in Southern Vietnam. Two sediment cores (upstream and downstream) were dated using Pb-210, allowing the environmental reconstruction of the last three decades. Considering the recent and fast economic growth of this region these results are suitable for the evaluation of anthropogenic impacts. Mean sedimentation rates (9.2 cm yr(-1) upstream, 4.7 cm yr(-1) downstream) indicate high land erosion likely due to deforestation and dumping of dredged material. Sediment quality guidelines (SQG's) showed that Cr and Cu levels exceed threshold values (TEL) in both cores. Upstream Ni is above the probable effect level (PEL) suggesting risk of potential adverse biological effects. Geo-accumulation (I-geo), enrichment factor (EF) and contamination factor (CF) indices were calculated based on geogenic background values. Most indices show only moderate contamination for different elements, particularly by Cr and Pb. However, considering the historical land use impacts (such as discharge of untreated wastewater, intense agricultural practices, tanning operations, etc.), pollutant concentrations are lower than expected, presumably due to dilution by high sedimentation rates and tidal hydrodynamics. Nonetheless, heavy metal indices and SQG's indicate the ecological condition in the area is of concern, particularly upstream as corroborated by high metal fluxes, highlighting severe impacts in the region.

AB  - Glomalin, which sequesters substantial amounts of carbon, plays a critical role in sustaining terrestrial biome functions and contributes to the fate of many pollutants from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems. Despite having focused on the amount of glomalin produced, very few attempts have been made to understand how landscapes and environmental conditions influence glomalin composition and characteristics. This study focused on glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) exported as storm runoff including eroded sediment and water that was collected before flowing to surface waters in a peri-urban watershed. GRSP characteristics were assessed by Bradford protein analysis, fluorescence spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), and the determination of aromaticity based on the specific ultraviolet absorption value (280 nm) and molecular weight. General linear models (GLMs) was established by integrating microbial activity, land cover, water temperature, precipitation, and other solution chemical properties to explain the variations in GRSP characteristics. Results showed that a higher GRSP concentration in agricultural reference sites was produced in the form of specific materials with low molecular weight and aromaticity, as well as high percentage of C1 and C5 components which indicate microbial-processed sources, relative to urbanized and forested sites. Compared with forested land, urbanized land clearly produced runoff GRSP with low molecular weight and aromaticity, as well as more degradation of humic-like materials (C3 component). The highest GLM explaining 89% of the variables, including significant variables (p < 0.05) such as microbial activity, water temperature, and water conductivity, was observed for GRSP characteristics. Therefore, changes in eroded soil GRSP quality can serve as an indicator for improving watershed management and thus protecting aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - The knowledge concerning associations between chronic chemical exposure and many disorders with complex etiology involving gene-environment interactions is increasing, and new methods must be developed to improve water quality monitoring. The complexity of chemical mixtures in polluted aquatic environments makes the evaluation of toxic potential in those sites difficult, but the use of biomarkers and bioindicators has been recognized as a reliable tool to assess risk of exposure to biota and also the human population. In order to evaluate the use of fish and biomarkers to assess toxic potential and bioavailability of chemicals in human-related hydric resources, an in situ experiment was accomplished in two water reservoirs designated for human supply, which were previously evaluated by the local environmental regulatory agency through a set of physical, chemical, and classical biological parameters. Molecular, biochemical, and morphological biomarkers were performed in caged Oreochromis niloticus kept for 6 months in the studied reservoirs to assess potentially useful biomarkers to evaluate the quality of water for human supply. Chemical analysis of toxic metals in liver and muscle and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in bile was considered to assess the bioavailability of pollutants and highlight human activity impact. The reservoir previously classified by a governmental agency as less impacted presented more risk of exposure to biota. These results were supported by chemical analysis, vitellogenin expression, histopathological findings (gonads, liver, and gills), as well as indicators of neurotoxic effects and oxidative stress in liver. The inclusion of some biomarkers as parameters in regulatory monitoring programs in reservoirs designated for human supply is strongly suggested to evaluate the risks of exposure to the human population. Thus, a revision of the traditional biological and physicochemical analysis utilized to establish the conditions of water quality is necessary.

AB  - Global demand for agricultural and forestry products fundamentally affects regional land-use change associated with environmental impacts (EIs) such as erosion. In contrast to aggregated global metrics such as greenhouse gas (GHG) balances, local/regional EIs of different agricultural and forestry production regions need methods which enable worldwide EI comparisons. The key aspect is to control environmental heterogeneity to reveal man-made differences of EIs between production regions. Environmental heterogeneity is the variation in biotic and abiotic environmental conditions. In the present study, we used three approaches to control environmental heterogeneity: (i) environmental stratification, (ii) potential natural vegetation (PNV), and (iii) regional environmental thresholds to compare EIs of solid biomass production. We compared production regions of managed forests and plantation forests in subtropical (Satilla watershed, Southeastern US), tropical (Rufiji basin, Tanzania), and temperate (Mulde watershed, Central Germany) climates. All approaches supported the comparison of the EIs of different land-use classes between and within production regions. They also standardized the different EIs for a comparison between the EI categories. The EIs for different land-use classes within a production region decreased with increasing degree of naturalness (forest, plantation forestry, and cropland). PNV was the most reliable approach, but lacked feasibility and relevance. The PNV approach explicitly included most of the factors that drive environmental heterogeneity in contrast to the stratification and threshold approaches. The stratification approach allows consistent global application due to available data. Regional environmental thresholds only included arbitrarily selected aspects of environmental heterogeneity; they are only available for few EIs. Especially, the PNV and stratification approaches are options to compare regional EIs of biomass or crop production such as erosion, biodiversity, or water quality impacts worldwide and thereby complement existing metrics assessing global EIs such as GHG emissions.

AB  - The zooplankton of the northern California Current are typically characterized by an abundance of lipid-rich copepods that support rapid growth and survival of ecologically, commercially, and recreationally valued fish, birds, and mammals. Disruption of this food chain and reduced ecosystem productivity are often associated with climatic variability such as El Nino events. We examined the variability in timing, magnitude, and duration of positive temperature anomalies and changes in copepod species composition in the northern California Current in relation to 10 tropical El Nino events. Measurable impacts on mesozooplankton of the northern California Current were observed during seven of 10 of these events. The occurrence of anomalously warm water and the response of the copepod community was rapid (lag of zero to 2months) following the initiation of canonical Eastern Pacific (EP) events, but delayed (lag of 2-8months) following 'Modoki' Central Pacific (CP) events. The variable lags in the timing of a physical and biological response led to impacts in the northern California Current peaking in winter during EP events and in the spring during CP events. The magnitude and duration of the temperature and copepod anomalies were strongly and positively related to the magnitude and duration of El Nino events, but were also sensitive to the phase of the lower frequency Pacific Decadal Oscillation. When fisheries managers and biological oceanographers are faced with the prospect of a future El Nino event, prudent management and observation will require consideration of the background oceanographic conditions, the type of event, and both the magnitude and duration of the event when assessing the potential physical and biological impacts on the northern California Current.

AB  - Vegetation is a key measure of changes in wetland hydrology and ecology induced by flood inundation. The fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy (FPAR) is an indicator of presence and state of vegetation, which can be estimated from remote sensing data. This study investigates the spatio-temporal variations of FPAR under inundation by integrating remotely sensed images and hydrological data in a GIS environment. Taking the Macquarie Marshes as a study area, it aims to model the behavior of vegetation after an ecologically significant flood using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) FPAR products, so as to reveal the impacts of flood on wetland vegetation. Flow data from four gauging stations at upstream, mid-stream and downstream were analysed. The modified Normalized Difference Water Index (mNDWI) was used to extract inundation extent from MODIS images. Image ratio and lagged cross-correlation methods were employed to disclose the vegetation response to flooding. Vegetation in the Marshes went through considerable structural changes during the identified flood event. FPAR was relatively more stable in the inundated areas than the non-inundated areas. FPAR values in both inundated and non-inundated areas exhibited a similar trend in the "non-flood period", but a different trend in the "flood period". Lagged cross-correlation analysis shows diverse vegetation responses to flood inundation between the inundated and non-inundated areas. It proves the water retention of wetland inundation and confirms vegetation in the non-inundated areas more sensitive to soil moisture conditions. This study proposes a feasible method for efficiently studying vegetation dynamics of flood inundation at both spatial and temporal scales. These methodology and results can provide baseline information for eco-hydrological studies of floodplain-wetland ecosystems.

AB  - Lack of field time, access to experts, and the challenges associated with research permits make traditional approaches for determining species richness (comprehensive collection and determination of biological specimens) impractical in many situations. To accelerate local biodiversity assessments for conservation and resource management, scientists need both cost-effective survey methods and validated statistical models that link sample data to estimates of true species richness. Lichen communities are reliable indicators for the condition of many different terrestrial ecosystems because they are sensitive to environmental stress and represent a promising system in which to develop alternative approaches to biodiversity monitoring. We propose a citizen scientist-based survey methodology for macrolichen diversity in which parataxonomic units (Pus), as identified in lichen photographs, serve as species surrogates to estimate lichen diversity. We validate this method by photographically surveying lichens at five park units previously surveyed as part of the Lichen Biomonitoring Project (LBP) at George Mason University. Using the Chao2 metric to account for variation in sampling effort, we compared observed (raw PU counts) and estimated (effort-corrected) PU and species richnesses and found that, for all park units, our methodology gave similar diversity estimates to those obtained by the LBP. While PUs provide rapid assessment of diversity within a sample, they do not address the challenge of upscaling from samples to estimate total species diversity in an area. We propose a statistical method to estimate PU richness that, unlike phenomenological methods like Chao2, can exploit replication in our sampling design to explicitly model PU occupancy and detection probability. In sum, we present new methods for both surveying diversity and extrapolating sample data that can be widely applied for rapid assessment of biodiversity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Conservation of the Mediterranean marine ecosystems is particularly challenging; high biodiversity is combined with high human population densities and a long history of resource exploitation. Residents and users of coastal areas often perceive marine conservation and management as limiting factors to economic development. Under these conditions, the creation of comprehensive systems of marine protected areas (MPAs) can be problematic. We selected a stretch of coast in southern Italy as a representative example of a Mediterranean coastline and nearshore marine ecosystems, featuring a complex matrix of vulnerable habitats in a landscape fragmented by multiple human activities and associated stressors. Through the use of site-selection algorithms, we investigated how human activities constrain MPA planning. Rather than assuming that patches of the same habitat found at different locations are interchangeable, we considered the scenario of a heterogeneous landscape of human impacts creating high variability in habitat quality. Despite widespread human influence, identification of portions of habitats to be protected from direct human disturbance as core no-take areas is still possible using the inclusion of 10 and 30% of low and high priority habitat, respectively, in reserves as a conservation target. Implementation of MPAs with a limited protection scheme that also include several small no-take areas could represent a feasible strategy for the conservation of Mediterranean coastal marine habitats. Moreover, MPAs could be combined with coastal zoning of activities as a means of further controlling effects over broader areas and allowing for recovery of degraded areas. Site-selection algorithms are invaluable tools for conservation planning. However, careful consideration of the potential constraints imposed by local human activities and future research aimed at filling existing gaps in understanding the ecology are crucial for making this approach useful in marine conservation planning.

AB  - Main potential impacts on seagrasses from dredging and sand mining include physical removal and/or burial of vegetation and effects of increased turbidity and sedimentation. For seagrasses, the critical threshold for turbidity and sedimentation, as well as the duration that seagrasses can survive periods of high turbidity or excessive sedimentation vary greatly among species. Larger, slow-growing climax species with substantial carbohydrate reserves show greater resilience to such events than smaller opportunistic species, but the latter display much faster post-dredging recovery when water quality conditions return to their original state. A review of 45 case studies worldwide, accounting for a total loss of 21,023 ha of seagrass vegetation due to dredging, is indicative of the scale of the impact of dredging on seagrasses. In recent years, tighter control in the form of strict regulations, proper enforcement and monitoring, and mitigating measures together with proper impact assessment and development of new environmental dredging techniques help to prevent or minimize adverse impacts on seagrasses. Costs of such measures are difficult to estimate, but seem negligible in comparison with costs of seagrass restoration programmes, which are typically small-scale in approach and often have limited success. Copying of dredging criteria used in one geographic area to a dredging operation in another may in some cases lead to exaggerated limitations resulting in unnecessary costs and delays in dredging operations, or in other cases could prove damaging to seagrass ecosystems. Meaningful criteria to limit the extent and turbidity of dredging plumes and their effects will always require site-specific evaluations and should take into account the natural variability of local background turbidity.

AB  - The transformation between hexavalent chromium (Cr6+) and trivalent chromium (Cr3+) has a significant impact on ecosystems, as Cr6+ has higher levels of toxicity than Cr3+. In this regard, a variety of Cr6+ reduction processes occurring in natural environments have been studied extensively. In this work, we investigate the reductive transformation of Cr6+ by ferrous ions (Fe2+) in ice at-20 degrees C, and compare the same process in water at 25 degrees C. The Fe(2+-m)ediated reduction of Cr6+ occurred much faster in ice than it did in water. The accelerated reduction of Cr6+ in ice is primarily ascribed to the accumulation of Cr6+, Fe2+, and protons in the grain boundaries formed during freezing, which constitutes favorable conditions for redox reactions between Cr6+ and Fe2+. This freeze concentration phenomenon was verified using UV-visible spectroscopy with o-cresolsulfonephthalein (as a pH indicator) and confocal Raman spectroscopy. The reductive transformation of Cr6+ (20 mu M) by Fe2+ in ice proceeded rapidly under various Fe2+ concentrations (20-140 mu M), pH values (2.0-5.0), and freezing temperatures (-10 to-30 degrees C) with a constant molar ratio of oxidized Fe2+ to reduced Cr6+ (3:1). This result implies that the proposed mechanism (i.e., the redox reaction between Cr6+ and Fe2+ in ice) can significantly contribute to the natural conversion of Cr6+ in cold regions. The Fe2+-mediated Cr6+ reduction kinetics in frozen Cr(6+)contaminated wastewater was similar to that in frozen Cr6+ solution. This indicates that the variety of substrates typically present in electroplating wastewater have a negligible effect on the redox reaction between Cr6+ and Fe2+ in ice; it also proposes that the Fe2+/freezing process can be used for the treatment of Cr6+-contaminated wastewater.

AB  - Peri-urban ecosystems are among the most intensive areas in terms of competition between different ecosystem components. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays a significant role in aquatic carbon cycling. The chemical composition of DOM and associated potential ecological risks in peri-urban aquatic ecosystems are poorly understood. Herein, we used fluorescence excitation-emission matrix and parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) to characterize DOM in a peri-urban critical zone observatory watershed in Eastern China. According to the theory of natural disaster risk formation, we calculated the ecological risk of DOM in the peri-urbanwatershed. Seasonal variation in DOM concentrations was observed, whereas fluorescent DOM concentrations were site-specific across four sub-watersheds. The analysis of DOM absorption properties revealed the presence of DOM components with high aromatic content and large molecular weight in the watershed. Four fluorescent components (two humic-like and two protein-like substances) were identified using the PARAFAC model. Spatial distribution analysis showed that DOM quality was mainly influenced by human activities, and the proportion of protein-like substance (C3) was strongly correlated with anthropogenic parameters. The distribution of optical indices indicated diverse sources of DOM in the watershed. Ecological risk related to DOM was greater in the dry season than the wet season. There was a slight risk in most areas, with an extreme risk in areas experiencing the most intensive human disturbance, which were also extremely or heavily vulnerable. The results emphasize the strong influence of human disturbance on the ecological risk of DOM in peri-urban aquatic ecosystems. Our study provides useful information for ecological risk assessment of DOM that is difficult to obtain using traditional chemical analysis. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biological indices such as AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (AMBI) and multivariate AMBI (M-AMBI) have been used in monitoring programs worldwide to assess the benthic ecological status (ES) of transitional and coastal waters. However, their reliability is reduced under faunal impoverishment and defaunation, low abundance/number of taxa, and/or high percentage of taxa not assigned or mis-assigned to ecological group, which imply removing these data from the analysis. In order to avoid loss of robustness when these situations are met, here we propose an approach based on decision criteria that utilize these indices together with environmental and contaminants data. Our area of study is the southern Gulf of Mexico seafloor, where a survey was carried out during the rainy season across a sampling grid of 75 sites. To achieve this, we first distinguished homogeneous groups of sites and then defined states ('good', 'fair', and 'bad') from three sediment quality elements: benthic indices, environmental data by quartile values, and contaminant concentrations in the context of sediment quality guidelines. Overall, 69% of sampling sites showed low abundance and defaunation, mainly at sites located on the continental shelf, where most of them ranged from 'moderate' to 'poor' ES, principally by 'fair' environmental data and secondly, oil-related disturbance. Conversely, sites located near the mouths of rivers and coastal lagoons recorded the highest abundance and showed diverse sensitivity levels, ranging from 'high' to 'tad' ES. In conclusion, the use of this states-based approach allowed us to support and interpret the results of AMBI and M-AMBI, since their values were related to environmental and contaminants data. This approach may be useful in many contexts to avoid the loss of data when assessing the ES of the seafloor under defaunation or low abundance conditions.

AB  - For the first time, the results of group-theoretical analysis of pseudo-symmetry in two-dimensional images of hydrobionts belonging to the classes Conjugatophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Acantharia, and Asteroidea are presented, along with symmetry transformations in echinoderms ontogenesis. The analysis has been conducted using original software "BioPsLeaf and "BioPsFlower". The source of hydrobionts two-dimensional images, used in this study, was published materials including graphical illustrations from "Kunstformen der Natur" by Ernst Haeckel. The structure of the hydrobionts selected for the analysis is determined, in essence, by Curie principle, which imposes constraints on symmetry groups of living things with account for environmental conditions. For representatives of classes Conjugatophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Acantharia, and Asteroidea it is found out that, in whole, the invariance (symmetry) of a biological object, approximately described by group C-n nu, according to the Schoenflies system, can be characterized by two numerical values, namely minimal values of pseudo-symmetry degree among all of its local maxima in both of turn operations (eta(r)) and mirror reflections (eta(b)). Using Asterina amurensis as an example, it is shown that complete metamorphosis of this starfish can be represented by symmetry transformations of the following sequence:
   C-4 nu -> C-2 nu -> C-s -> C-5 nu.
   It manifests natural transition from rotational symmetry to bilateral one and back to rotational one, which is due to organism's biology at early stages of development and agrees with Curie principle: under external impacts, point symmetry of a system changes in such a manner that only those symmetry operations retain that are common with symmetry operations of the impact. It is emphasized, that it is the group theory that allows characterizing object invariance in relation to space transformations, i.e., its symmetry. In its turn, finding invariants in some classes of objects means revealing their structural basis and helps to discover the unchangeable within the changeable.

AB  - The behaviour of talitrids, being a local adaptation to beaches, is known to be related to environmental stability. The use of behavioural responses of resident populations as bioindicator of shoreline stability has been tested under various conditions, including after soft and hard engineering actions to stabilise eroded beaches. Port structures likely have impact on sediment longshore transportation and shoreline stability. The question was whether talitrid orientation behaviour could be proposed as bioindicator of impacts also for sandy bays of limited extension and highly used for recreation, such as those in the vicinity of touristic port structures. Orientation experiments were carried out on a set of sandy beaches of different extension and morphology, each of them in the vicinity of a touristic port, across the Mediterranean coasts. The protocol included field orientation tests of populations of talitrids, then analysed in terms of orientation precision seawards (considering sun compass orientation as the most locally adapted behavioural mechanism) in different seasons (before and after the touristic season) and times of day. The populations from more protected (either naturally or artificially) headland-bays showed a higher precision of orientation with respect to the shoreline direction than those from extended beaches, more subject to changes in longshore sedimentary transport as consequence of natural and human activities. The distance from the port and touristic pressure had no influence on talitrid orientation. An important stabilising factor for the sandy beach ecosystems, including talitrid populations and their behavioural adaptation, appeared to be the presence of seagrass banquette. The behavioural data point out that biotic information proceeding from local animal populations linked to beach sediments may complement sedimentology data and allow scaling the impacts occurring on a developed coastline. This becomes particularly relevant when considering interdisciplinary approaches to monitoring strategies. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Ecosystem response to climate change in high-altitude regions is a focus on global change research. Picea/Abies forests are widely distributed at high altitudes of East and Central Asia, and their distribution changes are sensitive to climate change. Humidity is an important climatic factor that affects high-altitude ecosystems; however, the relationship between distribution changes of Picea/Abies forests and millennial-scale variability of humidity is still not clear. Palynological records can provide insights into millennial-scale paleovegetation changes, which have been successfully used to reconstruct past climate change in East and Central Asia. In this study, we synthesized 24 Picea/Abies pollen and humidity/moisture changes based upon Holocene lake records in East and Central Asia in order to explore the response of high-latitude ecosystem to millennial-scale climate change. The changing pattern of Holocene lacustrine Picea/Abies pollen in arid Central Asia differs from that of monsoonal East Asia, which can be due to different millennial-scale climate change patterns between monsoonal and arid Central Asia. Then, the relationship between changes in Picea/Abies pollen and humidity/moisture conditions was examined based on a comparison of pollen and humidity/moisture records. The results indicate that millennial-scale Picea/Abies distribution changes are mainly controlled by moisture variability at high altitudes, while the temperature effect plays a minor role in Picea/Abies distribution changes. Moreover, this research proves that lacustrine Picea/Abies pollen can be used as an indicator of millennial-scale humidity/moisture evolution at high altitudes in East and Central Asia.

AB  - Included in the 2nd tier of a site specific risk assessment that is being carried out in an abandoned uranium mine (Cunha Baixa uranium mine, Central Portugal), fatty acids biomarkers and sterols were analyzed to assess the impact of soil contamination with metals and radionuclides in the structure of the microbial community in seven sampling sites located at different distances from the mine. Surface soil samples were collected in those sampling sites in the four different seasons of the year. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on fatty acid biomarkers and sterols. Subsequently PCA scores obtained for both components were used to test the effect of sites and seasons, on soil samples collected in the Cunha Baixa uranium mine, through bi-factorial ANOVAs. Through PCA analysis, two distinct groups were set apart along the first two components. One group included sites at a great distance from the mine which were negatively correlated with higher contents of iC15:0 and iC17:0, both indicators of Gram-positive bacteria, as well as with ergosterol, cholestanol and cholesterol. The second group, in turn, was composed of the sampling sites most impacted by ore exploration, in situ leaching of poor ore, and spread of sludge from the effluent treatment pond. These sites were positively correlated with higher levels of iC16:0 (Gram-positive bacteria indicator), cyC17:0 (generally common in gram negative bacteria) and C18:0 and C17:0 biomarkers of non-specific bacteria. The profile of fatty acids obtained in the sampling sites revealed variable predominance of groups of bacteria which are a clear indication of differences in the soil microbial communities that are directly related to the environmental conditions prevailing in the uranium mine area.

AB  - We integrated basic concepts from fisheries science and toxicological risk assessment to form a potential method for setting screening-level, risk-based, site-specific water quality objectives for temperature. In summary, the proposed approach: (a) uses temperature impacts upon specific growth as a measure of chronic (cumulative) temperature effects; (b) explicitly incorporates the consequences of both magnitude and cumulative duration of exposures; (c) adjusts the result for local watershed conditions, reducing the likelihood that naturally warm systems are identified as thermally polluted while helping to ensure that naturally cool systems are closely monitored for ecologically harmful changes in thermal regime; and (d) expresses the net result both graphically and as a risk quotient, RQ, closely analogous to that used in toxicological risk assessments. The latter yields a site-specific, risk-based water quality objective and may serve as a straightforward decision rule for environmental managers. The method was applied to historical data from a small British Columbia stream subject to increasing urban development pressures. We also illustrate how the technique might be used to explore potential climatic change impacts, using coupled general circulation model predictions in conjunction with empirical downscaling. Overall, the method and results are presented as an introduction and illustration of concept, intended as a step toward the development of a logistically feasible risk-based approach to establishing screening-level, site-specific water temperature objectives, and monitoring compliance, in the context of large-scale, many-site, environmental monitoring networks. With further work, the technique offers potential to fill the gap between the temperature threshold-based targets typically specified in regulatory guidelines, which may be hydroecologically unrealistic, and detailed biophysical modelling, which typically is logistically infeasible in a day-to-day environmental monitoring and management context.

AB  - Plants tolerant to polluted environments were selected, based on several criteria, to restore a coastal forest ecosystem severely damaged by air pollutants discharged from an industrial complex. In addition, a restoration plan was prepared synthesizing these results and the diagnostic ecological indicators in the area for which restoration is required. Pollution-tolerant plants of 11 tree and subtree species, 10 herb species and one shrub species were selected from field surveys in the vicinity of two representative industrial complexes in Korea, Ulsan and Yeocheon. Nine species were selected for tolerance to SO(2) fumigation and six species were selected for tolerance to Al(3+). Growth and photosynthetic responses of sample plants transplanted into polluted and unpolluted sites showed that 15 species out of the 26 sample plants showed a disposition for tolerance. Most of these are endemic plants and they are composed of diverse species in structure and function. This result implies that these tolerant species could play important roles in the restoration of the study area, which has several specific features. On the other hand, results from transplant tests indicate that a field survey is the most reasonable method for selection of tolerant plants to restore a pollution-damaged ecosystem, as was shown in another restoration program. Results of ecological analysis on vegetation map indicate that the spatial range within the first ridge is the sector for which restoration is required. This sector was classified into four zones on the basis of topographic conditions: lower and upper slopes of both slopes facing and opposite the pollution source. Guidelines for soil amelioration and arrangement of tolerant plants were prepared considering the degree of vegetation degradation, leaf damage of major plant species and soil pollution in each zone under the restoration plan.

AB  - This study aims to showcase the adaptability evaluation of human settlements in Chengdu with the use of 3S technology. Chengdu was selected as the research object; natural eco-environmental factors such as terrain fluctuations, temperature and humidity, vegetation type, land use, and vegetation cover were analyzed, together with human disturbance factors such as traffic and gross domestic product (GDP); and the index weights were calculated by analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The evaluation model of Chengdu's residential environment adaptability was constructed based on the analysis carried out by the 3S technology: projection transformation, remote sensing interpretation, information extraction, and analysis. The results of the analysis reflected the zoning and spatial distribution characteristics of Chengdu's residential environment adaptability, and show that (1) the adaptability index of Chengdu's human settlement environment is between 15.98 and 76.75, and the suitability of human settlement environment is seen gradually decreasing from the middle, where it is the highest, when moving to the west and to the east of Chengdu; (2) according to the present situation, the suitability index can be divided into high-grade suitable areas, relatively high-grade suitable areas, moderately suitable areas, and low suitable areas; (3) the correlation between the spatial distribution of Chengdu population and each index factor is as follows: per capita GDP > topographic relief > temperature and humidity > vegetation coverage > traffic network density > land use > hydrological factors; (4) there is a good correlation between Chengdu's human settlements suitability index and the present population density grid layer, and its correlation coefficient is 0.7326; and (5) the leading impact indicators of human settlements are different in different regions. The results show that the natural environmental conditions in Chengdu are superior and that the ecological environmental quality is relatively stable, but the human settlement suitability index is relatively low in the southeast and Longmenshan areas of Chengdu.

AB  - Background and Aim: Wild birds raised in urban environments may be exposed to many negative factors, including biological and chemical toxic elements. The aim of the study was to assess the occurrence of bacteria and parasites in wild birds, based on the example of the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) as a potential indicator of bacterial drug resistance genes. Toxicological contamination was also analyzed to determine the impact of urbanized areas on this predatory species, in terms of its health, welfare, and survival in urban environments.
   Materials and Methods: The samples consisted of down feathers and fresh feces obtained from seven falcon chicks (during obligatory veterinary examination) reared in two nests located in the Lublin region (Lublin and Pulawy). Bacteria and parasites were isolated directly from feces by classical microbiological methods, polymerase chain reaction, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MS). The down feathers and feces of birds were used for toxicological testing by plasma inductively coupled plasma MS to assess the concentrations of selected heavy metals (cadmium [Cd], lead [Pb], arsenic [As], zinc [Zn], and copper [Cu]).
   Results: The study revealed the presence of a diverse microbiome in the falcon chicks, among which Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. bacteria and parasites of the genus Caryospora were dominant. The presence of drug resistance genes was also confirmed among the pathogens. The toxicological analysis found high concentrations of toxic heavy metals, including Cd, Pb, As, and Zn, in the downy feathers and feces of peregrine chicks.
   Conclusion: Predatory free-living birds living in urban environments not only can be infected with various pathogens but may also show contamination with heavy metals, which could influence their natural resistance, condition, and welfare.

AB  - The aim of our study is to quantify the relationship between ecosystem and climate variables in southwest China. We further examined spatiotemporal distribution patterns of daily reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and ecosystem types through integrated approaches, including spatiotemporal interpolation, Penman-Monteith, Mann-Kendall test, statistical correlation analysis and transition matrix based on those datasets including observation climate data, satellite remote sensing images (MODIS and Landsat) and observed ecosystem data. The following results are achieved. First, changes of ET(0)were greatly influenced by the combined effects of precipitation (with a decrease rate of -13 mm/10 years) and temperature (with a decrease rate of + 0.17 celcius/10 years). The annual average ET(0)increased by + 2.1 mm/10 years, and the increased ET(0)are more than 25% of the total area. Second, evapotranspiration was regarded as a sensitive indicator of climate and ecosystem feedbacks, and these ecosystem types have a great transformation, including forest, agriculture, and grass. Forest and grass were distributed primarily in the southern and eastern mountain areas, grass was in high mountains area while agriculture was prevalent in basin areas respond to climate changes. The area of forest converted to grass was 3670 km(2), which was greater than transition from grass to forest (1720 km(2)). Correlation coefficients of evapotranspiration and NDVI were positive in forest and negative in agriculture. Third, the effects of these changes on climate vegetation and ecosystem process feedbacks on the quickly warming southwest China are potentially significant. Although the variation in ecosystem types was combined effects caused by climate variation and human activities, an effective ecological restoration program "Grain for Green" has improved the environmental conditions in southwest China.

AB  - Ecosystem growth and development constrained by material, energy, and information flows can be well described by the use of ecoexergy in the context of thermodynamic laws. However, ecosystems are not only physically open to the environment but also ontic to all species and processes involved in an ecological network. Essential exchange of mass, energy, and information through an ecological network may happen both directly and indirectly, which in turn affect the ecosystem resilience and resistance when facing stresses and/or disturbances. The complexity of how the cycling of matter, energy, and information via commensalism or mutualism over relevant species in an ecological network could affect the ecosystem resilience and resistance has not yet been well explored quantitatively. This paper defines a virtual ecoexergy concept and develops a quantitative way to address the possible contributions from commensalism or mutualism between any paired species indirectly in an ecosystem under a decadal impact of intermittent droughts and hurricanes. The key terminology of the biomass equivalence rule that addresses these indirect contributions in an ecological network was introduced as an integral part of virtual ecoexergy concept to facilitate the applications. The case study in Lake Okeechobee (Florida) confirms a big difference in terms of resilience and resistance when the virtual ecoexergy is taken into account through the biomass equivalence rule. With the inclusion of the concept of virtual ecoexergy associated with mutualism or commensalism, the lake's ecological stability condition would not be underestimated during an ecosystem succession and recovery process when facing continuous hurricane and drought impacts in the 2000s. The enhanced resilience with the consideration of the virtual ecoexergy is about 12 times larger than the conventional resilience in this real-world case study. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The stable nitrogen isotope ratio (delta(15)N) in macroalgae is effectively used as a time-integrated bioindicator to record nitrogen sources for primary producers during their growing periods in aquatic ecosystems. However, the utility of this tool is limited because the occurrence of these organisms is often restricted in space and time. To investigate the potential of chemical composition in sedimentary organic matter (SOM) as a proxy for time-integrated environmental conditions, nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) contents and their stable isotope ratios (delta(15)N and delta(13)C) were determined, and systematically cross-checked against corresponding values in macroalgae at the Shiraho fringing reef in Okinawa, Japan. Preliminary trials showed that delta(15)N in SOM processed by the "wash-out method" for delta(13)C analysis yielded similar delta(15)N values to the bulk sediment, despite the loss of some SOM during the process. The amounts of organic matter and the ratio of the HCl-insoluble portion were variable within the reef, probably reflecting local vegetation and subsequent decomposition. The distribution of delta(15)N and VC in SOM showed similar trends to those of macroalgae, with mostly constant differences of 1.4 parts per thousand and -6.7 parts per thousand, respectively. These differences throughout the reef appeared to be explained in terms of mixed contributions from macrophyte and epibenthic microalgae growing in different seasons and years, with their debris undergoing diagenetic alteration. Therefore, macroalgae and SOM delta-values can be used in a complementary manner, over various time scales, as indicators of the integrated effect of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) sources on coral reef ecosystems.

AB  - Phytoplankton growth in oligotrophic regions might be constrained by a low photosynthetic capacity related to nutrient stress. A reduced photosynthetic capacity has been documented by low values of the maximum quantum efficiency of charge separation (F-v/F-m) of photosystem II (PSII), In the present work, spatial and temporal variations of F-v/F-m in phytoplankton samples of the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) off Mexico were characterized to explore the potential of this parameter as a nutrient stress indicator. Our results show that F-v/F-m was lower than 0.5 in most of the samples and that in surface waters this parameter was highly variable. The variability of F-v/F-m was related to the time of sampling, and F-v/F-m changes followed a day/night cycle with maximum values at dawn and a strong reduction at noon related to down-regulation of PSII activity. Enrichment experiments showed that F-v/F-m did not increase after nitrate addition to surface samples. These results Suggest that photosynthesis of the phytoplankton Community in the ETNP dominated by picoplankton, of which 60-80% was represented by prokaryote biomass (Prochloroccocus and other cyanobacteria), was not rate-limited under natural conditions. Therefore, low F-v/F-m values associated with PSII down-regulation and inherent. of specific phytoplankton species are not indicative of nutrient stress in picoplankton-dominated environments such as the ETNP off Mexico. These sources of variability that are not directly associated with the nutritional status of the phytoplankton community should be taken into account when using F-v/F-m as a diagnostic tool for nutrient limitation.

KW  - CORROSION
AB  - In this paper, the reliability analysis and residual life assessment model of gas pipelines with multiple corrosion pits are established. Aiming at the simulation evaluation of small failure probability of gas pipelines, a new method for reliability analysis and residual life assessment of gas pipelines with multiple internal corrosion pits is proposed, which is called the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo subset simulation (HMC-SS) method. Compared with the traditional MCS (Monte Carlo simulation) algorithm, the HMC-SS method has the advantages of less sampling, low cost, and high accuracy. And compared with the random walk SS method, the HMC-SS method can analyze the state space more efficiently and achieve faster convergence. In this paper, the HMC-SS method is applied to the reliability analysis and residual life assessment of gas pipeline engineering, and the sensitivity analysis of the random parameters affecting the failure probability of the pipeline is carried out. The results show that the corrosion rate, the depth of corrosion defects, and the wall thickness of the pipeline have great influence on the residual life of the pipeline, while the yield strength, working pressure, and the length of corrosion pits have no obvious influence on the failure probability and residual life of the pipeline. The analysis shows that the proposed HMC-SS method can be used as a reasonable tool for failure assessment of natural gas pipelines affected by corrosion to determine the remaining life of the pipeline system. This method provides a reliable theoretical basis for the integrity management of the gas pipeline.

AB  - Adaptations are frequently made by hospital administrators, clinicians, and other staff to accommodate for the changing populations of state psychiatric hospitals in the United States. For example, many mental health treatments, including evidence-based treatments, have been adapted for use with forensic patients and in forensic settings. Specialized ethical guidance has also been developed for working with forensic patients. However, there is a gap in the literature regarding the logistics of safely conducting therapeutic interventions and assessments in environments that were not designed for forensic populations, or individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities as primary diagnoses. Further, most training programs for mental health clinicians do not include specialized training for working in inpatient psychiatric settings, including state psychiatric hospitals, and so it often falls to training sites to provide that foundational knowledge. The current manuscript describes the context and practical challenges mental health clinicians across disciplines may face in providing services to clients in inpatient settings. Recommendations for maximizing safety of all persons, while simultaneously attempting to protect the privacy of the patient in the course of clinical interventions, and maintain the integrity of clinical interventions administered in inpatient settings, are also discussed. Recommendations are based on a review of the literature and the professional experiences of the interdisciplinary research team in several state hospitals across the United States. The target audience of this manuscript includes clinicians and trainees who are new to working in inpatient psychiatric settings, and seasoned clinicians adjusting to the changing demographics of state psychiatric hospitals.

AB  - Dynamic calibration is an essential way to characterize the measurement performance of pressure sensors under dynamic environment. However, it is difficult to guarantee the reliability of calibration results because the calibration signal is inevitably contaminated by noises. In this paper, a coarse-to-fine denoising method is proposed to improve the quality of calibration signals based on adaptive mode decompositions. Firstly, variational mode decomposition (VMD) is used to decompose the calibration signal into several band-limited intrinsic mode functions (BLIMFs). The optimal mode number is estimated based on their center frequency spacing and mutual information of BLIMFs. The coarsely denoised signal is then reconstructed by the relevant BLIMFs based on the ringing energy loss ratio indicator. Subsequently, the coarsely denoised signal is decomposed as a series of IMFs with empirical mode decomposition (EMD). By introducing a clustering indicator named as comprehensive weighted correlative degree, the ringing and trend IMFs are extracted for obtaining the finally denoised result. The performance of the proposed method is validated by both simulated and actual dynamic calibration signals. Results show that the SNR of denoised result with the proposed method is 33.91, which is obviously larger than that obtained by EMD (SNR = 25.03) and VMD (SNR = 22.67) for simulated signal. Furthermore, comparative experiments also demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the existing approaches in both denoising ability and signal integrity. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Collection of tissue samples for archiving is not a routine practice at each autopsy. This step may be omitted on purpose (e.g. identification of the corpse by DNA is not needed) or omitted by the pathologist. Tissue samples for pathological examination are commonly excised at the autopsy and frequently offer the only biological material available for DNA analysis.
   The objective of this study was evaluation of formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens as a potential source of DNA templates for kinship analysis, depending on a tissue type and a fixation method.
   The study material comprised of 10 sets of five FFPE specimens of cadaver tissue (a total of 50 samples) with no signs of decomposition - an archival material of the Department of Forensic Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw: three sets dating 2001 and three sets dating 2010 - fixed with 10% formaldehyde, four sets dating 2018 - fixed with buffered formaldehyde.
   DNA was extracted using Maxwell (R) 16 Forensic Instrument (Promega). PowerQuant System (Promega) 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) were used for DNA quantitation and integrity assessment. DNA templates were amplified with use of PowerPlex Fusion6C (Promega) and genotyped in 3500XL Genetic Analyzer.
   Based on our data, DNA degradation in 10% formaldehyde-fixed tissues increased, while the specimens fixed with buffered formaldehyde yielded good quality DNA. Based on DNA quantitation results and saturation of the PowerPlex Fusion6C profiles, the lung tissue and the brain tissue were the best sources of DNA templates out of all the specimens investigated regardless of the fixative used.

AB  - Economic growth has traditionally been attributed to the accumulation of human and physical capital and the increased productivity arising from technological innovation. The quest to attract physical capital led to the design and implementation of policies and the building of institutions by governments of developing countries to create a congenial investment environment to attract foreign investors. The multinational corporations operating in these developing countries take advantage of these policies to profit from these countries in terms of capital through both legal and fraudulent activities. For governments and stakeholders to be able to fight this menace of illicit financial outflow, there is a need for a comprehensive scrutiny of the quality of governance indicators that enhance the activities of these multinational companies. Therefore, this study seeks to explore the influence of cross-country indicators of governance on the illicit financial flow from developing countries. This study is based on secondary data (panel) derived from the Global Financial Integrity, World Development Indicators and Worldwide Governance Indicators. The total number of developing countries included in the analysis is 139, and 1562 observations are included. Using the multilevel estimation approach, the study finds that regulatory quality has a negative and significant influence on the illicit financial flow, while government effectiveness, corruption and FDI net inflows have a significant positive effect. This finding calls for developing countries to design and implement sound policies, build effective and accountable institutions, control corruption and enhance regulatory quality to control this issue.

AB  - This study comprehensively analyzes the environmental risk of heavy metals (HMs) in the dewatering process of dredged sediment. First, the toxicity leaching capacity, total content, and chemical speciation of the HMs (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mo, Pb, Sb, Sr, Tl, Zn) in dewatered sediment were determined using toxicity characteristic leaching procedure and modified Community Bureau of Reference sequential extraction procedure. The ecotoxicity and environmental risk of the HMs were then evaluated based on sediment quality guidelines, geoaccumulation index, enrichment factor, potential ecological risk, and risk assessment code. The results showed that flocculants reduced the ecological risk of Hg and Mo in sediment, and promoted the transformation of Mo, Sb, and Tl from the biologically active fraction to the more stable fraction. The transformation percentages of Mo, Sb, and Ti were 45.15%, 50.59% and 76.44%, respectively, after chitosan (CTS) treatment, and 64.55%, 31.75% and 99.90%, respectively, after cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM) treatment. CTS reduced the potential risks of bioavailable As, Cr, Cu, Mo, Sb, and Hg by (at most) 46.28%, 45.92%, 43.01%, 100.00%, 44.45%, and 39.69%, respectively, whereas CPAM decreased the ecotoxicity of bioavailable Cd, Co, and Zn by (at most) 27.49%, 16.10%, and 20.89%, respectively. According to the result of principal component analysis, the main factors affecting the environmental risk of HMs in sediment dewatering were nitrogenous organic compounds (mainly protein substances), fulvic acid substances, and minerals. The most essential factor was nitrogenous organic compounds, which accounted for 89.52% of the total variance. Chemical speciation was apparently more suitable for environmental risk assessment of sediment dewatering than total content. This study provides an important basis for controlling the environmental risk of HMs caused by sediment dewatering.

AB  - The aim of our research was to trace changes in the composition and structure of diatom communities and diatom ecological traits under the influence of drought. We also examined the impact of drought on the results of the Polish Diatom Index (IO) and the Indice de Polluo-Sensibilite? Spe?cifique (IPS), which is the most commonly used diatom index in European countries, as a preliminary assessment of how changes in watercourses during climate-change related drought affect environmental quality assessments. The studies were conducted on watercourses in an area devoid of significant anthropogenic pressures, i.e., the protected area of Magura National Park in the Carpathian Mountains, Poland. The chemical parameters and ecological condition based on diatom analysis permitted classifying the watercourses as having good and very good status. Drought periods had a significant impact on some water parameters such as electrolytic conductivity, pH, nitrogen compounds, chlorides, and sulfates. Changes in the composition and structure of diatom communities were observed; however, in larger watercourses they were much smaller than those in smaller watercourses of a higher order. During drought periods, the share of diatoms from the motile guild and terrestrial species increased significantly in the streams. Drought had positive effects on the increased biodiversity of benthic diatom communities. Diatom index values showed statistically significant differences between drought-free and drought periods. In the present study, the differences observed were small enough to not affect the final ecological status classification. However, given the significant increase in the abundance of motile species, which are often classified as indicators of pollution, we believe that in watercourses with lower ecological statuses the occurrence of motile taxa related to drought symptoms (e.g., low water current, formation of depository habitats) could have had an impact on lowering statuses during ecological water assessments.

AB  - The elemental composition of phytoplankton is a critical factor for primary production and nutrient recycling. The increase anthropogenic nutrient input into freshwater ecosystems is affecting phytoplankton assemblage structure and its stoichiometry. Reservoirs of South China generally show low level of phosphate and it is not clear how phytoplankton can grow and occasionally bloom in such conditions. Therefore, an indoor experiment was conducted to investigate the response of natural phytoplankton communities to 25 levels of supplied nitrogen to phosphorus ratios (N/P), arising from the combination of 5 levels of N and P. Our aim was to check the effects of absolute and relative N and P on phytoplankton growth and structure. We assumed that Alkaline Phosphatase (APA) provides a way to use alternative P resource. Our hypotheses include: (1) phytoplankton stoichiometry would be in homeostasis (sensu Sterner & Elser, 2002) under different N and P treatments; (2) absolute nutrient values rather than its ratio matters for phytoplankton assemblage; and (3) phytoplankton cell size declines to lower P requirements facing P limitation. Results showed that phytoplankton in this subtropical reservoir use alternative P sources via APA to support its growth. The absolute values of N and P instead and not their ratios were important for phytoplankton. The N/P ratio cannot be a reliable indicator for nutrient limitation or phytoplankton shift. During the fast-growing phase, their elemental contents were not sensitive to supplied nutrients, and their stoichiometry was more constrained compared to that in slow-growing phase. The plasticity of cellular stoichiometry was mainly due to the variations of cellular P. Phytoplankton stoichiometry was weakly homeostatic, and this mechanism provides a strategy to keep growth relatively stable in a variable nutrient environment.

AB  - The paper assesses sustainable development dynamic aspects in territorial management. The relevance of the work is determined by the importance of territorial management based on the principles of sustainable development and the need to scrutinize the socio-environmental and economic potential of the territories in order to create conditions for the full use of available resources without compromising the quality of life of current and future generations. Methodologically, the study rests on the concept of sustainable development, resource theory of economic systems, the dynamic approach to management, and the methodology for constructing integrated indicators and systems of indicators. In the article, the methods of analysis, synthesis, systematization, statistical observation, etc. are applied. Having shown the advantages and disadvantages of integral indicators found in Russian and foreign studies, the authors focus on selecting official statistics data that adequately reflect the state of the economy, population health and welfare, as well as natural capital. An increase in the level of welfare and population social development, while maintaining environmental sustainability, is regarded as the criterion of sustainability. Addressing the case of the Volga macroregion, we characterize the current state of regional development and scrutinize the dynamic aspect, namely the long-term development trajectory of each of the 17 regions. The research analyzes the growth rates of sustainable development indicators for the period of 2010-2017. The study reveals significant differences in the dynamics across the regions. The Republic of Tatarstan and Nizhny Novgorod oblast demonstrate a positive trend in all the components at initially high values, while the Republic of Kalmykia shows the worst dynamics at low values. The authors conclude that the system of indicators is preferable to the integral indicator and the system for assessing the effectiveness of long-term measures of public policy and related management decisions.

AB  - Background: Monitoring of fur-bearing species populations is relatively rare due to their low densities. In addition to catch data, trappers' experience provides information on the ecology and status of the harvested species. Fisher (Pekania pennanti) and American marten (Martes americana) are mustelids that are sensitive to forest management and therefore considered to be ecological indicators of forest health. Fisher populations have increased in eastern North America since the early 2000s and this could have resulted in a northeastern extension of the species' range and increased overlap with marten's range. Moreover, habitats of both species are subject to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. The objective of this study was to document the knowledge held by local trappers in the northern area of sympatry between fisher and marten to identify factors that could explain variation in populations of the two species and interactions between them.
   Method: Forty-one semi-directed interviews with Indigenous and non-Indigenous trappers in the Abitibi-Temiscamingue region of western Quebec (Canada), at the northern limit of the overlapping ranges of the two mustelid species.
   Results: Trappers highlighted the lack of exclusivity of marten and fisher to coniferous forests, although marten is more closely associated with them than is fisher. Fisher apparently also takes advantage of open environments, including agroforestry systems. Moreover, climate change increases the frequency of freeze-thaw events that cause the formation of an ice crust on the snow surface, which favors fisher movements.
   Conclusion: The fisher was identified as a competitor and even a predator of the marten. Furthermore, the fisher is less affected than the marten by forest management, and it also seems to benefit from climate change to a greater extent.

AB  - The threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) concept is well established for assessing human safety of food-contact substances and has been reapplied for a variety of endpoints, including carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and reproductive toxicity. The TTC establishes an exposure level for chemicals below which no appreciable risk to human health or the environment is expected, based on a de minimis value for toxicity identified for many chemicals. Threshold of toxicological concern approaches have benefits for screening-level risk assessments, including the potential for rapid decision-making, fully utilizing existing knowledge, reasonable conservativeness for chemicals used in lower volumes (low production volume chemicals (e.g., < 1 t/yr), and reduction or elimination of unnecessary animal tests. Higher production volume chemicals (>1 t/yr) would in principle always require specific information because of the presumed higher exposure potential. The TTC approach has found particular favor in the assessment of chemicals used in cosmetics and personal care products, as well as other chemicals traditionally used in low volumes. Use of the TTC in environmental safety is just beginning, and initial attempts are being published. Key questions focus on hazard extrapolation of diverse taxa across trophic levels, importance of mode of action, and whether safe concentrations for ecosystems estimated from acute or chronic toxicity data are equally useful and in what contexts. The present study provides an overview of the theoretical basis for developing an ecological (eco)-TTC, with an initial exploration of chemical assessment and boundary conditions for use. An international collaboration under the International Life Sciences Institute Health and Environmental Sciences Institute has been established to address challenges related to developing and applying useful eco-TTC concepts.

AB  - Uncontrolled tourism development threatens the fragile equilibrium of coastal ecosystems and compromises the environmental services they provide. The beach system especially loses its functionality as a place of leisure and recreation when its natural elements represent a risk for the health of beach users. In Colombia, the lack of a reliable and regular information system that can be used for controlling the environmental and sanitary conditions of their beaches presents a challenge for local environmental authorities. In this consideration, a partnership of local universities was formulated in 2010, known as the Research Program of Environmental Quality in Touristic Beaches of the Colombian Caribbean. Within this research program, the ICAPTU index was designed to assess the Beach Environmental Quality (BEQ) through a mathematical expression that weights a set of parameters used as indicators of ecosystem, sanitary and recreational quality. The update of the model, originally formulated in 2002, included the definition of a new set of environmental parameters, their prioritization, normalization and aggregation into three conceptual indicators. During the model's calibration, the research program has gathered a dataset from six tourist beaches in the cities of Santa Marta, Cartagena and Riohacha, allowing the definition of guidelines for designing monitoring platforms. As a result, a new scheme of the index has been defined that integrates the three dimensions that compose the concept of BEQ (sanitary, ecosystem and recreational). Among the conclusions, the research program has determined that the environmental quality of tourist beaches is a function of the beach performance as an ecosystem and a satisfier of human needs. The updated ICAPTU model is proposed as a technical instrument that summarizes the criteria for analyzing environmental parameters, presenting environmental authorities with a management tool more effective than the comparison of data with the governmental norms, which might be considered outdated or incomplete.

AB  - Major oil spills can have long-term impacts since oil pollution does not only result in acute mortality of marine organisms, but also affects productivity levels, predator-prey dynamics, and damages habitats that support marine communities. However, despite the conservation implications of oil accidents, the monitoring and assessment of its lasting impacts still remains a difficult and daunting task. Here, we used European shags to evaluate the overall, lasting effects of the Prestige oil spill (2002) on the affected marine ecosystem. Using delta N-15 and Hg analysis, we trace temporal changes in feeding ecology potentially related to alterations of the food web due to the spill. Using climatic and oceanic data, we also investigate the influence of North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, the sea surface temperature (SST) and the chlorophyll a (Chl a) on the observed changes. Analysis of delta N-15 and Hg concentrations revealed that after the Prestige oil spill, shag chicks abruptly switched their trophic level from a diet based on a high percentage of demersal-benthic fish to a higher proportion of pelagic/semi-pelagic species. There was no evidence that Chl a, SST and NAO reflected any particular changes or severity in environmental conditions for any year or season that may explain the sudden change observed in trophic level. Thus, this study highlighted an impact on the marine food web for at least three years. Our results provide the best evidence to date of the long-term consequences of the Prestige oil spill. They also show how, regardless of wider oceanographic variability, lasting impacts on predator-prey dynamics can be assessed using biochemical markers. This is particularly useful if larger scale and longer term monitoring of all trophic levels is unfeasible due to limited funding or high ecosystem complexity.

Nevertheless, there is a lack of suitable ecological knowledge to develop basic conservation and management guidelines for this ecosystem service. Essential questions, such as how well the abundance of frugivorous animals predicts seeding function in different ecosystems and how anthropogenic landscape heterogeneity conditions the role of dispersers, remain poorly answered. In three temperate ecosystems, we studied seed dispersal by frugivorous birds in landscape mosaics shaped by human disturbance. By applying a standardized design across systems, we related the frequency of occurrence of bird-dispersed seeds throughout the landscape to the abundance of birds, the habitat features, and the abundance of fleshy fruits. Abundance of frugivorous birds in itself predicted the occurrence of dispersed seeds throughout the landscape in all ecosystems studied. Even those landscape patches impoverished due to anthropogenic disturbance received some dispersed seeds when visited intensively by birds. Nonetheless, human-caused landscape degradation largely affected seed-deposition patterns by decreasing cover of woody vegetation or availability of fruit resources that attracted birds and promoted seed dispersal. The relative role of woody cover and fruit availability in seed dispersal by birds differed among ecosystems. Our results suggest that to manage seed dispersal for temperate ecosystem preservation or restoration one should consider abundance of frugivorous birds as a surrogate of landscape-scale seed dispersal and an indicator of patch quality for the dispersal function; woody cover and fruit resource availability as key landscape features that drive seedfall patterns; and birds as mobile links that connect landscape patches of different degrees of degradation and habitat quality via seed deposition.

AB  - Harmful algae can have profound economic, environmental, and social consequences. As the timing, frequency, and severity of harmful algal blooms (HABs) change alongside global climate, efficient tools to monitor and understand the current ecological context of these taxa are increasingly important. Here we employ environmental DNA metabarcoding to identify patterns in a wide variety of potentially harmful algae and associated ecological communities in the Hood Canal of Puget Sound in Washington State, USA. Tracking trends of occurrence in a series of water samples over a period of 19 months, we find algal sequences from genera with harmful members in a majority of samples, suggesting that these groups are routinely present in local waters. We report patterns in variants of the economically important genus Pseudo-nitzschia (of which some members produce domoic acid; family Bacillariaceae), as well as multiple potentially harmful algal taxa previously unknown or poorly documented in the region, including a cold-water variant from the genus Alexandrium (of which some members produce saxitoxin; family Gonyaulacaceae), two variants from the genus Karlodinium (of which some members produce karlotoxins; family Kareniaceae), and one variant from the parasitic genus Hematodinium (family Syndiniaceae). We then use data on environmental variables and the biological community surrounding each algal taxon to illustrate the ecological context in which they are commonly found. Environmental DNA metabarcoding thus simultaneously (1) alerts us to potential new or cryptic occurrences of algae from harmful genera, (2) expands our knowledge of the co-occurring conditions and species associated with the growth of these organisms in changing marine environments, and (3) suggests a pathway for multispecies monitoring and management moving forward.

AB  - Currently many pollutants enter the seas and oceans as a result of anthropogenic activities such as agriculture, fishing, shipping, etc. Many of these chemical compounds cause serious damage to marine and terrestrial ecosystems because they tend to accumulate and begin their activity as pollutants once their useful cycle has ended. Therefore, there is growing concern about how to act to stop the increase in environmental pollution. Some of these compounds that began to accumulate in the environment since the last century are well known by the scientific community and are widely called persistent pollutants. This group includes polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and heavy metals, among others. However, other compounds that have not been considered as contaminants have appeared recently. These are the so-called emerging pollutants, which involve a long list of compounds including drugs, hormones, antimicrobials, plasticizers, UV filters, etc. Through the study of different organisms, the presence of these pollutants in natural environments as well as the harmful effects they cause to the biota present in said media are being deeply investigated. Two of the aquatic model organisms used as bioindicators in the different studies for this purpose are reviewed here: the sea cucumber of the genus Holothuria and the common sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus that share the fact of being, both, edible echinoderms. This review could be used to make people aware of the damage it is causing through the irresponsible management of natural resources, so that they serve to launch a series of measures that allow recovering the original conditions of the different ecosystems.

AB  - Mining activity is an important cause of physicochemical, biological, and landscape alterations. Several studies involving disturbed environments confirmed the modification of demographic traits in anuran populations. The current study aimed to assess the effects of natural and artificial surface waters associated with a fluorite mine on the body size and life history traits of Rhinella arenarum and Boana cordobae. Sampling was done in three areas: stream running on granitic rock, with medium natural fluoride content (CN); stream running on metamorphic rock, with low natural fluoride content (LV); and artificial decantation pond (DP) with large variation in physicochemical parameters. Adult individuals of the two anuran species were measured and weighed, and their body condition (BC) was calculated. Life history traits were assessed using the skeletochronology method. Individuals from DP weighed significantly heavier than individuals from streams. The BC index in R. arenarum was higher at LV, whereas in B. cordobae, a higher index was obtained at both LV and DP. The average age differs between sites in B. cordobae but not in R. arenarum. Growth coefficient was higher for altered environment in both species (CN; DP), whereas the estimated SVLmax was slightly higher in populations from less disturbed sites (LV). The most affected species was B. cordobae. Therefore, for future studies, it is important to know the biology of sentinel species because not all amphibian species may respond in the same way to similar disturbances. Differences obtained in life history traits may be explained by the lack of survival of larger/older individuals or compensatory growth, required to balance fast growth with the costs on survival at more disturbed sites.

AB  - Ecosystem economic valuation has been proposed as an appropriate approach to account for natural resources. More specifically, the tangible and intangible values of ecosystem services (ES) associated with specific land uses/land covers have been appreciated by practitioners both in academia and policy arenas as useful accounting means for land use management. This paper explored how the outcomes from ecosystem valuation studies could be utilized to improve the current agricultural land pricing system in Vietnam's Mekong Delta. By reviewing the relevant legal documents, we highlighted some limitations of the current land pricing system and suggested reforms utilizing ES valuation results. By comparing the results of ES evaluation study for the prawn-rice rotational crops (PRRC) areas with their regulated agricultural land prices, one major limitation of the current pricing method was identified, that being its inability to capture the actual land profitability resulting from the classification system of lands which currently typifies PRRC areas as annual crops, similar to rice and vegetables. However, to register a dedicated classification for PRRC can be time consuming and costly due to the complexity of the relevant legal framework. As a response, an ES-based index to account for the differences between PRRC and other cultivation systems without having to thoroughly reform the legal system was recommended. Our recommendation is essentially in harmony with the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources Decree, which allows for the application of correction factors according to local conditions. As a methodological contribution, this attempt to include ES information in legal systems could facilitate the better standardization of core terminologies and practical guidelines, two of the most important challenges to the mainstreaming of the ES concept in decision making and policy planning.

AB  - Due to the shortage of fresh water and extensive discharge of wastewater into aquatic environment, the present research work aimed to evaluate the wastewater treatment efficiency of an integrated tire-derived rubber media-fixed biofilm reactor (TDR-FBR) and sand column filter (SCF) at low temperature (5 degrees C-15 degrees C). Wastewater was continuously re-circulated in TDR-FBR for 48 h at a flow rate of 80 +/- 2 mL/min for 120 d. A substantial reduction in the average concentration of different pollution indicators, such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5, 92.7%), chemical oxygen demand (COD; 93.8%), total dissolved solids (TDS, 77.2%), phosphates (PO43-, 42.2%), sulfates (SO42-, 74.9%), nitrates (NO3-, 39.7%), nitrites (NO2-, 31.7%) and fecal coliform (80.9%) was achieved during 48 h of operational period through TDR-FBR. Subsequently, TDR-FBR effluent was further passed through SCF system and more than 95% of BOD5 and COD removal was observed. While, 83.6%, 46.6%, 77.8%, 55.9%, 65.8% and 99.4% reductions were noticed in TDS, PO43-, SO42-, NO3-, NO2- and pathogenic indicators, respectively. However, increase in the concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) from 1.5 to 6.9 mg/L was noticed after the sequential treatment in TDR-FBR and SCF system. Moreover, cytotoxicity analysis of treated effluent on brine shrimp (Artemia salina) showed that TDR media has no hazardous effects on aquatic ecosystem. It can be concluded that this hybrid TDR-FBR and SCF system has potential for large-scale applications for small communities in the developing countries.

AB  - Shallow marine ecosystems naturally experience fluctuating physicochemical conditions across spatial and temporal scales. Widespread coral-bleaching events, induced by prolonged heat stress, highlight the importance of how the duration and frequency of thermal stress influence the adaptive physiology of photosymbiotic calcifiers. Large benthic foraminifera harboring algal endosymbionts are major tropical carbonate producers and bioindicators of ecosystem health. Like corals, they are sensitive to thermal stress and bleach at temperatures temporarily occurring in their natural habitat and projected to happen more frequently. However, their thermal tolerance has been studied so far only by chronic exposure, so how they respond under more realistic episodic heat-event scenarios remains unknown. Here, we determined the physiological responses of Amphistegina gibbosa, an abundant western Atlantic foraminifera, to four different treatments control, single, episodic, and chronic exposure to the same thermal stress (32 degrees C) in controlled laboratory cultures. Exposure to chronic thermal stress reduced motility and growth, while antioxidant capacity was elevated, and photosymbiont variables (coloration, oxygen-production rates, chlorophyll a concentration) indicated extensive bleaching. In contrast, single- and episodic-stress treatments were associated with higher motility and growth, while photosymbiont variables remained stable. The effects of single and episodic heat events were similar, except for the presumable occurrence of reproduction, which seemed to be suppressed by both episodic and chronic stress. The otherwise different responses between treatments with thermal fluctuations and chronic stress indicate adaptation to thermal peaks, but not to chronic exposure expected to ensue when baseline temperatures are elevated by climate change. This firstly implies that marine habitats with a history of fluctuating thermal stress potentially support resilient physiological mechanisms among photosymbiotic organisms. Secondly, there seem to be temporal constraints related to heat events among coral reef environments and reinforces the importance of temporal fluctuations in stress exposure in global-change studies and projections.

AB  - The analysis of temporal patterns in water quality and benthic assemblages in estuaries constitutes an important methodological issue for discriminating the effects of natural and anthropogenic pressures. Temporal trends in water quality and in the subtidal benthic community over a 5-year interval in the Mondego estuary (Portugal) were investigated with the aim of assessing changes in environmental quality as a response to restoration efforts and climate variability. Particularly, we addressed the following questions: (a) Would trends in water quality and benthos behave consistently over the whole study period for the different zones of the monitoring network and indicate improvement or degradation in ecological condition? (b) Could we distinguish the effects of climate variability and restoration efforts in water quality and benthos from trend analysis results? (c) Could the response of the benthic communities and water quality be useful to guide the planning of future management actions in this system?
   Clear cause-effect relationships regarding the ecological response to restoration efforts and climate variability were indeed challenging to identify and interpret. In fact, the response of water quality and benthic communities to restoration efforts seemed to have been masked by the effects of climatic variability. Furthermore, the present study illustrated clearly the high environmental variability inherent to estuarine systems and the difficulty of clearly distinguishing natural from anthropogenic stressors, in agreement with the "Estuarine Quality Paradox". Implications for ecological quality assessment and management of the Mondego estuary and other poikilohaline systems are discussed, namely with regard to the "one-out, all-out" principle required by the European Water Framework Directive (WFD).

AB  - Benthic invertebrates are a well-established target in environmental quality status evaluations. The AMBI (AZTI's Marine Biotic Index) was developed to determine the impacts and the quality status of soft-bottom marine benthic communities. The aim of this study was investigating multivariate pattern of benthic invertebrate community and application of AMBI (AZTI's Marine Biotic Index) for determining quality of health status in Khuzestan coastal waters. Seasonal samplings were collected from eight creeks over one year study by Peterson grab sampler, beginning from October 2005. All creeks are characterized by muddy bottom. According to sensitivity to environmental stress, macrobenthic animals classified into 5 ecological groups. Among 28 identified faunal groups the most abundant groups were polychaets, molluscs, crustaceans and nematodes, respectively. Two way ANOVAs showed only seasonal significant differences in mean abundance (P<0.05) and Margalef richness index values (P<0.05), while all of studied creeks shows similar biological characters based on benthic communities. According to annual mean of AMBI value all creeks were in ecological group III with slightly polluted condition, except for Darvish that was in unpolluted category. In the present study, although the number of species initially increased, but due to appearance of dominant species such as Capitella sp. and nematods (as opportunist species), diversity values reduced. In general, according to AMBI and Biotic index values, the most creeks are classified into unpolluted and slightly polluted categories except for Zangy, Doragh and Patil in summer and also Zangy and Bihad in winter which was in moderate to heavily polluted category. Different types of exploitation, industrial and shipping activities in this area could result in unbalanced to polluted status in benthic animals (as the best indicators in sediment quality assessment) so these results can be acceptable.

AB  - Because of the difficulties involved with separating natural fluctuations in climatic variables from possible directional changes related to human activities (e.g., heightened atmospheric CO2 concentrations related to fossil fuel consumption), some researchers have focused on developing alternative indicators to detect hypothesized climate changes. It has, for example, been suggested that the locations of ecotones, transitions between adjacent ecosystems or biomes, should be monitored. It is assumed that changes in climate, especially increases in atmospheric temperature, will result in shifts in the location (altitude or latitude) of ecotones as plants respond to the newly imposed climatic conditions. In this article, we address the use of two montane ecotones, the alpine tree-line ecotone and the deciduous/Boreal forest ecotone, in monitoring global climatic change. In so doing, we 1) outline the factors that create and maintain each ecotone's position at a given location; 2) assess the projected response of the ecotones to various aspects of global warming; and 3) discuss the usefulness of both ecotones as indicators of global climate change. While it is likely that extended periods of directional climate change would bring about an altitudinal shift in the ranges of montane species and the associated ecotones, we question whether the response at either ecotone will be at a timescale useful for detecting climate change (a few decades) owing to disequilibrium related to upslope edaphic limitations and competitive interactions with established canopy and subcanopy individuals. Further, limitations related to the prediction of the complex and interacting effects of projected changes in temperature, precipitation and site water balance on photosynthetic processes of plant species raise uncertainties about the expected responses of both ecotones.

AB  - The impact of climate change on the mountain ecosystems globally can be better sensed through monitoring of structural shifts in vegetation vis-`a-vis livelihoods of mountain communities. Here, we report the distribution pattern of an ecologically vital species, Arnebia euchroma, and its co-occurring communities. The species is considered as an indicator of ecosystem health and is linked to human wellbeing in mountain systems in the Trans-Himalayan range of Ladakh. Through intensive field surveys for two years, we recorded 127 species belonging to 41 families associated with A. euchroma across habitats, majority of which are herbaceous with perennial life cycle. The hemicryptophytes were found to be the most dominant followed by the geophytes and phanerophytes. Highest average importance value index (IVI) was found to be for A. euchroma (37.93) as against very low IVI values for 41.73% of the total flora, which reflects the need for conservation. Our generalized linear model results demonstrate the role of A. euchroma in maintaining and enhancing the maturity index of the communities with increasing altitude. The low maturity index of the communities indicates the influence of anthropogenic pressures and rather harsh environmental conditions. The Principal Component Analysis and Cluster Analysis correlated the investigated communities geographic features and microclimates to identify the dominant taxa and unique species assemblages in the local flora. Since A. euchroma and its associated assemblages are linked to local livelihoods in Ladakh, yet quite vulnerable to climate change, the importance of our results for future research and long-term monitoring in the Trans-Himalayan mountains is discussed.

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests that ecosystem responses to increases in atmospheric aridity, a hallmark of climate change, exhibit multiple thresholds across global drylands. However, it is not clear whether aridity thresholds exist in the relationships between ecosystem functions and remotely sensed indicators (RSIs). Assessing this is important because these empirical relationships underpin the statistical models commonly used to estimate ecosystem functioning across large spatial scales, which typically uses data from RSI. We evaluated how the relationships between nutrient cycling index (NCI; a proxy of ecosystem functioning) measured in situ and RSI [albedo and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)] change along with a wide aridity (1 - [precipitation/potential evapotranspiration]) gradient in Patagonia (Argentina). For doing so, we used field-based NCI data from 235 ecosystems that were surveyed twice (2008-2013 and 2014-2018). Three aridity thresholds were identified when evaluating the RSI-NCI relationships. The first threshold was found around aridity values ranging from 0.44 to 0.60, while the second and third were concentrated around aridity values of 0.69 and 0.82, respectively. These results indicate that RSI-NCI relationships changed drastically along aridity gradients, and these thresholds should be considered when evaluating ecosystem functions using RSI. In addition, we also found that the relationships between NCI and albedos were not significant around aridity values of 0.82. These results were consistent across sampling dates. Our findings imply that empirical models of the RSI-NCI relationship employing only albedos/reflectance as inputs are not reliable under the most arid conditions and can be used to improve the effectiveness of the use of RSI to monitor and predict changes in ecosystem functioning across large environmental gradients in drylands.

AB  - Urban green spaces can provide many types of ecosystem services for residents. An imbalance in the pattern of green spaces leads to an inequality of the benefits of such spaces. Given the current situation of environmental problems and the basic geographical conditions of Xi'an City, this study evaluated and mapped four kinds of ecosystem services from the perspective of equity: biodiversity, carbon sequestration, air purification, and climate regulation. Regionalization with dynamically constrained agglomerative clustering and partitioning (REDCAP) was used to obtain the partition groups of ecosystem services. The results indicate that first, the complexity of the urban green space community is low, and the level of biodiversity needs to be improved. The dry deposition flux of particulate matter (PM2.5) decreases from north to south, and green spaces enhance the adsorption of PM2.5. Carbon sequestration in the south and east is higher than that in the north and west, respectively. The average surface temperature in green spaces is lower than that in other urban areas. Second, urban green space resources in the study area are unevenly distributed. Therefore, ecosystem services in different areas are inequitable. Finally, based on the regionalization of integrated ecosystem services, an ecosystem services cluster was developed. This included 913 grid spaces, 12 partitions, and 5 clusters, which can provide a reference for distinct levels of ecosystem services management. This can assist urban managers who can use these indicators of ecosystem service levels for planning and guiding the overall development pattern of green spaces. The benefits would be a maximization of the ecological functions of green spaces, an improvement of the sustainable development of the city, and an improvement of people's well-being.

AB  - Marine environmental status can be assessed through the study of bio-indicator species. Here, we monitor natural environmental stress by the occurrence of morphologically abnormal planktonic foraminiferal specimens from a suite of surface sediments in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. We also compare Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) abnormality observations from sapropel S1-derived sediments in the Aegean, Libyan and Levantine basins, since they provide a direct record of a natural stress experiment that took place over past time scales. At initial sapropel deposition levels, we observe increased growth asymmetry in Globigerinoides ruber twinned and twisted individuals, possibly associated with eutrophication and anoxia. In modern material, a range of malformations and aberrant morphologies from slight deformity with smaller or overdeveloped chambers to more severe deformity with abnormally protruding or misplaced chambers, distorted spirals, and double tests is also observed, as a result of the hypersaline, oligotrophic and oxygen-depleted nature of the Mediterranean Sea water column. Overall, we highlight the current use of the relative abundance of abnormal tests as a bio-indicator for monitoring natural stress, especially the occurrence of twin specimens as indicative of high-salinity stress conditions, and further illustrate the necessity to map both their spatial and temporal distribution for accurate paleoenvironmental reconstructions. Such an approach presents the advantage to rapidly provide information over wide spatial and temporal scales, extending our ability to monitor a wide variety of environments (from coastal to the open-sea). However, further investigations should extend this approach to test the robustness of our findings in a number of similar oceanic settings.

AB  - Phenanthrene, a Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon, remains adsorbed to sedimentary particles in aquatic environments. It affects mainly benthic organisms, and is considered potentially genotoxic. In ecotoxicology, species of Chironomus Meigen, 1803 are widely known as bioindicators of the effects of chemicals on aquatic organisms. This study investigates the effects of phenanthrene on the size of the head capsule of Chironomus sancticaroli Strixino & Strixino, 1981 larvae after chronic (eight days) exposure, and DNA damage after acute (96 hours) and chronic exposure (eight days), under laboratory conditions. DNA damage, evaluated using the alkaline comet assay, detected effects for both exposure periods, indicating that phenanthrene is toxic for C. sancticaroli. For the acute exposure, we analyzed five concentrations of phenanthrene, between 0.16 mg. l(-1) and 1.60 mg. l(-1), detecting significant differences (Kruskall-Wallis test with p <= 0.05) in the degree of DNA damage in all groups. These effects were not dose-dependent. For the chronic exposure, two concentrations (0.16 mg. l(-1), 0.83 mg. l(-1)) were analyzed, and DNA damage was observed in both. Again, the effects were not dose-dependent. This indicates that phenanthrene is genotoxic to larvae of C. sancticaroli even at low concentrations. The size of the head capsule was evaluated after chronic exposure to concentrations of 0.16 mg. l(-1) and 0.83 mg. l(-1). Significant differences (ANOVA test with p <= 0.05) were detected in the two concentrations, and a reduction in the size of the larval head capsule was observed. This suggests that phenanthrene causes delay in larval development. These results indicate that phenanthrene affects the development of and causes DNA damage in C. sancticaroli larvae. Therefore, we suggest that C. sancticaroli can be used as a biological indicator for environmental contamination with phenanthrene.

AB  - Dung beetles are useful as indicators in conservation and global warming studies owing to their specialized regional and local distribution patterns. However, existing South African data are inadequate for indication at the necessary degree of spatial resolution. To improve the database, Survey methods need to Lie designed according to the spatial and temporal factors that influence dung beetle diversity. Across four major climatic regions, there are seven principal species distribution centres for dung beetles in which activity is influenced primarily by difference, in rainfall seasonality and temperature, Across these regions, generic endemism is largely concentrated around the coastline and in montane areas. The conservation status of endemic genera is discussed. At a local scale, spatial diversity is influenced primarily by soil, vegetation and dung type. Maximum local diversity of dung beetles is observed after rainfall and decreases as surface conditions become warmer and drier. After workshop discussions, a coarse-grained, asymmetrical gradsect survey grid has been designed according to vegetative, climatic and land-usage gradients across South Africa. It is suggested that each survey point across these regional gradients should comprise a quarter-degree square in which local ecological gradients should be surveyed for invertebrates, Baited pitfall trapping is an easy method to provide quantitative data for dung beetles across such environmental gradients. Lining up each catch on a tray provides a relatively quick way to compare the specimens, identify the species present, and provide a quantitative assessment of species abundance. Data collection may be conducted on one or more occasion., to accommodate seasonal and daily variation in species occurrence. This exercise could identify localities suitable for ecotourism reserves representative of the variation in ecotypes across the country, particularly, in coastal, natural grass and wooded regions, where many invertebrate taxa are endangered by habitat fragmentation including some rare dung beetle species.

AB  - Pesticide applications in agricultural crops often comprise a mixture of plant protection products (PPP), and single fields face multiple applications per year leading to complex pesticide mixtures in the environment. Restricted to single PPP, the current European Union PPP regulation, however, disregards the ecological risks of pesticide mixtures. To quantify this additional risk, we evaluated the contribution of single pesticide active ingredients to the additive mixture risk for aquatic risk indicators (invertebrates and algae) in 464 different PPP used, 3446 applications sprayed and 830 water samples collected in Central Europe, Germany. We identified an average number of 1.3 different pesticides in a single PPP, 3.1 for complete applications often involving multiple PPP and 30 in stream water samples. Under realistic worst-case conditions, the estimated stream water pesticide risk based on additive effects was 3.2 times higher than predicted from single PPP. We found that in streams, however, the majority of regulatory threshold exceedances was caused by single pesticides alone (69% for algae, 81% for invertebrates). Both in PPP applications and in stream samples, pesticide exposure occurred in repeated pulses each driven by one to few alternating pesticides. The time intervals between pulses were shorter than the 8 weeks considered for ecological recovery in environmental risk assessment in 88% of spray series and 53% of streams. We conclude that pesticide risk assessment should consider an additional assessment factor to account for the additive, but also potential synergistic simultaneous pesticide mixture risk. Additionally, future research and risk assessment need to address the risk from the frequent sequential pesticide exposure observed in this study. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The groundwater cycle pattern in the arid and semi-arid regions is drastically affected by both natural condition changes and human activities, resulting in serious eco-geological environmental problems. This paper selected the south edge of the Junggar basin as a pilot area for the basin-scale assessment of groundwater renewal capacity. Assessment indicator system was first established, assessment units were then constructed, and the Analytic Hierarchy Process method was used to identify the weights of the assessment indicators. The first three indicators are natural recharge ratio, groundwater residence time, and balance ratio between groundwater recharge and exploration, respectively. Two types of environmental assessment models, including the comprehensive index model and the fuzzy comprehensive model, were used and the results determine that low-lying intermountain areas and alluvial-proluvial piedmont plains have stronger groundwater renewal capacity, whereas that of the alluvial plain is much weaker. Second, at the typical watershed scale, the Manasi watershed was adopted as the study area, and numerical simulation method was used to assess the groundwater renewal capacities of intermountain low-lying land and the pediment alluvial-proluvial plain. They are found to have renewal periods of about 66.95 years and 25.05 years, respectively. These values are favorably compared to the results of isotopic analysis, which is corresponding to 46 years and 30 years, respectively. At last, four schemes were put forward to improve the regulation and storage capacity in different segment of Manasi River watershed. The results not only provide key guidance for reasonable groundwater resource exploitation and eco-environmental protection, but also offer a model for sustainable groundwater utilization for similar northwestern districts in China or other world similar districts.

AB  - Research Highlights:This research provides an application of a model assessing the naturalness of the forest ecosystem to demonstrate its capacity to assess either the deterioration or the rehabilitation of the ecosystem through different forest management scenarios.Background and Objectives:The model allows the assessment of the quality of ecosystems at the landscape level based on the condition of the forest and the proportion of different forest management practices to precisely characterize a given strategy. The present work aims to: (1) verify the capacity of the Naturalness Assessment Model to perform bi-directional assessments, allowing not only the evaluation of the deterioration of naturalness characteristics, but also its improvement related to enhanced ecological management or restoration strategies; (2) identify forest management strategies prone to improving ecosystem quality; (3) analyze the model's capacity to summarize the effect of different practices along a single alteration gradient.Materials and Methods:The Naturalness Assessment Model was adapted to theAbies balsamea-Betula papyriferaforest of Quebec (Canada), and a naturalness assessment of two sectors with different historical management strategies was performed. Fictive forest management scenarios were evaluated using different mixes of forestry practices. The sensitivity of the reference data set used for the naturalness assessment has been evaluated by comparing the results using data from old management plans with those based on Quebec's reference state registry.Results:The model makes it possible to identify forest management strategies capable of improving ecosystem quality compared to the current situation. The model's most sensitive variables are regeneration process, dead wood, closed forest and cover type.Conclusions:In theAbies balsamea-Betula papyriferaforest, scenarios with enhanced protection and inclusion of irregular shelterwood cuttings could play an important role in improving ecosystem quality. Conversely, scenarios with short rotation (50 years) could lead to further degradation of the ecosystem quality.

AB  - 1. Small hydropower projects ( SHPs) are promoted as environmentally benign alternatives to larger dams; however, the impacts of SHPs have been poorly studied, especially in tropical developing countries, where their growth is being encouraged. 2. This study assessed the impacts of two SHPs on freshwater fish communities in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot of India. Two dammed and one undammed tributary of the Netravathi River, having similar stream order, elevation, and surrounding land- use types, were identified as test and control sites respectively. Streamgeometry, water chemistry, and fish assemblages were compared across upstream, dewatered, anddownstreamlocationcategorieswithin andacross the threestreams. 3. Flow alterations induced by SHPs affected the dewatered river stretches most severely. Stream wetted width and depths diminished drastically in dammed dewatered segments, and consequently this region was characterized by elevated water temperature and reduced dissolved oxygen. 4. Fish species composition varied significantly between dammed and undammed sites, across the upstream, dewatered, and downstream location categories. Dammed segments had lower fish species richness, diversity, and endemicity, and were dominated by eurytopic species ( adapted to lentic conditions), unlike the control site, which was dominated by rheophilic species ( adapted to flowing waters). Regression analyses indicated that fish species richness in dammed streams increased with distance from the dam in the upstream direction. 5. The SHPs were found to have severe impacts on stream geometry, water chemistry, and aquatic biota, especially in the dry season. 6. Given the ambitious targets of planned SHP growth, most of which are within ecologically fragile regions, changes in SHP operations and policies are proposed to enable the conservation of river fish diversity. These include mandatory environmental impact assessments, conserving undammed headwater streams in regulated basins, maintaining adequate environmental flows, and implementing other mitigation measures.

AB  - The Water Framework Directive (WFD) provides the legal basis for water management in the European Union (EU). Twelve years after it was passed, all but five EU Member States had phytobenthos assessment methods for rivers, whilst nine had methods for lakes. Most are based on diatoms, although a few are supplemented by evaluations of non-diatoms and some include macroalgae as part of parallel macrophyte assessments. Norway is the exception, with assessment based on non-diatom algae alone. Over half of all states have methods based wholly or partly on weighted average metrics developed before the onset of the WFD, with nine choosing the Indice de Polluosensibilite Specifique. Such metrics generally have high correlations with the predominant nutrient or organic pollution gradient and, as such, represent pragmatic solutions to ecological status assessment. However, their widespread use raises questions about what, exactly, ecological status' means. Strong relationships with chemical pressure gradients may be a mixed blessing as pressure gradients are often composed of several intercorrelated variables, making it difficult to disentangle correlation and causation in the absence of ecophysiological studies of individual species. Moreover, the focus on strong relationships with chemical gradients means that most phytobenthos metrics describe the scale of hazard at a site rather than the risk posed to other trophic levels and to ecosystem services. This first generation of phytobenthos assessment tools may be inadequate when catchment managers need guidance on remediation strategies for particular water bodies. A second generation of assessment tools, focused on the fitness of the phytobenthos as part of aquatic ecosystems, rather than just as indicators of chemical conditions, is needed if the goal of good ecological status around Europe is to be achieved.

AB  - Striking progress has been made on conceptual and methodological aspects linking species traits to community and ecosystem responses to environmental change. However, the first step when using a trait-based approach (i.e., choosing the adequate traits reflecting species response to a given environmental driver) deserves much more attention. The first broad comparative studies, using worldwide datasets, have identified a number of traits that are, for example, good indicators of plant responses to water and nutrient availability, or good indicators of plant species defense against herbivory and plant effects on litter decomposition. Due to the successful explanation of global patterns of trait variation and the relatively easy measurements, some functional traits have become widely used. However, it is starting to be questioned whether the status of such "fashionable traits" is always justified; especially considering that particular traits might be the result of underlying traits that respond to distinct environmental factors. Some global trade-offs between traits reflecting contrasting resource use strategies do not hold under changing environmental conditions. Therefore, the choice of traits to up-scale responses of individuals to communities and ecosystems should be based on their adequacy for a specified ecological context. Here, we present a framework that helps identifying objective criteria for the choice of functional traits for studies on community assembly and ecosystem processes and services. This framework comprises five steps: 1) identification of the main environmental drivers; 2) identification of the relevant physiological processes allowing species to cope with the environment; 3) selection of traits that are involved in such physiological processes; 4) validation of the select traits at community level and; 5) evaluation of possible consequences for ecosystem processes/services.

AB  - In Hawaii, coral reefs occur across a gradient of biological (host abundance), climatic (sea surface temperature anomalies) and anthropogenic conditions from the human-impacted reefs of the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) to the pristine reefs of the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI). Coral disease surveys were conducted at 142 sites from across the Archipelago and disease patterns examined. Twelve diseases were recorded from three coral genera (Porites, Montipora, Acropora) with Porites having the highest prevalence. Porites growth anomalies (PorGAs) were significantly more prevalent within and indicative of reefs in the MHI and Porites trematodiasis (PorTrm) was significantly more prevalent within and indicative of reefs in the NWHI. Porites tissue loss syndrome (PorTLS) was also important in driving regional differences but that relationship was less clear. These results highlight the importance of understanding disease ecology when interpreting patterns of disease occurrence. PorTrm is caused by a parasitic flatworm that utilizes multiple hosts during its life cycle (fish, mollusk and coral). All three hosts must be present for the disease to occur and higher host abundance leads to higher disease prevalence. Thus, a high prevalence of PorTrm on Hawaiian reefs would be an indicator of a healthy coral reef ecosystem. In contrast, the high occurrence of PorGAs within the MHI suggests that PorGAs are related, directly or indirectly, to some environmental co-factor associated with increased human population sizes. Focusing on the three indicator diseases (PorGAs, PorTrm, PorTLS) we used statistical modeling to examine the underlying associations between disease prevalence and 14 different predictor variables (biotic and abiotic). All three diseases showed positive associations with host abundance and negative associations with thermal stress. The association with human population density differed among disease states with PorGAs showing a positive and PorTrm showing a negative association, but no significant explanatory power was offered for PorTLS.

AB  - The critical load approach to emission reductions has become an important element of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP). The steady state mass balance approach (SSMB) is the most widely used method in Europe for estimating critical loads, typically applied to forest ecosystems on mineral soils in conjunction with a base cation to aluminium (Bc:Al) ratio using a default critical limit of 1.0. The 'typical' approach has been expanded in this paper by: inclusion of a broader range of natural and semi-natural receptor ecosystems; inclusion of multiple chemical criterion for each receptor; and an attempt to include organic soils (peatlands). Critical loads of acidity were estimated for the Republic of Ireland using four receptor ecosystems (coniferous forest, deciduous forest, natural grasslands and moors and heathlands) and seven chemical criteria. The dominant chemical criteria, in the determination of critical loads, were based on a critical pH limit for mineral soils or a critical pH shift in relation to pristine conditions for organic soils. Approximately 68 and 26% of the final distribution of critical loads were estimated using these criteria, respectively. The 5th-percentile critical loads of acidity were more sensitive than those previously estimated for Ireland due to the inclusion of organic soils. Furthermore, coniferous ecosystems had the lowest critical loads due to the high percentage occurring on organic soils, and the removal of base cations through harvesting. The results demonstrate that it may be more appropriate to use multiple criteria and receptors to ensure adequate protection of biological indicators. However, it is important that appropriate critical limits are chosen to protect the biological indicators and receptor ecosystems from long-term damage. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - There is a need for research into bioindicators of stress in threatened plant communities such as coastal wetlands. Land subsidence, diversion of sediment, and salt water intrusion produce stresses associated with waterlogging, elevated salinity, and nutrient depletion, Temporal and spatial environmental variation (sell redox potential, interstitial water salinity, pH, ammonium and phosphorus, and cation and trace metal concentrations) was analyzed near Lake de Cade, Louisiana, in a brackish marsh which is a mosaic of healthy plant communities interspersed with areas where wetland loss is occurring. Environmental variation was related to indicators of stress in Spartina patens, which included variables derived from the adenine nucleotide levels in plants, leaf spectral reflectance, leaf proline concentrations, and shoot elongation. In a comparison of burned and unburned sites, streamside and inland marsh, and along a salinity gradient, among-site differences were found in spectral reflectance and adenine-nucleotide-related indicators. Although it was difficult to relate a single causal environmental variable to the response of a specific indicator, spectral reflectance in the visible light range responded to salinity or to elements borne in seawater; and adenine-nucleotide indices were sensitive to nutrient availability, The ability of indicators to detect plant responses changed during the growing season, suggesting that they were responding to the changing importance of different environmental factors, In addition, some reflectance indicator responses occurred along salinity gradients when salinity differences were less than those that were found to have ecologically meaningful effects in greenhouse experiments. A multivariate numerical approach was used to relate environmental variation with indicator responses. We concluded that factors which in combination cause the degradation and loss of Louisiana wetlands produce environmental conditions that are only subtly different from those in vigorously growing marsh communities.

AB  - Southern Mediterranean lagoons are among the more vulnerable systems regarding human activities (e.g. agriculture, tourism, urbanization) leading to eutrophication. We analyse the relationship of water-birds with locally measured or modelled environmental variables (nutrient load, fish production, jellyfish blooms) related with this process, in the Mar Menor lagoon (Murcia, SE Spain), and discuss the potential value of birds as indicators of the trophic status of the wetland. We use GLMs to relate the biomass of the five most abundant and representative waterbird species to these variables, accounting for the potential influence of external factors affecting their population at higher biogeographical scales. A significant effect of such factors was only found for Great Cormorant, which biased the positive response of the piscivore guild to nutrient load (NLD). Red-breasted Merganser appeared relatively insensitive to nutrient enrichment, although declined in the long term. The remaining species responded positively. NLD being a significant predictor of their biomass when a 2-year lag was allowed, although this variable alone had a low explanatory power except for the Coot. When homogeneous temporal phases were defined, grebes could be identified as early warners of eutrophication, and Coot as late-stage ones. The increase of piscivores along a period of declining fish catches could reflect a shift in fish community composition or structure that favours their feeding preferences. The interactive role of jellyfish, buffering temporally the loading of nutrients, may also be related to these changes. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose With reference to the methodology of Prof Choudhry in his book "Tawhidi Epistemology and its Applications: Economics, Finance, Science, and Society" in 2014, in a different context, this study aims to present the conceptual fundamental of Islamic finance investment, where investment decisions are governed by Divine law and Islamic jurisprudence, followed by the empirical nature of real-world issues where investment decisions are governed by only financial indicators, using the Amman Stock Exchange as a case study. Design/methodology/approach As pointed out by Raderbauer (2011), research and industry initiatives mainly focus on environmental measures while ignoring the economic and socio-cultural dimension of sustainability. Recognizing the importance of a holistic understanding to define sustainable business practices for the accommodation industry. Financial markets are no exception; moral and values either coming from secular or religious understanding help to examine relationships between attitudes and actions, as well as differences in attitudes and actions related to the business' characteristics. In business, ethical considerations apply to a broad list of virtues that companies, their managers and employees customarily seek to adopt. These include, but are not limited to, the encouragement of honesty, integrity and efficiency, as well as diversity and communication skills. One of the most common sources of ethical considerations is religion. In these cases, religious doctrine imparts a sense of applied ethics, where one considers what right conduct is, how to live a life pleasing to the Divine and how one should treat him/herself and others in accordance with those teachings. Again, as ethical considerations is a broad philosophical concept, it can apply to any situation where the person ponders the nature of right and wrong, how to recognize the difference and the meaning those conclusions carry for everyday life. Findings It can be concluded that the overall the quantitative and qualitative statistics showed that accommodation business manager's decision has had a very little positive attitude toward sustainability and the implementation of sustainable business practices in ASE financial transaction, no matter what classification, type of business, ownership or size of business. Only rules and regulations govern the attitude and behavior when making financial transactions with profit is the main target. Moral indicators could not be seen throughout the analysis and test used to achieve objectives of the study at hand. One can imagine that the combined two factors together "Moral-Material" in implementing financial transactions will produce a more beneficial outcome. Achieving a material and holistic objective will produce an optimum situation, which can contribute positively to sustainable development. Originality/value Islamic alternatives to traditional investment tools have been driven by the fact that such tools do not conform to the Islamic general principles of the Shari'ah (Usmani, 2002). There has been a growing desire to have funds in which profits are not based on riba or interest, which is prohibited in Islam. Muslims deem that profit should come because of efforts; this is not the case in interest-dominated investments. In addition, there is a desire to have investment portfolios, which are morally purified. Thus, investments in companies that are not in compliance with the Shari'ah are not permitted and are eliminated from the portfolio.
   To ensure compliance with the forgoing condition, Shari'ah advisory boards whose role is mainly to give assurance that money is managed within the framework of Islamic laws govern Islamic mutual funds (Hassan, 2001; Hassan, 2002). On the other hand, dealing with the applied part, the paper will deal with a case study from Jordan (Amman Stock Exchange), where, code of ethics is issued by virtue of the provisions of Article 26 (e) of the Securities Law No. 23 of 1997. The Amman Stock Exchange operates as an exchange for the trading of securities. The company lists securities such as equities and bonds. Its activities include providing enterprises with a means of raising capital by listing on the exchange; encouraging an active market in listed securities based on the determination of prices and trading; providing facilities and equipment for trading the recoding of trades and publication of prices; monitoring and regulating market trading; and coordinating with the Jordan Securities Commission as necessary. The company's activities also include ensuring compliance with the law, fair market and investor protection; setting out and enforcing a professional code of ethics.

AB  - A large body of literature addresses the role of science in environmental impact assessment (EIA) but less attention has been given to the views of practitioners themselves. In this research a survey of 31 EIA practitioners in Western Australia was undertaken to determine their perceptions of the quality and importance of science in EIA. The survey results are compared with previous theoretical, empirical, and survey studies of the role of science in EIA. Interview questions addressed the role of science in impact prediction, monitoring activities, mitigation and management, and EIA decision-making. It was clear from the interviews that many practitioners are satisfied with the quality of science currently used in EIA, but do not believe that it is given sufficient importance in the process. The quality and importance of science in the predecision stages of EIA was rated higher than in the postdecision stages. While science was perceived to provide the basis for baseline data collection, impact prediction, and mitigation design, it was seen to be less important during decision-making and ongoing project management. Science was seen to be just one input to decision-makers along with other factors such as sociopolitical and economic considerations. While time and budget constraints were seen to limit the scientific integrity of EIA activities, pressure from the public and regulatory authorities increased it. Improving the scientific component of EIA will require consideration of all these factors, not just the technical issues.

AB  - Background: Measures to quantify changes in the pace of biological aging in response to intervention are needed to evaluate geroprotective interventions for humans. Previously, we showed that quantification of the pace of biological aging from a DNA-methylation blood test was possible (Belsky et al., 2020). Here, we report a next-generation DNA-methylation biomarker of Pace of Aging, DunedinPACE (for Pace of Aging Calculated from the Epigenome). Methods: We used data from the Dunedin Study 1972-1973 birth cohort tracking within-individual decline in 19 indicators of organ-system integrity across four time points spanning two decades to model Pace of Aging. We distilled this two-decade Pace of Aging into a single-time-point DNA-methylation blood-test using elastic-net regression and a DNA-methylation dataset restricted to exclude probes with low test-retest reliability. We evaluated the resulting measure, named DunedinPACE, in five additional datasets. Results: DunedinPACE showed high test-retest reliability, was associated with morbidity, disability, and mortality, and indicated faster aging in young adults with childhood adversity. DunedinPACE effect-sizes were similar to GrimAge Clock effect-sizes. In analysis of incident morbidity, disability, and mortality, DunedinPACE and added incremental prediction beyond GrimAge. Conclusions: DunedinPACE is a novel blood biomarker of the pace of aging for gerontology and geroscience.

AB  - The current study aimed to examine the responses of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) taxa to the major physicochemical (temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand) and hydro-morphological (stream width, water depth and current speed) factors affecting their abundance, richness and distribution. Immature insects of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera were sampled as well as water during eight seasonal surveys conducted at 19 stations in Martil basin from spring 2016 to spring 2018. In total, 10,370 individuals belonging to 22 families, 36 genera and 48 species were collected during the study period. Baetidae, Perlodidae and Hydropsychidae were the most abundant and diversified families, respectively for each order. Significant biotypological differences of the EPT assemblages were observed among stream types relating to their spatial distribution, hydrological features and pollution levels. However, species richness and abundance were positively correlated with DO, pH and altitude and negatively correlated with temperature and the other parameters measured. The taxonomic list compiled following our recent investigations includes six new species for the Martil basin enabling them to expand their range in northern Morocco. Furthermore, the biogeographical analysis shows that EPT taxa from Martil basin are essentially composed of Mediterranean elements, with a high proportion of Ibero-Maghrebian endemic species. Moreover, this study provides a basis for further studies to analyze the distribution patterns of EPT taxa through multi-dimensional approaches.

AB  - Concrete is the material most produced by humanity. Its popularity is mainly based on its low production cost and great structural design flexibility. Its operational and ambient loadings including environmental effects have a great impact in the performance and overall cost of concrete structures. Thus, the quality control, the structural assessment, the maintenance and the reliable prolongation of the operational service life of the existing concrete structures have become a major issue. In the recent years, non-destructive testing (NDT) is becoming increasingly essential for reliable and affordable quality control and integrity assessment not only during the construction of new concrete structures, but also for the existing ones. Choosing the right inspection technique is always followed by a compromise between its performance and cost. In the present paper, the ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) method, which is the most well known and widely accepted ultrasonic concrete NDT method, is thoroughly reviewed and compared with other well-established NDT approaches. Their principles, inherent limitations and reliability are reviewed. In addition, while the majority of the current UPV techniques are based on the use of piezoelectric transducers held on the surface of the concrete, special attention is paid to a very promising technique using low-cost and aggregate-size piezoelectric transducers embedded in the material. That technique has been evaluated based on a series of parameters, such as the ease of use, cost, reliability and performance.

KW  - SUPPORT
AB  - Maintaining integrity and validity with online assessment is a significant issue that is well documented. Overt policies encouraging educators to adopt e-Learning and implement digital services coupled with the dramatic change in the education system in response to the challenges posed by COVID-19, has furthered the demand for evidence-based approaches for the planning and delivery of assessments. This study employed the Assessment Design Decision Framework (ADDF), a theoretical model that considers key aspects of assessment design, to retrospectively investigate from a multi-stakeholder perspective the assessments implemented following the rapid transition to remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. One-to-one semi-structured interviews were conducted with faculty and students from the Colleges of Pharmacy, Medicine and Health Sciences. After inductive and deductive thematic analysis three major themes were identified. These reflected on the impact of sudden transition on assessment design and assessment plan; changing assessment environment; and faculty-student assessment related interactions which included feedback. The use of a comprehensive validated framework such as ADDF, to plan assessments can improve validity and credibility of assessments. The strengths of this study lie in the innovative adoption of the ADDF to evaluate assessment design decisions from both an educator and student perspective. Further, the data yielded from this study offers novel validation of the use of ADDF in circumstances necessitating rapid transition, and additionally identifies a need for greater emphasis to be attributed to the significance of timeliness of the various activities that are advocated within the framework.

AB  - Here we explore the dose-dependent response of the tropical fish tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) to intraperitoneal injection of benzo[alpyrene (BaP) at doses of 0 (carrier control), 1, 10, 100 and 1000 molar BaP Kg-1 Hepatic ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity showed a bell-shaped dose dependent response curve, where the highest injected BaP dose caused enzyme inactivation. Activities of hepatic catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) increased at the highest dose relative to the carrier control group. Lipid peroxidation (LPO), serum-sorbitol dehydrogenase (s-SDH) and DNA damage in blood cells were higher for all BaP doses when compared to the carrier control group. At high dosage, the production of BaP metabolites was paralleled by induced activity of the antioxidant enzyme SOD, and high levels of DNA damage in blood cells. In a similar way, high LPO was concomitant to elevated s-SDH in the bloodstream, suggesting that lipid peroxidation caused the loss of membrane integrity and leakage of s-SDH from hepatocytes into the bloodstream. These biomarkers were also positively co-correlated. The results demonstrate the potential use of a suite of biomarkers for tambaqui living in contaminated tropical aquatic environments. In particular, we recommend the analysis of DNA damage in blood cells, as this was highly correlated with all other biomarkers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Moths exhibit different levels of fidelity to habitat, and some taxa are considered as bioindicators for conservation because they respond to habitat quality, environmental change, and vegetation types. In this study, we verified the effect of two phytophysiognomies of the Cerrado, savanna and forest, on the diversity distribution of moths of Erebidae (Arctiinae), Saturniidae, and Sphingidae families by using a hierarchical additive partitioning analysis. This analysis was based on two metrics: species richness and Shannon diversity index. The following questions were addressed: 1) Does the beta diversity of moths between phytophysiognomies add more species to the regional diversity than the beta diversity between sampling units and between sites? 2) Does the distribution of moth diversity differ among taxa? Alpha and beta diversities were compared with null models. The additive partitioning of species richness for the set of three Lepidoptera families identified beta diversity between phytophysiognomies as the component that contributed most to regional diversity, whereas the Shannon index identified alpha diversity as the major contributor. According to both species richness and the Shannon index, beta diversity between phytophysiognomies was significantly higher than expected by chance. Therefore, phytophysiognomies are the most important component in determining the richness and composition of the community. Additive partitioning also indicated that individual families of moths respond differently to the effect of habitat heterogeneity. The integrity of the Cerrado mosaic of phytophysiognomies plays a crucial role in maintaining moth biodiversity in the region.

AB  - Maps of mangroves have often been limited to showing the presence or absence of mangrove trees and seldom have studies shown an important indicator of ecosystem integrity such as vegetation cover. Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) is used to assess ecosystem health, land cover and carbon stocks, hence accurately measuring FVC is an important task for scientists and land managers. Many methods have been proposed to measure FVC and simple linear models are commonly used. We created an experiment that allowed us to: 1) acquire very detailed hyperspectral imagery (1 mm pixel size) from a simulated mangrove forest, 2) measure the effect of water depth on FVC estimations, and 3) compare the relationship of eight spectral bands and indices with FVC using linear and non-linear models. After acquiring the imagery we corrected for dark signal and a white reference, performed spectral and spatial resampling, and created linear and non-linear models across four pixel sizes. Our results suggest that 1) linear and beta models have similar performance across all pixel sizes; 2) Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAW), Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index2 (MSAVI2) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) perform better than the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDV), and, 3) our models perform better at fine pixel sizes than coarse scales. We tested our results on high-resolution satellite imagery with similar results and, therefore, recommend using SAW, EVI or MSAVI2 when predicting FVC instead of NDVI.

AB  - One of humanity's major challenges of the 21st century will be meeting future food demands on an increasingly resource constrained-planet. Global food production will have to rise by 70 percent between 2000 and 2050 to meet effective demand which poses major challenges to food production systems. Doing so without compromising environmental integrity is an even greater challenge. This study looks at the interdependencies between land and water resources, agricultural production and environmental outcomes in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), an area of growing importance in international agricultural markets. Special emphasis is given to the role of LAC's agriculture for (a) global food security and (b) environmental sustainability. We use the International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT)-a global dynamic partial equilibrium model of the agricultural sector-to run different future production scenarios, and agricultural trade regimes out to 2050, and assess changes in related environmental indicators. Results indicate that further trade liberalization is crucial for improving food security globally, but that it would also lead to more environmental pressures in some regions across Latin America. Contrasting land expansion versus more intensified agriculture shows that productivity improvements are generally superior to agricultural land expansion, from an economic and environmental point of view. Finally, our analysis shows that there are trade-offs between environmental and food security goals for all agricultural development paths.

AB  - Major accidents involving dangerous substances pose a serious threat to the health and safety of local communities and the environment, as well as to the integrity and development of infrastructure where Seveso establishments are located. In some cases, the disastrous effects may affect larger, even cross-border areas At European level, there are continuous efforts to develop land-use planning policies and regulations to reduce consequences and to prevent future accidents from happening. Hence, research in this field comes to support the current actions and strategies of the European Commission to improve the capacity of the EU Member States to cope with and respond to the identified risks through effective prevention, preparedness and response measures. In Romania, the Seveso establishments are mostly located in or very close to urban areas. This paper analyses vulnerability in case of two different accident scenarios (explosion and toxic dispersion) in Targu-Mures, a city hosting one of the largest Seveso upper-tier establishments in Romania. The approach starts with exposure analysis - the first step in the process of vulnerability analysis - which identifies all the elements at risk, be they social (population, medical facilities, schools), environmental (protected areas, water bodies) or economic (transport infrastructure, buildings, utility and water supply networks, fuel or food storage facilities). Following the exposure analysis, vulnerability is assessed based on indicators selected in such way so that they cover the entire range of social, economic, environmental aspects, as well as the existing response capabilities in case of a major accident.

AB  - The study of fauna through long-term surveys is important in unveiling how temporal patterns shape the structure of communities in tropical habitats. The butterfly assemblage of the subtropical Atlantic Forest may be considered highly diverse and shows changes in diversity and composition over time, highlighting the importance of long-term inventories. This work assessed temporal diversity patterns in the distribution and composition of butterfly assemblages in an Atlantic Forest site in southern Brazil using combined data from three years of standardized sampling with entomological nets, increasing the knowledge on this group in the Neotropics for monitoring and conservation. The butterfly fauna was analyzed in terms of richness, abundance, and composition. The inventories reached 401 species, with 14,442 butterfly individuals sampled. All the diversity parameters evaluated show significant differences between the first year of sampling compared to the second and third years. The latter had higher values of richness and abundance, followed by the first and second years. Hesperiidae was the richest family, followed by Nymphalidae and Lycaenidae, indicating a good representation of the assemblage as a whole. The results of this work are important for developing conservation programs in the Atlantic Forest and other forested environments in the neotropics, especially concerning reliable diversity assessments for the monitoring and management of protected areas. Decision making and public policy might also benefit from knowledge on temporal patterns of diversity regarding the maintenance of native habitats and integrity of biomes and their associated fauna.

AB  - The ecological indicator system (EIS) is widely used. It is vital to develop a scientific and rational EIS for practical application. Assessment of an EIS's effectiveness is important to understand the gaps between practical indicators and indicators that are considered theoretically ideal. In this paper we develop a conceptual method to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of a practical EIS by comparing it with the ideal EIS that is considered perfect by using three assessment indices: linkage, coverage and representation degrees. Linkage degree reveals the relevance of individual indicators to the ideal system. Coverage degree shows the integrity of the practical indicator system compared with the ideal system. Representation degree is the ultimate goal of the quantitative assessment and can detect the gap and overlap between the practical indicator system and the ideal one. Case study on the Ecological Province Construction Indicators (EPCI) proved that our conceptual method is useful to assess the effectiveness of a practical EIS. Compared with an ideal EIS, the EPCI has a high linkage and coverage degree but biased representation. Although the practical EIS covers most of the objectives detailed in the Fujian eco-province construction documents, many social development indicators are overlooked, including ecological culture and green consumption. Using the quantitative method will improve the practical application of an EIS by detecting its redundancy and weakness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fast and accurate monitoring of chemical and microbiological parameters in drinking water is essential to safeguard the consumer and to improve the understanding of treatment and distribution systems. However, most water utilities and drinking water guidelines still rely solely on time-requiring heterotrophic plate counts (HPC) and plating for faecal indicator bacteria as regular microbiological control parameters. The recent development of relative simple bench-top flow cytometers has made rapid and quantitative analysis of cultivation-independent microbial parameters more feasible than ever before. Here we present a study using a combination of cultivation-independent methods including fluorescence staining (for membrane integrity, membrane potential and esterase activity) combined with flow cytometry and total adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) measurements, to assess microbial viability in drinking water. We have applied the methods to different drinking water samples including non-chlorinated household tap water, untreated natural spring water, and commercially available bottled water. We conclude that the esterase-positive cell fraction, the total ATP values and the high nucleic acid (HNA) bacterial fraction (from SYBR (R) Green I staining) were most representative of the active/viable population in all of the water samples. These rapid methods present an alternative way to assess the general microbial quality of drinking water as well as specific events that can occur during treatment and distribution, with equal application possibilities in research and routine analysis.

AB  - At the macroscopic scale, brittle media such as rocks, concretes or ceramics can be seen as homogeneous continua. However, at the microscopic scale, these materials involve sophisticated microstructures that mix several phases. Generally, these microstructures are composed of a large amount of inclusions embedded in a brittle matrix that ensures the cohesion of the material. These materials generally exhibit complex mechanical behaviors resulting from the interactions between the different phases of the microstructure.
   As a result, the macroscopic behavior of these media may be predicted considering an accurate knowledge of their microstructures. This paper proposes a model to study the impact of diffuse damage resulting from thermal expansion mismatch between the mixed phases. This type of damage (which is not catastrophic for the integrity of two-phase materials) may appear when heterogeneous materials are subjected to thermal cycles.
   This phenomenon involves a high amount of discontinuities and can not be tackled easily with the Finite Element Method (FEM). The Discrete Element Method (DEM) naturally accounts for discontinuities and is therefore a good alternative to the continuum approaches. However, the difficulty with DEM is to perform quantitative simulations because the mechanical quantities are not described in terms of the classical continuum theory. This study describes the approach used here to tackle this fundamental difficulty. The results given by the proposed approach are finally compared to experimental observations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We advocate that to secure ecological integrity, conservation should focus on the spatial overlap of biodiversity occurring for multiple taxonomic groups. However, there is a lack of practical and accurate measures for estimating the continuous distribution of insect diversity across spatially complex landscapes to enforce such conservation strategy. Based on 216 sampling data, we predicted plant and caterpillar species density across a 200 km(2) spatially complex tropical dry forest landscape, using reflectance values of a SPOT 5 satellite imagery, altitude values from a digital elevation model, and improved model performances by incorporating spatial autocorrelation of residuals with kriging interpolation. Spectral information and altitude accounted for 21-25 % of the variation in woody plant species density whereas the residuals did not demonstrate spatial autocorrelation. In contrast, spatial dependence accounted for most of the 35 % explained variation in caterpillar species density; the spatial range of autocorrelation of caterpillars however, is broader than that of host plants. Although local species density of caterpillars and woody plants showed no relationship, specific areas demonstrated an overlap of species diversity for both taxonomic groups. Spatially explicit models with spectral information as predictors have the potential to estimate woody plant species density across complex landscapes, while the prediction of caterpillar diversity could be done analyzing the spatially autocorrelated structure of species density, implicating labor intensive, but not necessarily costly sampling schemes.

AB  - Viruses can be used as vectors for transient expression of proteins in plants but frequently foreign gene inserts are not maintained stably over time due to recombination events. In this study the hypothesis was that the choice of plant host affects the foreign gene retention level by a Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) vector expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP). To accomplish this, a novel virus vector integrity bioassay was developed based on an old concept, whereby RNA transcripts of the TBSV-GFP vector were rub-inoculated onto leaves of test plants, and at 3 days post inoculation (dpi), these leaves were used as inoculum for passage to cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), a local lesion host. Chlorotic lesions at points of virus infection were counted on cowpea at 4dpi and then the leaves were exposed to ultraviolet light to count green fluorescent foci. These tests with seven different plant species covering five families showed that the percentage of green fluorescent lesions varied on the cowpea indicator plants in a host-dependent manner. For instance, the vector was relatively unstable in Nicotiana benthamiana, tomato, bean, and spinach, but compared to those its stability in lettuce was significantly improved (similar to 3-fold). This host-dependent effect suggests that some plants may present a more suitable environment than others to support or maintain optimum levels of virus vector-mediated foreign gene expression.

AB  - In the last decade in forest-agrarian landscapes areas and territories of Russia all the more urgent becomes the problem of deterioration and preservation of protective forests, loss of effective ecological-reclamation impact on agro-ecosystems. For forest strips that are in the age stage of maturity and overrun, the most common processes of their degradation are the growth of forest edges, thinning of the upper tier and inner rows of the stand, the presence of a large number of dry and diseased trees. In the overwhelming majority, it is impossible to correct such plantations by thinning, and urgent work is needed to reconstruct them. The purpose of the research is to evaluate the methods of reconstructive logging in forest belts of unsatisfactory composition and condition for growth indicators and the pathology of pedunculate oak cultures. Studies conducted in 1986-2018 on the territory of the Stone Steppe (Talovsky district of the Voronezh region). The object of research was the reconstructed unsatisfactory in composition and state of the stand 9-row forest shelter strip No. 206 with the creation of pedunculate oak cultures. The plantation was created in 1948 according to the tree-shrub type of mixing: Kya - Kya- (D + Azh) - Kya- (D + Azh) -Kya- (D + Azh) -Kya - Kya, where Kya - maple american, D - English oak, Azh - acacia yellow. Its direction is from north to south. Row spacing - 2.3 m, the distance between the trees in a row - 0.7 m. Experience laid in three versions: 1 - control, forest strip in the initial state - 0.46 ha; 2 - arrangement of longitudinal corridors in the forest belt - 0.50 ha; 3 - device diagonal corridors at an angle of 30 degrees to the longitudinal axis of the forest belt - 0.38 ha. It was established that a more thorough soil preparation and favorable light conditions in diagonal corridors ensured the best growth of pedunculate oak cultures during the study period and by the age of 40, the elevation above the longitudinal corridors (western and eastern) was 18.1 and 3, 8%, and the diameter of the trunk - 40.2 and 14.8%. The maximum increments in height and diameter are observed 17-20 years. Characteristic is the lag development trees in extreme ranks relatively central series. Compliance with thinning regimes in experimental variants of pedunculate oak contributed to the presence of 76.6...93.0% viable specimens of the total number of trees. The highest value is observed in a more favorable light exposure - diagonal corridors, where their average excess, compared with the longitudinal corridors (western and eastern), is 9.4 and 5.7%. The absence of thinning (thinning) of forest crops led to an increase in the share of forest mortality in the options of experience by 5.9...7.7% of non-viable trees and partially viable, respectively, by 10.3...13.0% and 10.9...9,4%, while reducing viable trees by 26.7...31.6%.

AB  - The relevance of the research is caused by the need to expand the use of the resource base of mineral waters for balneological purposes, close to the consumer, assess the therapeutic properties of mineral waters based on a study of their operating experience and compliance with the requirements of current guidance documents. The development of this direction will allow increasing the volume and spectrum of therapeutic and preventive services using local natural mineral waters while minimizing the capital expenditures for geological exploration.
   The aim of the research is to study the structure, current state and operating experience of the Daginsky thermal mineral water field (Sakhalin Region), to assess the prospects for expanding balneological and tourist services, to develop recommendations for industrial development of the field.
   Objects: mineral thermal waters, their properties and conditions of distribution on the earth's surface and in the hydrogeological section.
   Methods: study of stock and archive documents on geological structure and hydrogeological conditions of the study area, a field survey of the current state of the field, hydrochemical testing of individual sources, a survey of mineral water consumers.
   Results. The paper introduces the geological and hydrogeological characteristics of the field of thermal mineral waters. The balneological properties of the waters in different parts of the field were determined in accordance with the relevant guidelines. The present state of use of thermal mineral waters is presented. The authors have developed the recommendations for field operation.
   Findings. The long-term operation of the Daginsky field proves high balneological efficiency of thermal mineral waters. The field is formed by mixing deep hot mineralized waters with near-surface cold and fresh groundwater. Explosive tectonics field is divided into three sections. More than 60 ascending sources of thermomineral waters are observed on the site of the field. The waters are hot, weakly and moderately mineralized, sodium chloride, bromine, iodine (Northern part) and sodium bicarbonate-sodium (Central and Southern). Balance operational reserves are approved for categories B+C-1+C-2 in the amount of 2500 m(3)/day. Water in the sources have a wide range of medical indicators for use. Currently, the field is exploited "wildly". Waters are used primarily for bathing at the springs. Attendance sources in the summer reaches 300 people/day. In winter, visiting the sources is difficult. There are good prospects for a multiple increase in the number of visits without the capital expenditure on exploration of the field. Thermal mineral waters of the deposit have a very high biological activity. Uncontrolled use of water instead of therapeutic, can lead to a negative effect. There are cases of deaths after excessively long baths in the sources. It is necessary to conduct a comprehensive study of the balneological properties of waters of various sources and to develop recommendations on the method of their use. It is also necessary to organize monitoring of sources in order to determine the time of water recovery after the visit and to develop a mode of bathing.

AB  - TIM (Threat Identification Model) is a framework for the ex ante assessment of agricultural land management sustainability at the land unit scale that identifies sources of unsustainability within agricultural land management systems. The model explicitly links defined hazards to land productivity and environmental integrity, land resource data and information, and land management practice options using expert and local knowledge on land management and its potential effects. The model was tested in the Crystal Creek Subcatchment, a narrow coastal strip of land situated in north Queensland, Australia. This area was chosen due to the expansion of the sugar industry onto increasingly marginal land in the area, which represents a threat to sustainable land use and a requirement for careful land-use planning and land management.
   TIM may be used in a relational database as a stand alone decision support system for land-management planning. Its usefulness in land-use planning is greatest when it is linked to a Geographic Information System (GIS) as shown in this paper. GIS allows TIM outputs, such as constraints to agriculture and site-specific best-management practices, to be identified in a spatially explicit manner.
   The main advantages of TIM are that it can be done ex ante, it removes the need to define sustainability assessment criteria and indicators, it utilises current understanding of the causes and effects of land degradation and how different land-management practices influence these, and links this knowledge to definite land-management options.

AB  - Minimizing and alleviating pain and distress in laboratory mice without compromising the methodologic integrity of research is a crucial goal. However, current methods for welfare assessment in mice are not well suited to cageside checks. In the present study, we developed a simple assessment tool-the time-to-integrate-to-nest test (TINT)-and evaluated its ability to identify mice with compromised welfare. To conduct the TINT, a nominal amount of nesting material is added to a mouse cage, and the nesting behaviors that occur immediately thereafter are observed. The TINT yields a positive result when a mouse integrates the new nesting material into the main nest site within 10 min; failure to interact with the nesting material is defined as a negative TINT. Our first experiment examined whether genetic background and sex are associated with differences in the likelihood of a positive TINT in unmanipulated mice. A significant effect related to mouse strain was found: C3H/HeNCrl had the lowest positive TINT rate among the 10 strains evaluated. A second experiment assessed whether results of the TINT would be altered after a painful surgical procedure, such as carotid artery injury. Despite all mice having received buprenorphine as analgesia at the time of surgery, significantly more mice had a negative TINT for 2 d after surgery than before surgery. Based on the results of the current study, additional work is needed to specifically validate the TINT in injured and noninjured subjects.

AB  - Quantitative differentiation of live cells in biosolids samples, without the use of culturing-based approaches, is highly critical from a public health risk perspective, as recent studies have shown significant regrowth and reactivation of indicator organisms. Persistence of DNA in the environment after cell death in the range of days to weeks limits the application of DNA-based approaches as a measure of live cell density. Using selective nucleic acid intercalating dyes like ethidium monoazide (EMA) and propidium monoazide (PMA) is one of the alternative approaches to detecting and quantifying viable cells by quantitative PCR. These compounds have the ability to penetrate only into dead cells with compromised membrane integrity and intercalate with DNA via their photoinducible azide groups and in turn inhibit DNA amplification during PCRs. PMA has been successfully used in different studies and microorganisms, but it has not been evaluated sufficiently for complex environmental samples such as biosolids. In this study, experiments were performed with Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 as the model organism and the uidA gene as the target sequence using real-time PCR via the absolute quantification method. Experiments with the known quantities of live and dead cell mixtures showed that PMA treatment inhibits PCR amplification from dead cells with over 99% efficiency. The results also indicated that PMA-modified quantitative PCR could be successfully applied to biosolids when the total suspended solids (TSS) concentration is at or below 2,000 mg . liter(-1).

AB  - Breeding birds and anurans (frogs and toads) in coastal wetlands of Green Bay, Lake Michigan vary dynamically with changing water levels, habitat type, and geography. We describe species assemblages over a seven-year period (2011-2017) beginning with historic low water levels followed by an increase in average lake level of 0.85 m. In general, species richness and abundance of marsh-obligate species responded positively to increasing water levels, although several species of shallow wetlands (sandhill crane, sedge wren, swamp sparrow, and American toad) showed the opposite trend. Anuran assemblages were more diverse in the middle and upper bay, coinciding with a well-established nutrient gradient from the hypereutrophic lower bay to more oligotrophic waters of the upper bay. Three marsh-obligate bird species (black tern, sandhill crane, and sedge wren) were significantly more abundant in the middle or upper bay while sora, American coot, and common gallinule were more abundant in the eutrophic lower bay. Our findings have several important implications for conservation. Inland wetlands near the coast (including diked wetlands) might play a key ecological role by providing refugia for some species during low water years. However, the importance of shallow coastal wetlands and near shore gradients of wetland habitat might be overlooked during low water years; when high water returns, these areas can become extremely productive and species-rich.

AB  - With ever increasing particle beam energies and interaction rates in modern High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments in the present and future accelerator facilities, there has always been the demand for robust Data Acquisition (DAQ) schemes which perform in the harsh radiation environment and handle high data volume. The scheme is required to be flexible enough to adapt to the demands of future detector and electronics upgrades, and at the same time keeping the cost factor in mind. To address these challenges, in the present work, we discuss an efficient DAQ scheme for error resilient, high speed data communication on commercially available state-of-the-art FPGA with optical links. The scheme utilises GigaBit Transceiver (GBT) protocol to establish radiation tolerant communication link between on-detector front-end electronics situated in harsh radiation environment to the back-end Data Processing Unit (DPU) placed in a low radiation zone. The acquired data are reconstructed in DPU which reduces the data volume significantly, and then transmitted to the computing farms through high speed optical links using 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10GbE). In this study, we focus on implementation and testing of GBT protocol and 10GbE links on an Intel FPGA. Results of the measurements of resource utilisation, critical path delays, signal integrity, eye diagram and Bit Error Rate (BER) are presented, which are the indicators for efficient system performance.

AB  - This study aimed to observe patterns in the structure of fish assemblages in streams with different levels of urbanisation, as well as, relationships of these patterns with local and regional environmental factors. We predicted that regional environmental factors would account for more assemblage variation than local regional environmental factors. Data from 10 streams in a gradient of urbanisation in Maringa County, Brazil, were used to characterize fish assemblages' and environmental factors. Discriminant function analysis was used to test differences between streams and environmental factors. Associations between the structure of fish assemblages and environmental factors in local and regional scales were observed with direct gradient analysis (CCA and pCCA) and relative's contribution quantified by inertia partition techniques. Indicator values were used to find characteristic species in streams with different impacts levels. The environmental factors and structure of fish assemblages were different in streams with different urbanisation levels in regional and local scales. In agreement with the hypothesis tested, the environmental factors as land use, hydrology, geomorphology, chemical and physical habitat characteristics pointed out strong association with structure of fish assemblages in streams with different urbanisation levels. So, the results reveal that the structure of fish assemblages is influenced by environmental factors in different spatial scales in impacted environments, suggesting that efficient management actions should be improved if environmental factors are considered in local and regional scales.

AB  - Twenty years (1993-2012) of satellite altimetry dataset, through maps of absolute dynamic topography and their derived geostrophic velocities, as well as monthly climatological maps of windstress and windstress-curl have been used to assess the oceanic variability in the western Indian Ocean region (WIO). We have performed a comparative study between the Agulhas Current Large Marine Ecosystem (ACLME) and the Somali Coastal Current Large Marine Ecosystem (SCCLME) during the current time period when significant levels of climate change related variability have been documented. In the WIO region, climate variability, and/or change are impacting the atmospheric and oceanic circulation, e.g: excessive sea surface warming and consequent air-sea heat flux exchanges in the SCCLME; and broadening and weakening of the Agulhas Current, with potential negative implication on Agulhas leakage, in the ACLME. The latter being caused by an acceleration of the mesoscale eddy field in response to changing atmospheric wind forcing conditions. Therefore, eddies need to be properly quantified, characterized and monitored if their contribution on climate is to be assessed. While four hotspot regions of enhanced mesoscale variability have been identified in the combined Agulhas Somali Currents Large Marine Ecosystem (ASCLME), the main focus of this study has been in the ACLME and in the SCCLME. The results suggest that the levels of variability in these two LMEs are controlled by different physical processes: seasonality appears to be important in the SCCLME, but conversely less important in the Agulhas LME. The census conducted on the eddy field revealed that more eddies have been formed in the ACLME than in Somali Coastal Current. The eddy mean properties have shown that the eddies in the ACLME are smaller in diameter, and higher in amplitude than those in the SCCLME. In addition, the eddies in the ACLME are maintained as coherent structures longer; have been more strongly nonlinear; and have propagated longer distances from their origins than those in the SCCLME. These indicate that the eddies in the ACLME have relatively much stronger implication on the overall retention and transport of hydrographic properties (e.g. heat and salt). Therefore, they could have stronger influence on oceanic lateral fluxes and ocean-atmosphere flux exchanges, thus may influence more strongly the environmental conditions (both in the ocean and atmosphere) in the combined ASCLME, than those in the SCCLME. Time-evolution of the eddies mean properties suggests that inter-annual changes, may have influenced the eddy field differently in the ACLME and the SCCLME: moderate correlation r = 0.6, p = 0.05 has been found between time and eddy mean radius in the ACLME, and also r = 0.6, p = 0.05 was found between time and EKE in the SCCLME. Therefore, eddy size (for the Agulhas LME) and energy content (for Somali LME) could serve as potential indicators of change in oceanographic conditions over time in these LMEs.

AB  - Carabid beetle assemblages in three environments in the Araucaria humid forest of southern Brazil. Carabidae is composed mainly by ground-dwelling predator beetles. It is the fourth most diverse group within Coleoptera, but its diversity in the Neotropical region is understudied. Here we describe and analyze the diversity of carabid beetles in a region of subtropical rain forest dominated by Araucaria angustifolia with different landscapes. Three areas were chosen in an environmental integrity gradient: primary forests, secondary forests and old Pinus plantations. Pitfall traps were taken monthly, in a total of 14 samples per area. 1733 adult carabid beetles, belonging to 18 species, were sampled. There were differences in richness and abundance between the sampled areas. The total scores followed the same tendency: primary forests (14 species/747 individuals), secondary forests (13/631) and Pinus forests (10/355). An analysis of similarity shows differences in species composition, for both areas and seasons. Galerita lacordarei was the most abundant species for all samples and seasons. Carabid species show similar responses in accordance with habitat heterogeneity and disturbance. The abundance of Galerita lacordarei was influenced by temperature, for all sampled sites. Environmental changes affect the carabid assemblages and decrease diversity, possibly interfering in local dynamics. Seasonality patterns seem to indicate an increase in individual movement during summer, probably in search of resources. It is suggested that microhabitat patchiness is probably an important factor affecting carabid beetle diversity at small spatial scales.

AB  - The distribution and invasive status of the amphibious plant Paspalum paspalodes (water knotgrass) are observed. The P. paspalodes distribution clearly shows that it is an invasive plant established in Portugal, which has never before been recorded as invasive in Portugal. The purpose of our study is to determine the various stages of invasion of this plant on a large biogeographical scale, in five basins or groups of floodplain river basins belonging to five Portuguese regions covering the principal floodplains of the south and centre of the country. The composition of the river plant community in terms of structure and species richness was obtained from a data set of 401 sites. In sonic cases, water knotgrass could be a threat for particular river flora and consequently for the integrity of the river system. In other cases, it occurs in highly degraded places, where other taxa considered as invasive plants and/or indicators of degraded ecosystems are present. The pattern of invasion of P. paspalodes is discussed in relation to risk assessment for the other river plants and compared to the North European invasion processes of P. paspalodes. We conclude that the evolution of the distribution of this predominant Portuguese water plant has to be carefully followed in some of the studied floodplains, as well as its North European distribution limits. In-depth survey should be carried out to relate the current biogeographical changes to the hypothesis of indication in climate changes.

AB  - Voluntary disclosures of sustainability information have recently received considerable attention by investors, regulators, and public companies in improving reliability and integrity of corporate reporting. We examine the association between the quantity and quality of sustainability disclosures and earnings quality in the context of corporate ethical value and culture. We posit that sustainability disclosures of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance reports are linked to earnings quality, because of the importance of both earnings quality and ESG sustainability disclosures to investors and trustworthiness of corporate reporting. We collect our sample of 35,110 firm-year observations between 1999 and 2015. Using both difference-in-difference tests and OLS regression, we find that sustainability disclosure quantity is positively associated with innate earnings quality and negatively correlated with discretionary earnings quality in mitigating managerial earnings manipulation and unethical opportunistic reporting behavior. Further tests illustrate that sustainability disclosure quality can strengthen the positive relation between innate earnings quality and sustainability disclosure quantity and mitigate the negative relation between discretionary earnings quality and sustainability disclosure quantity. Finally, additional tests suggest that the relation between earnings quality and sustainability disclosure quantity is moderated by corporate structure and prior-year sustainability performance. Our results provide policy, practical, and research implications as ESG sustainability reporting is being integrated into corporate culture and business models.

AB  - The present investigation was done to assess cytomorphologic parameters as indicators of genotoxicity as it is a simpler method and could be suggested for rapid screening of the vast range of agrochemicals used all over the world. The excessive and indiscriminate use of agrochemicals is responsible for increasing the level of pollutants in the soil environment resulting in cellular and molecular damage to the plants. The cellular damage caused manifestation of the resulting oxidative stress due to pollutants which can go up to the level of DNA. The roots of Allium cepa were treated with 0.5 mg N ml(-1) concentration of ammonium nitrate fertilizer for 3, 6, 9 and 12 h, and in mitotic preparation of their respective root, mitotic index, phase indices and the genotoxic markers viz. chromosomal aberrations and binucleate cells were observed and the data statistically analysed. A significant decrease in mitotic index and increase in abnormality percentage as compared to control was observed which increased with the treatment duration. Chromosomal aberrations like stickiness, fragmentation, precocious movement, bridges and disorientations were observed in varying frequencies. A cytomorphologic study revealed that the interphase cell volume of cells of treated roots and their respective interphase nuclear volume were reduced as compared to control. The ratio between nuclear and cytoplasmic volume has been reported to relate to cell integrity. Both these markers viz. cytomorphologic and genotoxic can be used for assessment of the toxicity of agrochemicals including fertilizer; in our study, they have revealed the cytogenotoxic behaviour of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.

AB  - There is a growing concern about the adverse effects of saltwater intrusion via tidal rivers, streams, and creeks into tidal freshwater forested wetlands (TFFW) due to sea level rise (SLR) and intense and extended drought events. However, the magnitude and duration of porewater salinity in exceedance of plant salinity stress threshold (2 practical salinity units, psu) and the controlling factors remain unclear. In this study, we developed a TFFW soil porewater salinity model, in which the feedback mechanisms between soil salinity and evapotranspiration and hydraulic conductivity were incorporated. We selected sites (upper, middle, lower tidal freshwater forest sites, and oligohaline marsh site) along the coastal floodplains of two rivers, the Waccamaw River (SC, USA) and the Savannah River (GA and SC, USA), that represent landscape salinity gradients from tidal influence of the Atlantic Ocean. The model results agreed well with field measurements and revealed that with drought-induced saltwater intrusion, the mean annual soil porewater salinity and duration of elevated soil porewater salinity (>2 psu) increased significantly compared to the normal (nondrought) condition, posing a threat to the health and ecosystem services of TFFW even in the absence of SLR. Model results also showed more severe salinity stress under drought for the lower forest sites along the two rivers, where soil salinity values have already been at or in exceedance of the 2 psu threshold.
   Plain Language Summary Tidal freshwater forested wetlands (TFFW) provide valuable ecosystem services to society including, but not limited to, carbon sequestration, water quality improvement, and habitat for critical wildlife species. However, TFFW are vulnerable to saltwater intrusion due to climate change-induced sea level rise (SLR) and extreme drought events. Salinity stress to TFFW is often reflected in elevated soil porewater salinity in exceedance of plant salinity stress threshold (2 psu). Soil porewater salinity magnitude and dynamics at sites along two coastal floodplains, the Waccamaw River (SC, USA) and the Savannah River (GA and SC, USA) exposed to drought-induced saltwater intrusion during 2008-2016 were studied using a physical and ecological process-driven soil salinity model. The mean annual soil porewater salinity and duration of elevated soil porewater salinity at TFFW sites increased significantly with drought-induced saltwater intrusion, even without SLR, compared to the normal (nondrought) condition, thus posing a threat to the health and ecosystem services in TFFW. Soil porewater salinity is an effective ecological indicator and the soil porewater salinity model can be used for predicting changes in the timing, magnitude, frequency, and duration of salinity stress to TFFW sites under future climate change.
   Key Points
   Drought-induced saltwater intrusion significantly increases soil porewater salinity in soils of tidal freshwater forested wetlands Tidal freshwater forest sites located near the tidal marsh boundary will suffer more severe salinity stress with climate change Soil porewater salinity is an effective ecological indicator for tidal freshwater forested wetland condition

AB  - A structural health assessment (SHA) methodology is developed using data acquired from structural health monitoring (SHM) system installed on long-span bridges. A set of fatigue criteria has been proposed for pre-determining the global state of the bridge structure failure due to fatigue. This involves finding the threshold of fatigue initiation, below which the rate of fatigue damage may be undetectable under current technology or it is economically unfeasible. The state-of-art for large structures corresponds to the initiation of macro-cracks caused by the accumulation of damage generated by actual service loads for the case of bridges. In what follows, consideration is given to developing fatigue crack growth criterion based on the concept of the continuum damage mechanics (CDM). Fatigue accumulative is included in the model where a fatigue limit for multi-axial stress state is considered. The proposed criterion advocates the evolution of micro-crack growth up to the stage of macro-crack formulation. Considered are the loading histories that correspond to normal traffic loading for highways and railways, incidental or accident loadings such as those caused by typhoons and effective environmental loadings. The potential sites of damage are determined are discussed. The proposed criterion is applied to analyze the fatigue damage of the Tsing Ma Bridge with online strain history data acquired by the SHM system that is permanently installed in the bridge.

AB  - The remaining historical forests are crucial for maintaining biodiversity in urban areas. However, the integrity and stability of historical forests are affected by land-use/cover change. A better understanding of these impacts can help prioritize protection and restoration. In this study, we estimated the loss of area and levels of threats and analyzed the importance of critical areas for historical forests in the built-up area of a rapidly urbanizing city-Guiyang, China. We used the threat indicator, morphological spatial pattern analysis, and probability of connectivity based on InVEST, GuidosToolbox, and Conefor software. The results based on remote sensing image classification showed that 1988.46 ha of historical forestlands was transformed into other land-use/cover types. The mean value of the threat index of all the historical forest patches increased by 33% compared to the baseline year. The area of cores and bridges, considered as key nodes and links for the connectivity of forest networks, decreased by 193.32 and 353.61 ha, respectively. Most of the critical areas with high importance values for connectivity were located in the central part of the city and were severely threatened by the surrounding areas. We recommend that effective measures be implemented to control the further loss of historical forests and to increase the connectivity and buffering capacity of the remaining forests by creating tree belts and corridors in key locations.

AB  - Most of reactor vessel internals (RVIs) have been constructed by austenitic stainless steels (ASSs) to support and protect core from high temperature coolant and radiation particles. However, if they are operated in the harsh environment for a long time, ASS materials may undergo significant changes in micro-structural features, macroscopic deformation and strengths due to age-related degradation mechanisms (ARDMs). In this study, user subroutines were developed based on material constitutive models of recently revised technical reports to reflect irradiation embrittlement, irradiation enhanced creep and void swelling behaviors. Benchmark analyses for a simple rod and detailed numerical analyses for a RVI sub-components assembly with welds were conducted via coupling the subroutines. With regard to the latter analyses, not only typical normal operating sequences but also three fuel cycles associated with specific core loading patterns were taken into account with a constant initial weld residual stress distribution. Adequacy of the subroutines was verified through analytical solutions generated from temperature and radiation damage dependent equations. Complex neutron dose, temperature and pressure profiles of the assembly were successfully determined from thermal and mechanical finite element analyses. Structural integrity assessment in terms of the ductility, embrittlement and irradiation assisted stress corrosion cracking susceptibility ratio after 40-years of operation led to acceptable in spite of the ARDMs. Contributions of factors and interaction effects were further quantified and discussed via design of experiment approach.

AB  - China's national parks adopt a resource-oriented protection and planning approach that cannot restrain the continuous landscape fragmentation and deterioration, whereas, we propose to characterise the landscape in order to protect its integrity. This paper described a hierarchical identification of landscape character types and areas in Lushan National Park and its fringes according to a refined combination of the parametric and the holistic methods in a multiscalar approach. In terms of the functional hierarchy of landscape character, we decided to order the available data sources in 'downscaling'. At the broad scale, landscape typologies were delimited by raster datasets of four natural attributes: land cover, soil, vegetation, and altitude. At the intermediate scale, landscape typologies were determined by raster datasets of six natural and cultural attributes: aspect, slope, relief amplitude, heritage density, geology and land use. At these two scales, we adopted the principal component analysis (PCA) and two-step cluster analysis in SPSS software to visualise landscape types, to modify and integrate the results obtained in the eCognition software, as well as to rectify the visualisation with manual identifications. At the detailed scale, landscape typologies were demarcated by two raster and one vector datasets of cultural attributes: building density, visual influence and time depth. We performed the visualisation and integration with a similar method except for the PCA step. This multi-scaled identification will provide a nested framework facilitating the integration of the broad Lushan region in both spatial and administrative dimensions.

AB  - Due to anthropogenic load there is a risk of area reduction of Siberian and Far Eastern species of lilies. One of the methods for preserving the native natural gene pool of Lilium is their cultivation ex situ. The research purpose involved analysis of the biomorphological features of the representatives of the genus Lilium L. in the conditions of the northern forest steppe of Western Siberia. The results of morphobiological features evaluation were obtained for the following species: L. pilosiusculum, L. regale, L. pumilum, L. pensylvanicum, L. callosum. Time of flowering and sum of positive temperatures (above 0 degrees C), effective temperatures (above +5 degrees C) and active temperatures (above +10 degrees C) were determined. They are necessary for the onset of developmental phenophases such as regrowth, budding, flowering and fruiting. The beginning of regrowth of L. pilosiusculum, L. regale, L. pumilum, L. pensylvanicum and L. callosum occurred in the first or second decades of May. Flowering started at different times: from the third decade of June to the third decade of July - L. pumilum; in June - L. pensylvanicum; from the second decade of July to the second decade of August - L. callosum; from the third decade of July to the first decade of August L. pilosiusculum; from the third decade of July to the second decade of August - L. regale. The criterion for the onset of species flowering is the sum of active temperatures typical for the region. There is a different ability of the species to fruiting, depending on hydrothermal conditions of the vegetation period. The results showed that the local flora species L. pilosiusculum had the maximum height of shoot reached more than 100 cm; while L. callosum, L. pumilum, L. pensylvanicum and L. regale had stunted shoots (less than 60 cm). L. pilosiusculum and L. regale had the maximum number of flowers in inflorescence and indicators of flower productivity. The indicator role of the main pigments of the photosynthetic apparatus (chlorophylls a and b, carotenoids) in the leaves during seasonal development was established for the first time. It was found that the most significant indicators of the physiological state of plants were the content of chlorophyll a and b, and carotenoids in the leaves. Their amount depended on the phenological phases of development. During budding, the carotenoid content increased, the concentration of chlorophyll a was greater than the concentration of chlorophyll b at all vegetation phases, the ratio between chlorophyll a and b was within the normal limits and ranged from 2.189 to 3.225 mg/g of raw weight, the value of a+b/carotenoids in species decreased by the time of fruiting. The determined changes in the pigment complex composition can be considered as indicators of the adaptation mechanism of species to environmental conditions. The obtained results are necessary for the rational use of lilies in the reintroduction work, the development of which is especially important in Siberia.

AB  - Purpose The study analyses the factors that promote pro-environmental intentions and sustainable electronic waste management among households in a developing country context. Design/methodology/approach Based on a quantitative survey, a cross-sectional study of households was conducted. Data from 652 respondents were collected using structured questionnaires and analysed with partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Findings Among the findings, environmental values was the major influencer of pro-environmental intentions, accounting for 54.8% of its variance. Whilst pro-environmental intention was hypothesised as a key predictor of sustainable waste management behaviours, results showed that sustainable e-waste management is mainly influenced by perceived behavioural control (beta = 0.546, p = 0.000), followed by pro-environmental intentions (beta = 0.302, p = 0.000). Perceived behavioural control, on the other hand, was influenced by perceived producer responsibility (beta = 0.340, p = 0.000) and facilitating conditions (beta = 0.141, p = 0.0.034). Research limitations/implications First, the study used a quantitative approach. The use of a mixed-methods approach could provide deeper insights into the determinants of sustainable e-waste management practices in a specific cultural context. Also due to the quantitative nature of the study, sustainable e-waste management was based on self-reports. Future studies may adopt longitudinal studies to validate self-reported behaviours with observation. Finally, the study does not include all constructs proposed by planned behaviour and norm activation theory. This is because the main aim of the study was to examine perceived behavioural control as an extrinsic motivator and environmental values as an intrinsic motivator to engage in sustainable waste management practices. Practical implications Waste is best managed at source, so the study recommends that producers of electronic equipment must reconsider their role in sustainable waste management, by taking physical and economic responsibility for the environmental costs of their products. Pro-environmental intentions must be encouraged; however, it is not sufficient to cause sustainable waste management behaviours. Consequently, governments must promote and encourage sustainable e-waste management among households by providing enabling policy conditions such as convenient e-waste collection points and positively reinforcing waste reduction, reuse and recycling behaviours. Also, a culture of environmental conservation should be encouraged among households. Originality/value The study explores the role of environmental values and perceived behavioural control as a source of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation to engage in sustainable e-waste management. The inclusion of facilitating conditions and perceived producer responsibility is justified, based on the call for a collective approach towards electronic waste management. The results of the study throw more light on the tri-party approach, specifically, consumers, business and government role in developing and maintaining a sustainable approach towards the management of electronic waste in Ghana. Also, the study integrates planned behaviour and norm activation based on the strong sustainability argument.

AB  - Water management in the Andarax river basin (Almeria, Spain) is a multi-objective, multi-participant, long-term decision-making problem that faces several challenges. Adequate water allocation needs informed decisions to meet increasing socio-economic demands while respecting the environmental integrity of this basin. Key players in the Andarax water sector include the municipality of Almeria, the irrigators involved in the intensive greenhouse agricultural sector, and booming second residences. A decision support system (DSS) is developed to rank different sustainable planning and management alternatives according to their socio-economic and environmental performance. The DSS is intimately linked to sustainability indicators and is designed through a public participation process. Indicators are linked to criteria reflecting stakeholders concerns in the 2005 field survey, such as fulfilling water demand, water price, technical and economical efficiency, social and environmental impacts. Indicators can be partly quantified after simulating the operation of the groundwater reservoir over a 20-year planning period and partly through a parallel expert evaluation process. To predict the impact of future water demand in the catchment, several development scenarios are designed to be evaluated in the DSS. The successive multi-criteria analysis of the performance indicators permits the ranking of the different management alternatives according to the multiple objectives formulated by the different sectors/participants. This allows more informed and transparent decision-making processes for the Andarax river basin, recognizing both the socio-economic and environmental dimensions of water resources management.

AB  - Advanced ceramics are widely used in high temperature and wear related situations due to their unique physical and chemical characteristics. With the increasing demand for ceramics, the machining techniques of ceramics become a hot and tough issue because ceramics are extremely fragile and difficult to process. Traditional mechanical machining techniques like milling, turning, and drilling are subjected to large cutting forces and heat leading to extensive tool wear and poor machining performance. Electric discharge machining (EDM) has an outstanding ability of no-contact machining brittle and hardness materials with complex shapes via generating extreme high-temperature plasma channel to melt and vaporize materials. Therefore, in this paper, the research trends of latest EDM technologies for advanced ceramic materials were comprehensively reviewed. Firstly, according to the electrical conductivity of advanced ceramics, different EDM processes were introduced in details. Secondly, the existing physical models and material removal mechanisms of EDM process of ceramics were compared and analyzed. Then the machining performance indicators, such as MRR, Ra, TWR, surface topography, and micro-structures, were respectively investigated. Additionally, the new hybrid machining techniques of EDM were presented to provide some potential for efficiently machining advanced ceramics. Eventually, this paper also discussed the challenges associated with electrical discharge machining of advanced ceramic materials, and suggested some related research areas which possibly attract significant research attentions in the future.

AB  - Introduction: Pastoral communities have a comprehensive knowledge of their environments. This knowledge was acquired through extensive observation of the local environment and continuous herding practices. Pastoralists' wisdom about their local environment and adaptation strategies to climate change is essential for sustainable development. Thus, appreciation of pastoralists' knowledge about their environment is also important for the integration of indigenous knowledge with the proper application of scientific approach to fit with the prevailing ecological potential of pastoral areas.
   Methods: Data were collected using focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and in-depth interviews. The in-depth interviews were conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire that was administered to 100 household heads with the age of above 50 years old. Respondents were randomly drawn from selected Pastoralists Associations (PAs) of two study districts. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics as well as the logit model. The logit model was used to analyze the different coping strategies of pastoralists to overcome the failure of rain during different seasons. This was done by complementing pastoralists' indigenous knowledge of time-series-based analysis across four seasons (Kerma, Gillal, Hagay, and Sugum) vs. the existing meteorological records. Forty years (from 1971 to 2011) of existing metrological data were used to compare the empirical evidence with pastoralists' perceptions.
   Results: Respondents mentioned that livestock number was the best indicator for evaluating rangeland condition in Afar region. The existing empirical evidence based on metrological data did not show any significant decline in precipitation for the last four decades between 1971 and 2011 as opposed to the perception of pastoralists where 80% of them reported a decline in precipitation. A one unit increase in labor force suggested about 16.1% decrease in the choice of livestock selling as coping strategy in Afar pastoral areas of North-East of Ethiopia. The non-intervened pastoral households had more preference (3.78%) to practice herd splitting than those pastoral households in the intervened district. Similarly, the non-intervened pastoral households had 4.43% more preference to use crop residue for livestock feeding than pastoral HHs in the intervened areas.
   Conclusions: Communities' perceptions showed that livestock number was the best indicator of rangeland condition in the study area. Afar pastoralists' observations with regard to temperature and precipitation trends over the last four decades greatly corresponded with the existing metrological-based empirical evidence. However, pastoralists' perception in terms of reduced precipitation was not confirmed by the meteorological-based data records for the short rainy season (SRS). Afar pastoralists' experience showed that the short rainy season was the best indicator for the occurrence of droughts as compared to other seasons in Afar. Our results suggest that most coping strategies are labor force demanding, and the situation worsens during the long rainy season (LRS). We suggest that differences in intervention between the study areas should not be overlooked as a policy tool in tackling the impact of climate change.

AB  - Soil quality has been proposed as a prime indicator for characterizing and defining management factors contributing to soil degradation. In this study, biological (soil respiration, fluorescent Pseudomonas bacteria and entomopathogenic nematode populations), chemical (pH, inorganic N, and total C & N), and physical (bulk density and infiltration) indicators were used to determine soil quality. The specific research objective was to determine the capacity of this specific set of indicators to assess soil quality and determine its ability to detect short-term changes in soil conditions and processes. The assessment was comparative because of the lack of specific criteria or guidelines available in the literature for interpretation of most soil property indices measured. The following treatments were chosen from an ongoing farming systems study to achieve a preplanned set of comparisons that would make this type of assessment possible: (1) best management practices/ conventional tillage (BMP/CT), (2) BMP/no-tillage (BMP/NT), (3) an organic system, and (4) a successional fallow system. Assessments were made multiple times between 1999 and 2000. Statistical differences between systems were found for all soil quality indicators except for entomopathogenic nematodes. Differences between systems varied across dates, a result that supports other research stating the need to consider the temporal variability of these indices for an unbiased overall soil quality assessment. Differences in total carbon and total nitrogen between systems were most evident in the 2000 sampling dates with BMP/NT showing greater contents on the last sampling date. The soil pH and inorganic N results did not suggest a possible difference in soil function status between any of the three agricultural systems studied. All three agricultural systems, BMP/NT, BMP/CT and organic, had similar pH values and overall low soil inorganic N levels. The non-agricultural successional system had a slightly more acidic soil condition than the three agricultural systems. Soil bulk density increased with time in the untilled BMP/NT and successional systems but the resulting values were not considered detrimental to either productivity or environmental quality. Infiltration was lower in the BMP/NT and successional systems than in the BMP/CT and organic systems. In conclusion, all soil quality indicators except for entomopathogenic nematodes proved to be sensitive to the detection of rapid changes in soil conditions that occur by the influence of soil management. The importance of using soil bulk density to express soil results on a volume basis, as the soil exists in the field before sampling, prevented an average interpretation error of 7-14% as compared to treatment comparisons on a soil weight basis only. This also demonstrates the need to carefully consider field sampling locations (row, between row, or wheel traffic areas) which dramatically influence soil density, physical characteristics, organic matter concentrations, and biological activity. Failure to consider these factors can invalidate even the most careful approaches to establishing baseline soil quality levels in the field as affected by various tillage and residue management practices and associated comparisons in time.

AB  - This aim of this paper is to examine the occurrence of dead wood in a generic virgin beech forest by using a simulation model to determine typical dead wood values (covering amount, availability and spatial distribution). These values should be constant during the development of the forest and robust to small changes in environmental conditions. As we are examining an idealized (modelled) virgin beech forest, the results tend to be qualitative. We show that the invariance of some dead wood values makes them helpful for developing a dead wood concept., However, the reference values must be adapted to the actual stand conditions.
   We extended the BEFORE model (developed for virgin beech forests) by incorporating both the CWD module (coarse woody debris) for dead wood and an estimation of the volume of the canopy layer trees. The extended model proved to be sensitive only to those volume parameter values which can be taken from the literature. Since the other volume parameter values only have a small influence on the model results, it does not matter that they can only be roughly estimated. As a result, the model is mainly determined by the model parameters and stable with respect to small changes in the estimated values.
   The parameter values of the dead wood module CWD (probability of fungal decay WahrschPilz and velocity of decomposition Tot-age) also have only a small influence on the target value of calibration (mean total tree volume per ha) and other values such as the mean total tree volume in the various developmental stages. By contrast, the values concerning the coarse woody debris are closely related to the velocity of decomposition. However, due to the coarse time pattern of the model, this parameter can be estimated with sufficient accuracy.
   The results of the CWD model with standard parameters (Table 2) closely match the empirical results (Tables 5, 6) describing tree volumes in the whole forest area or individual developmental phases', as wen as snags or downed logs. Although CWD is quite simple, significant results not only on coarse woody debris but also of total tree volume can be obtained. Invariant indicators can be identified, i.e. indicators which hardly change during the development of the forest (in the model: during a simulation run) or under slightly varied environmental conditions (in the model: model parameters). These values describe the number, volume and spatial distribution of snags. Although total dead wood volume oscillates in time, the oscillations of dead and live wood augment each other such that the mean total tree volume is (nearly) constant relative to the whole forest area and the individual development stages.
   A suitable compromise between a managed forest and large unmanaged areas might be to mark out pristine forest islands. Our results show that the typical invariant indicators win even develop on an (inner) forest area of 7.4 ha. Furthermore, they. remain constant despite occasional severe storm events for the whole observation period of 3000 years.

AB  - Since recently localization, building, and exploitation of landfill sites in Poland have been taking place without any guidelines and legal regulations. As a result Poland, in comparison to other European Union countries, does not score well in this respect. Unfortunately landfills, particularly from the rural area, quite often have been stored directly on the natural grounds without any protection in excavation after the exploitation of aggregate.
   The aim of this article is to indicate the elements that should be taken into account during structure design, or expansion of the landfills, by focusing particularly on the groundwater quality of the terrain. In order to stress the significance of this subject, three examples of the municipal landfills that have been located in the sites of adverse geological conditions are presented, and the effect of it on the groundwater quality was carried out. Tested landfills have been located mainly within the limits of the non-cohesive soils with high filtration coefficients without any protection. In every case, a subsurface water-bearing layer is deposited directly under the stored landfills. Observation for analyzed landfills were made just before their closing but still during the exploitation. Therefore, the analysis regards the period from the formation of the landfill monitoring wells till today when the landfills are already closed and reclaimed. In the water samples, which were collected according to the guidelines, the following indicators were taken into account and analyzed: reaction pH, proper electrolytic conductivity, total organic carbon, heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, Cr, Hg), total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
   In all the tested landfills was found higher concentrations of groundwater's pollution indicators in landfill monitoring wells located on the outlet of these waters than in the landfill monitoring wells located on their supply. An increased total organic carbon content and higher electrolytic conductivity and content of heavy metals such as copper and zinc was specifically observed. Increased contents of these indicators prove a negative impact of landfills on the water environment. Consequently, the order to close these landfills was justified, as further storage of these landfills would have a bad impact on the groundwater quality, as a result of which a complete degradation of the water-bearing level would take place. As a consequence of the cessation of the exploitation, the quality of water has improved within the limits of the landfills where the geological conditions were the best, namely, even a discountinuous layer of the poorly permeable formations stored above the water-bearing layer had a positive impact and stopped the pollution, disallowing their further migration into the highly permeable formations. In the case of the landfills situated directly on the soils of high filtration coefficients, the indicators of negative influence of deposited landfills increase even after the closing of the researched landfill sites. In this case, a further analysis of monitoring research is needed in order to see after how many years after the shutdown the landfills would cease to be damaging for the waters of the subsurface water-bearing layer.

AB  - Chemical alarm cues function as early indicators of a predation threat and influence the outcome of predator-prey interactions in the favour of the prey animal. The tropical goby, Asterropteryx semipunctatus, responded with a stereotypical alarm response, including reduced movement and feeding, following exposure to water that contained chemical cues from injured conspecifics under natural field conditions. Gobies did not exhibit an alarm response when challenged with extracts from damaged fish from a different taxonomic family. The behavioural response in the field was similar to that observed in laboratory experiments. This study verifies the use of chemical alarm cues in a marine fish in their natural environment.

AB  - Surface waters along the Kalamazoo River, USA, were examined for occurrence and population trends of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) with culture-based and culture-independent methods. The two methods recorded discrepancies in FIB counts, with the culture-independent method revealing more consistent numbers between the river sites. FIB cells that hybridized with the ECO1482 probe were highest in the downstream site, while the upstream site recorded higher ENF343 hybridized cells. Spatial and temporal differences in FIB populations were probably attributable to contrasting fecal pollution influences, vegetation type, varying environmental conditions as well as several in-stream factors between the two river sites.

AB  - The neurotoxic effects of monocrotophos on the brain of the nile tilapia fish (Oreochromis niloticus) were examined, using a static bioassay under laboratory conditions. By probit analysis the 96 h LC(50) value of monocrotophos was 4.9 mg/l. After 96 h exposure to acute levels of monocrotophos, the brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity decreased progressively as the concentration of monocrotophos increased. In addition, four weeks following transfer to toxicant-free water after exposure to 1 mg monocrotophos, nile tilapia fish brain regained 95% of control AChE activity. The results indicate that inhibition of AChE activity in fish exposed to monocrotophos may serve as an indicator of hazard due to application of this chemical in the natural environment.

AB  - In a field study, infecting European flounder (Platichthys flesus L.) subclinically with different parasite species did not result in any alteration of the innate immune response. Due to the high variability in infection status and the immune parameters measured, no relationships of biological significance were found. The data indicate that copepods, as the most abundant parasites, most probably had no major influence on immune responses measured here. Thus it might be concluded that these parameters were not sensitive to parasite infections occur-ring under natural conditions. The immune parameters considered here are regarded as promising indicators of chemical contaminant-induced variation in piscine immune responses, which could be implemented in pollution monitoring programmes.

AB  - Environmental integrated assessments are often carried out via the aggregation of a set of environmental indicators. Aggregated indices derived from the same data set can differ substantially depending upon how the indicators are weighted and aggregated, which is often a subjective matter. This article presents a method of generating aggregated environmental indices in an objective manner via Monte Carlo simulation. Rankings derived from the aggregated indices within and between three Monte Carlo simulations were used to evaluate the overall environmental condition of the study area. Other insights, such as the distribution of good or bad values of indicators at a watershed and/or a subregion, were observed in the study.

AB  - Environmental indicators are often aggregated into a single index for various purposes in environmental studies. Aggregated indices derived from the same data set can differ, usually because the aggregated indices' sensitivities are not thoroughly analyzed. Furthermore, if a sensitivity analysis is carried out, it is not presented in a transparent fashion to policy decision-makers. This paper presents a method of generating various aggregated environmental indices and analyzing their sensitivities via the use of the fuzzy set concept. Results show that several insights into the environmental conditions of the study area (e.g., the distribution of good or bad values of indicators at a watershed and or across the region) can be revealed in the sensitivity analysis of aggregated indices.

AB  - This study presents a new global gridded dataset of bioclimatic indicators at 0.5 degrees by 0.5 degrees resolution for historical and future conditions. The dataset, called CMCC-BioClimInd, provides a set of 35 bioclimatic indices, expressed as mean values over each time interval, derived from post-processing both climate reanalysis for historical period (1960-1999) and an ensemble of 11 bias corrected CMIP5 simulations under two greenhouse gas concentration scenarios for future climate projections along two periods (2040-2079 and 2060-2099). This new dataset complements the availability of spatialized bioclimatic information, crucial aspect in many ecological and environmental wide scale applications and for several disciplines, including forestry, biodiversity conservation, plant and landscape ecology. The data of individual indicators are publicly available for download in the commonly used Network Common Data Form 4 (NetCDF4) format.

AB  - A first overview on fossil chironomids in Dominican amber is given. This fossil assemblage seems to represent an insular fauna, very similar to its living relatives. Stenochironomus sp. and especially the true xylophagous, neotropical/southem North American Xestochironomus spp. prove the persistence of submerged dead wood in nutrient poor mountain streams in the Greater Antilles from the Miocene until today. Their abundance indicates that the special ecological conditions in extant Caribbean tropical mountain streams already ruled the ancient ecosystem. The results arising from the fossils of these freshwater organisms do not coincide with the faunal changes shown by other groups of insects. General systematic descriptions of new fossil representatives of Xestochironomus and Stenochironomus are given. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wildlife ecology and management studies have been widely criticized for deficiencies in design or analysis. Manipulative experiments-with controls, randomization, and replication in space and time-provide powerful ways of learning about natural systems and establishing causal relationships, but such studies are rare in our field. Observational studies and sample surveys are more common; they also require appropriate design and analysis. More important than the design and analysis of individual studies is metareplication: replication of entire studies. Similar conclusions obtained from studies of the same phenomenon conducted under widely differing conditions will give us greater confidence in the generality of those findings than would any single study, however well designed and executed.

AB  - In some small factories producing moulds for ceramic tiles using a cobalt alloy (stellite), environmental and biological (CoU) monitoring was conducted for eight workers employed in gas-shielded arc (MAG) and oxy-acetylene welding processes. During oxy-acetylene braze-welding, the exposure to cobalt is very low as are urinary cobalt concentrations. On the other hand, during the MAG welding process, the exposure levels can exceed the TLV-TWA levels and correlated well with CoU at the end of a working shift. Two MAG welders followed for two consecutive weeks, showed different patterns of urinary cobalt excretion: under the same environmental conditions, the higher CoU was found in the worker with greater past exposure. This aspect needs further evaluation before adopting CoU as a current indicator of occupational exposure to the metal.

AB  - Individual PCB congeners and organophosphorus pesticides were determined in the muscular tissue of the mosquitofish Gambusia affinis from a rice crop field (Ebro Delta, Spain).  Variations in the accumulation patterns of both classes of chemicals were investigated along a year and related to biological constraints of the organisms (e.g. sex and reproduction cycle), environmental conditions (e.g. water flow and pesticide applications) and the physicochemical characteristics of the pollutants.  Gambusia affinis showed a rather fast response against the occurrence of these contaminants in the rice crop field, although its biological cycle has a significant influence on the bioaccumulation of the more lipophilic species (e.g. PCBs).

AB  - Bill deformities have been documented in many avian species across the globe and can be caused by environmental or genetic conditions that may also reflect ecosystem health. We describe the first case of bill deformity in the genus Tyrannus, in a young male Western Kingbird (Tyrannus verticalis) that fledged from a nest in an industrial park in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. The upper mandible of the bill was curved to the left and below the plane of the normal lower mandible making it unlikely that the individual would be able to forage normally and survive to adulthood. Genetic testing for evidence of hybridization with Scissor-tailed Flycatchers (T. forficatus) showed no sign of introgression, and it is unclear what caused the deformity.

AB  - This paper presents results of a study conducted to provide detailed characterization of fine-grained fraction in the selected surface sediment sampled along the eastern Adriatic Sea. The studied fraction was dominated by silt-sized material and composed of carbonate particles (both of biogenic and terrigenous origin), biogenic silica and terrigenous siliciclastic particles. Both components, biogenic and terrigenous were deposited in recent and sub recent conditions. The knowledge about mineral and granulometric composition and the origin of fine-grained particles is essential for understanding sedimentological processes. The obvious complex composition of the fine-grained fraction should be taken into account when environmental studies are to be carried out.

AB  - The discovery and development of pharmaceutical drugs targeting ion channels is important for treating a variety of medical conditions and diseases. Ion channels are expressed ubiquitously throughout the body, and are involved in many basic physiological processes. Neuronal ion channels are particularly appealing drug targets, and recent advances in screening ion channel function using optical-based and electrophysiological technologies have improved drug development in this field. Moreover, methods for the discovery of peptide-based neurotoxins and other natural products have proven useful in the pharmacological assessment of ion channel structure and function, while also contributing to the identification of lead molecules for drug development.

AB  - Random nature of corona phenomena in power lines and accompanying them audible noise cause that the best evaluation method of the negative environmental impact is a continuous signal monitoring. Unfortunately for such procedure some problems are encountered with automated extraction of the indicators normally used for evaluation of the corona audible annoyance, especially in intensified interference conditions. One of the more efficient methods of filtering out the random interference signals is the statistic spectrum measurement method.
   In this work a practical realization is described for estimation of corona noise indicators, making use of the statistic spectrum measurement. High efficiency of such an approach has been shown, especially when the acoustic signal of corona process is relatively low, whereas the random interference level maybe intensified.

AB  - Lakes and wetlands in Mediterranean regions are overexploited and contaminated without sufficient local governmental control. The biodiversity of Salt Lake Acigol (Turkey), an internationally recognized ecosystem, is presently endangered by management plans. This study aims to analyse the ostracod community to establish its ecological status as a base for future paleoecological studies using ostracods to reconstruct the recent evolution of this wetland. Samples were collected seasonally and 13 species were recorded. Multivariate classification and ordination statistical methods revealed a major difference between assemblages related to the relative abundance of species tolerant of desiccation vs. species preferring permanent waters. Cyprideis torosa, mainly found in saline, low diversity sites, is a euryhaline species regarded as an indicator of future lake conditions if inappropriate water resource management continues.

AB  - Sustainable product development of an automotive structure requires a balanced approach towards technological, economical and ecological aspects. Current paper shows the application of a structural optimization system to the optimal choice of foams as a core material for sandwiches with aluminum alloy faces, for the use as floor panels in the bottom structure of a concept car. The minimization problem for the weight of the entire bottom structure under static load conditions, including stiffness, strength and buckling constraints, is formulated and solved for each material application. In addition to optimal (minimized) mass and materials' price used for selection of foams, the assessment of an environmental impact of materials-candidates during the entire life cycle of the structure is considered.

AB  - Models of natural action selection implicate fronto-striatal circuits in both motor and cognitive 'actions'. Dysfunction of these circuits leads to decision-making deficits in various populations. We review how computational models provide insights into the mechanistic basis for these deficits in Parkinson's patients and those with ventromedial frontal damage. We then consider implications of the models for understanding behaviour and cognition in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD). Incorporation of cortical noradrenaline function into the model improves action selection in noisy environments and accounts for response variability in ADHD. We close with more general clinical implications.

AB  - In the Czech Republic, there are forest ecosystems under various stress factors (acidification, cutrophization, Al-phytotoxicity, deficiency of nutrients). Thus since 1988, intensive chemical research was conducted to clarify cause-effect relationships between air pollution and forest decline. Some smog episodes were detected and caused their visible injuries, especially in 1996. In this study cation leaching from Norway spruce canopy (Picea abies (L.) K a r s t.) is used as chemical indicator for direct or indirect impacts of acidic deposition. Tree canopy internal circulation of nutrient indicates and reflects the health and environmental conditions of spruce. The calculation of total acid deposition and tree canopy internal circulation of basic cations is described.

KW  - DIAGNOSIS
AB  - Vibration-based method has been widely applied for damage identification of bridge. Natural frequency, mode shape, and their derivatives are sensitive parameters to damage. However, these parameters can be affected not only by the health of structure, but also by the changing temperature. It is essential to eliminate the influence of temperature in practice. Therefore, a fuzzy neural network-based damage assessment method is proposed in this paper. Uniform load surface curvature is used as damage indicator. Elasticity modulus of concrete is assumed to be temperature dependent in the numerical simulation of bridge model. Through selecting temperature and uniform load surface curvature as input variables of fuzzy neural network, the algorithm can distinguish the damage from temperature effect. Comparative analysis between fuzzy neural network and BP network illustrates the superiority of the proposed method.

AB  - International practice shows an increasing use of web-based Environmental Assessment (EA) registries or project websites to provide public access to information. In support of statutory public participation, registries inform when to participate and provide relevant documents and the continued availability of information. However, what constitutes good practice in this field? This article proposes a framework for assessing good practice in providing access to information via registries. Based on performance indicators for an 'ideal' registry, the framework allows evaluation in the review categories: framework conditions, notice of projects, provision of documents, accessibility of information and ongoing information regarding the status of the environmental assessment. An explorative case study analysis applies the framework and presents results on the performance of international practice examples.

AB  - In recent years there has been an increasing number of papers showing how parasitism and pollution can interact with each other in aquatic organisms. Among the variety of investigated aspects especially the combined effects of pollution and simultaneous infection on the health of aquatic hosts (molluscs, crustaceans, fish, mammals is of considerable interest. Effects of pollution or the occurrence and distribution of parasites is another interesting field of "Environmental Parasitology" attracting increasing attention. This mini-review presents some promising examples of interdisciplinary studies paying attention to the fact that under natural conditions no organism will only be affected by either parasites or pollution.

AB  - Recent work on Carabidae of grasslands and cereals in northern Europe is summarised. In cereals, the biology and role of individual carabids in pest management has been studied in some detail. Grassland studies have concentrated more on classifying the assemblages present, and relating the fauna to environmental conditions and vegetation management. This information is used in the ecological evaluation of grassland habitats. Recent works emphasize landscape features and pattern in the agricultural environment. Examples are given of the author's studies on: pitfall trapping for assessing carabid assemblages; management effects on grassland carabids; multivariate analyses of carabids in UK cereals. A prime need is for further work on individual carabid biologies and population dynamics.

AB  - The detection of stress arising from parasitic infection by Sarcoptes scabieis and from pregnancy is explored, using a fractal analysis of head lifting behaviour and feeding-non-feeding activity sequences in female Spanish ibex, Capra pyrenaica, under natural conditions. Because organisms under stress increase their metabolic rate and, in consequence, energy consumption, it follows that stress will, generally, lead to a reduction in complexity (fractal dimension) of exploratory behaviour. In the present study the fractal dimension of the three measures of complexity used declined with stress, both from pregnancy and from parasitic infection. This observation provides a new and effective way to assess the general state of animals' health in the field, without the need for capture and handling.

AB  - 1. Lake Kus (Manyas Golu), an important bird conservation area, was sampled in the summer, autumn, winter and spring of 1997, and the seasonal and spatial distributions of ostracods: were investigated. Many of the taxa collected are useful indicator species for monitoring conditions within lake basins.
   2. The findings suggest that the L. Kus ecosystem is already substantially degraded. Pollution, coupled with extensive water abstraction for irrigation, have damaged the value of the lake, both commercially (as an inland waters fishery), and as an important site for wetland bird conservation.
   3. This work shows that ostracod faunal analysis has value in the study of such sites, particularly where more formal physical, chemical and biological monitoring methods are inappropriate or unavailable. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The data were collected from a small embayment, protected as a NATURA 2000 area, functioning as a fishing ground important for the local community and as a site of diverse commercial developments. The analysis showed a drastic reduction of the macrobenthos abundance and biomass, which could have been related to oxygen deficiency; on the other hand, recolonisation processes have also been observed.

AB  - Delivering decision-making based on a systemic approach to the reality tackled is an increasingly important condition for increasing the efficiency of using the resources needed to implement environmental programs and projects. Therefore, the hierarchical organisation of the whole reality, recognised as a strictly objective truth, must also be reflected at the level of the information systems, whose basic component is the information flow. In order to meet this requirement, one needs at least an ameliorative analysis of the information flows, represented in the matrix form. This will allow one to highlight and evaluate the relationship among documents, indicators and between documents and indicators regarding the main structural component of the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve Authority (DDBRA): Biodiversity, Natural Heritage Management Service (BNHMS).

AB  - "Sustainable agriculture" has emerged as the most agreed-upon term to synthesize a variety of concepts and perspectives associated with agricultural practices that differ, from those of conventional production. Definitions of sustainable agriculture contain three equally important components: environmental quality and ecological soundness, plant and animal productivity, and socioeconomic viability. The Agroecosystem component of the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program is developing a systems-level approach to the long-term monitoring of agroecosystem sustainability. Measurements will be made for a suite of indicators at sites selected from a probability sampling frame. Associations between indicator values over time will be used to assess agroecosystem condition and status on a regional and/or national scale. One or more measures of sustainability will be developed by organizing indicators and assessment end-points into a framework based upon the three components of sustainable agriculture.

AB  - The main transformation processes effected by the natural microbial consortium of upper Iskar River with predominant participation of sediment biofilm were simulated in the laboratory by the use of portable devices (chambers). The dynamics of real heterotrophic respiration, organic matter oxidation, denitrification and ammonification were analysed by oxygen depiction, reduction of chemical oxygen demand, nitrate uptake and ammonium accumulation, under the conditions prevailing during high and low flow periods. The experimental results showed fast oxygen consumption and high process rates - indicators for intensive respiration by a heterotrophic microbial consortium and good functioning of the ecosystem component studied. The nitrogen transformations occurred at slower rates but in mutual dynamic balance and their simultaneous realisation was due to precise, adaptive division in time and space.

AB  - Despite the successes, and the considerable and continuing ethical disputes regarding wolf reintroduction in the United States, no clear, cogent, theoretically based ethical examination of the wolf reintroductions has yet been completed. Ecoloincal feminist thought, particularly a, articulated by Karen J. Warren, presents one way to create such an ethical assessment. Applying ecological feminist theories to wolf reintroduction also generates an intriguing instance of theoretical application in the "real world" and sheds insight oil the pragmatic value of ecological feminist thought. While ecofeminism does not give a definitive and decisively defensible position concerning wolf reintroduction, it does offer a repeatable framework and set of conditions by which one can assess environmental practice and policy, evidencing yet another example of the relevance of environmental ethics for the assessment of environmental policy.

AB  - A long-term study of the typomorphism of native gold under exogenous conditions gave an insight into its evolution in time and space. The morphology, internal structure, and chemical composition of native gold change depending on the duration of its occurrence under near-surface conditions and on the thermodynamic parameters of the environment. Along with the known facts of gold transformation in the exogenous environment, we consider some of the first identified aspects of the evolution of native gold in weathering crusts and the hydrodynamic, eolian, and anthropogenic environments. Additional attention is given to the transformation of gold in ancient gold-bearing conglomerates under lithostatic pressure and in metamorphic strata depending on the P-T environmental conditions. The paper is based on the results of field work, experiments, and analytical studies of the mineralogy of native gold. The objects of study were gold placers of the eastern Siberian Platform, Tuva, and Mongolia, gold-bearing conglomerates of the Timan Ridge, anthropogenic gold placers of the Yenisei Ridge, kaolinite and laterite weathering crusts of Salair, Kazakhstan, and the Republic of Guinea, and the collections of placer gold from the A.E. Fersman Museum (Moscow), the Central Research Institute of Geological Prospecting for Base and Precious Metals (Moscow), the Moscow Mining Academy, and ZAO VNESHMET (Moscow). In the course of experimental studies, we investigated for the fist time the mechanical transformation of gold particles under the impact of sand-air flow in the eolian conditions and under the lithostatic pressure of the overlying strata on ancient gold-bearing conglomerates. We also used a number of mineralogical and geochemical methods to study the typomorphic features of native gold. The evolution of gold under exogenous conditions depends on the ambient environment. Examination of weathering crust has revealed gold nano- and microparticles resulted from the decomposition of sulfides, tellurides, and other unstable gold-containing compounds. Newly formed gold nano- and microparticles in the form of finest crystals, dendrites, and globules are deposited on the surface of primary endogenous gold. The gold formed in weathering crust is spongy and nodular; the fineness of primary endogenous gold increases, the content of impurity elements in it decreases, and a high-fineness porous shell forms at the edges of the gold particles. In the hydrodynamic environment, placer gold, independently of its form (hemihedral, euhedral, interstitial, etc.), flattens and undergoes a simple deformation, but its chemical composition and internal structure change little; they depend on the stage of ore formation and on the mineragenic type of the gold ore source. We have established that the chemical composition and internal structure of gold change during its long occurrence in the environment and under its repeated redeposition from ancient (Precambrian) to younger (Quaternary) deposits. Based on the obtained results of experimental and mineralogical studies, we have proved that eolian processes change not only the shape of native gold but also its chemical composition and microhardness. In the eolian environment, placer gold of different shapes tends to become a globule with a film-fibrous surface. The change in the shape of gold is accompanied by an increase in its fineness, a decrease in the content of impurity elements, and, as a result, decrease in the gold microhardness.
   In ancient conglomerates (ancient fossil placers), placer gold subjected to the lithostatic pressure of overlying deposits transforms into pseudo-ore gold. In metamorphic strata with constant temperatures and pressures, gold becomes refined. The identified indicators of placer gold of different exogenous environments make it possible to reconstruct the geologic and geomorphologic conditions of gold placer formation, namely, to determine the genetic type of placers (related to weathering crusts, alluvial, eolian, etc.) and to define the source areas (intermediate or primary sources). This helps to find a more correct technique for the search for gold placer and ore deposits.

AB  - The maintenance cost of a gas turbine is significantly higher than its original purchase cost. This study presents a novel prognostic condition-based maintenance (CBM) approach based on the theory of multi-environmental time similarity (METS). In this approach, gas turbine of the same type is regarded as the reference system, and two influential factors - the running hours and number of start-ups are selected as the main degradation indicators. The similarities are calculated based on the values of the degradation indicators under service environment and benchmark environment. Equivalent life (EL) of the object system under the benchmark environment is calculated on the basis of the similarities and historical data of the object system under the service environment. Remaining life (RL) of the object system is obtained by comparing EL and theoretical life. Real-time RL, historical RI. and their calculating algorithms are proposed for acquiring more accurate historical degradation data that can be employed for decision making. Factored service factor is proposed as a key indicator in decision making of CBM, and four optional CBM scenarios are constructed based on different values of the factored service factor. This approach is applied in a thermal power plant in Hangzhou, China, and its effectiveness is proved as an extra power generation of 302,640 MW-h can be achieved due to re-scheduled maintenance.

AB  - Precipitation is a primary environmental factor in the semiarid grasslands of northern China. With increased concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases, precipitation regimes will change, and high-impact weather events may be more common. Currently, many ecophysiological indicators are known to reflect drought conditions, but these indicators vary greatly among species, and few studies focus on the applicability of these drought indicators under high CO2 conditions. In this study, five precipitation levels (- 30%, - 15%, control, + 15%, and + 30%) were used to simulate the effects of precipitation change on 18 ecophysiological characteristics in Stipa bungeana, including leaf area, plant height, leaf nitrogen (N), and chlorophyll content, among others. Two levels of CO2 concentration (ambient, 390 ppm; 550 ppm) were used to simulate the effects of elevated CO2 on these drought indicators. Using gray relational analysis and phenotypic plasticity analysis, we found that total leaf area or leaf number (morphology), leaf water potential or leaf water content (physiology), and aboveground biomass better reflected the water status of S. bungeana under ambient and elevated CO2 than the 13 other analyzed variables. The sensitivity of drought indicators changed under the elevated CO2 condition. By quantifying the relationship between precipitation and the five most sensitive indicators, we found that the thresholds of precipitation decreased under elevated CO2 concentration. These results will be useful for objective monitoring and assessment of the occurrence and development of drought events in S. bungeana grasslands.

AB  - We compared canopy arthropod assemblages among overstory conifer and understory angiosperm species at Teakettle Experimental Forest in the Sierra Nevada in California during 1998-2000. Arthropods were sampled from upper, middle, and lower crown levels of one overstory tree of each of the four dominant conifer species (Jeffrey pine, sugar pine, white fir, and incense cedar), and from three understory plants of each of the major understory species (California black oak, manzanita, and white-thorn ceanothus) in each of five replicate plots during June and Aug. in each of the 3 years to represent seasonal and annual variation in abundances. Many taxa differed significantly in abundance among plant species, with one to five taxa being significant indicators for each plant species. Five to eight taxa on each plant species showed significant differences in abundance among years. Aphids and scale insects, predaceous mirids, and some detritivores showed peak abundances in 1999, a particularly dry year, whereas most other taxa showed lowest abundances during 1999 or declining abundances during this period, suggesting association with wetter conditions. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS), supported by multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP), showed that arthropod assemblages differed significantly among the seven plant species, especially between overstory conifers and understory angiosperms, and among the 3 years. These data indicate that the diversity and structure of arthropod communities depend on vegetation structure and/or condition, perhaps as modified by annual variation in weather conditions.

AB  - TWO FIELD experiments were carried out at Fac. Agric. Edu. Farm, Minia University, Egypt, during the two successive seasons of 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 under irrigation and drought conditions. Thirty nine genotypes of bread wheat were evaluated to estimate physiological traits related to water stress, tolerance indices, and to determine the best drought tolerant genotypes. The combined analysis revealed significant differences for environments, genotypes, years, environments x genotypes and years x genotypes interactions for all studied traits. Under irrigation, three genotypes No. 39, No. 42 and No. 68 were significantly higher than the better parent in excised leaf water retention and grain yield. Under drought stress condition, genotypes No. 13, No. 42 and No. 246 exceeded the better parent in relative water content, leaf water content, specific leaf weight and grain yield. Under normal irrigation, relative water content showed negative and significant (P <= 0.01) correlation with leaf water loss (-0.86), with leaf area (-0.36), and positive correlation with grain yield (P <= 005), while under drought stress, excised leaf water retention showed negative and significant (P <= 0.01) correlation with leaf water loss (-0.85), and negative correlation with both of leaf area (-0.25) and grain yield. Ranking method indicated that genotypes No. 13, No. 296 and No. 379 were the most drought tolerant genotypes, while genotypes No. 1, No. 74, No. 95 and No. 129 were the most sensitive to drought condition.

AB  - The formation and lifespan of soybean root nodules is affected by drought-stress, compromising the nitrogen supply of soybean plants. Expression of nodule cysteine proteases, involved in the regulation of the bacterial symbiosis and leghemoglobin degradation, increases during nodule senescence. Changes in the root nodule transcriptome were studied under varying drought-stress conditions using RNA-seq to identify nodule cysteine proteases induced following exposure to drought-stress conditions. Eight cysteine proteases belonging to the C1 family (papain-like cysteine proteases) and three cysteine proteases belonging to the C13 family (legumains or vacuole processing enzymes (VPE)) were induced by drought-stress. Expression of one C1 cysteine protease, Glyma.10G207100, was highly induced during drought but not under natural nodule senescence. A possible function of one C13 cysteine protease (alpha 1-VPE-deficient), which was highly expressed in nodules under drought, was further investigated in Arabidopsis mutant plants. C13 mutant plants showed decreased C1 cysteine protease activity, had higher biomass and protein levels under stress conditions compared to wild-type plants. From our study we conclude that the C1 cysteine protease, Glyma.14G085800 will be a useful indicator for drought-induced premature senescence of soybean root nodules and that silencing of C13 cysteine proteases (VPEs) might be a strategy to reduce the consequences C1 cysteine protease activity during drought-stress.

AB  - Cropping systems modify soil attributes and may change its quality. The work had the objective to evaluate the changes in physical, chemical and biological soil under organic farming systems (soils cultivated organically for more than seven years), in conversion to organic and conventional, with reference to the soil under native forest, and identify the attributes used as indicators of soil quality. Three areas of farm crops, located in the municipalities of Areia, Remigio, and Lagoa Seca, the state of Paraiba, Brazil were selected, and soil samples deformed collected in the layers 0-10 and 10-20 cm. The data were analyzed using ANOVA, the Tukey Test, and the Principal Component Analysis. There was a reduction of soil density (Ds) and increased porosity (PT) in the system of organic farming compared to cropping systems in conversion organic and conventional. The contents of phosphorus and organic carbon (CO), the base sum (SB), cation exchange capacity (CTC), light particulate organic matter (MOPL), carbon particulate organic matter light (CMOPL), edaphic respiration (RE) and pH of soils under organic cultivation are higher than soils under conventional tillage. The growing organic basis contributes to the maintenance of soil quality under similar conditions and/or even better than the condition forest and, under the conditions of this study, the most appropriate indicators to analyze the cultivation organic basesare Ds, PT, CO, MOPL, CMOPL, pH, SB, CTC e RE.

AB  - We conducted field surveys and laboratory analyses to test the effects of soil characteristics in habitat mitigation sites and natural sites on the growth and condition of blue elderberry (Sambucus mexicana), which is the sole host plant for the federally threatened Valley elderberry longhorn beetle (Desmocerus californicus dimorphus). Thirty mitigation and 16 natural sites were selected throughout the range of the beetle. We found that although plant relative growth rates were comparable between mitigation sites and a natural site, mitigation sites contained substantially less soil nutrients than mitigation sites. Within mitigation sites, elderberry health and growth were positively correlated with the amount of total nitrogen in soils and less strongly with other soil nutrients and soil moisture. Analyses demonstrated reductions in the relative growth rate of elderberry as mitigation sites aged, and that soil nutrients and soil moisture became depleted over time. For mitigation sites, it took approximately seven years to develop basal stem diameters that have been linked to successful beetle colonization. Mitigation sites have smaller shrubs than natural sites and growth slows as mitigation sites age, thus delaying convergence of conditions between natural and mitigation sites. Analyses of soil particle size and whether sites were within the 100-year floodplain (as an indicator of riparian conditions) were inconclusive. We recommend investigating fertilizing and optimum planting densities for elderberry at restoration and mitigation sites, as well as increasing the duration of irrigation and monitoring.

AB  - This study characterizes the responses, particularly diurnal variations, of thyroid hormones (TH) [3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), and T3:T4 ratio (T3/T4)] of Arbor Acres broilers to constant thermoneutral (TN) or warm cyclic (WC) temperatures. There existed distinct circadian variations-2 peaks in TH under the TN and WC conditions. The 2 peaks of T3, T4, and T3/T4 of the broilers occurred, respectively, at 0 and 16 h, 8 and 16 h, and 0 and 12 h under the TN condition; but at 0 and 12 h, 0 and 8 h, and 4 and 12 h under the WC conditions. During a 5-d heat exposure (HE) to the WC regimens, T3 and T4 showed continual decrease. The daily mean of T3 declined significantly (P < 0.05) on the first day of HE, whereas significant decrease of T4 (P < 0.05) occurred on the second day of HE. There was no significant change in daily mean of T3/T4 during the same HE period. Hence, results of the study indicate that T3 provides a better heat stress indicator than T4. The nature of circadian variations in TH makes it necessary to collect blood samples more than once a day, e.g., 6 times at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 h, to ensure full evaluation of hormonal responses of market-size broilers undergoing thermal challenges.

AB  - Summer heat provides stressful conditions for Bos taurus feeder cattle; in extreme instances these conditions can be fatal. One management option is to provide shade structures for feedlot animals. This study was conducted during the summer of 2001 to compare physiological responses of cattle with shade access or no-shade access. Eight steers were selected from a group of 12, and assigned individual pens. Four pens were fitted with shade structures that allowed the steers to choose shade; the remainder had no shade option. The animals were rotated through pen assignments during the summer season. Continuous measures of respiration rate and body temperature were recorded as response variables to the shade treatments. Environmental conditions were monitored for the experimental period. Daytime means and standard errors were 86.0 +/- 0.39 breaths min(-1) for respiration rate shade, and were significantly lower (probability P < 0.05) than respiration rate No-shade of 102-3 +/- 0.36 breaths min(-1). Linear regression fit for daytime data showed the slope for No-shade to be 4.5 +/- 0.15 breaths min(-1) and 1.5 +/- 0.11 breaths min(-1) for Shade. Thresholds for humidity and treatment of Shade and No-shade were determined to exist between 25 and 30 degrees C. Linear regression equations were developed for respiration rate including effects of temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation for animals in either Shade or No-shade feedlot pens.

AB  - Recognition of fatigue is important for treadmill conditioning. Characteristics of regularity as early fatigue indices in different training programs have not been thoroughly investigated. In presented study regularity and symmetry characteristics of recreation Warmbloods were investigated under varying treadmill training conditions -velocity, training period and position of treadmill. The hypothesis that greater regularity allows to find optimum velocity was stated. Warmblood recreation horses (14) were trained under identical environmental conditions on the treadmill in trot (for 1 month) and walk (for 6 months). Stride parameters were measured using a digital camera (50 fps) in walk after 1-and 6-month training and trot after 1-month training, at two gait velocities (5 and 6 km/h; 10 and 11 km/h) and for a 3% inclined (walk and trot) and 3 and 6% declined treadmill (walk). Data were collected for individual horses during ten successive strides. The effects of training, velocity, successive stride number and treadmill position were analysed using the analysis of variance. Front limb symmetry was significantly greater for trot at greater velocities (11 vs. 10 km/h). In walk the symmetry is generally lower after each training period (about 1-2%), while in trot symmetry and regularity were greater (2% and 4%). Symmetry and regularity of trot on an inclined treadmill were greater than for a horizontal treadmill (4% for symmetry and 2% for regularity). Obtained results of fatigue indicators are representative for recreation Warmblood horses at medium workload.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the condition of activated sludge in the biologic reactor located in the collective wastewater treatment plant in Nowy Targ (Poland) based on OUR tests in the aspect of the impact of sludge's concentration in the biologic reactor and dependence of BOD5/TN and BOD5/TP in wastewater flowing into the biologic reactor. The analysis was conducted based on test results from 61 samples of activated sludge taken from the biologic reactor and 61 samples of wastewater flowing into the biologic reactor. The analysis included the concentration of sludge in the biologic reactor. The following indicators were analyzed in wastewater flowing into the reactor: biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). The statistical analysis concerning the impact of the analyzed factors on oxygen uptake rate (OUR) tests was developed based on the Pearson's correlation coefficient and partial correlation of many variables. Based on the results of the partial correlation analysis, nomograms were developed to determine the condition of activated sludge microorganisms (OUR) based on the BOD5/TN and BOD5/TP connection and knowledge of the sludge concentration in the bioreactor of the treatment plant. The presented nomograms can be formulated for each bioreactor based on activated sludge technology related the load of organic and biogenic pollutants in the wastewater flowing into the bioreactor and the concentration of the sludge in the bioreactor.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of oil type and oxidation status on acrylamide (AA) formation and colour development in potato products under domestic baking conditions. Sunflower, soybean and olive oil were used; the first one was thermally oxidized to obtain different oxidation status. A potato dough containing 10 % oil, potato powder, flour and water was shaped into thin discs and baked at 180 A degrees C for different heating times. AA concentration, moisture content and surface colour were determined. Results obtained showed that neither the nature of lipids present, in terms of content of unsaturated fatty acids, nor the degree of fat oxidation influenced AA formation in low-fat baked potato products. Browning ratio higher than 45 % and moisture content lower than 17 % resulted in dark brown, almost burnt, products. Moreover, in those cases, no correlation could be found between those variables and AA content, since formation and degradation simultaneously occur. When the browning ratio ranged between 0 and 45 %, a good linear correlation with AA formation was observed, suggesting that the browning ratio may be considered as a reliable indicator of AA concentration. Finally, AA less than 1000 mu g/kg, which is an indicative value that has been recently set for potato crisps by the European Commission, corresponds to a browning ratio of less than 8 % and moisture content more than 23.5 %.

AB  - Analysis of sediment and aquatic vegetation samples collected along the Onkaparinga estuary, South Australia, revealed the distribution patterns of benthic and epi-benthic micro-organisms, specifically foraminifera and ostracods. The total assemblage provided an assemblage 'snap shot,' contemporaneous with the environmental conditions at the time of sampling, as well as seasonally and time-averaged distribution information. Species richness is low in the upper reaches of the estuary and favours species with a wide salinity tolerance. Observed species richness increases seawards. Species richness and abundance within species is greater where there is conspicuous aquatic vegetation. Thus, species richness and distribution appear to be related to the proximity to the sea and the provision of diverse habitable substrate. Foraminiferal species, Ammonia beccarii and Elphidium excavatum, and ostracods belonging to the genera Paracypria, Xestolebris and Leptocythere dominate the total assemblage. These species are characteristic of euryhaline conditions. The mutual maximum occurrences of Reophax barwonensis, Ammobaculites barwonensis and Trochammina inflata signify mid-estuarine conditions. In the lower regions of the estuary, the appearance of shallow marine species of foraminifera such as Elphidium crispum and Quinqueloculina poeyana, and ostracods Bairdoppilata sp., Hemicytherura spp. and Paranesidea spp. signifies interactions with the adjacent inner shelf coastal waters. Throughout the entire length of the estuary, the presence of vegetal substrate created a strong numerical bias towards live occurrences of the ostracods Paracypria sp. and Xestolebris cedunaensis. These species are potentially useful as proxies for paleoenvironmental interpretations of estuarine sediments.

AB  - Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) analysis was employed to extract paleoclimatic information from mollusk shells taken from the Luochuan section located on the Loess Plateau of central China. The results show that the EPR spectrum of Mn2+ in mollusk shells is complicated and consists of two sets of six hyperfine lines of Mn2+ that arise from two non-equivalent Mn2+ sites in aragonite. There is no obvious inconsistency of EPR spectral intensities among different species of modern mollusks at Luochuan area; the magnitude of EPR spectra intensities of mollusk shells is correlative with the Mn2+ concentration of the environments.
   The EPR signals from mollusk shells taken from the loess, which is considered to be formed in the cold and dry glacial environment, are stronger than those from the paleosol deposited under the warm and humid interglacial condition suggesting that the Mn2+ available for mollusks in a cold climate is higher than in a warm climate. We propose that during the glacial period, the mollusks lived in a relatively reductive soil environment with more Mn2+ while during the interglacial period its environment was more oxidizing with less Mn2+. This result provides direct evidence that the loess-paleosol interlayers came into being under alternating redox conditions resulting from fluctuating paleoclimate. The analysis of the EPR spectra of mollusk shells serves as a new tool for retrieving climatic information from the mollusk records.

AB  - An integrated study of variation in siliceous microfossils, lithofacies, and other geochemical guides to environmental conditions through the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary transition at Flaxbourne River and Woodside Creek, coastal eastern Marlborough, indicates that the K/T impact disrupted oceanic conditions along the continental margin of eastern New Zealand for c. I m.y. Initial effects of the K/T event were a major reduction in carbonate production, associated with calcareous plankton extinctions, and significant increases in terrigenous clay and biogenic silica content. An absence of radiolarian extinctions or significant negative excursions in paleo-productivity indicators (Ba, d(13)C) at the boundary, followed by rapid increases in the abundance of diatoms and spumellarian radiolarians, indicate that biogenic silica production partly compensated for the collapse in calcareous plankton.
   The earliest Paleocene recovery of calcareous plankton was short-lived, giving way to a progressive increase in siliceous plankton abundance over c. 500 000 yr, which culminated in a c. 400 000 yr episode of peak biogenic silica production. The dominance of siliceous facies, coupled with the abundance of diatoms and spumellarian radiolarians, indicates climatic or oceanic conditions were significantly cooler than in the Late Cretaceous. Stepped increases in biogenic silica production show c. 100 000 yr periodicity, suggesting that early Paleocene lithofacies changes were influenced by climate forcing agents at the eccentricity bandwidth.

AB  - The natural intermittent impulses created by impeller in case of centrifugal pump, and reciprocating motions of piston in case of axial pump exhibit strong cyclo-stationary phenomenon. This makes the identification of defect impulses difficult in their vibration signals even with the powerful signal processing techniques such as Fast-spectral correlation. To deal with the issue, this work proposes noise subtraction and marginal enhanced square envelope spectrum (MESES) for detecting bearing defects in the centrifugal and axial pump. For subtraction of noise, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of signal of unknown defect condition is computed and then FFT of normal working condition is subtracted from the signal of unknown defect condition. Then, inverse FFT is applied to resulting signal to construct denoised signal in time domain. The noise subtraction is done in frequency domain so as to avoid time lag problem which generally occurs in two signals obtained at different time. Further, the signal is processed by Fast-spectral correlation. To select the spectral frequency having fault related information, a criterion named as marginal band selection indicator (MBSI) is proposed. The spectral frequency band having the highest MBSI is selected for computing MESES. After selection of spectral frequency, MESES is computed and Feature frequency is find out. Finally, comparison of feature frequency is done with the bearing fundamental fault frequencies to conform the presence of defect.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation and degradation seriously threaten native animal communities. We studied the response of a small marsupial, the agile antechinus Antechinus agilis, to several environmental variables in anthropogenically fragmented Eucalyptus forest in south-east Australia. Agile antechinus were captured more in microhabitats dominated by woody debris than in other microhabitats. Relative abundances of both sexes were positively correlated with fragment core area. Male and female mass-size residuals were smaller in larger fragments. A health status indicator, haemoglobin-haematocrit residuals (HHR), did not vary as a function of any environmental variable in females, but male HHR indicated better health where sites' microhabitats were dominated by shrubs, woody debris and trees other than Eucalyptus. Females were trapped less often in edge than interior fragment habitat and their physiological stress level, indicated by the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio in peripheral blood, was higher where fragments had a greater proportion of edge habitat. The latter trend was potentially due to lymphopoenia resulting from stress hormone-mediated leukocyte trafficking. Using multiple indicators of population condition and health status facilitates a comprehensive examination of the effects of anthropogenic disturbances, such as habitat fragmentation and degradation, on native vertebrates. Male agile antechinus' health responded negatively to habitat degradation, whilst females responded negatively to the proportion of edge habitat. The health and condition indicators used could be employed to identify conservation strategies that would make habitat fragments less stressful for this or similar native, small mammals.

AB  - Saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons were used to evaluate depositional redox conditions and marine photoautotroph contributions to Middle Caradocian strata of the central United States (IA). At the base of the Spechts Ferry Member of the Decorah Formation, C-13-enriched aryl isoprenoids, derivatives of green sulfur bacteria, become abundant, indicating the development of photic-zone anoxia. This is coincident with the disappearance of the organic-walled microfossil Gloeocapsomorpha prisca and a marked decrease in the relative abundances of cyanobacterial biomarkers. The development of dysoxic to anoxic conditions and/or associated changes in basin circulation potentially affected the distributions and abundances of these organisms. In the overlying Guttenberg Member, G. prisca-derived organic matter becomes dominant, but relative cyanobacteria abundances remain low. In addition, the percentage total organic carbon is greater than 20%, even though selected biomarker ratios (pristane/phytane ratios greater than 3, and homohopane indices less than 0.5) and the presence of bioturbation indicate that bottom waters were oxygenated. It is suggested that deposition of G. prisca affected both organic matter preservation and depositional redox conditions. Observed variations in redox indicators and marine photoautotroph contributions are associated with changes in siliciclastic deposition, reported macrofauna turnover and with evidence for oceanic cooling and a change in circulation patterns documented in the eastern United States.

AB  - Hopanoids are among the most widespread biomarkers of bacteria that are used as indicators for past and present bacterial activity. Our understanding of the production, function, and distribution of hopanoids in bacteria has improved greatly, partly due to genetic, culture-independent studies. Culture-based studies are important to determine hopanoid function and the environmental conditions under which these compounds are produced. This study compares the lipid inventory of Rhodopseudomonas palustris strain TIE-1 under anoxic photoautotrophic conditions using either H2 or Fe(II) as electron donor. The high amount to which adenosylhopane is produced irrespective of the used electron donor suggests a specific function of this compound rather than its exclusive role as an intermediate in bacteriohopanepolyol biosynthesis. C-2 methylated hopanoids and tetrahymanol account for as much as 59% of the respective C-2 methylated/non-methylated homologs during growth with Fe(II) as electron donor, as compared with 24% C-2 methylation for growth with H2. This observation reveals that C-2 methylated hopanoids have a specific function and are preferentially synthesized in response to elevated Fe(II) concentrations. The presence of C-2 methylated pentacyclic triterpenoids has commonly been used as a biosignature for the interpretation of paleoenvironments. These new findings suggest that increased C-2 methylation may indicate anoxic ferrous conditions, in addition to other environmental stressors that have been previously reported.

AB  - The late Cenomanian-early Turonian Oceanic Anoxic Event (OAE-2) represents major paleoceanographic and faunal perturbations Samples from the northern Tethyan margin (Rehkogelgraben Eastern Alps) were investigated in order to trace the paleoceanographic processes Paleoecologic conditions were reconstructed by combining the results of assemblage counts of indicative microfossil groups (foraminifera and radiolaria) Assemblages size distributions and abundances show a tripartite subdivision for surface and bottom waters 1) Oligotrophic surface conditions and oxic bottom waters with a reasonably high food supply for the late Cenomanian interval 2) An OAE period with black shales characterized by very low numbers but high diversities and a lack of high-productivity indicators among planktic foraminifera Low abundances of small sized benthic foraminifera indicate low oxic-dysoxic conditions at the seafloor 3) Post-OAE assemblages are characterized by mesotrophic planktic species and benthic foraminifera suggest oxic bottom waters It took about 300 ky to re-establish a pelagic carbonate producing regime The semi-enclosed basin situation of the Penninic Ocean is thought to be responsible for differences between the high productivity in the world ocean during the OAE-2 and the overall absence of high-productivity indicators and high foraminiferal diversities at Rehkogelgraben The Penninic Ocean may have even served as a refuge during the environmental crisis (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB  - The paper describes the concept of a management system called MOM (Modelling-Ongrowing fish farms-Monitoring) which may be used to adjust the local environmental impact of marine fish farms to the holding capacity of the sites. The concept is based on integrating the elements of environmental impact assessment, monitoring of impact and environmental quality standards (EQS) into one system. The amount of monitoring is dependent on the level of the environmental impact. Two terms are introduced: (1) the degree of exploitation, which is an expression of how much the site is being utilised, and (2) the level of monitoring, which determines the amount of monitoring depending on the environmental impact. For Norwegian conditions, a monitoring programme, including EQS, has been developed concerning the impact on the sediment under fish farms. It consists of three types of investigations of increasing elaboration and accuracy. A model, which simulates the environmental impact on a site given information about the farm's size and production and the hydrodynamic conditions and topography of the site, has been developed but not yet tested. The model and the monitoring programme with EQS are only briefly described, but will be published later. The MOM system should help to maintain satisfactory environmental conditions in and around fish farms and may be a valuable tool in site selection and coastal zone management.

AB  - Plant cold acclimation involves complicated pathways that integrate signals from temperature changes and light conditions. To understand plant responses to environmental signals in detail, molecular events that are regulated by temperature and light must be investigated at the whole-plant level in a nondestructive way. Using the promoter of COR15A connected to the luciferase reporter gene as a cold-responsive indicator, we developed an in planta monitoring system for gene expression under controlled temperature and photoperiod conditions. COR15A promoter activity was intensified by day-night cycles at 2 degrees C, while its induction was abruptly suppressed in the dark at 8 degrees C or higher, indicating a difference in responsiveness to photocycle between these two acclimation conditions. Freeze-thawing tests of whole plants proved that lower acclimation temperature resulted in higher tolerance to freezing, consistent with the temperature-dependent induction of COR15A. Inhibition of photosynthetic electron transport by 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea eliminated the responsiveness to the day-night cycles at 2 degrees C, indicating a possibility that the photosynthetic redox and/or the accumulation of photosynthates modulate COR15A responsiveness to photoperiod during cold acclimation, in addition to the well-known regulation by CBF (C-repeat binding factor) genes. These findings indicate that the cold-responsive promoter is regulated by distinctive mechanisms dependent on temperature and simultaneously affected by photocycle and photosynthesis.

AB  - The literature review concerning various materials for production of sheet piles used in wet ground, waterfront and marine conditions has been presented. Polyvinyl chloride has been identified as a promising steel alternative. Despite unambiguous findings suggesting a higher environmental impact of steel sheet piles compared to polymer products, the necessity of further detailed surveys, confirming the preliminary conclusion, has been perceived. The main objective of this study has been to compare the environmental impact of steel and vinyl sheet piles taking into consideration various corrosion rate depending on the local conditions. The comparative life cycle assessment analyses have been carried out according to a cradle-to-site approach. The comparison of indicators has shown that the environmental impact of polymer products had been significantly lower than that of steel products. In case of the most aggressive environment, the differences of results have reached an order of magnitude. The dominant environmental impact has resulted from the production process of sheet piles. An uncertainty analysis has been carried out by means of Monte Carlo simulations. The study has also provided sensitivity analysis to the assumptions of the model applied. The minimum thickness of steel sheet piles after 50 years of use, including loss allowances and protective coatings, as well as different parameters of transport has been analyzed. Irrespective of the assumed conditions, the general conclusion has remained the same: steel sheet piles indicated significantly higher environmental impact than vinyl sheet piles.

AB  - Climate change has increased flooding frequency, making the heavy metal polluted areas more vulnerable, and led to increased global land degradation. Information about the alteration of soil microbiota under heavy metal pollution and flooding is still rather limited. Fast-growing trees are candidates for phytoremediation of heavy metal polluted soils. Therefore, the impact of Cu pollution on microbiota in soil used for cultivating Salix integra Thunb. was investigated with and without flooding for 60 d. Bacterial and fungal communities were accessed via partial 16S rRNA (V-3-V-4) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) genes. The activity of invertase, urease and cellulase were markedly decreased by 28.5-59%, 55.0-76.7% and 17.3-34.1%, respectively, with increasing Cu levels. Flooding significantly increased the activity of polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase by 56.3% and 41.4% at the highest Cu level compared to its respective nonflooded condition. High Cu concentration significantly decreased the richness and diversity of the bacterial community, and fungi were more sensitive than bacteria under flooding conditions. Redundancy analysis suggests that Cu, Fe and soil organic matter are the key determinants affecting the composition of microbial communities.

AB  - We assessed the utility of using the sediment total organic carbon/total nitrogen (C/N) ratio as an indicator of paleoclimate changes in the eastern Baltic area during the late glacial and early Holocene. The C/N ratio in sediments from Lake Lielais SvA"tiA dagger u, eastern Latvia, was compared with other sediment variables that are used as proxies of past climate and environment. Analysis revealed that although the organic matter (OM) content in late glacial sediments was extremely low, the C/N ratio captured information about OM origin, and fluctuations in the ratio tracked climate oscillations. The C/N ratio was significantly positively correlated with pollen-inferred mean summer temperature. Therefore, C/N ratio was lower under colder conditions, indicating a predominantly phytoplankton origin of OM, and was higher during warmer conditions, when there was more vegetation around the lake. A strong positive correlation between C/N ratio and the paleopigment beta carotene suggested that elevated phytoplankton production resulted from higher nutrient availability that was controlled largely by the input of terrestrial OM to the lake during warmer climate episodes. Thus, C/N ratio was a good indicator of paleoclimate changes, at least for the late glacial period, when generally cold conditions prevailed. This study also demonstrates the power of multi-proxy paleolimnological analyses for investigating past environmental changes in lakes and their watersheds.

AB  - Although the effects of land use changes on hydrological functioning are widely addressed, issues such as which components of the hydrological system are affected, how and on what time scales are still poorly understood. In this context, we evaluated whether forest restoration improves soil water conditions in a Cerrado area, and whether the combined effects of forest structure and hydrological variables influence soil attributes. For this, we monitored three areas in different stages of natural succession over seven months, and evaluated vegetation structure indicators, hydrological indicators and soil indicators. Vegetation structure variables were analyzed with Principal Components Analysis, and to evaluate the direct and indirect effects among the variables we used structural equations modelling Each successional stage differed in relation to forest structure, affecting the hydrological processes and causing the improvement of soil attributes with forest development hi the initial stage, throughfall was higher due to the more open vegetation, and the soil was more resistant to penetration. With the development of the vegetation, stem-flow and interception also increased. As a result of the structural and hydrological changes, the model indicated that soil moisture was influenced directly by throughfall and stem-flow, as well as by soil resistance to penetration and infiltration rates, and indirectly by forest structure, which influenced these variables, except infiltration rates. These results suggest that hydrological variables can be good indicators of forest restoration monitoring, providing a direct link to changes in soil conditions.

AB  - Although Leontopodium alpinum is considered to be threatened in many countries, only limited scientific information about its autecology is available. In this study, we aim to define the most important ecological factors which influence the distribution of L. alpinum in the Swiss Alps. These were assessed at the national scale using species distribution models based on topoclimatic predictors and at the community scale using exhaustive plant inventories. The latter were analysed using hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis, and the results were interpreted using ecological indicator values. Leontopodium alpinum was found almost exclusively on base-rich bedrocks (limestone and ultramafic rocks). The species distribution models showed that available moisture (dry regions, mostly in the Inner Alps), elevation (mostly above 2,000 m a.s.l.) and slope (mostly > 30A degrees) were the most important predictors. The relev,s showed that L. alpinum is present in a wide range of plant communities, all subalpine-alpine open grasslands, with a low grass cover. As a light-demanding and short species, L. alpinum requires light at ground level; hence, it can only grow in open, nutrient-poor grasslands. These conditions are met in dry conditions (dry, summer-warm climate, rocky and draining soil, south-facing aspect and/or steep slope), at high elevations, on oligotrophic soils and/or on windy ridges. Base-rich soils appear to also be essential, although it is still unclear whether this corresponds to physiological or ecological (lower competition) requirements.

AB  - The aim of this investigation was to compare the prevalence of indicators of poor welfare among 5 Italian cattle breeds (Italian Holstein-Friesian, Italian Bruna, Pezzata Rossa Italiana, Grigia Alpina, and Pezzata Rossa d'Oropa) kept in tie-stalls in the Italian Alps under similar housing and management conditions. We recorded the presence of integument alterations (hairless patch areas, lesion/swollen areas, or overgrown claws) and lameness in 612 cows. Additionally, we checked 834 cows for the presence of physical malformations ("open" shoulders). In general, the prevalence of welfare problems showed a decreasing trend from the more productive to the less productive breeds. Local breeds (Grigia Alpina and Pezzata Rossa d'Oropa) showed a significantly lower prevalence of welfare problems compared with the other 3 breeds, whereas Italian Holstein-Friesian usually had the highest percentage of individuals with problems. No differences were found between Pezzata Rossa Italiana and Italian Bruna, both of which showed fewer problems than Italian Holstein-Friesian. The effect of the breed significantly affected the welfare of dairy cows in tie-stalls in alpine traditional husbandry systems. The prevalence of the negative welfare indicators studied was lower in local breeds, which are better adapted to local breeding conditions. Our results indicate an urgent need to promote changes in the criteria used for genetic selection in the dairy industry and underline the importance of maintaining the diversity of local breeds, which should be carefully chosen for each specific environmental condition.

AB  - Deep-sea hydrothermal vents are considered as some of the most adverse environments in the world, yet the animals dwelling around the vent sites exhibit high productivity and therefore must cope with unusual levels of heavy metals, pH, temperature, CO2 and sulfide, in addition to environmental microbes. In an attempt to understand the physiological reactions of animals normally set to endure extreme conditions we investigated molecular indicators of acclimation processes during which the mussel Bathymodiolus azoricus was maintained over long periods of time under without methane and/or sulfide supplementation, vent mussels seem to endure well aquarium conditions. The presence and induction of a Rel Homology Domain containing gene was investigated along with the induction of the antibacterial gene mytilin following experimental infections carried out with the marine bacteria Vibrio parahaemolyticus. It was then concluded that vent mussels are capable of performing typical immune gene transcription activity as their shallow water congeners. The mussel's viability was determined during stimulations achieved with the hyperbaric chamber IPOCAMP, by comparing the expression levels of, among other genes, the metal-responsive Metallothionein (MT) gene at 170 bars. laboratory conditions. Even in the absence of the characteristic high hydrostatic pressure found at deep-sea vent sites and Our results suggest that Bathymodiolus azoricus maybe used in experimental studies as an indicator species, for assessing immunity, toxicity or metal stress and the effect of hydrostatic pressure.

AB  - Substandard housing is considered a public health issue worldwide. Migrants are more likely than other individuals to experience poor housing conditions in urban China, and these challenges in housing conditions have deep effects on migrant health. This study characterizes the relationship between housing satisfaction and migrant health in Hangzhou, China. In particular, 17 indicators for assessing housing satisfaction, which include the indoor environment (IE), outdoor environment (OE) and safety (SE), are integrated. In order to reveal the physical health and mental health status of migrants, a physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) were assessed by using a Twelve-Item Short-Form Health Survey. Multivariate linear regression was further employed to quantify the associations between housing satisfaction and migrant health. The results showed that high satisfaction with the indoor environment, outdoor environment and safety can improve the physical health of migrants. High housing satisfaction, in addition to satisfaction with the outdoor environment, has a significant relationship with the mental health of migrants. Income is associated with migrant health since it plays a key role in determining migrants' socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and subjective aspirations. However, per capita living space does not have a significant association with migrant health because most of the migrants live in small living spaces in the study area. According to the findings, implications for housing policies that can better integrate housing conditions and health are proposed.

AB  - Red blood cells (RBCs) deformability refers to the cells' ability to adapt their shape to the dynamically changing flow conditions so as to minimize their resistance to flow. The high red cell deformability enables it to pass through small blood vessels and significantly determines erythrocyte survival. Under normal physiological states, the RBCs are attuned to allow for adequate blood flow. However, rigid erythrocytes can disrupt the perfusion of peripheral tissues and directly block microvessels. Therefore, RBC deformability has been recognized as a sensitive indicator of RBC functionality. The loss of deformability, which a change in the cell shape can cause, modification of cell membrane or a shift in cytosol composition, can occur due to various pathological conditions or as a part of normal RBC aging (in vitro or in vivo). However, despite extensive research, we still do not fully understand the processes leading to increased cell rigidity under cold storage conditions in a blood bank (in vitro aging), In the present review, we discuss publications that examined the effect of RBCs' cold storage on their deformability and the biological mechanisms governing this change. We first discuss the change in the deformability of cells during their cold storage. After that, we consider storage-related alterations in RBCs features, which can lead to impaired cell deformation. Finally, we attempt to trace a causal relationship between the observed phenomena and offer recommendations for improving the functionality of stored cells.

AB  - Target 2 of the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 aims at the deployment of Green Infrastructure (GI) and the restoration of at least 15% of degraded ecosystems. We assess different alternatives for the spatial planning of GI and ecosystem restoration across the European Union by using spatial conservation prioritization tools. We compared three different scenarios for the identification of priority areas in which the ecosystem service potential, beneficiaries (i.e. people) and ecosystem condition play different roles. As an example of GI restoration, we also assessed the cost-effectiveness of removal of invasive alien species in the areas prioritized under each scenario.
   The comparative assessment of the spatial alternatives for GI shows synergies and conflicts. We found that GI could be efficiently established close to densely populated areas, since high multi-functionality is delivered in these locations (close to human settlements). However, restoration costs, such as the removal of invasive alien species, were higher in such areas given the influence of urban pressures. We also found that GI prioritized in areas under poor ecosystem condition would require a larger spatial extent of implementation, due to a lower ecosystem service potential per unit area.
   Given the scarcity of resources for investment in GI and ecosystem restoration, win-win situations should be identified where GI designation can deliver several policy objectives simultaneously. The prioritization framework we have presented here could also be applied at the country or regional level to support local planning.

AB  - The use of visual information is a very well known input from different kinds of sensors. However, most of the perception problems are individually modeled and tackled. It is necessary to provide a general imaging model that allows us to parametrize different input systems as well as their problems and possible solutions. In this paper, we present an active vision model considering the imaging system as a whole (including camera, lighting system, object to be perceived) in order to propose solutions to automated visual systems that present problems that we perceive. As a concrete case study, we instantiate the model in a real application and still challenging problem: automated visual inspection. It is one of the most used quality control systems to detect defects on manufactured objects. However, it presents problems for specular products. We model these perception problems taking into account environmental conditions and camera parameters that allow a system to properly perceive the specific object characteristics to determine defects on surfaces. The validation of the model has been carried out using simulations providing an efficient way to perform a large set of tests (different environment conditions and camera parameters) as a previous step of experimentation in real manufacturing environments, which more complex in terms of instrumentation and more expensive. Results prove the success of the model application adjusting scale, viewpoint and lighting conditions to detect structural and color defects on specular surfaces.

AB  - As nuclear power plants seek to extend their licenses and maintain a high level of performance and safety, online monitoring and assessment of system degradation are becoming a crucial consideration. A goal of the DOE Light Water Reactor Sustainability program is the accurate estimation of the remaining useful life of nuclear power plant systems, structures, and components. Effective prognostic systems should seamlessly predict the remaining useful life from beginning of component life to end of component life, so-called Lifecycle Prognostics. When a component is first put into operation, the only information available may be past failure times of similar components or the expected distribution of failure times derived from reliability analyses of these data (Type I Prognostics). These data provide an estimated life for the average component operating under average usage conditions. As the component operates, it begins to consume its available life at a rate largely influenced by the system and environmental stresses. Information from these recorded stresses can be used to update the expected failure time distribution (Type II Prognostics). The incorporation of stressor information allows for the estimation of the remaining useful life for an average component operating under specific usage conditions. After continued operations, measurable levels of degradation may evolve, which allows for further improvement of the failure time distribution estimate by incorporating these health indicators (Type III Prognostics). This article presents a framework for using Bayesian methods to transition between prognostic model types and to update failure time distribution estimates as new information becomes available.

AB  - Polylepis forests are the world's highest forests in terms of elevation and host a unique biodiversity of plants and animals. Unfortunately, these forests are rapidly disappearing due to human impact and are one of the most threatened ecosystems of South America. This paper deals with liverwort diversity inPolylepisforests of Ecuador. Liverworts are very diverse in tropical forests and are sensitive indicators of changes in humidity conditions. By comparing species richness, species composition and composition of functional groups of liverworts in dry and humidPolylepisforest, we explore how liverwort diversity ofPolylepisforests is affected by climatic conditions differing in humidity. We inventoried liverwort diversity inPolylepis pautaforest of Lagunas de Mojanda reserve characterized by a relatively dry climate and in the paramo of Papallacta with a humid climate. In each site, we sampled liverworts on 10P. pautatrees and surrounding soil. Species richness was highest in the humid forest and species composition in the two sites differed significantly. The two sites also had very different patterns of functional groups, with smooth mats dominating the liverwort flora of Mojanda while rough mats prevailed at Papallacta. This underscores the importance of bryophyte life forms as climate indicators in tropical forests. A phytogeographic comparison of the two sites showed a higher number of northern Andean taxa in the humid forest. The greater representation of species with restricted ranges in humidPolylepisforest shows the importance of these forests for conservation.

AB  - Studies of germination behavior and seedling establishment contribute to the development of appropriate methods of forest species management. The aim of this study was to investigate germination and seedling growth of tamboril (Enterolobium contorsiliquum (Veil.) Morong), taking into account environmental factors and seed weight. Seeds were separated into three weight classes (light, medium and heavy), to determine the moisture content percentage and thousand-seed weight per class. Seeds from each class were then tested for germination. The experimental design was completely randomized with a 2x3x4 factorial arrangement of treatments: two light conditions (presence and absence), three weight classes (Light < 0.7 g; Medium 0.7 to 0.8 g; Heavy > 0.8 g) and four temperatures (20, 30, 40 and 20-30 degrees C), with four replications each. Percentage of germination and germination speed index for seed vigor were determined. For the evaluation of seedling growth, the length and dry mass of both the shoot and root were determined. When the data proved normal, ANOVA and Tukey tests (p <= 0.05) were conducted to compare treatment means. Non-normal data were analyzed using nonparametric Mann-Whitney test (p <= 0.05). Germination speed index, shoot dry mass and root dry mass data presented a normal distribution, allowing for ANOVA testing. Germination occurred regardless of light conditions, with a higher speed at 40 degrees C, although this temperature was detrimental to seedling growth. The temperature of 30 degrees C promoted better germination (>80 %) and seedling growth. Heavy seeds displayed improved germination and produced more vigorous seedlings.

AB  - This paper presents a method to investigate the relative influence of waves, wind-induced currents and tidal currents on sediment mobility in coastal environment. It is based on the assumption that, knowing high uncertainties linked to sediment dynamics studies, simple sediment mobility indicators are sufficient tools to provide useful information. This method is based on five main steps: (1) assessing hydrodynamic conditions and related errors spatially and temporally for an area; (2) evaluating the bottom shear stress induced by these hydrodynamic conditions; (3) providing simple sediment mobility indicators; (4) analysing the sensitivity of these indicators to the existing hydrodynamic uncertainties; (5) interpreting indicators knowing their limits (identified in the sensitivity analysis). This methodology is applied to a test site on the inner shelf, seaward of the Pertuis Charentais region in France. Using wave (SWAN) and sea-level and currents (MARS-2DH) modelling, we study the spatial distribution of the relative contribution of waves, tides and wind-induced current in the non-cohesive sediment mobility under storm conditions. The deduced sediment dynamics indicators reveal the dominant action of waves in sediment initiation in the offshore area, in water depths of up to 60 m. The sensitivity study, performed in order to evaluate the validity of results, shows that the sediment mobility indicators still provide relevant information, even for hydrodynamic uncertainties of +/- 20% or furthermore when only a qualitative sedimentological knowledge of the area is available.

AB  - Heracleum mantegazzianum, a tall forb from the western Caucasus invaded several different habitats in the Czech Republic. The relation between invasion success and type of recipient habitat was studied in the Slavkovsky les hilly ridge, Czech Republic. The vegetation of 14 habitat types a occurring in an area of ca. 25 km(2) was analysed using phytosociological releves, and the invasion success of Heracleum (in terms of number of localities, area covered and proportion of available area occupied) was recorded separately in each of them. Site conditions were expressed indirectly using Ellenberg indicator values. The hypothesis tested was that Heracleum spreads in the majority of vegetation types regardless of the properties of the recipient vegetation.
   Community invasibility appeared to be affected by site conditions and the composition of the recipient vegetation. The species is not found in acidic habitats. Disturbed habitats with good possibilities of dispersal for Heracleum seeds are more easily invaded. Communities with a higher proportion of phanerophytes and of species with CS (Competitive/Stress-tolerating) strategy were more resistant to invasion. The invasion success was bigger in sites with increased possibilities of spread for Heracleum diaspores. Communities invaded by Heracleum had a lower species diversity and a higher indicator value for nitrogen than not-invaded stands. It appears that species contributing to community resistance against invasion of Heracleum, or capable of persisting in Heracleum-invaded stands, have similar ecological requirements but a different life strategy to the invader.

AB  - Numerous chronic health effects might be caused by the presence of chemical constituents in reclaimed water; however, an acute risk for water-borne diseases is mostly associated with pathogens. For potable reuse applications, the greatest risk among pathogens is posed by viruses due to their small size and low infectious dose. An advanced water treatment train not utilizing high-pressure membranes but employing the novel SMARTplus biofilter with highly controlled plug-flow and redox conditions was proposed and tested during a 3D-pilot-scale study as a barrier against viruses. Spiking tests with bacteriophages (MS2 and phi X174) and murine norovirus-1, accompanied by the conservative tracer, primidone, were conducted to study their transport and maximal reduction under controlled hydraulic conditions. While maintaining plug-flow conditions, mean log reduction values (LRVs) of 5.1, 5.0, and 3.5 were achieved for MS2, phi X174, and murine norovirus-1, respectively. Given the short hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 12.6 h and a travel distance of 6 m, the demonstrated LRVs in the pilot-scale SMARTplus bioreactor were significantly higher than conventional slow sand filters. This SMARTplus-based advanced water treatment train, employing post UV-disinfection followed by subsequent groundwater recharge as environmental buffer, would comply with the performance targets for potable water reuse defined by WHO.

AB  - Objective: The objective of the paper is to find out the conditions for enhancing the students' learning capacity based on the use of computerized dynamic adaptive tests in identifying the structure elements of compound objects and to give grounds for them. At present, the requirements for the results of educational institution students' professional training have made relevant the problem of developing dynamic adaptive tests in compound objects identification that ensure conditions for self-learning.
   Method: The key method for the investigation of this problem is made up by the analysis of psychological and pedagogical theory and generalization of results of scientific studies by the Russian and foreign scientists in dynamic adaptive testing in education, in particular: the activity-based approach for carrying out developmental teaching under the instructional feedback; the environmental approach relying on learning with reinforcement in conditions of assessment feedback.
   Results: Based on the results of the theoretical research computer dynamic adaptive tests in identifying objects of anatomy have been created, the model for diagnosing the procedural characteristics of students' learning activity has been developed. The effectiveness of dynamic adaptive testing in diagnosing the development of students' cognitive abilities is represented and proven.
   Conclusion: The suggested model of dynamic adaptive tests in identifying the structure of anatomy objects allows timely diagnosing the procedural characteristics of medical students' learning activity within the educational process. It also made possible to formulate the main principles of dynamic adaptive testing based on the assessment feedback in education.

AB  - The palmetto weevil, Rhynchophorus cruentatus (Fabricius), is a pest of cultivated palms in Florida. The larvae of this species and 2 other important Rhynchophorus pests, R. ferrugineus (Olivier) and R. palmarum (L.), feed internally and cause structural damage to palm fronds, trunks, and offshoots. Often, infestations are not detected until the tree suffers irreparable damage. Acoustic methods used previously to detect R. ferrugineus in field environments were applied to investigate detectability of early instar R. cruentatus larvae. Sounds from neonates inoculated into palm fronds were recorded for 120 s periods at 7-day intervals for 56 days in urban (exposed) and acoustically shielded (enclosed) conditions that might be encountered when screening offshoots for sale or transportation. The sounds were classified by automated spectral analyses into multiple categories, including vehicle noise, bird calls, and broadband, 0.3-3-ms larval sound impulses. Because spectral characteristics alone are not always reliable identifiers of larval signals in wood, the analyses also identified trains of 6 or more closely grouped larval impulses called bursts to help classify fronds as infested or uninfested. Larval bursts were produced at sufficient rates to classify inoculated fronds correctly each day of testing, although molting and resting behaviors resulted in the absence of bursts in 6-50% of individual, 2-min recordings. The rates of larval bursts were not significantly different in paired comparisons of recordings obtained from the same frond on the same day under urban and shielded conditions, which suggests that bursts are useful as indicators of Rhynchophorus infestations in a variety of conditions.

AB  - Current and historical livestock movement patterns are explored in a semi-arid communal environment in central-north Namibia, placed in context of increasing population, large-scale enclosures, increased water supply and changing vegetation. Fanner's knowledge of movements, rangeland potential, vegetation condition and plant indicators was gathered and analysed with various methods such as Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). Local rangeland units were mapped with Landsat TM imagery and analysed with a Geographical Information System (GIS). The data suggest that good grazing was previously maintained by low herbivore pressure and frequent fires in a management regime controlled by hunter-gatherers and limited permanent water supply.
   Population increase in settled areas starts migration to more fertile land units in previous prime grazing areas causing a conflict between grazing and cropping and a decrease in grazing condition triggering further migration and need for new water supply. Recent large-scale enclosures are targeting predominantly more fertile land units with the most palatable perennial grass species and water, causing further conflict for communal farmers.
   Having reached the frontier of the traditional land there is no space for further expansion, resulting in the need to adapt to uncertainty with annual grasses more dependent on rainfall. Livestock movement patterns have changed drastically for large herd owners from transhumance and migration to largely permanent cattle posts. Small herd owners face increasing longer movements between kraals, water points, depending on less suitable and decreased unfenced grazing lands. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The objective of the paper was to determine the effects of the cultivar, year and cultivar x year interactions on the expression of several technological quality characters in winter wheat grown under semiarid conditions of the Vojvodina province, Yugoslavia. Twenty-three winter wheat cultivars were grown over a seven-year period (1990-96). The harvested grain was milled and the flour was analysed for protein content, wet gluten, bread yield and loaf volume. The significance of cultivar x year interactions was determined using two parameters of stability - the coefficients of regression and deviation from regression. In protein content, wet gluten and bread yield, the contribution of the year to total variance was higher than that of the cultivar, while for loaf volume the situation was the opposite. The parameters of stability showed that a number of cultivars exhibited stability for some of the quality indicators under investigation. However, only the cultivar Proteinka had both a high phenotypic value and high environmental stability for all the traits involved. In order to reduce the negative effects of cultivar x environment interactions on the technological quality of winter wheat, we need to develop cultivars that have a high potential for yield and technological quality as well as tolerance to soil and air droughts at grain fill, so that they are suitable for growing under semiarid conditions.

AB  - Climate change should lead to massive loss of biodiversity in most taxa, but the detailed physiological mechanisms underlying population extinction remain largely elusive so far. In vertebrates, baseline levels of hormones such as glucocorticoids (GCs) may be indicators of population state as their secretion to chronic stress can impair survival and reproduction. However, the relationship between GC secretion, climate change and population extinction risk remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether levels of baseline corticosterone (the main GCs in reptiles) correlate with environmental conditions and associated extinction risk across wild populations of the common lizard Zootoca vivipara. First, we performed a cross-sectional comparison of baseline corticosterone levels along an altitudinal gradient among 14 populations. Then, we used a longitudinal study in eight populations to examine the changes in corticosterone levels following the exposure to a heatwave period. Unexpectedly, baseline corticosterone decreased with increasing thermal conditions at rest in females and was not correlated with extinction risk. In addition, baseline corticosterone levels decreased after exposure to an extreme heatwave period. This seasonal corticosterone decrease was more pronounced in populations without access to standing water. We suggest that low basal secretion of corticosterone may entail downregulating activity levels and limit exposure to adverse climatic conditions, especially to reduce water loss. These new insights suggest that rapid population decline might be preceded by a downregulation of the corticosterone secretion.

AB  - Introduction. Black Leaf Streak Disease (BLSD) is the most important foliar disease affecting banana production worldwide. A forecasting system has been developed and implemented in various countries aiming at optimal control of BLSD through minimum applications of fungicide. In Dominican Republic, favorable dry climatic conditions contrast with serious organizational issues for BLSD control. Our objective was to evaluate the adaptation of this forecasting strategy in these specific conditions. Materials and methods. Fungicide resistance analyses were carried out in the northwestern region of Dominican Republic, in order to determine the appropriate spectrum of systemic fungicides for the forecasting strategy. Three field experiments were set up on commercial farms where disease evolution was monitored every week, on reference plots, in order to decide the pertinence of fungicide applications. Results. Fungicide resistance to QoI fungicides and strong sensitivity reduction to DMI (Demethylation Inhibitor) fungicides were detected in all farms. In spite of these limitations in the use of some fungicide groups, disease control was achieved with a limited number of fungicide applications (6-9), as compared with 13-26 applications in most commercial farms of Dominican Republic over the same period. Discussion. The calculation of an indicator of the efficiency of the chemical control confirmed the potential of the forecasting strategy, underlining the influence of crop management as well as the neighboring environment of the farms on its efficiency. The requirements for further generalization of this system to commercial farms of this country are discussed.

AB  - Studies of Lake Pontchartrain benthic invertebrates and submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) from 1996 through 2005 provided the opportunity to determine community responses to severe disturbances including: recovery from shell dredging; effects of anoxia and hypoxia from saltwater intrusion; the 1997 Bonnet Carre Spillway opening; a prolonged drought resulting from an El Nino Southern Oscillation; and effects of Hurricane Katrina. We included reviews and updates of our recently published work, an integrated analysis of findings, and restoration recommendations. During this decadal study there were no prolonged periods of "normal" conditions. Instead, benthos and SAV were experiencing or recovering from significant temporal disturbances. This made it difficult to use the abundance of a particular set of organisms at a point in time to evaluate habitat quality or restoration success without considering past disturbance effects. Benthos species diversity and the relative abundance of stress tolerant groups such as annelids were good indicators of short-term adverse conditions, but rapid changes occurred in response to salinity and dissolved oxygen. Rangia cuneata was a good indicator of the extent of hypoxia and long-term damage from hurricanes. The distribution and abundance of SAV decreased with turbidity and nutrient increases, and Vallisneria americana and other freshwater SAV decreased with prolonged salinity increases. Resistance to and resilience after disturbances and natural changes during long term cycles have to be considered in evaluating habitat condition and restoration success.

AB  - The floral traits of the inflorescences of angiosperms have coevolved to ensure and maximize pollination success. Other factors believed to influence floral architecture are external (for example, ecological) to the inflorescence. In order to understand the relationships between such factors and floral characters, 12 floral traits were measured in 54 species of Araceae. An analysis was performed to determine how these traits are linked to the following: (1) self-pollination capacity; (2) life form (evergreen versus seasonally dormant); (3) climatic conditions; and (4) type of pollinator (i.e. flies, bees, or beetles). A significant difference was found between the pollen to ovule ratio of the species able to self-pollinate and those unable to self-pollinate. Evergreen and tropical aroids produced a larger number of gametes than did seasonally dormant and temperate taxa. Finally, several floral traits, such as pollen volume and number, number of female flowers, and flower sexual type (unisexual or bisexual), showed clear differences between the three pollinator types. Variations in floral traits between the different life forms and climatic conditions are discussed with respect to pollination efficiency and properties of the growing season. The pollen to ovule ratio cannot be considered as an accurate indicator of breeding systems in aroids because of the particular pollination ecology of the family.

AB  - Intense reuse of treated wastewater in agriculture is practiced all over the world, especially in arid and water-scarce regions. In doing so, pharmaceutical residues in the water are irrigated to the soil and subsequently can percolate into the local aquifers. Since evaporation rates in these areas are typically high, persistent substances might enrich in the groundwater recharge of closed catchments like the Jordan Valley. Against this background, unsaturated column tests were conducted to investigate the potential for evaporative accumulation of the two pharmaceuticals bezafibrate and carbamazepine under simulated arid climate conditions. Parallel tests were conducted with inhibited microbiological activity where both substances showed an increase in the effluent concentrations proportional to the evaporation loss of the inflow solution. The mean accumulation factors of the pharmaceuticals correspond to the evaporated water loss. The experiments indicate the accumulation potential for pharmaceuticals with high persistence against biodegradation. For the first time, the overall potential for evaporative enrichment could be demonstrated for pharmaceuticals. Under the given experimental conditions, the two investigated pharmaceuticals did not enrich faster than chloride, which might result in soil salting prior to reaching harmful pharmaceutical concentrations in soil water. The findings are relevant to future assessments of environmental impacts of persistent trace substances, which need to take into account that concentrations in the aquatic cycle might increase further due to evaporative enrichment.

AB  - Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) are large-bodied, long-lived mammals that live only in the circumpolar Antarctic. As such, they represent an ideal sentinel species for the impacts of environmental change on polar species. However, longitudinal physiological studies of marine mammals are notoriously difficult due to their largely aquatic lifestyle, such that many baseline indicators of health and condition are not well defined. Fifty known-age, adult seals (9-27 years, 24 males, 26 females) in McMurdo Sound were sampled for mass, total body fat, blubber depth and a suite of blood parameters (21 variables) to assess hydration state, nutritional plane, reproductive hormones (females only), organ function and immune status. Total body mass increased with age, whereas variation in blubber depth was best described by mass and/or sex, with an overall greater blubber thickness in female seals (p < 0.001). Ten blood parameters showed a significant effect of one or more model variables, most prominently between the sexes. Serum chemistry suggested that females were better nourished and displayed lower indicators of acute stress compared to males. We noted limited age-related declines that might indicate impaired organ function. Overall, seals demonstrated clinically normal values for large mammals, even at the upper end of the age continuum. Future physiological studies in this species are strongly encouraged to incorporate potential sex effects in experimental design and analysis. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to enlighten existing gender differences in the linkages between university ecosystem, self-efficacy and entrepreneurial intention in a developing country. Design/methodology/approach The empirical exercise relies on Partial Least Squares Structural Equations Modeling based on data from a probabilistic sample of 467 Brazilian students of 70 universities across the country. Findings The university ecosystem positively influences self-efficacy and entrepreneurial intention. Entrepreneurial intention is also influenced by self-efficacy. Gender difference lies in females' self-efficacy, which presents a higher impact on entrepreneurial intentions. Research limitations/implications The research used a secondary database, which offered a limited view of the constructs analyzed. Moreover, by evaluating perception conditions, students' self-evaluation may not offer conditions to better comprehend higher education organizations conditions. Practical implications This paper provided an evaluation of entrepreneurship in universities and gender differences, also presenting an analysis tool for university ecosystems. The assessment of the university ecosystem in two dimensions helps to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of university ecosystems and also the impact they can have on the entrepreneurial ecosystems in which they are inserted. Originality/value This study added in-depth information on the dynamics of entrepreneurial universities and gender differences in the context of a developing country, with a probabilistic sample. Both the comprehensive analysis of the model and the assessment at the variable level bring new evidence that can guide entrepreneurship-oriented initiatives in universities.

AB  - Energy and the environment has long been a topic of concern. Activated carbon (AC) is a widely used highperformance industrial material. Agricultural and forestry waste (AFW) is a sustainable and economical resource for AC production. In the field of AFW-derived AC (AFWAC) research, the characteristics of the pore structure are important indicators of the quality and possible applications of AFWAC. Therefore, it is of great significance to conduct in-depth studies on the factors affecting the pore structure in the preparation process of AFWAC, and to control and predict the properties and extent of the pore structure of AFWAC during the preparation so its performance can also be controlled. In this paper, various preparation methods and condition parameters of AFWAC are reviewed, including carbonization and activation methods, and the effects of AFW types, activator types, activator amount, activation temperature, and activation time on the pore structure of AFWAC are discussed in detail. Second, other properties and an economic analysis of AFWAC are carried out. Finally, the specific application of AFWAC with different pore structure characteristics in gas and liquid phase adsorption is expounded. This review promotes the research of AFWAC and its real-world applications by optimizing different preparation methods and conditions to effectively obtain high-performance, low-cost, and targeted AFWACs suitable for different applications.

AB  - Forest succession depends strongly on the life history strategies of individual trees. An important strategic element is the ability to survive unfavourable environmental conditions that result in strongly reduced tree growth. In this study, we investigated whether the relationship between growth and mortality differs among tree species and site conditions. We analysed 10 329 trees of nine tree species (Picea abies, Taxus baccata, Fagus sylvatica, Tilia cordata, Carpinus betulus, Fraxinus excelsior, Quercus robur, Betula spp. and Alnus glutinosa) from unmanaged forests of Europe: the continental Bialowieza forest (Poland) and several oceanically influenced Swiss forest reserves. For each species, we calculated a set of flexible logistic regression models with the explanatory variables growth (as measured by relative basal area increment), tree size and site. We selected the species-specific model with the highest goodness-of-fit and calculated its discriminatory power (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC) and calibration measures. Most models achieved at least a good discriminatory power (AUC >0.7) and the AUC ranged from 0.62 to 0.87; calibration Curves did not indicate any overfittring. Almost all growth-mortality relationships differed among species and sites, i.e. there is no universal growth-mortality relationship. Some species Such as F. excelsior showed reduced survival probabilities for both unfavourable and very good growth conditions. We conclude that the growth-mortality relationships presented here can contribute to the life-history classification of trees and that they should also help to improve projections of forest succession models.

AB  - Physical (aggregate stability and bulk density) and microbiological (enzyme activities and labile carbon fractions) properties were studied in soils from a degraded mining site and two areas revegetated with Casuarina equiset folia L. ex J.R. & G. Forst. or Anacardium occidentale L. under subtropical conditions. An adjacent soil under natural vegetation was used as a standard of local, high quality soil. Six years after planting, revegetation with C. equisetifolia or A. occidentale had resulted in higher soil total organic C, water soluble C and carbohydrates, total N content and aggregate stability compared with the bare soil. Soil bulk density decreased sharply after planting of both the tree species, approaching that of soil under native vegetation. Protease-BAA and P-glucosidase activities were higher in the soil revegetated with C. equisetifolia than in that revegetated with A. occidentale, while the remaining activities reached similar values in both the revegetated soils, these being higher than those of the bare soil. It may be concluded that revegetation with C. equisetifolia or A. occidentale rapidly improved soil physical and microbiological properties of a mining area under subtropical conditions. Soil enzyme activities and labile carbon fractions were very sensitive indicators of the improvement in soil quality resulting from the revegetation. Over the duration of this experiment, revegetated soils were still far from reaching the quality levels of the soil under natural vegetation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Maize (Zea mays L.) yield in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is low because of both abiotic and biotic constraints, and limited availability or use of improved seed in some areas. This study was conducted (i) to estimate combining ability and heterosis among seven stress-tolerant populations, and (ii) to assess diversity among the populations and the relationship between diversity and heterosis. Twenty-one hybrids developed from diallel crosses of seven populations, parents, and two checks were evaluated in 10 optimal and 11 stressed environments (drought, low N, and random stress) in Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, and Zimbabwe for 2 yr. Analysis II of Gardner and Eberhart showed that variety and heterosis were significant for grain yield (GY) under optimal and managed stress, and across environments. Heterosis accounted for most of the variation for GY among populations under optimal conditions (67%) and drought stress (53%), which suggested the importance of dominance in inheritance of GY under these conditions. Genetic distance (GD) among populations ranged from 0.328 to 0.477 (mean = 0.404). The correlation between GD and heterosis was low (r = 0.14-0.40) in all environments. The simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker-based and GY-based clustering of parental populations showed similar patterns, with three populations distinct from the rest, suggesting significant differentiation of allelic variation in these three populations. The SSR-based diversity and phenotypic analysis results should be useful in defining breeding strategies and maintaining heterotic patterns among these populations.

AB  - The contamination of water by adenoviruses (AdV), rotaviruses (genogroup A. GARV). and enteroviruses (EV), including bovine enterovirus (BEV). was assessed for the first time in Brazilian dairy farms. The area of study, at the municipality of Taquara, is highly representative of the dairy farms in Southern Brazil: the farms are small, high animal densities per grazing area are used, the management of manure is poor and the sanitation for the human excreta is also deficient. Conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was practiced to detect AdV, GARV, EV, and BEV in water samples taken from 27 collection sites in 10 dairy farms: two collections were made, after wet and dry weather conditions. For the first collection of water samples, during wet conditions posed by 18 consecutive days of rain prior to the sampling, 6 (22.2%) samples gave positive results for AdV and only 1 sample was positive for GARV. On the other hand, during the second collection, made under dry conditions, 4(16%) of the samples were positive for AdV, whereas 10(40%) samples gave positive results for GARV. EV was found on lower rates (9.6%) of the samples and BEV was not detected. Fecal contamination of water bodies is widespread on these farms, which could be confirmed either by detection of fecal coliforms and enteric viruses found. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The development of this study was oriented on the possibility of contribute to the evaluation and the conditioning of environmental characteristics of specific clippings of the Brazilian geographic space, in this sense, the proposed work provides conditions to evaluate and reflect on the environmental issues and concerns in Pontal do Paranapanema region. The implementation of this study has organized and produced information and data on the environmental characteristics of the remaining vegetation of two micro-basins located in the municipalities of Teodoro Sampaio and Mirante do Paranapanema in the state of Sao Paulo. The main objective of this work is not limited only to produce a report or generally characterizing the physical surroundings and environmental conditions, but also to collaborate both theoretically and technically on the possibility of environmental recovery and restoration of the most interesting within the observed cutout. The results obtained were achieved by building a methodology that would compile, in an organized way, several pieces of preliminary information and database supporting the steps of environmental analysis of the area at the office and in the fieldwork, and also a later thematic mapping of the area with different geoprocessing techniques. The theoretical understanding of this work has been founded on the appropriation of the idea that the activities implemented within the micro-basin has direct and indirect effects on the characteristics and, consequently, the environmental quality of the area; and whereas certain uses have produced harmful suppressions, impacts and shifts to the environment.

AB  - The article presents the results of 3 years study on the adaptation of the properties of various winter wheat varieties to the conditions of the submontane zone of the Central Caucasus. The indicator of the ontogenetic adaptability was the homeostaticity of the plants. We have studied thirty winter wheat varieties according to the parameters of ecological plasticity, productivity and resistance to the destructive complex of diseases and pests like Fusarium head blight, brown and yellow rust, Septoria blight, tan spot etc. The yield of the mixed variety crops was 4.5 t/ha; the increase was 9%. In the crops of the triple mixture of the strong Veda and Delta varieties (25%) with the valuable Batko variety (50%), which differed in resistance to various diseases, the average yield of 52 cwt/ha was obtained with the protein content of 12%, the gluten content of 28% and the flour strength of 320 a.u. The authors used the resistance of the precocious Kuma variety to the damage by the cereal leaf beetle as a protective screening crop along with the field perimeter. Such a screening crop of the stable variety prevents the colonization of the crops of the other less resistant varieties with pests. The genetic diversity of the variety creates the conditions for regulating and stabilizing the phytosanitary state of the crops and increasing their productivity. With this agrotechnical method, it becomes possible to regulate and stabilize the phytosanitary situation in the fields and to increase grain productivity and quality.

AB  - Hypoxia in near-bottom waters has been increasing globally. Dark plankton respiration is a key aspect of hypoxia studies. In situations where the general background eutrophication level is high, more blooms are found in estuaries and adjacent coastal zones, suggesting an increase in respiration from phytoplanlcton and heterotrophs. An assessment of the phytoplankton biomass-specific rate of dark plankton respiration is therefore of considerable value in terms of environmental assessments and modeling. During the summer of 2011 a series of concentrated in vitro incubation experiments were conducted on board a ship off the Changjiang Estuary and in the adjacent coastal zone, to simulate phytoplankton-driven dark plankton respiration under elevated phytoplankton biomass (i.e. high Chlorophyll a concentration) conditions and to further quantify the relationship between dark plankton respiration and phytoplankton biomass (measured as Chlorophyll a). A power function was used to elucidate the relationship for the concentrated incubation system. Based on our results we determined that the value for this constant was 0.67, which is similar to a previous value derived from other estuaries. Given the strong allochthonous (i.e. terrestrial) material input and the specific incubation condition, an empirical formula is suggested, which applies to conditions in which a high chlorophyll a concentration prevails and in situations where diatoms are the dominant phytoplankton.

AB  - Chydorus sphaericus, a cladoceran characterized by a wide range of distribution, is often numerous in various water habitats. Its body size is a consequence of environmental characteristics and physiology. The aim of the study focused on the distribution of body size and densities of C. sphaericus in relation to environmental conditions represented by: (i) habitat types (elodeids, helophytes, and the open water); (ii) specific pond types (forest and field); (iii) pond size (surface area); (iv) the presence/lack of fish; and (v) physicochemical factors. Similar to large daphnids, in the case of the examined small water bodies, fish presence was responsible for a reduction of the body size of C. sphaericus in the zone of open water. More abundant crustacean communities and the presence of larger specimens were found among macrophytes, which indicated that aquatic vegetation offered optimal growth conditions as well as an effective refuge against fish predation. These facts reflect the necessity for maintaining a varied mosaic of habitats even in small water bodies such as the examined ponds. We found that not only the abundance of C. sphaericus but also its body size can be used as an bioindicator of environmental conditions as it preferred small and eutrophic ponds, particularly those with complex macrophyte cover (such as elodeids). Furthermore, the abundance pattern of zooplankton dominant species was affected by elodeids and fish presence as well as by the area of the ponds.

AB  - We conducted an anthracological analysis of charcoal remains from Border Cave's member 1RGBS to provide environmental context for the site's occupation ca. 74 ka. Charcoal specimens were analyzed to assess their quality and quantity, and identify their tree taxa to reconstruct the vegetation communities available to the site's occupants. Specimens were analyzed using light stereomicroscopy and following standard anthracology methods. We identified the tree taxa that grow predominantly in the savanna, forest, and grassland vegetation communities. Using the current distribution of these communities as a reference, we suggest that the archaeological Border Cave landscape included vegetation types that now grow in southern Africa's interior warm parts. Our data revealed that Tarchonanthus sp. was collected most abundantly at this time, possibly for its medicinal and cosmetic properties. Euphorbia species were also collected, perhaps for their latex before their wood was burned. Furthermore, green wood logs of Tarchonanthus sp. were burned or discarded into the fire; this is evidenced by the high proportion of fragments of this species bearing radial cracks. There may have been unfavorable environmental conditions in the archaeological landscape that resulted in the wood vessel occlusion of many trees. These were likely episodic microclimatic conditions around the cave during some growth phases of the trees. These conditions and their intensity, however, were not fatal to the trees in this dataset.
