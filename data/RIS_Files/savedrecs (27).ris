AB  - Permanent grasslands produce high-quality forage and host very diverse plant communities. They also play a key role in carbon storage. However, we still understand little about how pedoclimatic conditions and plant community management or functioning help generate ecosystem services. This study analysed 32 grasslands in Normandy, Lorraine, and Auvergne that offer different ecosystem services. Certain grasslands had high values for service indicators. However, no synergies among services were observed, which suggests that determinant factors were different. A functional traits approach showed that plant community functioning directly affected forage quality. Plant diversity was tied to agricultural management and is also likely related to grassland history and landscape structure. Carbon storage levels were related to the clay content of soils.

AB  - This paper analyzes the predictive content of the level, slope and curvature of the yield curve for U.S. real activity in a data-rich environment. We find that, while the slope contains predictive power, the level and curvature are not successful leading indicators. The predictive power of each of the yield curve factors fluctuates over time. The results show that economic conditions matter for the predictive ability of the slope. In particular, inflation persistence emerges as a key variable that affects the predictive content of the slope. The slope tends to forecast the output growth better when inflation is highly persistent. (C) 2017 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Three trace heavy metals viz., nickel, copper and zinc were studied for their toxic action against Poecilia reliculata (Peters). Among these, copper was found to be most active followed by zinc and nickel. Accumulations of these metals as well as behavioural studies were carried out after exposing fish to sub-lethal concentration of LC20 It was found that the highest quantity of nickel was accumulated in the fish body followed by zinc and copper. After exposure to sub-lethal concentration of metals some behavioural changes in fish were observed due to stress, such as mucus like secretion over gills, excessive excretion, anoretic condition and increased distance between gills and operculum. In all the cases increased fin movement: was observed. Role and use of such changes as biological indicators or as biological early warning system in water quality assessment has been discussed.

TI  - MAPPING MULTIPLE PERCEPTIONS OF WILDERNESS IN SOUTHERN NEW-ZEALAND

KW  - SOLITUDE
AB  - New Zealand's wilderness areas are coming under increased pressure from both overseas and domestic tourists. At present, a limited number of Wilderness Areas are strictly defined in objective, physical terms, but a growing body of research suggests that wilderness conditions are perceived differently by different people. This paper takes a survey of wilderness imagery from among backcountry users and demonstrates how this can be related to four levels of wilderness perception. These are measured in terms of the artefacts, remoteness, naturalness and solitude that each group requires, or will accept, in a wilderness setting, as they perceive it. Using the northwestern South Island region of Nelson as an example, quantifiable indicators for each wilderness property are devised, and plotted for each purism class, using a GIS approach. Perceived wildernesses for each group are overlaid to provide a map of multiple perceptions of wilderness, and the value of this for management is discussed.

AB  - Analysis of spatiotemporal variations in forest ecohydrological characteristics is critical for understanding the impacts of climate change on forest ecological functions. In this study, using gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem water balance residual (eWBR) and ecosystem water use efficiency (eWUE) as forest ecohydrological function indices, and annual mean precipitation (MAP) and temperature (MAT) as climate indicators, we assessed the impacts of climate change on forest ecosystem in the Lancang-Mekong Region (LMR) during 19922016 (baseline) and 2020-2099 under different Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) climate scenarios. The coupled Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approaches-Gramineous Crop Growth (CASA-GRAMI) model, the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model, and the Hargreaves-Sumani method were employed to estimate GPP, eWBR, evapotranspiration (ET) and eWUE. The main findings are as follows: (i) GPP, eWBR and eWUE showed an increasing trend in the western parts of LMR during 1992-2099, with high values in the central and south-west of Myanmar, west and south of Thailand; (ii) eWBR decreased in most scenarios; while eWUE increases under RCP 2.6 scenario during 2030's (0.15 gC.kg(-1).H2O.yr(-1)) and 2050's (0.13 gC.kg(-1).H2O. yr(-1)) and slightly increases with a trend of 0.02 gC.kg(-1).H2O.yr(-1)) under RCP 8.5 scenario during 2050's; (iii) evergreen and deciduous broadleaved forests exhibit high GPP values, while deciduous broadleaved forest was characterized by lowest eWBR and declining trends in eWUE in future scenarios; (iv) MAT significantly correlated with GPP, eWBR and eWUE (R-2 >0.70) while MAP indicated a week correlation with GPP and eWUE (R-2 <0.50) in all the RCPs scenarios, which indicating that water-carbon cycles coupled with hydrothermal conditions may be a key control factor for carbon sequestration in LMR in the context of climate change.

AB  - We document changes in the number of sightings and timing of humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), blue (Balaenoptera musculus), and gray (Eschrichtius robustus) whale migratory phases in the vicinity of the Farallon Islands, California. We hypothesized that changes in the timing of migration off central California were driven by local oceanography, regional upwelling, and basin-scale climate conditions. Using 24 years of daily whale counts collected from Southeast Farallon Island, we developed negative binomial regression models to evaluate trends in local whale sightings over time. We then used linear models to assess trends in the timing of migration, and to identify potential environmental drivers. These drivers included local, regional and basin-scale patterns; the latter included the El Nino Southern Oscillation, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, which influence, wind-driven upwelling, and overall productivity in the California Current System. We then created a forecast model to predict the timing of migration. Humpback whale sightings significantly increased over the study period, but blue and gray whale counts did not, though there was variability across the time series. Date of breeding migration (departure) for all species showed little to no change, whereas date of migration towards feeding areas (arrival) occurred earlier for humpback and blue whales. Timing was significantly influenced by a mix of local oceanography, regional, and basin-scale climate variables. Earlier arrival time without concomitant earlier departure time results in longer periods when blue and humpback whales are at risk of entanglement in the Gulf of the Farallones. We maintain that these changes have increased whale exposure to pot and trap fishery gear off the central California coast during the spring, elevating the risk of entanglements. Humpback entanglement rates were significantly associated with increased counts and early arrival in central California. Actions to decrease the temporal overlap between whales and pot/trap fishing gear, particularly when whales arrive earlier in warm water years, would likely decrease the risk of entanglements.

AB  - Climate change and environmental degradation are an existential threat faced by Europe and the rest of the world. To overcome these challenges, Europe requires a new growth strategy that transforms the Union into a modern economy that uses resources efficiently and competitively. The use of natural technology for cooling buildings is attracting attention due to the growing interest in energy and environmental conservation. Therefore, given the great cooling potential from using the sky as a heat sink and to promote the integration of nocturnal dissipation systems that use this environmental heat sink, the authors present a study to assess the potential of radiative water-based cooling systems that use a radiant panel or flat surface and water supplied to an air treatment unit through a storage tank. The method implemented in the study is based on the characterization of supply and demand and the subsequent linking of both through the natural cooling technique. This method presents the definition of performance indicators that allow to determine if the application of natural cooling techniques are of interest in a specific place. The method may be applied directly to assess the energy savings achieved by incorporating these systems into specific design and operating conditions, and inversely, by evaluating the design and operating systems required by the systems studied to obtain a given saving. The results of the study of their potential use in Europe show that the use of natural radiative and falling-film technology is of great interest. From the results obtained, it stands out that the integration of the falling-film system can provide savings of more than 60% in extremely hot regions and much greater in areas with less cooling needs. From the studies carried out, it is concluded that the integration of the falling-film means that practically no part of Europe requires an additional cooling system, making the continent passive in terms of cooling and facilitating the achievement of the objectives set by the European Union.

AB  - Bacteria that pass through a 0.2-mu m pore-size filter (0.2-mu m-filterable bacteria) have been reported from various aquatic environments. It has been recognized that some 0.2-mu m-filterable bacteria are "transiently" small/thin cells, which are considered as starvation forms of heterotrophic bacteria, especially in oligotrophic environments. However, whether these "transiently 0.2-mu m-filterable bacteria" have roles in organic matter processing in aquatic environments has not yet been well described. Here we found high potential of the transiently 0.2-mu m-filterable bacteria with extracellular protease activity in their natural nutritional condition. We conducted microcosm experiments using 0.2-mu m-filtered coastal seawater (FSW) without any nutritional amendment, and monitored changes of the cell numbers trapped on a 0.2-mu m filter (not 0.2-mu m-filterable cells anymore) and their community structure in the FSW microcosms, with extracellular protease activities as indicators of heterotrophic microbial activity. We observed a rapid increase in the 0.2-mu m-trapped cell number in the FSW microcosms that originally included only 0.2-mu m-filterable microbes. The regenerating 0.2-mu m-trapped cells were typical marine bacteria (Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Flavobacteriia). Extracellular aminopeptidase activities increased with increasing numbers of 0.2-mu m-trapped cells. These results suggest that transiently 0.2-mu m-filterable-form bacteria in the original coastal seawater recovered their size and were producing extracellular proteases, which might catalyze organic matter processing in seawater. Since organic nutrients were not added, the size increase might be caused by the reduction in competition from larger bacteria and/or the absence of grazing pressure. Our results demonstrate the growth potential and extracellular protease activity of "transiently 0.2-mu m-filterable" bacteria in seawater, usually obscured due to the coexistence of grazers and other bacteria.

AB  - The application of organic fertilizers (60 t/ha of dung) to gray forest soils increases the proportion of deeply humified humus substances within a humus, so the soils become more cultured. The organic-mineral fertilizer system (12 t of dung and 220 kg of NPK - nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium - per 1 ha of crop rotation area) and the organic fertilizer system (24 t/ha of dung) result in humus wide reproduction at the level of 1,32% and 1,35% comparing to the initial level (1,20%). The regular input of fresh organic fertilizers into soil caused the 1,5-times increase of intensity of biological processes (according to CO2 release) if compared to the soil without such an input. The intensity of CO2 release rose by 56% while applying organic-mineral fertilizers, by 28% with organic fertilizers, and by 14% with mineral fertilizers if compared to the control soil without applying fertilizers (118 mg of carbon-dioxide per 1 sq.m./h). The input of organic fertilizers in soil changed the concentration of microorganisms which decompose cellulose, and they prove to be rather good indicators of changes of soil agronomical properties. The cellulose-decomposing activity of soil nourished only with mineral fertilizers was 38,9%, that is a medium intensity. The cellulose-decomposing activity of soil amended only with fresh organic fertilizers rose to 80% that corresponded to a strong intensity. Fertilizing with both organic and mineral material stimulated the process of cellulose decomposing up to 82,4%. The intensity of a nitrification process reflects a potential soil biological activity. According to the research, the low nitrification intensity was observed in soil without fertilization (12,8 mg/kg), while the nitrification intensity rose to 14,0 mg/kg after mineral fertilization and to 17,4 mg/kg after organic fertilization. We revealed that the nitrification ability of soil tended to increase up to 21,9 mg/kg following the combined application of organic and mineral fertilizers, consequently coordinating with cellulose-decomposing activity changes of soil microbial cenosis under field conditions.

AB  - Aeolian desertification has become one of the most serious environmental and socioeconomic problems facing the world today. Quantitative remote sensing technology is an important means to achieve the development trends of aeolian desertified land (ADL). To compensate for the shortcomings in the time scale of Landsat The matic Mapper and other high-spatial-resolution remote sensing data, this study introduces Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer time series data and products to invert the monitoring indicators of ADL. The QUEST (quick, unbiased, and efficient statistical tree) classification method was used to establish the extraction model of ADL based on multiple indicators. The ADL time series dataset was extracted from 2000 to 2015, and the characteristics of ADL and its spatial-temporal dynamics were analyzed. These results were combined with meteorological data and socioeconomic statistics to discuss the main factors influencing ADL. The results showed that, by the end of 2015, the total area of ADL was 32,633 km(2), accounting for 26.02% of the study area. The slight, moderate, severe, and extremely severe ADL accounted for 51.39%, 34.11%, 10.31%, and 4.20%, respectively. The total area of ADL decreased significantly at a rate of 2388.60 km(2) y(-1) from 2000 to 2015. The decreasing area was dominated by the slight and moderate ADL. The reversal of ADL exhibited significant correlations with an increase of annual precipitation and a decrease of annual maximum wind velocity (p < 0.01). The impact of annual maximum wind velocity on ADL is more important than annual precipitation. Increases in population density and the number of livestock did not promote the development of ADL. A series of ecological protection projects and policies created advantageous conditions for the reversal of ADL. This research provides a new method for monitoring ADL and useful information for controlling and managing aeolian desertification in this region. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In lotic ecosystems highly susceptible to anthropogenic activities, the influences of environmental variables on microbial communities and their functions remain poorly understood, despite our rapidly increasing sequencing ability. In this study, we profiled the microbial communities in the hyporheic sediments of a watershed undergoing intensive anthropogenic activities via next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA V4-V5 hypervariable regions on Illumina MiSeq platform. Tidal impacts on microbial communities were investigated via co-occurrence networks. In addition, the influences of physicochemical variables including salinity, and the concentrations of nutrients, organic matter and heavy metals on the microbial communities were explored via canonical correspondence analyses. The sediment samples were collected from 19 sites covering the whole main river stem of the target watershed (n = 19; Maozhou river watershed, Shenzhen, China). The samples were subdivided in the field for microbiological analyses and measurements of physicochemical variables. The results indicated that core microbiome was associated with archaea methanogens and bacteria members from Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, Synergistetes and Firmicutes, among which, gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria genera contributing to the cycling of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur were predominant. Site-specific microbiomes were revealed that may serve as indicators of local environmental conditions (e.g., members affiliated to Oceanospirillales were abundant at sites with salt intrusion). Distinct microbial co-occurrence networks were identified for non-tidal, inter-tidal and tidal sites. Major environmental factors influencing microbial community composition included the concentrations of nitrate and bicarbonate in river water, pore water concentrations of sulfate, dissolved organic carbon and electrical conductivity, as well as manganese concentrations associated with the solid sediment. Collectively, the results of this study provide fundamental insights into the influence of environmental perturbations on microbial community composition in a lotic system, which may aid in the design of effective remediation and/or restoration strategies in the target watershed and beyond.

AB  - Future climate change potentially can have a strong impact on the African continent. Of special concern are the effects on food security and the restricted adaptive capacity of Africa's poverty stricken population. Targeted policy interventions are, therefore, of vital importance. While there is a broad consensus on selection of climate and agricultural indicators, a coherent spatial representation of the populations' vulnerability is still subject to debate, basically because important drivers at household and institutional level are captured at the coarser (sub)-national level only. This paper aims to address this shortcoming by capitalizing on available spatially explicit information on households, food security institutions and natural resources to identify and characterize vulnerable groups in climate change prone areas of East and West Africa. First, we identify and localize groups with varying degrees of vulnerability, using food security and health indicators from georeferenced household surveys. Second, we characterize these vulnerable groups using statistical techniques that report on the frequency of occurrence of household characteristics, social bonding, remittances and agro-ecological endowments. Third we localize areas where climate change conditions affect production of major staple crops even after a maximum adaptation of crop rotations. Fourth, we characterize the vulnerable groups in the climate change affected areas and compare their profiles with the overall assessment to elucidate whether generic or climate change targeted policies are required. Since climate change will impact predominantly on agricultural production, our analysis focuses on the rural areas. For West Africa, we find that vulnerable groups in areas likely to be affected by climate change do not fundamentally differ from vulnerable groups in the study area in general. However, in East Africa there are remarkable differences between these groups which leads to the conclusion that in this part of Africa, poverty reducing strategies for climate change affected areas should differ from generic ones.

AB  - Many (palaeo-)environmental parameters can be deduced from ecological and chemical analyses of ostracods. However, the specific ecology of each taxon has a great impact on its reaction to changing environmental conditions. As a consequence, each taxon records these changes differently. The mean penetration depth (MPD) and relative individual abundances have been documented along sediment depth profiles for the dominant sub-littoral to profundal species of ostracods in western Lake Geneva, Switzerland, and this data can be used to estimate their preferential habitat in terms of sediment depths. Isocypris beauchampi, Limnocytherina sanctipatricii, Cypria ophtalmica forma lacustris at 13-m water depths, Limnocythere inopinata, and a winter generation of Herpetocypris reptans have the shallowest habitat preferences at the study sites (MPDs of 0.45, 0.48, 0.49, 0.60, and 0.81 cm, respectively). These results suggest that these populations may be regarded as being preferentially epifaunal forms. Populations of Cytherissa lacustris (MPDs of 0.61, 0.73, and 0.82 cm at 13-, 33-, and 70-m water depths, respectively), Cypria ophtalmica forma lacustris at 70 m (MPD = 0.96 cm), Fabaeformiscandona caudata (MPD = 0.99 cm), and a summer generation of Herpetocypris reptans (MPD = 1.03 cm) were identified as being infaunal. Candona neglecta is the species that was found the deepest in the sediment of Lake Geneva, with MPDs of 0.65, 1.22, and 1.30 cm at 13-, 33-, and 70-m water depths, respectively. Information on the sediment texture and oxygen concentrations inferred from the analyses of sediment pore water suggest that the oxygen content of the sediment pore water is not the only dominant parameter controlling the differences in ostracod sediment penetration depths observed among the different sites, but that they might also be influenced by the sediment 'softness,' which itself depends on grain size, water content, and the abundance of organic matter in sediment.

AB  - Most natural disasters are caused by water-/climate-related hazards, such as floods, droughts, typhoons, and landslides. In the last few years, great attention has been paid to climate change, and especially the impact of climate change on water resources and the natural disasters that have been an important issue in many countries. As climate change increases the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall, the number of water-related disasters is expected to rise. In this regard, this study intends to analyse the changes in extreme weather events and the associated flow regime in both the past and the future. Given trend analysis, spatially coherent and statistically significant changes in the extreme events of temperature and rainfall were identified. A weather generator based on the non-stationary Markov chain model was applied to produce a daily climate change scenario for the Han River basin for a period of 2001-2090. The weather generator mainly utilizes the climate change SRES A2 scenario driven by input from the regional climate model. Following this, the SLURP model, which is a semi-distributed hydrological model, was applied to produce a long-term daily runoff ensemble series. Finally, the indicator of hydrologic alteration was applied to carry out a quantitative analysis and assessment of the impact of climate change on runoff, the river flow regime, and the aquatic ecosystem. It was found that the runoff is expected to decrease in May and July, while no significant changes occur in June. In comparison with historical evidence, the runoff is expected to increase from August to April. A remarkable increase, which is about 40%, in runoff was identified in September. The amount of the minimum discharge over various durations tended to increase when compared to the present hydrological condition. A detailed comparison for discharge and its associated characteristics was discussed. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Question
   Is there a pattern in growth of annual rings in roots of perennial forbs in relation to climate and climate extremes in grassland ecosystems?
   Location
   Semi-arid grassland in Duolun (42 degrees 27'N, 116 degrees 41'E, 1380 m a.s.l.), central Inner Mongolia, China.
   Methods
   Main roots of three perennial species, Potentilla anserina L., Cymbaria dahurica L. and Lespedeza daurica Schindl., were sampled. Cross-sections (10-15-mu m thick) were produced from the proximal end of sampled roots using a sledge microtome. Annual growth rings in the main roots were identified and measured by differentiating between earlywood and latewood in the secondary xylem. Relationships between annual growth rings and monthly mean temperature and total monthly precipitation were identified using correlation analysis. Differences in an annual ring width to the previous and following years were examined by calculating a distinctness score.
   Results
   The three perennial forbs showed clearly demarcated annual growth rings in all individuals and the same fluctuation patterns. Their ring widths were generally positively correlated with precipitation from April to October (except for August) and with temperature from February to June (except June for L. daurica), September to October, and the annual mean. Strong deviations of annual ring widths from their neighbour rings were observed in 1998 and 2000. The trend of absolute distinctness scores (D-m) increased significantly from 1988 to 2003, indicating an increase in the frequency of annual ring width variation.
   Conclusions
   Annual growth rings in the main roots of three perennial forb species can be used as an indicator of the influence of climate on below-ground grassland growth. The change in below-ground conditions and effects on the functioning of grassland should receive more attention in future studies.

AB  - Rewetting of drained fens is necessary to stop further soil degradation and to reestablish important ecological functions. However, substantial changes of peat characteristics in the upper soil layers, due to drainage and land use, could counteract their recovery as nutrient-poor systems for an unknown period. We assessed the importance of altered peat properties, such as the degree of peat decomposition and the amount of redox-sensitive phosphorus (P) compounds, for P mobilization in different degraded fens. An experimental design involving 63 intact peat cores from fens with varying drainage and land-use histories was developed to quantify the mobilization of P, as well as that of iron (Fe), ammonium, carbon dioxide, and methane, all indicators of organic-matter decomposition and/or P-releasing processes. We found that net P release rates in peat cores with highly decomposed peat (range: 0.1-52.3 mg P.m(-2).d(-1)) were significantly correlated to the amount of P bound to redox-sensitive compounds and the molar Fe: P as well as Al:P ratios of peat. We conclude that the following general rules apply for P mobilization in rewetted fens: (1) elevated levels of P release rates and P concentrations in pore water up to three orders of magnitude larger than under natural reference conditions can only be expected for rewetted fens whose surface soil layers consist of highly decomposed peat; (2) peat characteristics, such as the amount of P bound to redox-sensitive Fe(III) compounds (positive correlation) and molar ratios of Fe: P or Al: P (negative correlations), explain the high range of P release rates; and (3) a critical P export to adjacent lakes or rivers can only be expected if molar Fe: P ratios of highly decomposed peat are less than 10.

AB  - Background: Regime shifts are abrupt changes encompassing a multitude of physical properties and ecosystem variables, which lead to new regime conditions. Recent investigations focus on the changes in ecosystem diversity and functioning associated to such shifts. Of particular interest, because of the implication on climate drivers, are shifts that occur synchronously in separated basins.
   Principal Findings: In this work we analyze and review long-term records of Mediterranean ecological and hydro-climate variables and find that all point to a synchronous change in the late 1980s. A quantitative synthesis of the literature (including observed oceanic data, models and satellite analyses) shows that these years mark a major change in Mediterranean hydrographic properties, surface circulation, and deep water convection (the Eastern Mediterranean Transient). We provide novel analyses that link local, regional and basin scale hydrological properties with two major indicators of large scale climate, the North Atlantic Oscillation index and the Northern Hemisphere Temperature index, suggesting that the Mediterranean shift is part of a large scale change in the Northern Hemisphere. We provide a simplified scheme of the different effects of climate vs. temperature on pelagic ecosystems.
   Conclusions: Our results show that the Mediterranean Sea underwent a major change at the end of the 1980s that encompassed atmospheric, hydrological, and ecological systems, for which it can be considered a regime shift. We further provide evidence that the local hydrography is linked to the larger scale, northern hemisphere climate. These results suggest that the shifts that affected the North, Baltic, Black and Mediterranean (this work) Seas at the end of the 1980s, that have been so far only partly associated, are likely linked as part a northern hemisphere change. These findings bear wide implications for the development of climate change scenarios, as synchronous shifts may provide the key for distinguishing local (i.e., basin) anthropogenic drivers, such as eutrophication or fishing, from larger scale (hemispheric) climate drivers.

AB  - The history of environmental changes and human activities in the catchment of Xingyun Lake, Yunnan Province, Southwest China, was investigated using an 85 cm sediment core drilled in the northwest part of the lake. The chronology of the sediment, established with the Pb-210 method, represented the most recent 160 years of depositional history. A series of lipids, including n-alkanes and n-alkanols, were identified by using GC/MS. The distinct n-alkanes and n-alkanols distributions at different depths are indicators of environmental changes. The carbon preference index (CPI) of the n-alkanes ranges from 0.55 to 3.35. The average chain length (ACL) ranges from 19.2 to 25.7. The ratios of the C27/C31 and C27/(C15+C17+C19) are between 0.43-1.63 and 0.05-0.85, respectively. The ratio of the higher carbon components to the lower of n-alkanes (H/L) and n-alkanols changes from 0.16 to 3.18 and 0.24-7.36, respectively. These ratios, compared with the temperature record of the meteorological station in the catchment, reveal a remarkable relationship: high H/L values correspond to warm climate conditions and vice versa. Four stages were recognized according to the sediment records for the past 160 years: a cold period before the 1920s, a warm period from the 1920s to the mid-1950s, a cool period between the mid-1950s and 1970s, and a warm period after the 1980s. The proxies also reveal the organic origin of the lake sediment. Human activity led to great environment change, such as the Gehe channel dredging in 1923, denudation and excessive reclamation at the end of the 1950s, and especially the eutrophication of the lake since about the early 1990s. The lipids are a sensitive recorder of the environment changes, although the strong increase of human activities may affect the record of natural changes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

AB  - Two soil chronosequences of mountainous ecosystems in Switzerland served as the basis to calculate the accumulation of soil organic matter, transformation of pedogenic Fe and Al and net losses of the main elements (Ca, Mg, K, Na, Fe, Al, Mn and Si) by means of mass-balance calculations. Elemental losses due to deglaciation and exposure to the weathering environment were calculated. These mass balance calculations indicate that extensive mineral weathering resulted in significant leaching losses of Si, major base cations, and Al (particularly from the upper horizons). The losses are especially pronounced in the early stages of soil formation. In most cases, the exponential decay model incorporating an asymptotic or logarithmic regression model seems to provide a good description of weathering. The greatest changes in the soil chemistry of these alpine soils on granitic host material occurred within the first 3000-4000 years of soil development. Later, the weathering rates decreased rapidly and the overall depletion of elements nearly reached an asymptote. We also found that the mean ratio of [AltFed]/[AldFet] of the fine earth of the A, E and B horizons is closely linked to the duration of soil development. A very rapid decrease of this ratio also occurred at the beginning of soil evolution in order to reach asymptotic values after about 3000 years. Consequently, this ratio could be a good indicator of the age of alpine soils. Furthermore, there is a close relationship between the mass of organic C or N in the whole profile and the soil age: the older the soil the higher the corresponding mass per unit area. The chronofunctions presented give a first attempt of the chemical soil evolution in the Alps. However, only little data has been available up until now regarding alpine soils, and this fact inhibits a more detailed observation of the changes that have occurred over a period of 2000-8000 years of soil formation under similar climatic conditions.

AB  - Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a leading cause of spinal cord injury and a major contributor to morbidity resulting from narrowing of the spinal canal due to osteoarthritic changes. This narrowing produces chronic spinal cord compression and neurologic disability with a variety of symptoms ranging from mild numbness in the upper extremities to quadriparesis and incontinence. Clinicians from all specialties should be familiar with the early signs and symptoms of this prevalent condition to prevent gradual neurologic compromise through surgical consultation, where appropriate. The purpose of this review is to familiarize medical practitioners with the pathophysiology, common presentations, diagnosis, and management (conservative and surgical) for DCM to develop informed discussions with patients and recognize those in need of early surgical referral to prevent severe neurologic deterioration.

AB  - Ecological monitoring requires sensitive and effective approaches to detecting polluting substances. One such approach involves tracking the behavioral responses of plankton that is initially adapted to normal habitat conditions. Zooplankton such as Daphnia are filter feeders that are highly sensitive to pollution. We describe how a submersible holographic camera with additional attracting lighting (at a wavelength of 532 nm) can be used to track changes of Daphnia response to light for a number of pollutants, including potassium dichromate and crude oil. Our laboratory experiments showed that the sensitivity of this method of bioanalysis is comparable to standard laboratory methods, but has the additional advantage that it can be used in real time in lakes and other water areas, and hence is more versatile than standard methods.

AB  - Replication is one of the three cornerstones of inference from experimental studies, the other two being control and randomization. In fact, replication is essential for the benefits of randomization to apply. In addition to ordinary replication, the repetition of treatments within a study, two other levels of replication have been identified. Pseudoreplication, a termed coined by Stuart Hurlbert, generally involves making multiple measurements on experiment units (which is commendable) and treating them as if they reflected independent responses to treatment (which is erroneous). Metareplication is a higher level of replication in which entire studies are repeated. Scientists are too much concerned about analysis of data within studies and too little concerned about the repeatability of findings from studies conducted under a variety of conditions. Findings that are consistent among studies performed at different locations at different times with different investigators using different methods are likely to be robust and reliable.

AB  - During the first half of the 20th century fluid inclusions have been studied in ore geology in order to determine the chemistry and physical parameters (density) of the mineralising fluids. Apart from a few pioneering works in the middle of the century, fluid inclusions were not used as structural markers before the late 1980s. During the same time, experiments as well as observations of natural samples have shown that the volume, shape and density of fluid inclusions may change when submitted to pressure-temperature conditions different from their trapping isochores.
   In view of these experiments, and based on natural examples from the Higher Himalaya metamorphic rocks, it is evident how fluid inclusions can be used as thermobarometric, structural and tectonic markers. Points of interest for further studies on fluid inclusions in nature and experiments are also stressed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Radiolarian assemblages from the plankton and sediments in various Norwegian fjords and sediments from stations in the Norwegian Sea were compared using multivariate analysis. The sediments were very different from all of the plankton in all seasons. This difference was the largest source of variability in the data set, followed in turn by differences due to season, regions, various fjords, depths arid locale within a given fjord. The sediments did not average the seasonal plankton signals observed, but did conserve most of the geographical information presented in the plankton assemblage. The information in the plankton and sediments was conveyed by different groups of species. While the sediments can be excellent indicators of environmental conditions in the overlying water column, they say relatively little about the species composition in the overlying plankton.

AB  - What drives the private sector's attitude toward the public sector? We address the question by regressing survey data on the perceived burden of government regulation on objective data on the nature, cost, and administration of the regulation of entry in different political and economic contexts. The results suggest that businesspeople perceive democratic, regulatory, and left-of-center governments to be inefficient, net of objective conditions, and tax havens to be well-governed despite-or perhaps due to-their lack of transparency. Our findings contribute to both the sociology of knowledge and political sociology by demonstrating that indicators of public sector performance that are derived from surveys of businesspeople and used by donors and investors are not only biased against liberal democracies that try to regulate and/or tax the private sector but-insofar as they influence the flow of public and private resources-a threat to regulation and redistribution in the twenty-first century.

AB  - Acid-sulfate minerals such as jarosite are often used as indicators of environmental conditions on Mars. These minerals form in a diverse set of environments on Earth; however, all known Martian jarosite deposits are most likely evaporative, from evaporation of either groundwater or ponded water. Here, we use the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars and High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment to report a new jarosite deposit along the southern wall of Ius Chasma. The morphology and geologic context of the Ius deposit are unique on Mars, and difficult to explain with an evaporative or groundwater mechanism. We propose instead that it was deposited along the margins of a past glacier. Such acid-ice interactions would be similar to those reported along the margins of Svalbard glaciers (arctic Norway), and would represent a new style of acid-sulfate formation on Mars.

AB  - The surface of Mars has long been considered a relatively oxidizing environment, an idea supported by the abundance of ferric iron phases observed there. However, compared to iron, manganese is sensitive only to high redox potential oxidants, and when concentrated in rocks, it provides a more specific redox indicator of aqueous environments. Observations from the ChemCam instrument on the Curiosity rover indicate abundances of manganese in and on some rock targets that are 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than previously observed on Mars, suggesting the presence of an as-yet unidentified manganese-rich phase. These results show that the Martian surface has at some point in time hosted much more highly oxidizing conditions than has previously been recognized.

AB  - Large losses of tropical forests result from the flooding of terrestrial ecosystems by mega hydroelectric dams. Because run-of-the-river dams operate based on smaller reservoirs with limited water storage, they have been generally considered less harmful to the environment, but their actual effects on biodiversity have been rarely measured. We herein estimate immediate impacts resulting from the flooding of the run-of-the-river Santo Antonio Hydroelectric on phyllostomid bat assemblages, based on the variation of their richness, abundance and species composition over the first two years after the establishment of the dam. We designed a standardized study integrating temporal sampling in areas that would and would not be flooded, before and after the establishment of the dam. We sampled 12 Pre-flood plots, and 34 plots that remained unflood. Among the non-flood plots, 25 were resampled after the river damming. We captured 3096 bats belonging to 59 species and found that the abundance of fruit bats decreased posterior to the formation of the dam. Moreover, the composition of fruit bats was different between the sampling periods, with a clear segregation of the vorzea plots of the pre-flood period. Comparisons between pre- and post-unflood plots revealed that 60% of the plots decreased in abundance of bats, and 68% decreased in abundance of phyllostomid fruit bats. Our results demonstrate that the run-of-the-river dam altered the phyllostomid species composition in the non-flooded areas after the establishment of the dam, reducing the abundance of frugivorous bats. Also, the remaining unflood areas did not incorporate bat assemblages from the vorzea forests that were permanently flooded by the reservoir. Based on our results, we suggest that environmental policies regulating the licensing processes for the implementation of large hydroelectric power stations should include orientation for the establishment of protected areas, as a condition for their operation. These areas can work as systematic instruments for biodiversity conservation, with special attention to the protection of the irreplaceable floodplain forests.

AB  - Paleobiology conservation is an emerging discipline with potential applications in the conservation of modern biodiversity. Ecological baselines based on paleontological information are effective tools for assessment of the conservation status of the present-day ecosystems, especially those with historical disturbance episodes. The aim of this study is the proposal of two Late Pleistocene ecological baselines in order to evaluate the depauperating degree of Mixteca Alta, a large extension in northwestern Oaxaca, southern Mexico. Comparison of alpha and beta diversity indexes of fossil and modern non-vagile animal assemblages (terrestrial gastropoda and rodents) were used to assess the resistance of Recent ecosystems. Ecosystem services of fossil and modern assemblages were compared to evaluate the recovery capacity of the present-day ecosystems. Late Pleistocene faunal assemblage is composed of six continental gastropod taxa, three species of micromammals, one species of medium-sized mammal, and ten species of large mammals. Recent faunal assemblage is constituted by five taxa of continental gastropods, six taxa of micromammals, and six taxa of medium-sized mammals. Concerning beta diversity, species turnover between Late Pleistocene and Recent is higher in rodents (beta(W) = 0.8) than in gastropods (beta(W) = 0.454). Peromyscus difficilis, Succinidae, Lymnaeidae and Physidae gastropods persist in the area since Late Pleistocene. The low diversity of some taxa suggests a possible low resistance of San Antonio Acutla's ecosystems. Three classes of ecosystem services provided by fauna (regulation of conditions of freshwater by living processes, weathering processes and their effect on soil quality, and seed dispersal) ocurred since the Late Pleistocene until present-day; this prevalence is an indicator of the apparently good health of these ecosystems. Late Pleistocene baselines provide valuable information to assure that ecosystems of San Antonio Acutla did not suffer, at the same severity, the degradation processes that affected ecosystems in other areas of Mixteca Alta, since the Late Pleistocene to present day.

AB  - Releases of oil and gas (OG) wastewaters can have complex effects on stream-water quality and downstream organisms, due to sediment-water interactions and groundwater/surface water exchange. Previously, elevated concentrations of sodium (Na), chloride (Cl), barium (Ba), strontium (Sr), and lithium (Li), and trace hydrocarbons were determined to be key markers of OG wastewater releases when combined with Sr and radium (Ra) isotopic compositions. Here, we assessed the persistence of an OG wastewater spill in a creek in North Dakota using a combination of geochemical measurements and modeling, hydrologic analysis, and geophysical investigations. OG wastewater comprised 0.1 to 0.3% of the stream-water compositions at downstream sites in February and June 2015 but could not be quantified in 2016 and 2017. However, OG-wastewater markers persisted in sediments and pore water for 2.5 years after the spill and up to 7.2-km downstream from the spill site. Concentrations of OG wastewater constituents were highly variable depending on the hydrologic conditions. Electromagnetic measurements indicated substantially higher electrical conductivity under the bank adjacent to a seep 7.2 km downstream from the spill site. Geomorphic investigations revealed mobilization of sediment is an important contaminant transport process. Labile Ba, Ra, Sr, and ammonium(NH4) concentrations extracted from sediments indicated sediments are a long-term reservoir of these constituents, both in the creek and on the floodplain. Using the drivers of ecological effects identified at this intensively studied sitewe identified 41 watersheds across the North Dakota landscape that may be subject to similar episodic inputs from OG wastewater spills. Effects of contaminants released to the environment during OG waste management activities remain poorly understood; however, analyses of Ra and Sr isotopic compositions, as well as trace inorganic and organic compound concentrations at these sites in pore-water provide insights into potentials for animal and human exposures well outside source-remediation zones.

AB  - Under current tomato cultivation conditions, measures aimed at preventing the development, reproduction, and distribution of the quarantine species of the South American tomato moth Tuta absoluta Meyr. in the steppe of Ukraine have been studied. Regional indicators on the distribution and peculiarities of biology and ecology of the South American tomato moth are estimated, both in importing tomatoes to Ukraine and in the use of modern technologies, mainly the range of insecticides, taking into account the organogenesis of cultivated plants. It specified the areas of new territories of moth reproduction by seasonal monitoring of the quarantine pest species development, considering the impact of globalization processes, changes in weather and climatic factors, and new ecosystems. We have determined biology and ecology indicators that affect the pest's acclimatization and occupation of new ecological niches in the structure of local species that affect tomatoes' yield and quality. Simultaneously, we have determined predictors for predicting the South American tomato moth's development and reproduction under the modern effectiveness of phytophage control measures at the species and population levels. The resistance of individual tomato varieties to Tuta absoluta was studied. The guidelines for determining the degree of phytophage colonization of tomatoes at the main stages of yield formation in vegetable crop rotations under relatively long reproduction and survival and a high pest population in the research region were developed. We have noted the importance of assessing the impact of rising air temperature on the duration of the autumn period of tomato growth and development and changes in moths' ecological optimum and pest spread in individual farms of the steppe zone. According to the population density indicators of this species, it was specified the mechanisms of tomato entomological community formation, taking into account the first years of localization of the South American moth foci. We have specified quarantine measures of phytophage control, both by the South American tomato moth phenology levels and the impact of agricultural background and weather fluctuations on moths number of generations, number, and survival rate these pests in the Ukrainian Steppe.

AB  - A suite of indicators have been developed in Canada to assess and report on the status and trends of agri-environmental performance as impacted by agricultural production activities. The indicators include models that focus on the impact of land management practices on soil erosion, water contamination, greenhouse gas emissions, soil organic carbon and wildlife habitat. Soil Cover is one of these indicators and relates to soil protection afforded by crop canopy, crop residue and snow. It is quantified by the equivalent number of days in a year in which the soil is not exposed, and is a function of the type of crop, biomass yield, tillage, residue management practices, and weather (snow) conditions. Higher soil cover indicates a lower risk of soil erosion, better maintenance of soil organic carbon, improved wildlife habitat and lower greenhouse gas emissions. The Soil Cover Indicator has been calculated and reported on a spatial basis over the entire country every five years since 1981. Currently, the agri-environmental indicators program is being re-oriented toward assessing the environmental sustainability of different production sectors (beef, hogs, dairy, grains, oilseeds, etc.) and commodities (milk, eggs, beef, pork, etc.) rather than geographic/areal units such as soil polygons or watersheds. As an initial effort in this direction, we have developed a farm types database on an ecostratification spatial framework, and have applied the Soil Cover Indicator to each farm type in order to assess its levels and changes pertaining to different farm types over the period from 1991 to 2011. The database identified land use compositions and their spatio-temporal variability typical of different types of farms. Initial outputs indicate that Beef, Other Livestock and Other Crop farm types provide the highest soil cover, Dairy and Poultry/Egg farms provide moderate levels, and Field Crop, Hog and Fruit/Vegetable farms have the lowest levels. Temporal analysis indicates a general improvement in soil cover across most farm types from 1991 to 2011.

AB  - Laboratory studies of pollutant uptake kinetics commonly start shortly after experimental soil contamination when it is not clear if the processes between soil and chemicals are equilibrated and stabilized. For instance, when the concentration in soil quickly decreases due to initial biodegradation, bioaccumulation may show a peak-shape accumulation curve instead of conventional first order kinetics with a plateau at the end. The results of such experiments with soil freshly contaminated in the laboratory are then hardly comparable to bioaccumulation observed in soils from historically contaminated sites. Therefore, our study focused on the uptake kinetics of four hydrophobic organic compounds (pyrene, lindane, p,p'-DDT and PCB 153) in two laboratory-contaminated natural soils with different soil properties (e.g. total organic carbon content of 1.6 and 9.3%) aged for 203 days to mimic long-term contamination. For pyrene, the results surprisingly showed peak-shape accumulation curves despite long aging. It seems compound biodegradation might be significant in aged soils when the conditions change (e.g. by distribution to the experimental vessels) and this should be also considered when testing historically contaminated soils. For lindane, longer aging seems to guarantee stability of the soil-compound-earthworm system and the steady state was reached after 5 days of exposure. Furthermore, although concentrations of p,p'-DDT and PCB 153 in earthworms after 11-15-day exposure did not statistically differ, which is a commonly-used indicator that a steady state was reached, they continuously increased until the end of the exposure. Therefore, despite the aging, longer exposure was probably needed to reach the true equilibrium between concentrations in earthworms and soil. In summary, aging does not warranty the conventional first order kinetic curve with the equilibrium at the end of the exposure but may have diverse effects for compounds with different environmental properties and should be taken into account in the bioaccumulation factor calculation and the risk assessment.

AB  - Degeneration of aquatic ecosystem has become one of the ecological problems facing the whole world. However, due to the uncertainty and complexity, it is difficult to assess the food web health and apply them to ecosystem management. In this research, we established a TIO-IS (Total-input-output-interaction strength analysis) method to assess food web health, combining topology and interspecific interaction. In detail, we selected eight three-species modules containing six types of interspecific interaction and 64 four-species modules to evaluate food-web health (FWH). Furthermore, we used ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) analysis to test correlation between network complexity and interspecific interaction. This work will enhance the traditional methods in terms of (a) constructing a systematic and integrative indicators system to assess food web health; (b) analyzing community stability under different topology structures; (c) coding different types species in aquatic ecosystem. As the results, omnivory and trophic cascade had higher FWH than other interactions. By ranking, we got the health degree of the interaction of these six species respectively: omnivory, trophic cascade, multi-predators, exploitive competition, interguild predator and loop. The occurrence frequency of interaction relationship were respectively 0.88, 0.84, 0.68, 0.52, 0.12, 0. Additionally, about 16% of network structures have been shaping the uniform pattern for each species node. It is concluded that the health food web should be satisfied with three primary conditions: a) there exist multiple component types (i.e. species with multiple trophic levels); b) it is with high probability that there have coexistence with omnivory and trophic cascade relationship for sub-module types (the weak interaction swamping hypothesis); c) it is likely that some nodes shape high connectivity, which lead to the inhomogeneous distribution of connectivity in a web (keystone species hypothesis). This research will improve the development of ecosystem management, provide an indicator to evaluate aquatic ecosystem, and conducive to realize manual design of food web.

AB  - The article presents the results of a study into methods for increasing the preservation of polyphenolic compounds in the composition of meat products in terms of expanding product ranges and improving the functional effectiveness of foods. Various quality indicators of a dry extract of lingonberry (DLE) grown in Transbaikal regions were studied. The extract, obtained from lingonberry husks, was characterised by a mass fraction of moisture of 4.52 % and acidity of 5.6 %, having a burgundy colour, a sweet and sour taste and characteristic lingonberry aroma, as well as a free-flowing powder consistency. The DLE was established to have a high total antioxidant content of 382.5 mg / g. With the introduction of 0.2 % DLE into a meat steak recipe, the total content of antioxidants following thermal processing in the final product decreased by 18.7%. In order to increase the antioxidant activity and corresponding preservative effectiveness in the ready-to-serve products, various methods for increasing bioavailability, including sorption and encapsulation of biologically active substances of DLE were used. An offal paste based on beef honeycomb tripe, lung and diaphragm was developed for sorption of DLE polyphenols. The matrix consisted of collagen proteins of offal connective tissue having high sorption ability; moreover, fine grinding of by-products into a homogeneous consistency provided good conditions for the immobilisation of polyphenols. The results demonstrate that the use of this method reduced the loss of antioxidants to 7.4 %. Next, the possibility of using an encapsulated form of DLE was considered. Liposomal forms of an extract dissolved in a buffer solution and water were developed. Soy lecithin was used as a liposome forming agent. The obtained data indicated that the introduction of the liposomal form of plant polyphenols contributed to the greater preservation of antioxidants. Specifically, when dissolving the dry lingonberry husks extract in water, the loss of antioxidants was 5.3 %, and when dissolved in a buffer solution, only 3.4 %.

AB  - The biotic and abiotic factors can alter the temperature sensitivity of soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition in rangeland areas. This is a key issue that directly affects soil fertility and productivity. On the other hand, most of the rangelands in Iran are involved overgrazing. However, there is a lack of information about these effects, especially, in semi-arid environments. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of land management on soil nutrient contents and their stoichiometry on the temperature sensitivity of SOM decomposition (Q(10)) in semi-arid rangeland ecosystems. Soil samples (at three different soil depths) were collected in adjacent rangeland areas with different management in Iran. Soils were incubated at three different temperatures. The soil heterotrophic respiration was measured using an Alkali absorption method and then was calculated Q(10). The decrease in Q(10) values was observed with increasing carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) of soil content. Changes of Q(10), in relation to stoichiometry C:N and P:N showed a linear model and a second-order polynomial model in grazed and ungrazed rangeland respectively. Ungrazed rangeland had the lower Q(10) value (0.97) compared to grazed rangeland (1.21). Labile C variability at soil due to effects in land management such as trampling and erosion, altering plant biomass and microbial communities may be able to partly explained variation of Q(10) values. Overall, trend of decreasing Q(10), values associated with increasing C, N and P contents of soil in all rangeland management can be explained by the high microbial CUE. The obtained results presumably indicated that stoichiometry of C:P:N can play as an important determinant in increase CUE and decrease Q(10) in rangeland ecosystems. Overall, the results of this research will valuable for prediction of the condition and succession trend via Q(10) and C losses in various grazing management in semi-arid rangeland ecosystems.

AB  - Introduction Studies suggest that access and exposure to green-blue spaces (GBS) have beneficial impacts on mental ealth. However, the evidence base is limited with respect to longitudinal studies. The main aim of this longitudinal, population-wide, record-linked natural experiment, is to model the daily lived experience by linking GBS accessibility indices, residential GBS exposure and health data; to enable quantification of the impact of GBS on well-being and common mental health disorders, for a national population.
   Methods and analysis This research will estimate the impact of neighbourhood GBS access, GBS exposure and visits to GBS on the risk of common mental health conditions and the opportunity for promoting subjective well-being (SWB); both key priorities for public health. We will use a Geographic Information System (GIS) to create quarterly household GBS accessibility indices and GBS exposure using digital map and satellite data for 1.4 million homes in Wales, UK (2008-2018). We will link the GBS accessibility indices and GBS exposures to individual-level mental health outcomes for 1.7 million people with general practitioner (GP) data and data from the National Survey for Wales (n=similar to 12 000) on well-being in the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. We will examine if these associations are modified by multiple sociophysical variables, migration and socioeconomic disadvantage. Subgroup analyses will examine associations by different types of GBS. This longitudinal study will be augmented by cross-sectional research using survey data on self-reported visits to GBS and SWB.
   Ethics and dissemination All data will be anonymised and linked within the privacy protecting SAIL Databank. We will be using anonymised data and therefore we are exempt from National Research Ethics Committee (NREC). An Information Governance Review Panel (IGRP) application (Project ID: 0562) to link these data has been approved. The research programme will be undertaken in close collaboration with public/patient involvement groups. A multistrategy programme of dissemination is planned with the academic community, policy-makers, practitioners and the public.

AB  - The invasive tree species Ailanthus altissima increasingly occupies forests in the southern parts of the Alps. Many of these forests grow on steep slopes and protect settlements and infrastructure from natural hazards, such as rockfall. It is feared that the mechanical properties of Ailanthus are less favourable for energy reduction of falling rocks due to lower wood strength as well as higher prevalence of heart rot. Therefore, the question has arisen whether the spread of Ailanthus will substantially change rockfall risk. The objective of this study is to analyse the influence of the spread of Ailanthus trees in forest stands on their protective effect against rockfall. We first quantify the block energy reduction capacity of single Ailanthus trees based on a block-tree impact model and compare it to that of other species. Subsequently, we analyse the effect of Ailanthus on rockfall risk for different forest scenarios with a varying proportion of Ailanthus at the stand scale. The capacity of Ailanthus to reduce the block energy was quantified using a model of the block impact on a tree based on the Discrete Element Method. We then integrated the obtained results in the rockfall trajectory model Rocky For 3D. Based on rockfall simulations, we finally calculated rockfall risk for different forest scenarios representing current forest conditions and an increasing spread of Ailanthus. The energy reduction capacity of Ailanthus lies in the range of the species predominantly present in the study area, as well as other species that are typically found on rockfall slopes in the Alps. Rockfall risk for houses and roads does not increase with an increasing proportion of Ailanthus without change in the forest structure. Assuming a decrease in tree diameters with an increasing proportion of Ailanthus trees, rockfall risk, however, critically increased. Consequently, whether or not Ailanthus changes rockfall risk in the long term, strongly depends on its influence on the forest structure. To anticipate the evolution of protection forests invaded by Ailanthus, more long-term ecological data on growth and succession of Ailanthus at stand scale is required.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that crAssphage is abundant in human faecal samples worldwide. It has thus been postulated as a potential microbial source tracking (MST) marker to detect human faecal pollution in water. However, an effective implementation of crAssphage in water management strategies will depend on an understanding of its environmental dynamics. In this work, the abundance and temporal distribution of crAssphage was analysed in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants using different sewage treatments, and in two rivers (water and sediments) that differ in pollution impact and flow regime. Additionally, the influence of environmental conditions (temperature and rainfall) on the removal of the marker was studied along a river section, and natural inactivation was assessed by a mesocosms approach. Molecular and culture-based tools were used to compare crAssphage abundance and dynamics with those of bacteria and bacteriophages currently applied as global indicators (E. coli, somatic coliphages, Bacteroides GA17 bacteriophages, and the human-associated MST markers HF183 and HMBif). CrAssphage concentrations in sewage effluent and river samples were similar to those of HF183 and HMBif and higher than other general and/or culture-based indicators (by 2-3 orders of magnitude). Measurement of crAssphage abundance revealed no temporal variability in the effluent, although rainfall events affected the dynamics, possibly through the mobilisation of sediments, where the marker was detected in high concentrations, and an increase in diffuse and point pollution. Another factor affecting crAssphage inactivation was temperature. Its persistence was longer compared with other bacterial markers analysed by qPCR but lower than culturable markers. The results of this study support the use of crAssphage as a human source tracking marker of faecal pollution in water, since it has similar abundances to other molecular human MST markers, yet with a longer persistence in the environment. Nevertheless, its use in combination with infectious bacteriophages is probably advisable. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Increasing population and industrialization have caused air pollution and air pollution in some cities has increased to such an extent that it has started to threaten human health and has become one of the most important agenda topics of our day. Many pollutants arise in cities due to exhaust gases, car wheels, vehicles and vehicle wear. Heavy metals are one of the most infamous pollutants, because they can remain in nature for a long time without degradation and the amount of heavy metal concentration in the environment is constantly increasing. Heavy metals also tend to bioaccumulate. Therefore, the determination of heavy metal concentration is of great importance in terms of identifying risk regions and risk levels. Determination of heavy metal concentrations in plants is important both for determining plants' ability to remove heavy metals from the air and thus to improve air quality, as well as for monitoring air quality. Bio-indicators are the most important indicators of the change in the concentration of heavy metal in the atmosphere. This study aims to determine the usability potential of Scotch Pine (Pinus sylvestris) in monitoring the traffic related heavy metal concentration. For this purpose, samples of Scotch Pine individuals were collected from one of the busiest highways of Turkey, at the route of Ankara-Istanbul, from refuges, at roadsides and at distances of 3 m, 10 m, 30 m, 50 m and 100 m from the roadside, some of the branch and needle samples were washed and the change of Cu, Pb and Cd concentrations on these samples was determined. As a result of the study, the change of the concentrations of these heavy metals depending on distance to the road, organelle and washing conditions all seem to indicate that the Scotch Pine is a good bio-monitor which could be used especially to monitor the change of Cd concentration.

AB  - Global change processes (including climate change, sea-level rise, and land-use change, among others) represent significant threats to biodiversity. These changes are usually studied across broad areas, and understanding their effects on narrowly distributed endangered species is challenging. Peltophryne florentinoi is a critically endangered Cuban toad, restricted to two coastal localities and potentially threatened by these phenomena. Despite its endangered status, few analyses have focused on threats to its survival in the face of global change. Current and future threats from global change to this species were evaluated using ecological niche modelling and multiscale geographic information system (GIS) approaches. Climate change effects were assessed by comparing the species niche with six future (2050) climate scenarios across its distribution area. Risks from sea-level rise were evaluated by simulating potential coastal inundation under three scenarios of sea-level rise. Recent land-use changes were quantified using information on the loss of forest cover between 2000 and 2015. Within the species distribution area, warmer and drier conditions can be expected in the future. Sea-level rise will not have direct impacts on the species range; however, occasional inundations and saltwater intrusion may present additional stressors. Although only 2% of the forest cover has been lost in the species range and its surroundings during 2000-2015, deforestation trends were variable during this period, and future losses in forest cover can be expected. Considering these threats, and that the colonization of new areas seems unlikely, indirect and additive adverse effects on the species can be anticipated. These impacts will most probably be observed during the larval stage of this toad; hence, breeding sites constitute a key element in the conservation of this species. Long-term studies and experimental manipulations may be the next steps towards a better understanding of the responses of P.florentinoi to expected changes. Initial conservation actions are proposed based on these results and the ecology of this species.

AB  - The use of biocides by industry, agriculture and households increased throughout the last two decades. Many new applications with known substances enriched the variety of biocidal pollution sources for the aquatic environment. While agriculture was the major source for a long time, leaching from building facades and preservation of personal care and cleaning products was identified as new sources in the last few years. With the different usage forms of biocidal products the complexity of legislative regulation increased as well. The requirements for risk assessment differ from one law to another and the potential risk of substances under different regulations might be underestimated. Still EC50 and predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) values gained from testing with different species are the core of environmental risk assessment, but ecotoxicological data is limited or lacking for many biocides. In this study the biocides widely used in facade coatings and household products terbutryn, octhilinone and methylisothiazolinone were tested with the Daphnia magna acute immobilisation assay, the neutral red uptake assay and the ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) assay, performed with rainbow trout liver (RTL-W1) cells. Further, the MTT assay with the ovarian cell line CHO-9 from Chinese hamster was used as mammalian model. Octhilinone induced the strongest effects with EC50 values of 156 mu g/l in the D. magna assay, while terbutryn showed the weakest effects with 8390 mu g/l and methylisothiazolinone 513 mu g/l respectively. All other assays showed higher EC50 values and thus only weak effects. EROD assays did not show any effects. With additional literature and database records PNEC values were calculated: terbutryn reached 0.003 mu g/l, octhilinone 0.05 mu g/l and methylisothiazolinone 0.5 mu g/l. Potential ecotoxicological risks of these biocides are discussed, considering environmental concentrations. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Regional groundwater flow in high mountainous terrain is governed by a multitude of factors such as geology, topography, recharge conditions, structural elements such as fracturation and regional fault zones as well as man-made underground structures. By means of a numerical groundwater flow model, we consider the impact of deep underground tunnels and of an idealized major fault zone on the groundwater flow systems within the fractured Rotondo granite. The position of the free groundwater table as response to the above subsurface structures and, in particular, with regard to the influence of spatial distributed groundwater recharge rates is addressed. The model results show significant unsaturated zones below the mountain ridges in the study area with a thickness of up to several hundred metres. The subsurface galleries are shown to have a strong effect on the head distribution in the model domain, causing locally a reversal of natural head gradients. With respect to the position of the catchment areas to the tunnel and the corresponding type of recharge source for the tunnel inflows (i.e. glaciers or recent precipitation), as well as water table elevation, the influence of spatial distributed recharge rates is compared to uniform recharge rates. Water table elevations below the well exposed high-relief mountain ridges are observed to be more sensitive to changes in groundwater recharge rates and permeability than below ridges with less topographic relief. In the conceptual framework of the numerical simulations, the model fault zone has less influence on the groundwater table position, but more importantly acts as fast flow path for recharge from glaciated areas towards the subsurface galleries. This is in agreement with a previous study, where the imprint of glacial recharge was observed in the environmental isotope composition of groundwater sampled in the subsurface galleries.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to estimate critical body residues (CBRs) of three metals [cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr)] in the aquatic oligochaete Tubifex tubifex based on lethal (LBR) and sublethal effects (CBR), and to discuss the relevance of the exposure to sediment for deriving CBR. Toxicity parameters (LC50, EC50, LBR50 and CBR50) were estimated for each metal by means of data on survival and on several sublethal variables measured in short-term (4 days), water-only exposures and in long-term, chronic (14 and 28 days) exposures using metal-spiked sediment. Sublethal endpoints included autotomy in short-term exposure, as well as reproduction and growth in chronic bioassays. LBR50 and CBR50 were 3-6 times higher in sediment than in water-only exposure to Cd and about 2-11 times higher for Cu, depending on the measured endpoint; however, for Cr these parameters varied only by a factor of 1.2. Cu and Cr LBR50 and CBR50 values in 96 h water-only exposure were very similar (survival 2.39 mu mol Cu g(-1) dw, 2.73 mu mol Cr g(-1) dw; autotomy 0.53 mu mol Cu g(-1) dw, 0.78 mu mol Cr g(-1) dw). However, in metal-spiked sediments, 28 d CBR50 values for autotomy, reproduction and growth ranged 6.76-29.54 mu mol g(-1) dw for Cd, 3.88-6.23 mu mol g(-1) dw for Cu, 0.65 mu mol g(-1) dw for Cr (calculated only on total number of young). Exposure conditions (time and presence/absence of sediment) seem to be influential in deriving metal CBR values of Cd and Cu, while appear to be irrelevant for Cr. Thus, CBR approach for metals is complex and tissue residue-toxicity relationship is not directly applicable so far.

AB  - 1. Many valuable contributions to the biology and conservation of harvested or previously harvested species have come from examination of specimens obtained by lethal collections. The northern fur seal Callorhinus ursinus on the Pribilof Islands, Alaska, has a long history of exploitation, including a large (> 320 000) experimental harvest of females from 1955 to 1968 when the population was at a peak (similar to 2 million seals). The decline caused by this harvest was followed in 1977 by another major decline, apparently unrelated to harvest, that has recently accelerated.
   2. To obtain current reproductive data that could be compared directly with historic estimates, we used imaging ultrasonography to estimate pregnancy rate in 171 adult fur seals captured on St. Paul Island, Alaska, in November, near the end of embryonic diapause. A modified logistic regression of pregnancy by date was used to estimate asymptotic pregnancy rate; a Bayesian hierarchical model based on date and size of embryonic vesicle was also used to account for pregnancies that were not detectable on the date of examination.
   3. Pregnancy rate was high [0.85 (SE = 0.05), 0.88 (SE = 0.05) or 0.92 (SE = 0.04), depending on method] and there was little statistical support for the hypothesis that the current pregnancy rate is lower than the pre-decline rate (0.84, SE = 0.012) or contributing significantly to the present decline.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Further study on intrauterine losses and pupping rates is necessary and ongoing, but reproductive ultrasonography provided an early comparative assessment important for the conservation management of this fur seal stock. It narrows the search for demographic and ecological causes of the population decline and allows research priorities to evolve in response to the likelihood of those causes. The field and analytic methods described have application to population assessments of other mammalian species, including those considered threatened or serving as ecosystem indicators.

AB  - To study environmental risk assessment, echinoderms provide a useful model for ecotoxicological testing. However, limited knowledge of the life history of field collected heart urchins is a problem and the use of cultured urchins has been investigated here. The present study describes a culture method for the heart urchin Echinocardium cordatum under controlled laboratory conditions, providing organisms with a low biological variation. Based on our optimized growth protocol both larvae and juveniles have a growth rate comparable to E. cordatum in the wild. The toxicological response of cultured and field-collected E. cordatum was compared in standard saltwater toxicity bioassays. Using ammonium chloride as a water-soluble reference toxicant, mean 96 h LC50 values for cultured heart urchins versus field collected animals were 37.4 +/- 7.6 mg NH4+/l (n = 5) versus 22.5 +/- 4.9 mg NH4+/l (n=19), respectively. Additional toxicity experiments with tributyl tin (TBT) spiked sediments revealed 14d LC50 values of 1,242 (95% confidence interval 986-1,564) and 964 (95% confidence interval 843-1,102) mu g Sn/kg dw respectively in cultured and field collected E cordatum. From this it was concluded that cultured heart urchins are less sensitive to TBT than field collected E. cordatum. Furthermore in whole sediment toxicity tests, survival of cultured sea urchins was higher or at least similar to that of field collected E. cordatum. The increased sensitivity,of field urchins compared to cultured urchins in various toxicity tests may be due to multiple environmental stressors reducing their overall performance. Overall it was demonstrated that the use of cultured E. cordatum provides a significant advance for urchin-based bioassays for marine environmental toxicity testing, resulting in a more homogeneous, vital population with experimental data displaying reduced variability.

AB  - The aim of this experimental study was to investigate the bioaccumulation rate of cadmium and lead in the mussel foot and gills and the possibility to use these organs as quantitative bioindicators of the pollution of near-shore marine environments. Therefore, our experiment has been designed to provide conditions as close as possible to those found in nature. Three age groups of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis (1, 1.5 and 2 yr) were kept in tanks with elevated cadmium and lead concentrations (Cd, 5.1, 9.6 and 13.9 nM; Pb, 5.2, 9.9, 14.7 nM) for seven days. To study the interaction effects of Cd and Pb during accumulations, the mussels were also exposed to a mixture of these metals with concentrations of 9.5 nM Cd and 5.1 nM Pb.
   Even though the concentrations of metals in the experimental medium were relatively low, compared with the concentrations used by other authors is similar experiments, a significant increase of Cd and Pb concentrations in foot and especially in gills, as a function of time, was observed (particularly in younger age groups). This study also confirms the fact that Cd and Pb concentrations in mussel foot and gills depend on their size and age as well as on the metal levels in a particular environment and on the exposure time to evaluate metal concentrations in the experimental media. In addition, the mussels in the tanks with higher metal concentrations accumulated greater metal quantities. It is interesting that metal accumulation in foot and gills during the experiment (seven days) showed slight exponential increase. Iteractions between Cd and Pb were not observed with reference to bioaccumulation.
   Apart from known comparative advantages with respect to other organs (invariability of weight with reproductive cycle, easy removal from the rest of the soft tissue), this study confirms the assumption that the mussel foot and gills may be used as quantitative bioindicators for assessing the degree of cadmium and lead pollution in a particular marine environment.

AB  - An ecological study of the Municipalite Regionale de Comte (MRC) du Haut-Saint-Laurent area, a highly disturbed landscape located south-west of Montreal (Quebec), was carried out. The aim of this study was to establish links between indicator species of ecosystems and geomorphological features in a heavily disturbed background. Analysis to obtain the ecological groups are based on the links of herbaceous plants and shrubs. This approach is defined as a sociological one where grouping is based only on the species' affinity. In order to obtain ecological groups, similarity measures using the chi-square coefficient were calculated on the relative cover values of the 150 retained species from 452 plots. An intermediate linkage cluster analysis was then performed on the similarity matrix thus created. By this procedure, 56 ecological groups were obtained. These groups were then characterized according to abiotic variables, especially the geomorphological data, by the use of binary discriminant analysis. Results indicate that 39 of these 56 groups were significantly associated specifically with one of 10 morphogenic features, while 13 of these 56 groups were associated with 2 or 3 features. The ecological groups which were associated with one specific geomorphological process showed a strong link to one texture and one specific drainage class. On the other hand, the groups which were associated with several features were linked with one drainage class, usually imperfect, and a certain topographic situation. However, ecological groups showing a strong association to more than one feature can be of cartographic use, provided soil texture is analysed to determine the origin of the deposit. Finally, the type of deposit becomes non determinant on vegetation where drainage and topographic variables indicate poorly or very poorly drained sites. Non-significant groups should be used as indicators of drainage and topographical conditions but not as indicators of geomorphological deposits. The ecological groups not associated with morphogenic features demonstrated mostly a heliophilic character. Thus, the ubiquitous character of ecological groups is not exclusive to species taking advantage of disturbances.

AB  - It is almost impossible to develop a universal approach to the formation of a green economy at the regional level, characterized by differences in economic specialization, heterogeneity of investment activity, and a variety of natural conditions. In this regard, this article aims to provide an analysis of the recent level of development of the green economy in the Republic of Belarus based on indicators of the green economy for the development of competent management decisions. The authors studied the indicators of the green economy in the Republic of Belarus using data mining methods. The relationships between the rates of change of indicators were established, and the uniformity of their development was researched. Trends in indicators were revealed. Based on the research results, reasoned conclusions were made. Measures aimed at solving the identified problems were proposed.

AB  - Extreme sensitivity and relatively rapid reaction to environmental changes makes amphibians suitable bioindicators of environmental health. Chemical contaminants, developmental disruptors, ultraviolet radiation, parasitic and viral infections, intrinsic developmental constraints are common factors causing malformations of individuals. In the period October 2017 - February 2018 we investigated fire salamanders (Salamandra salamandra) wintering in underground roosts in Slovakia, Europe. Individuals were measured (SVL, snout-vent length; TBL, total body length), weighed and underwent ophthalmic examination, including tonometry. From 80 individuals, three salamanders with malformations were observed. The deformities recorded were a skin deformity in the lumbar region of one individual, unilateral microphthalmia and syndactyly of the right forelimb. Two of these deformities were detected during one inspection of the artificial gallery. In this paper we also mention incidence of deformities during our several years of research on fire salamanders in Slovakia.

AB  - The impact evaluation of the implementation of a contra flow bus lane in the city centre of Thessaloniki, conducted through traffic simulation modeling techniques and expressed in terms of environmental and traffic indicators, is hereby presented and discussed. The employment of this measure entails the relocation of a currently underutilized bus lane of an adjacent street to a one-way, four-lane road axis that is at present host to a significant amount of traffic volume in the network. The basic conclusion concerns the slight deterioration of the environmental and traffic conditions both in the road axis of implementation and in the buffer zone. The increased levels of the pollutant emissions (CO2, NOx, CO, HC and Pb) and a minor increase of fuel consumption were among the main drawbacks of the scheme.

AB  - The Jurassic rocks are well exposed in Gangta Bet of the Wagad region, Eastern Kachchh. The succession consists of thick arenaceous unit overlain by the calcareous sandstone-siltstone-shales and capped by the algal limestone. The Lower sandstone units are highly ferruginized, fractured, weathered and exposed in core of the Gangta Dome. The calcareous sandstone-siltstone units are marked by well-preserved trace fossils. Total 27 ichnospecies of 19 ichnogenera falling in five ethological categories are identified from the Gangta Bet. The recurrent pattern of the trace fossil assemblages exhibit bathymetric controls and display development of Cruziana-like ichnofacies characterizing subtidal conditions of depositional environment. The algal limestone band over the trace fossil horizon is interrupted by the ripple calcareous sandstone and characterized by Maya and Helenae Assemblage Zones of Early- Middle Oxfordian age.

AB  - Many environmental systems and infrastructure systems are monitored using a set of indicator values that assess several aspects of site condition. The values of different indicators often convey different comparative messages for the study sites. The comparability between sites is analyzed within the theory of partially-ordered sets and visualized with Hasse diagrams. This paper demonstrates that properties of partially-ordered sets and the conversion of indicator scores into a rank matrix provide a manager or decision-maker with valuable information that would be lost if the monitored indicator data were aggregated only into a single index. Stream stability assessment data from 49 bridge crossing sites in the United States are used to demonstrate these techniques in prioritization and identification of restoration and maintenance needs of stream channels at bridge crossings.

AB  - Knowledge and education in today's globalized world is becoming the most important factor in the development of society and regions. One of the main problems of regional development in Slovakia is the insufficient level of economic development potential based on the usage of knowledge, thereby creation of new sources of development is insufficient, and they will still be more built on the usage of creativity, education and skills of the workforce. To address the nature and direction of development of the education system at both national and regional level becomes more imperative. For this can be used regional training capacity indicator which is proposed in the paper and methodology of its application to the conditions of Slovakia and its regions as a solution to the processing of the regional strategy.

AB  - We infer the absolute completeness of the mammalian fossil record of the Iberian Neogene, from a compiled database of preserved stratigraphic ranges for both species and genera and by means of the analytical tools developed by Foote and Raup (1996). We conclude that the mammalian fossil record from the Neogene of the Iberian Peninsula is very complete (more than 75% at the specific level, and more than 90% at the generic one), being a good indicator of how complete the record of terrestrial organisms can be at least under certain favorable conditions. Comparison with previously published results for well-known marine invertebrates indicates that the continental Iberian Neogene record is not significantly less complete, thus raising doubts about the importance of more episodic deposition in continental environments. It remains to be seen if continental faunas in general are as complete as the marine invertebrate record.

AB  - Radiation therapy (radiotherapy) is a valuable technique used in medicine for cancer treatment. It is a fact that many of the incidents and accidents involve only partial body irradiation and the extremities are the most frequently injured parts of the body. As it is still not general practice to use infrared (IR) thermographic imaging for the more precise diagnosis of local injuries, the availability of these techniques is very rarely mentioned in the publications. In this paper attention is drawn to what was introduced more than a decade ago, namely the use of IR thermographic procedures in diagnosing local radiation injuries. Further justification for introducing these techniques is that, in the relevant cases, the assessment of absorbed radiation dose through the widely known biological indicators or biological dosimetry assays is not always possible.

AB  - It is now feasible to monitor some aspects of landscape ecological condition nationwide using remotely-sensed imagery and indicators of land cover pattern. Previous research showed redundancies among many reported pattern indicators and identified six unique dimensions of land cover pattern. This study tested the stability of those dimensions and representative pattern indicators across different types of land cover maps. The maps were derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper images of the Tennessee River and Chesapeake Bay watersheds, and they differed in resolution, number of attributes, and method of delineating landscape unit boundaries, A multivariate analysis of pattern metrics was conducted separately for each map, and the results were then compared among types of maps, Measures of land cover diversity, texture, and fractal dimension were more consistent than measures of average patch shape or compaction among the land cover maps.

The enzyme was sealed in a stainless steel capsule, which was pretested to be suitable for high-temperature, short-time applications, and embedded at the center of a finite cylindrical particle. The percentage retention of the enzyme activity was calculated by using transient temperatures and their respective D values in a finite difference program. Heat transfer coefficients estimated for the potato particles under similar experimental conditions were used as input data. Excellent comparison was observed between predicted and measured percentage retention of enzyme activity.

AB  - Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process that mediates prominent homeostatic functions, both at the cellular and organismal level. Indeed, baseline autophagy not only ensures the disposal of cytoplasmic entities that may become cytotoxic upon accumulation, but also contributes to the maintenance of metabolic fitness in physiological conditions. Likewise, autophagy plays a fundamental role in the cellular and organismal adaptation to homeostatic perturbations of metabolic, physical, or chemical nature. Thus, the molecular machinery for autophagy is functionally regulated by a broad panel of sensors that detect indicators of metabolic homeostasis. Moreover, increases in autophagic flux have a direct impact on core metabolic circuitries including (but not limited to) glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. Here, we detail a simple methodological approach to monitor these two processes in cultured cancer cells that mount a proficient autophagic response to stress.

AB  - The electrochemical nanofilm processor is a smart system based on the lateral anodic oxidation of a nanoscale aluminum film, The electrochemical nanofilm processor is directly related to nominal electrolyte flows of femtoliter volumes per second which determines the electrochemical reaction. The oxidation velocity in the electrochemical nanofilm processor depends on the ambient relative humidity and temperature. In this paper we provide a deeper investigation of the oxidation behavior dependent to the ambient relative humidity and temperature. Therefore we present a new method for controlling the oxidation velocity of the electrochemical nanofilm processor in variable environmental conditions. With this approach we provide the basic principle for an exclusively time-dependent electrochemical nanofilm processor, which is suitable as a self-writing smart label time indicator.

AB  - The idea of taking into account environmental impact criteria in the process design becomes a necessity for both the industry and governments, due to increased binding regulations. Moreover, to address the issue of integrating sustainable processes, environmental impact must be weighed and balanced against other concerns, such as economic performance, product quality, and long-term sustainability. Therefore, this study introduces a methodology for environmental impact minimization and optimization of multiple conflicting criteria. A general eco-design method for biomass drying process is proposed.

AB  - The IDEA diagnostic method was used in this study to evaluate the sustainability of dairy cattle agropastoral systems in the context of the semi-arid region of Setif (Algeria). Moreover, surveys carried out in 60 dairy holdings made it possible to appreciate the pertinence of the indicators of the tree scales investigated: the agro-ecological, the socio-territorial and the economic scales. The sustainability analysis shows that the total trend is the same in ail holdings: they are sustainable on the agro-ecological level, less sustainable on the economic level and quite unsustainable on the socio-territorial level. The use of this self-diagnostic tool in the dairy cattle holdings in the semi-arid highlands has a disputable adaptation level. Indeed, if several indicators prove to be relevant, others seem completely incompatible with the local conditions, and others appear very subjective.

AB  - Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is the most common parasitic disease of the central nervous system. Several drugs, such as drugs against tapeworms, praziquantel or albendazole associated to corticosteroids, have been tested for the treatment of this' condition. Although some have claimed the reduction or involution of cystic or granulomatous lesions, there is no consensus about the efficacy of these treatments. The natural evolution of the disease is not clear and this hampers the assessment of treatment effects. Moreover, there are no good imaging or clinical indicators that can predict the progression or spontaneous resolution of lesions, specially at the meningeal or ventricular compartment. Therefore, evidence based medicine does not have a definitive answer about the treatment, neither of seizures, the most common manifestation of NCC, or the varied and complex meningeal and ventricular involvement. This review includes experts opinions to give the clinician some clues for decision making in the treatment of NCC.

AB  - The paper reports the results of an investigation aimed to evaluate the influence of hydrodynamic conditions on physical and biochemical characteristics of granular sludge obtained in a SBBR system. Biomass density resulted very high. i.e. 70-125 gTSS/L-biomass, and this permitted to achieve a biomass concentration much high as 17-45 gTSS/L-bed. An appropriate equation proved that the pressure loss, an easily measurable parameter, can be used for biomass porosity measurement and indirect assessment of biomass concentration in the biofilter. As for biomass biochemical characterisation. the EPS (Extracellular Polymeric Substances) content was rather low (5-7% of the total organic matter) and mostly made up of proteins whereas the cellular protein content, a parameter frequently used as an indicator of microorganisms activity, was high (30-60% of total organic matter).

AB  - Multiple linear regression models are presented for boreal mixed-wood stands that predict white spruce [Picea glauca (Moench) Voss] site productivity as a function of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) productivity. Site productivity was measured using both age-referenced and diameter-referenced site indices. Average tree and stand attributes, and environmental parameters that describe topographic and soil conditions were examined for their suitability as additional independent variables in the two basic productivity models. The inclusion of additional regressors provided substantial increases in the explanation of variance over the models which used the site productivity measures alone. The best age-referenced model yielded an R(2) value of 0.794 while the best diameter-referenced model produced an R(2) of 0.908.

AB  - The increasing demand for liquid hydrogen as an environmentally friendly energy source necessitates developing an effective hydrogen liquefaction process. In this study, hydrogen production (steam methane reforming), hydrogen liquefaction, and CO2 liquefaction processes were successfully integrated by conducting several parametric studies involving three small-scale models and six scaled-up models. The enhanced liquefaction process included a modified Claude cycle that reduced the specific energy consumption to 6.15 kWh/kgLH(2), 47% lower than that of a reference process. Three different refrigerants (nitrogen, liquified natural gas, and hydrogen) were utilized in the integrated process, and an interactive genetic algorithm-based multi-objective optimization model was developed using the MATLAB-Aspen HYSYS interface to minimize the energy consumption and CO2 generation. In addition, a hybrid non-isothermal ortho-para hydrogen cooling heat exchanger was designed by performing an H-2 specific heat correction to enhance the robustness of the developed model. Techno-economic analysis of the designed process indicated that the integrated system considerably improved the main economic indicators (Levelized cost of hydrogen) and environmental friendliness of the hydrogen production process by approximately 51% and 95%, respectively. Moreover, CO2 liquefaction was performed most efficiently at a pressure of 120 bar with a reduced overall process cost. In addition, the LOCH (Levelized cost of hydrogen) of all the design integrated processes is less than $3/kg in market accessibility compared to the reference process. The sensitivity analysis results conducted by varying the costs of refrigerants, power (electricity), the selling price of liquid hydrogen, and carbon price revealed that the proposed integrated process had a higher application po-tential than other commonly used processes. In particular, under conditions of 45 tonne/day or more of carbon prices, the integrated process is environmentally and economically advantageous over the CO2 emission process with a reduced PBP of at least 10%.

AB  - Channel dynamics is a significant geomorphological process that involves the channel migration, erosion-deposition and meandering of an alluvial river channel within its floodplain region. This geomorphic process is often accelerated by climatic condition and human activities which changes this natural process to a quasi-natural hazard. Current research work tries to evaluate the changing behaviour or dynamic nature of alluvial channel by enlightening average length and shape migration. Finally, state of the art techniques in Arc GIS has been adopted to prepare the mouza (village) wise erosion-deposition map by considering highly fluctuating mouzas of the Kaljani River and its adjacent village at the Himalayan foothill region. The primary data source was a series of time-sequential Landsat data of the years 1972, 1980, 1987, 1993, 1998, 2002, 2008, 2013, and 2019 spanning 47 years. Furthermore, we divided total study time into eight groups i.e. 1972-1980, 1980-1987, 1987-1993, 1993-1998, 1998-2002, 2002-2008, 2008-2013, and 2013-2019 for better understanding. During the study period (1972-2019) the average length of migration of the Kaljani River was 742.05 m and the annual rate was 15.79 m/year. Within this time frame of 1972-2019, the shape area migration of the channel was 66.79 km(2) and the annual rate was 1.42 km(2)/year. The total area of bank erosion from 1972 to 2019 equaled 62.74 km(2), out of which, 30.07 km(2) were on the right bank and 32.67 km(2) were at the left bank. Present analysis helps to enhance the effectiveness of planning and management of land resources and ecological balances in these 45 adjacent Mouzas of the Kaljani River. Among the various important causes, tectonic activity, rainfall, floods, and human intervention especially constriction of the embankment along the Kaljani River are the most significant causes for this dynamic changes of River Kaljani. The results of this study therefore, can be used as an important indicator of the vulnerability of the Kaljani River and also provides information about geomorphological instabilities of the study area.

AB  - Within a changing world where freshwater resources are coming under increasing pressure, assessing water system vulnerability is critical for enabling adequate water resource management. Quantitative assessments of socio-economic and environmental factors which contribute to water system vulnerability can provide a strong evidence base on which to base decision-making. A range of drivers including population growth, agricultural intensification and industrial activity are placing greater demand on freshwater supplies in Western Australia. In combination with changing climatic conditions resulting in a warmer and drier environment in southwest Western Australia, these pressures have diminished the quantity of available freshwater supplies for agricultural districts. In this paper we provide a quantitative assessment of water supply and demand vulnerabilities for the Wheatbelt region of the state of Western Australia (WA). This region provides significant agricultural and mineral resource contributions to the state economy. The potable water supply for human consumption in this region is almost entirely drawn from a different geographic area, and conveyed by means of an extensive pipeline network to the Wheatbelt region. Competition for freshwater resources is high with increasing population pressures from expansion of the state's capital city, Perth, encroaching north- and eastwards into the Wheatbelt. To assess water vulnerability we conceptualise the water system components and select a series of socio-economic and environmental indicators which best represent the inherent vulnerabilities associated with water supply and demand in the Wheatbelt. Water supply, demand and overall system vulnerabilities were spatially assessed for the years 2001, 2006 and 2011. Results indicate that biophysical indicators of supply capacity have the greatest influence on overall vulnerability for each time period, however the spatial variability of specific vulnerability factors is much more nuanced. Our assessment of water vulnerability will enable water resources managers and policy-makers within the Wheatbelt and at the state level to better assess water supply and demand pressures. However, our robust methodology also allows for transferability to other locations experiencing water stress as a comprehensive approach for examining historic and future impacts of water resource availability on socio-ecological systems.

AB  - Although being well described at the landscape level, patterns in species composition of forest herb layer are rarely studied at smaller scales. Here, we examined fine-scale environmental determinants and spatial structures of herb layer communities in thermophilous oak- and hornbeam dominated forests of the south-eastern part of the Czech Republic.
   Species composition of herb layer vegetation and environmental variables were recorded within a fixed grid of 2 x 2 m subplots regularly distributed within 1-ha quadrate plots in three forest stands. For each site, environmental models best explaining species composition were constructed using constrained ordination analysis. Spatial eigenvector mapping was used to model and account for spatial structures in community variation. Mean Ellenberg indicator values calculated for each subplot were used for ecological interpretation of spatially structured residual variation.
   The amount of variation explained by environmental and spatial models as well as the selection of variables with the best explanatory power differed among sites. As an important environmental factor, relative elevation was common to all three sites, while pH and canopy openness were shared by two sites. Both environmental and community variation was mostly coarse-scaled, as was the spatially structured portion of residual variation. When corrected for bias due to spatial autocorrelation, those environmental factors with already weak explanatory power lost their significance. Only a weak evidence of possibly omitted environmental predictor was found for autocorrelated residuals of site models using mean Ellenberg indicator values.
   Community structure was determined by different factors at different sites. The relative importance of environmental filtering vs. spatial processes was also site specific, implying that results of fine-scale studies tend to be shaped by local conditions. Contrary to expectations based on other studies, overall dominance of spatial processes at fine scale has not been detected. Ecologists should keep this in mind when making generalizations about community dynamics. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ultraviolet Radiation (UVR) is a stressor for aquatic organisms affecting enzyme activities in planktonic populations because of the increase in reactive oxygen species. In addition, UVR exposure combined with other environmental factors (i.e. temperature and food quality) could have even higher detrimental effects. In this work, we aimed to determine the effect of UVR on somatic Alkaline Phosphatase Activity (APA) and Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) activity on the cladoceran Daphnia commutata under two different temperatures (10 degrees C and 20 degrees C) and under three food qualities (carbon:phosphorus ratios: 1150, 850 and 550). APA is a biomarker that is considered as a P deficiency indicator in zooplankton. Since recovery from UVR damage under dark conditions is an ATP depending reaction we also measured APA during recovery phases. We carried out a laboratory experiment combining different temperatures and food qualities with exposition to UVR followed by luminic and dark phases for recovery. In addition, we exposed organisms to H2O2, to establish if the response on APA to UVR was a consequence of the reactive oxygen species produced these short wavelengths. Our results showed that somatic APA was negatively affected by UVR exposure and this effect was enhanced under high temperature and low food quality. Consistently, GST activity was higher when exposed to UVR under both temperatures. The H2O2 experiments showed the same trend as UVR exposure, indicating that APA is affected mainly by oxidative stress than by direct effect of UVR on the enzyme. Finally, APA was affected in the dark phase of recovery confirming the P demands. These results enlighten the importance of food quality in the interacting effect of UVR and temperature, showing that C:P food ratio could determine the success or failure of zooplanktonic populations in a context of global change.

AB  - The use of speleothems to reconstruct past climatic and environmental change through chemical proxies is becoming increasingly common. Speleothem chemistry is controlled by hydrological and atmospheric processes which vary over seasonal time scales. However, as many reconstructions using speleothem carbonate are now endeavouring to acquire information about precipitation and temperature dynamics at a scale that can capture short term hydrological events, our understanding of within cave processes must match this resolution. Monitoring within Cueva de Asiul (N. Spain) has identified rapid (hourly resolution) changes in drip water electrical conductivity (EC), which is regulated by the pCO(2) in the cave air. Drip water EC is therefore controlled by different modes of cave ventilation. In Cueva de Asiul a combination of density differences, and external pressure changes control ventilation patterns. Density driven changes in cave ventilation occur on a diurnal scale at this site irrespective of season, driven by fluctuations in external temperature across the cave internal temperature threshold. As external temperatures drop below those within the cave low pCO(2) external air enters the void, facilitating the deposition of speleothem carbonate and causing a reduction in measured drip water EC. Additionally, decreases in external pressure related to storm activity act as a secondary ventilation mechanism. Reductions in external air pressure cause a drop in cave air pressure, enhancing karst air draw down, increasing the pCO(2) of the cave and therefore the EC measured within drip waters. EC thereby serves as a first order indicator of cave ventilation, regardless of changes in speleothem drip rates and karst hydrological conditions. High resolution monitoring of cave drip water electrical conductivity reveals the highly sensitive nature of ventilation dynamics within cave environments, and highlights the importance of this for understanding trace element incorporation into speleothem carbonate at the event scale.

AB  - A sediment core from Taibai Lake, a shallow and eutrophic lake (SE China), was analysed for chironomids to track environmental changes in the lake. Nutrient dynamics over the past 1400 years were traced based on subfossil records and a regional chironomid-inferred total phosphorus (CI-TP) transfer function. Between ad 600 and 1370, the coexistence of several macrophyte-related taxa such as Dicrotendipes, Paratanytarsus and Endochironomus reflected a clear-water state with flourishing plants, and total phosphorus (TP) reconstructions ranged from 40 to 60 mu g/L. For the time span from ad 1370 to 1650, the prevalence of Paratanytarsus penicillatus-type indicated a slight decline of TP to lower than 50 mu g/L, but CI-TP increased to previous levels between ad 1650 and 1940. Since the 1950s, Chironomus plumosus-type dominated the chironomid community, which illustrated that the lake suffered from high nutrient loadings and CI-TP increased from 80 to 140 mu g/L. The results suggest that 50-60 mu g/L of TP concentration is the reference condition for Taibai Lake, and similar to 80-110 mu g/L might be considered as the nutrient threshold range between the plant-dominated and algal-dominated status. Variance partitioning analysis (VPA) was used to determine the relative influence of climate and human factors on the lake ecosystem. The analyses revealed that long-term climate change appeared to be the main determinant regulating the chironomid assemblages; however, the impact of human activities on the aquatic ecosystem prevailed over that of climate factors since the 1950s. This study improves our understanding of complex trajectories of aquatic ecosystem development at centennial to millennial timescales, which are influenced by both anthropogenic and climatic factors in a densely populated region. The main finding also provides reference for sustainable management in this lake and other analogous floodplain lakes.

AB  - The construction of ski-pistes can cause serious damage to all the components of an ecosystem and may therefore be considered as one of the main causes of human-driven environmental changes in mountain habitats. This study was aimed at assessing the responses of different ground dwelling arthropod assemblages (i.e. ground beetles, spiders and grasshoppers) to ski-piste restoration through hydroseeding with commercial seed mixtures. The soil, vegetation and arthropods of restored and un-restored ski-pistes and the adjacent grassland have been sampled at two high altitude sites in the north-western Italian Alps. The ski-piste soil was characterized by a higher skeletal content and, consequently, a lower amount of fine earth and organic matter than that of the undisturbed adjacent grassland. The plant cover of the restored ski-pistes was very low above 2,500 m a.s.l.; the vegetation cover below this threshold was higher in the study area, mainly due to the seeded species. The unrestored ski-pistes showed very large proportions of bare ground. The responses of the three ground-dwelling arthropod groups to vegetation conditions were different. GLMMs and IndVal analyses showed that all three groups avoided the unrestored ski-pistes plots, which were characterized by a very scarce vegetation cover, irrespective of the altitude. The low altitude plots of the restored ski-pistes, which were characterized by a high vegetation cover, had a significantly larger number of grasshoppers on the ski-pistes than on the adjacent grassland plots. Moreover, these restored ski-piste plots were used in equal proportion to the adjacent grassland plots by ground beetles but avoided by spiders. When ski-pistes become sufficiently revegetated by hydroseeded plants, they are colonized by grasshoppers and, to a lesser extent, by ground-beetles. Spiders, instead, do not colonize the pistes, thus demonstrating that they are the most sensitive arthropods and may therefore represent the best indicators of human-driven environmental changes in high altitude alpine habitats.

AB  - It is ecologically undesirable to solve forest soil compaction due to mechanized harvesting at large spatial scales using agricultural mechanical soil loosening techniques. We therefore examined whether a stimulation of biological activity through litter manipulation, liming and/or inoculation of the anecic earthworm species Lumbricus terrestris could significantly contribute to the ecological restoration of compacted forest soils by comparing the impact of these treatments on the soil within and beside compacted wheel tracks. The replacement of native litter by litter with a better quality resulted in a faster litter decomposition. However, maximal decay rates were obtained only when litter manipulation, earthworm inoculation and liming were combined. Anecic earthworms were initially absent as soils were probably too acid. Liming as well as litter manipulation had a small positive influence on the numbers of retraced L terrestris, inducing positive feedback mechanisms on soil pH and litter decomposition rates. None of the treatments, however, had a significant effect on the compaction degrees within or beside tracks within the small study period. L terrestris realized only a small decrease of bulk density beside the tracks. Within the tracks a similar number of L. terrestris was retrieved, but effects on the compaction degree were negligible. Liming decreased penetration resistance, but only in the absence of anecic earthworms. Endogeic earthworms were overall more abundant than the anecics, especially within tracks where soil water contents and pH values were higher. However, endogeics only had a marginal effect on litter decomposition and although they positively influence soil structure, they could not realize a reduction of the compaction degree, quantified by bulk density and penetration resistance, due to different burrowing habits. Our results indicated that a positive impact of anecic earthworms on the structure of compacted forest soils can be obtained in the long-term, at least in case soil conditions (acidity, nutrient availability and moisture content) are favourable. This can be achieved by conversion of forests towards tree species with high quality litter. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. The zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha is a well-known biofouler, having potentially serious impacts on freshwater-dependent industries. Chemical treatment is the most popular approach to control this pest. The identification of potential peaks of increased susceptibility of the species to molluscicidal agents may provide environmental and economic benefits, allowing control to be achieved through lower toxin load.
   2. In this study, the seasonal pattern of the tolerance of zebra mussels to three reference toxicants with distinct modes of action was recorded by conducting static bioassays. The annual profiles of dry tissue weight of a reference individual and mussels' filtration rate were also followed.
   3. The tolerance of the species to toxicants was found to follow a pronounced annual cycle, increasing up to 22 times between early summer and winter.
   4. The role of temperature and filtration rate as predictors of the mussels' susceptibility was confirmed, but there was no relation between this and the animals' body condition. Indeed, this study contradicts the common belief that physiologically exhausted adult zebra mussels are more susceptible to chemical control measures.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The results presented here enlarge the body of knowledge of D. polymorpha biology and may have practical implications at three levels. First, they reinforce the importance of judicious sampling while testing molluscicides against zebra mussels as well as the specification of the specimens' collection date in toxicological studies. Secondly, they provide information that may be useful to the design of reactive chemical control strategies. In particular, they suggest that the dosage scheme in periodic treatment may be optimized to take advantage of the significant variation of a mussel's susceptibility between late spring and autumn. Finally, the outcome of this study highlights the need of taking into account the seasonality of bivalve responses in ecological risk assessment and the regulation of the discharge of chemicals into surface waters.

AB  - To date, studies on genetic variability in the tolerance of aquatic biota to chemicals have focused on exposure to single chemicals. In the field, metals occur as elemental mixtures, and thus it is essential to study whether the genetic consequences of exposure to such mixtures differs from response to single chemicals. This study determined the feeding responses of three Daphnia magna Straus clones exposed to Cd and Zn, both individually and as mixtures. Tolerance to mixtures of Cd and Zn was expressed as the proportional feeding depression of D. magna to Cd at increasing zinc concentrations. A quantitative genetic analysis revealed that genotype and genotype x environmental factors governed population responses to mixtures of both metals. More specifically, genetic variation in tolerance to sublethal levels of Cd decreased at those Zn concentrations where there were no effects on feeding, and increased again at Zn concentrations that affected feeding. The existence of genotype x environmental interactions indicated that the genetic consequences of exposing D. magna to mixtures of Cd and Zn cannot be predicted from the animals' response to single metals alone. Therefore, current ecological risk assessment methodologies for predicting the effects of chemical mixtures may wish to incorporate the concept of genetic variability. Furthermore, exposure to low and moderate concentrations of Zn increased the sublethal tolerance to Cd. This induction of tolerance to Cd by Zn was also observed for D. magna fed algae pre-loaded with both metals. Furthermore, in only one clone, physiological acclimatisation to zinc also induced tolerance to cadmium. These results suggest that the feeding responses of D. magna may be related to gut poisoning induced by the release of metals from algae under low pH conditions. In particular, both induction of metallothionein synthesis by Zn and competition between Zn and Cd ions for uptake at target sites on the gut wall may be involved in determining sublethal responses to mixtures of both metals.

AB  - Fecundity of the copepod Calanus helgolandicus was monitored at a coastal station in the western English Channel during January to September 1994 and varied seasonally from 3 to 33 eggs female(-1) d(-1) (mean 17 eggs female(-1) d(-1)). Particulate fatty acid levels, particularly in the <20 mu m size fraction, were more highly correlated with fecundity than either chi a, particulate carbon or nitrogen, and this reflected the size and species composition of the microplankton. Diatoms, dinoflagellates and ciliates all sustained high fecundity. The mean volume of eggs produced by C. helgolandicus was inversely related to both food availability and fecundity, with increased numbers of smaller eggs produced during periods of high food availability. Female C. helgolandicus with the highest body nitrogen and carbon produced eggs with the highest carbon and nitrogen contents, although these eggs were also smaller. Hatching viability was consistently high with a seasonal mean of 83% and both viability and the incidence of deformed nauplii were negatively correlated with the carbon and nitrogen content of females and eggs. Hatching viability was not correlated with the abundance of diatoms, but was closely correlated with the levels of 18:2(n-6) and 20:4(n-6) fatty acids in both the environment and in the eggs. Particulate concentrations of the polyunsaturated fatty acids 20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3), although abundant in the environment and therefore good indicators of food availability, were not correlated with either egg viability or naupliar survival. The levels of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in the eggs were important factors determining naupliar survival under starvation conditions. Although food availability limited fecundity, female recruitment was possibly limited by predation pressure, particularly during the late summer. This study highlights the value of seasonal and nutritional based studies in understanding variability in zooplankton fecundity.

AB  - The mine abandonment is generally associated with the release of potentially toxic metals into the environment, which may depend on metals speciation, soil properties and climate conditions. The goal of the present work was to assess the environmental impact of the abandoned Pb-Zn mine "Las Musas" (Spain) using an integrative approach. The impact on soils and surface waters was performed using: chemical parameters, quantification of potentially toxic metals (Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn), and ecotoxicological responses using lethal and sub-lethal bioassays with organisms' representative of different trophic level ((soil: Eisenia fetida (mortality and reproduction test); Latuca sativa and Lollium perenne (seedling emergence); and water: Vibrio fischeri (luminescence inhibition), Daphnia magna (immobility and reproduction test), Thamnocephalus platyurus (mortality), Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (growth inhibition)). The results showed soils with neutral to slight alkaline pH (7.64-8.18), low electric conductivity (125-953 mu S/cm) and low organic matter levels (0.20-1.85%). For most of the soil samples, Pb was the only metal which surpassed the limit proposed by the Canadian soil quality guidelines, with values ranging from 42.2 to 181.4 mg/kg. The ecotoxicological results showed that the soils with the highest levels of Pb induced a decrease on E. fetida reproduction and on L. sativa germination, indicating negative impacts on the habitat function. The analysis of the surface waters showed levels of Zn surpassing the legal limit adopted from the Water Framework Directive (37.0 to 69.0 mu g/L). The ecotoxicological results highlight the importance of bioassays that evaluate the behavior of species, when assessing the risk of mining areas with non- acid soils andwaterswith high nutrients/organic matter concentrations and lowconcentrations of potentially toxic metals. The results indicated a moderate environmental risk from potentially toxic metals, at the areas analyzed around the Azuaga mine. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Global warming, and its consequences, constitute one of the main stressors for organisms worldwide, affecting different factors such as the geographic distribution and the abundance of parasites, which in turn can affect the immune system of their hosts, and vice versa. Therefore, it is important to have baseline information on immune parameters of organisms in order to make future comparisons within this changing ecological context. Here, we report on the leukocyte counts of the Antarctic pack ice seals, the crabeater (Lobodon carcinophaga), Weddell (Leptonychotes weddellii) and leopard (Hydrurga leptonyx) seals, sampled off the western Antarctic Peninsula. We captured and sampled seals in the pack ice off the Danco Coast, Antarctica in the austral summers, January to March, of 2015 and 2016. The leukocyte counts, along with the counts of each different leukocyte (e.g., basophil, neutrophil, eosinophil, lymphocyte and monocyte), were made from blood smears viewed under the light microscope. As a potential stress indicator, we examined whether seals with lice, so presumably under greater physiological stress, had changes in leukocyte counts, including higher ratios of neutrophil-to-lymphocytes (N/L ratio). Leukocyte counts were different among the seal species. While crabeater and Weddell seals had higher neutrophil counts, followed by lymphocyte counts, leopard seals had the reverse pattern. Basophil, eosinophil, and lymphocyte counts were higher in the leopard seal, while the N/L ratio, as well as the neutrophil counts, were higher for the crabeater seal. We show, for the Weddell seal, that the animals with lice were more likely to have higher N/L ratios. This suggests that future research into the potential of the N/L index as a stress indicator, that incorporates additional stress parameters including cortisol concentrations, oxidative damage, as well as other measures of immune function, is warranted for the pack ice seals. Our results are a first step towards establishing leukocyte count baselines for the Antarctic pack ice seals off the western Antarctic Peninsula.

AB  - We sampled collembolan communities in 11 coal mine spoil tips (locally called 'terrils') from the North of France, and their surroundings, in various stages of vegetation development (bare soil, herb, shrub and tree vegetation). We wondered whether species, functional trait (Community Weighted Mean trait or CWM) composition and trait diversity (Rao's quadratic entropy) responded to the particular environment of coal mine spoil tips (here called 'terril' effect) and to successional effects and which of these three sets was the best indicator of soil and vegetation effects, taking into account that spoil tips were spatially distant and idiosyncratic (e.g. varying in height, area, past history and surrounding environment). We showed that species, but not traits, were strongly influenced by site effects, while traits were influenced by both 'terril' and successional effects to a significant extent, making traits more robust than species when trying to discern patterns of community response to soil and vegetation changes. Functional diversity did not show any significant multi-trait response to either 'terril' or successional effects, but several functional traits showed an increase in diversity with succession. The overall response of trait diversity was intermediate between species and trait responses. The 'terril' effect was mainly mediated by a coarser soil texture (51% coarse sand compared to 14% in the surrounding environment) which, combined with harsher microclimate conditions, stems in a better representation of functional traits linked to subterranean life, such as shorter body length and increased representation of parthenogenesis. Successional effects (in particular the increase in diversity shown by several functional traits varying with vertical distribution) were mediated by the increasing development of organic horizons but other factors like microclimate were seemingly involved, too. More generally this study showed that shift to subterranean life was an adapted response of collembolan communities to harshness of the environment and that vertically stratified ecosystems allow a more complete expression of their functional diversity.

AB  - The present study aims to identify the natural and anthropogenic imprints left by the accumulation of elements and to determine/ identify the current level of enrichment of major oxides in the Pichavaram mangrove sediments. Pichavaram mangrove is a dynamic intertidal environment lying in between the Vellar and Coleroon estuaries in the Cauvery delta along the east coast of India. In the present study, results of texture studies reveal highly variable depositional environment in upper and lower portion of Core 1 and middle portion of Core 2. In both the cores, decrease in grain size is observed in the upper portion which may suggest that the sediments in the upper portion were deposited at low energy condition. Mn/Al, Mg/Al, Ca/Al, Ti/Al, P/Al and K/Al ratios are found to be low in the both the core samples. Ti elemental ratio is lower in both core samples indicating that Ti concentrations in marine sediments are the best indicators of lithogenous material flux to the marine environment. The concentration of various elements in the core can be summarized as Si > Al > Fe > Mn > Mg > Ca > Ti > P > K. The PIA values of Core 1 indicate that the sediments were derived from predominant weathering up to 40 cm and the remaining sediments derived from unweathered matrices. Plagioclase Index of Alteration (PIA) values of most of the downcore samples of Core 2 are found to be more than 40 suggesting the predominance of weathering activity. Low PIA values are observed at the depth of 54-70 cm indicating the moderately weathered nature of the sediments in the study area. Positive correlation between Fe and Mg and their negative relationship with silica indicates the presence of ferromagnesian debris in top of the sediments. Major oxide geochemistry indicates a heterogeneous and moderately weathered to unweathered source for the sediments of the present study area.

AB  - Forests are living dynamic systems and these unique ecosystems are essential for life on earth. Forest fires are one of the major environmental concerns, economic, and social in the worldwide. The aim of current research is to identify general indicators influencing on forest fire and compare forest fire susceptibility maps based on the boosted regression tree (BRT), generalized additive model (GAM), and random forest (RF) data mining models in the Minudasht Township, Golestan Province, Iran. According to expert opinion and literature review, fifteen condition factors on forest fire have been selected in the study area. These are slope degree, slope aspect, elevation, topographic wetness index (TWI), topographic position index (TPI), plan curvature, wind effect, annual temperature and rainfall, soil texture, distance to roads, rivers, and villages, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and land use. Forest fire locations were identified using MODIS images, historical records, and extensive field checking. 106 (approximate to 70%) locations, out of 151 forest fires identified, were used for models building/training, while the remaining 45 (approximate to 30%) cases were used for the models validation.
   BRT, GAM, and RF data mining models were used to distinguish between presence and absence of forest fires and its mapping. These algorithms were used to perform feature selection in order to reveal the variables that contribute more to forest fire occurrence. Finally, for validation of models, the area under the curve (AUC) for forest fire susceptibility maps was calculated. The validation of results showed that AUC for three mentioned models varies from 0.7279 to 0.8770 (AUC(BRT) = 80.84%, AUC(GAM) = 87.70%, and AUC(RF) = 72.79%,). Results indicated that the main drivers of forest fire occurrence were annual rainfall, distance to roads, and land use factors. The results can be applied to primary warning, fire suppression resource planning, and allocation work. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim Most risk assessments and decisions in conservation are based on surrogate approaches, where a group of species or environmental indicators are selected as proxies for other aspects of biodiversity. In the focal species approach, a suite of species is selected based on life history characteristics, such as dispersal limitation and area requirements. Testing the validity of the focal species concept has proved difficult, due to a lack of theory justifying the underlying framework, explicit objectives and measures of success. We sought to understand the conditions under which the focal species concept has merit for conservation decisions. Location Our model system comprised 10 vertebrate species in 39 patches of native forest embedded in pine plantation in New South Wales, Australia. Methods We selected three focal species based on ecological traits. We used a multiple-species reserve selection method that minimizes the expected loss of species, by estimating the risk of extinction with a metapopulation model. We found optimal reserve solutions for multiple species, including all 10 species, the three focal species, for all possible combinations of three species, and for each species individually. Results Our case study suggests that the focal species approach can work: the reserve system that minimized the expected loss of the focal species also minimized the expected species loss in the larger set of 10 species. How well the solution would perform for other species and given landscape dynamics remains unknown. Main conclusions The focal species approach may have merit as a conservation short cut if placed within a quantitative decision-making framework, where the aspects of biodiversity for which the focal species act as proxies are explicitly defined, and success is determined by whether the use of the proxy results in the same decision. Our methods provide a framework for testing other surrogate approaches used in conservation decision-making and risk assessment.

AB  - In underwater hydrocarbon seepage environments, gas hydrates are considered to play a significant role as shallow gas reservoirs and buffers for light hydrocarbon expulsion. Here we report on mixed hydrate structures from the Chapopote Knoll in the southern Gulf of Mexico and discuss several options on how a mixture of structure I (sI) and structure II (sII) gas hydrate may occur in nature. Locally resolving microscopic methods are needed to characterize the coexistence of different hydrate structures at geological hydrate deposits; we used Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and gas chromatography for our investigations. Gas hydrates were found within the matrix and pores of the asphalts extruded at the seafloor. Two of the three hydrate pieces investigated comprised only sI, formed mostly from methane. In contrast, one piece comprised an intimate mixture of both sI and sII with sII representing ca. 25 wt.% and sI ca. 75 wt.% of the hydrate present. The two structures were closely associated within individual grain agglomerates. The crystallites of sII were significantly larger than of sI, suggesting differences in the nucleation density or different crystallite ages. The structural coexistence may be a result of one or more processes: i) de-mixing into two hydrate structures during the growth from the gas phase, which provides an additional degree of freedom for lowering the free energy in the system; ii) fractionated crystallization with a subsequently changing molecular composition; iii) crystallization from separated gas bubbles with different hydrocarbon compositions and water; and iv) partial transformation from sII to sI after hydrate nucleation, ceasing when a thermodynamically stable state was reached. The presented work will affect future assessments of natural hydrate deposits at thermogenic hydrocarbon systems, as it shows that both hydrate types I and II can be present at a certain geological site, and may provide a lingering strength to the system if conditions fall below the sI stability limit. This suggests that present worldwide hydrate occurrences are likely to be underestimated. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To track spatial and temporal changes in the bay, 32 mine-impacted (top) and pre-impact (bottom) samples were analyzed from 16 short sediment cores taken along a transect extending from the pollution source. In addition, short cores from the impacted and reference sites were studied. Recent sediments displayed a geochemical gradient from the inner bay, where mine water is discharged, to the outer bay. Inner bay sites were enriched with C, S, and Fe, whereas Mn was depleted, but has precipitated in the outer bay. Among the heavy metals, Cu, Al, Zn, and Ni concentrations had increased in the inner and mid bay, while Co and Cd concentrations had increased at mid-bay sites. The change from the natural to mine-impacted condition was also seen in faunal gradients. According to ordination and distance measures, the greatest changes in species composition occurred in the inner bay, with fairly small changes in the outer bay. Numerical methods suggested that metals (Cu, Pb, Al, Zn, Cr), redox-sensitive elements (Fe, Mn), organic carbon and nutrients could be related to changes in arcellacean assemblages. Geochemical changes in the impacted core started at similar to 20 cm with increases in S alternating with peaks in Cr and Mg. Heavy metal concentrations increased markedly at 10 cm, after the active mining period, suggesting the beginning of acid mine drainage. Geochemical changes at similar to 20 cm were already apparent in the arcellacean assemblages, but the most notable change coincided with the geochemical shift at 10 cm, with signs of decreased pH. Numerical methods suggest that mining-related metals Co, Cu, Zn and Ni co-vary with arcellaceans, but Al appears to behave independently with respect to the species data.

AB  - The US Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) sampled similar to 500 wadeable streams in the Mid-Atlantic Highlands region of the US during the late spring of 1993 to 1995 for a variety of physical, chemical, and biological indicators of environmental condition. Eighty-eight sites that were minimally affected by human activities were chosen to determine the extent to which geographic and stream-based classifications accounted for variation in the composition of riffle macroinvertebrate assemblages. Bray-Curtis similarities among sites were calculated from the relative abundance of macroinvertebrates to assess the strength of classifications based on geography (ecoregions and catchments), habitat (slope and stream order), and water chemistry (conductivity). For comparison a taxonomic classification (two-way indicator species analysis, TWINSPAN) and a gradient analysis (correspondence analysis, CA) were performed on the macroinvertebrate data. To assess the effect of taxonomic resolution, all analyses were completed at the family level and to lowest practical taxon. The large overall variation within and among ecoregions resulted in a low average classification strength (CS) of ecoregions, although some ecoregions had high CS. Stream order had the highest CS of the habitat and water chemistry classifications. Ecoregion CS increased, however, when stream sites were 1(st) stratified by stream order (ecoregions nested within stream order). Nested ecoregion CS did not increase within 1(st)-order streams, yet increased within 2(nd)- and 3(rd)-order streams. CA ordinations and TWINSPAN classification showed a clear gradient of streams along stream size (order), with a clear separation of 1(st)- and 3(rd)-order streams based on macroinvertebrate composition. The ordinations did not, however, show a distinct clustering of sites on the basis of ecoregions. Overall, the lowest practical taxon level of identification resulted in a clearer pattern of sites in ordination space than did family-level identification, yet only a slight improvement in the different classifications (geographic, habitat, and water chemistry) based on average similarity.

AB  - Zooplanktons are bio-indicators of water ecosystems. Their diversity depends on the water condition. In the present study, samples were collected from the six different locations of two Rivers namely; Saraswati and Shingoda for the study of zooplankton diversity. These rivers are located in Gir-Somnath district of Gujarat. The entire work was carried out during the winter season and the effort was being made to analyze the diversity of Zooplankton in different selected sites to compare the diversity found in both the rivers. During the survey 14 physicochemical parameters of water like pH, Electric conductivity, DO, BOD, TS, TDS, TSS, Total Hardness, Ca++ Hardness, Mg+ Hardness, Alkalinity, Acidity, Salinity, and Chlorinity were also analyzed. Total 16 species of zooplankton were recorded among which Acrocalanus gracilis, Calanopia minor, Centropages tenuiremis, Copepod nauplii, Tortanus barbatus, Pseudodiaptomus serricaudatus and Tortanus forcipatus were the most dominant zooplankton.

AB  - Nummulites-Discocyclina bioclastic packstone and Discocyclina rudstone occur in the transgressive sequence of the Middle-Upper Eocene deposits in the Tatra Mts. The succession of the studied facies is a direct response to a rapid environmental change, related to progressive deepening. Facies transition from Nummulites-Discocyclina bioclastic packstone of proximal mid-ramp to Discocylina rudstone of distal mid- and outer-ramp is an exemplary record of a deposition during deepening conditions. Increasing of diversity of the genus Discocyclina, decreasing of diversity of other foraminifera up the section and vertical variation of orthophragminid morphotypes from the ovate- through saddle- to the disc-shaped tests are related to deepening and shadowing of the depositional environment.

AB  - The field system of the Wadi Faynan in southern Jordan was fed by an ancient combination irrigation system that incorporated runoff farming and diversion irrigation techniques. The hydraulic characteristics of this system were most probably designed to take advantage of the confluence of three tributary streams. A theoretical model of discharge produced by runoff is based on contemporary ground conditions and historic climate reconstructions. The design principles of the main hydraulic features are examined and velocity and discharge measurements in principal conveyance irrigation channels are reconstructed. The design of this hydraulic system took into account the environmental constraints and opportunities of the area and maximized different sources of water in the catchment using various techniques of water collection.

AB  - Ecological Risk Assessments (EcoRAs) often fail to reflect important ecological conditions and processes that modulate exposure to chemicals. Greater ecological realism and more informed management decisions could be obtained if better use of landscape features were used to characterize sites. Wildlife habitat suitability models provide efficient methods to characterize landscape features that are relevant for specific species or guilds of interest (i.e., assessment species). This can help avoid assessing exposure in areas in which a wildlife species would be absent because of a lack of habitat or to bound exposure estimates in areas with low habitat quality. The results of habitat suitability are best viewed as generalized predictions of carrying capacity that provide useful insights into wildlife use patterns. The models can provide valuable information for use in modifying exposure estimates in ecological risk assessments.

AB  - A one-dimensional bubble plume model is described to predict the gaseous mass transfer of air bubbles into ambient water and the appropriate design criteria of a bubbler for a linearly stratified reservoir. The bubble plume behavior is governed by two dimensionless parameters: G, the strength of stratification, and M, the source strength (via airflow rate). Mechanical efficiency, an indicator of bubbler operating Costa the rate of plume entrainment flux, an indicator of mixing effectiveness; and the oxygen dissolution efficiency are analyzed as functions of G and,If for different air bubble sizes to describe optimum bubbler design conditions. A bubble radius close to 1 mm is recommended as it favors higher mechanical efficiency and oxygen dissolution efficiency. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Capsicum plants were grown under controlled greenhouse conditions and different combinations of NK dosage were applied to the crop resulting in 12 treatments. Leaf levels of pigments and nonstructural carbohydrates were analysed and fruit yield was determined. The best yield results were obtained with a fertirrigation of N180K40. The effect of joint NK fertilization was most acutely observed on the leaf levels of chlorophyll a and carotenoids. In general, carbohydrates also showed the effects of NK interaction. The chlorophyll a is a good indicator or at least the best indicator found in the present experiment of the effect of NK fertilization. Applying doses of N and K together favoured the processes of chlorophyll and carbohydrate synthesis. The use of the optimum fertilization formulae would reduce the economic and ecological impact caused by the application of high levels of N and K.

AB  - A study of sedimentary structures of cold-climate coastal dunes along Eastern Hudson Bay, Canada, showed that in areas of very sparsely vegetated surfaces, tractional sedimentary processes are dominant while in partly and well vegetated areas, grainfall deposition is the dominant sedimentary process. Alternating fine and coarse sand strata are characteristic of the vegetated foredune ridge. Coarse strata are interpreted to be mainly related to niveo-aeolian deposition. In poorly vegetated areas deformed strata associated with the melting of snow were preserved. A vaguely stratified strata interpreted as a dimpled surface as well as coarse lenses with irregular basal contact were found. Such distinctive sedimentary structures may represent good indicators of cold-climate conditions and could serve as criteria to identify aeolianites that may have been deposited in similar cold-climate environments in palaeoenvironmental reconstructions.

AB  - Measured and derived meteorological parameters are used to examine the changes in air mass associated with local winds of differing origin. Research conducted explores the usefulness of wet bulb potential temperature, equivalent potential temperature, virtual potential temperature and relative humidity as indicators of air mass change during sea breeze, foehn wind and nocturnal drainage flow events. The complex interactions between these different topgraphically-induced wind systems in South Canterbury, New Zealand, provide an environment in which marked changes in air mass characteristics are common. Results demonstrate that under a considerable range of boundary-layer conditions, measured wet bulb potential temperature when used in conjunction with windspeed and direction enables quick and accurate determination of air mass origin. Relative humidity was also found to respond closely to changes in local air mass type, but its dependence on air temperature makes it a less reliable indicator.

AB  - Objective. Gross mode, the work climate has been studied as an area inherent in leadership. In the case of the one that is distinguished by its communication and vertical motivation, the work environment has been addressed as a determinant of flexibility in terms of conditions, salaries and benefits. In this regard, the objective of this paper has been to explore the dimensions of climate and labor flexibility in order to establish the dependency relationships between its indicators. Methodology. A non-experimental, cross-sectional and correlational study was carried out with a non-probabilistic sample selection of 300 employees from central Mexico. Results and conclusions. The labor climate determines the flexibility, although the most recent literature warns that rather the climate mediates the relationship between the flexibility policies on staff turnover, the informal salary and the absence of benefits. Research lines arc recommended concerning the incidence of leadership styles in the variables in question.

AB  - The historical development of Peru's sardine (Sardinops sagax) fishery between 1978 and 2005 is described from fishery indicators (landings and effort) and environmental indicators (Pacific Decadal Oscillation [PM] index, Southern Oscillation Index, and Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly) in order to observe the spatial and temporal variations of the fishery. During this period, the fishery indicators showed that excessive fishing pressure caused the drastic decline in abundance, as demonstrated by the low catch levels in recent years. Regarding the environmental indicators, a positive relationship with sardine landing anomalies was observed; however, the PDO index had a significant positive correlation (r(pearson) = 0.50; P = 0.0005; n = 45) in comparison with the other indices. The results of this study show that the effects of overfishing and adverse environmental conditions strongly impacted the Peruvian sardine population, with the consequent collapse of the fishery.

AB  - Evaluating and comparing development alternatives with regard to sustainability is an important goal for comprehensive project appraisal. In the United States, this component has been largely missing from standard environmental impact assessment practice. Cumulative effects assessment provides a way to appraise the sustainability of project alternatives in terms of their probable contributions to long-term trends affecting the condition of valued environmental components. Sustainability metrics and predictors are being developed as criteria for rating systems and evaluation processes that are applied to community planning, building design, and transportation infrastructure. Increasing interest in adaptive management is also providing cost-effective solutions to optimizing safety and function throughout the long-term operation of a facility or infrastructure. Recent federal legislation is making it easier to integrate sustainability features into development alternatives through early, community-based planning. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper describes the experience gained in operating a membrane bioreactor (MBR) for the treatment of blackwater. Beside a complete characterization of blackwater, operational conditions and removal efficiency concerning parameters such as COD, BOD5, nitrogen and phosphorus as well as microbiological parameters were determined. Furthermore the membrane performance was investigated. The results show that in blackwater treatment nitrogen removal is limited in the biological process, because of the blackwater matrix (BOD5:TKN=1.1:1.0). Blackwater contains a high fraction of soluble, inert COD, which is not degradable by biological operation, only. Phosphorus elimination was negligible, probably induced by precipitation of cellular phosphorus. Although the released permeate was free of the fecal indicators E. coli and streptococcus and met guideline values, a direct reuse as service water is not recommended due to the yellowish coloration.

AB  - This Paper presents a simple assay for the direct quantification of small-sized (up to 1000 bp) fragmented DNA based on the differential separation between large and small-sized DNA by polyethylene glycol precipitation. The assay can be applied to as low as 1 mu g ml(-1) DNA and has a very low DNA detection limit (0.01 mu g ml(-1) fragmented DNA), which can be further lowered at least 10-fold with anion exchange chromatography. The assay quantifies for the first time a more direct indicator of the extent of DNA damage than the usually assessed DNA nicks and base modifications, since small-sized fragmented DNA represents an unrepairable DNA damage of necrotic and apoptotic events that are related to normal and abnormal biological conditions.

Using standard techniques in marine chemistry on board ship, it is possible to infer a great deal about the composition and condition of the plankton. In addition, the organic matter content in terms of cell volume was determined for each group of plankton. Variation of chemical composition with depth was also considered. The ratio carbohydrates/lipids (Cbh/Lip) was used as an indicator of the chemical quality of the plankton.

AB  - The possibility of using proline accumulation and fluorescence inhibition as predictive tests for drought tolerance in durum wheat has been investigated. The drought susceptibility of 25 genotypes was evaluated by comparing yields and yield components in irrigated and non irrigated conditions in the field. A drought susceptibility index (DSI) was calculated based on yields from irrigated and dry treatments and compared with the results obtained using the two physiological criteria. Proline accumulation and chlorophyll fluorescence inhibition were found to be significantly and negatively correlated with DSI of grain yield, biological yield, and thousand kernel weight, and tiller index. The use of both criteria for breeding durum wheat in Mediterranean dryland is discussed.

AB  - Gonad-somatic index (GSI), the relation of ovarian to somatic weight, was calculated for 14 species of finfish that are yearlong residents of the New York Bight.  Specimens were collected monthly from June 1974 through June 1975 in the ocean and associated estuarine waters of the Bight.  Analysis indicated that alewife and yellowtail flounder are spring spawners; silver and red hake, black sea bass, butterfish, striped and northern searobin, and fourspot flounder are summer spawners; and summer and winter flounder are fall-winter spawners.  Offshore hake exhibited a protracted spawning season with ripe females collected from spring through fall, while spotted hake and windowpane exhibited bimodal spawning patterns with two GSI peaks per year.  The co-occurrence of spawning with appropriate food supply and environmental conditions is discussed on an individual-species as well as species-complex basis.

AB  - Balancing erosion control and the water conservation service is the primary goal of intensive revegetation in water-limited conditions. In this study, a field experiment was conducted in the dryland Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP), to investigate the role of vegetation pattern and density in their tradeoff between soil conservation (SC) and soil water retention (SWR). Five vegetation patterns (up-slope covered, downslope covered, low and high uniformly covered, no coverage) with three levels of grass density (220 g m(-2), 110 g m(-2), and 0) were designed and implemented. A novel indicator EEW (the exchange between erosion reduction and water consumption), as the cost of any extra depletion of soil water to improve each unit of soil conservation, was used to represent the tradeoff during a complete dry-wet-dry soil water convert cycle. The higher EEW, the poorer tradeoff between SC and SWR. It was illustrated that higher vegetation density could promote SC but not inevitably suppress EEW. The present typical grass density in CLP, round 220 g m(-2), was redundant in optimizing the SC-SWR tradeoff. A concentrated and centralized vegetation distribution mainly in the downslope obtained an EEW at 11.6 mm m(2) kg(-1) and was confirmed as a favoured vegetation pattern. The simulated typical density and spatial pattern in CLP (about 220 g m(-2) and uniformly distribution) had EEW at 20.5 mm m(2) kg(-1), by reducing the density to about 110 g m(-2) and a downslope centralized vegetation redistribution, the EEW was reduced by 43.4%. Under long-term drought conditions at dry-wet-dry cycles, soil water decreased more sharply in the Full-covered plots, due to more evapotranspiration and vertical water loss caused by higher plant density, compared with half-covered and bare soil plots. The present study confirmed that planted density and vegetation pattern can manipulate SC-SWR tradeoff and it was thus possible to optimize it by adjusting revegetation's intensity and structures in practice.

AB  - The exhumation history of the Central Tibetan Mountain Range (CTMR) in the Qiangtang terrane is important for establishing the boundary conditions prior to the India-Asia collision. Previous studies suggest that the CTMR is a significant provenance for Jurassic sediments in the Qiangtang terrane. The Middle Jurassic sediments north of the CTMR provide crucial information to constrain the timing of exhumation in the source area. Here we present detailed stratigraphic sections and detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology in the northern Qiangtang basin. Sedimentary facies analyses indicate that the Early-Middle Jurassic Quemoco Formation is mainly deposited in the deltaic system and carbonate-platform environment. Upsection, the Middle Jurassic Xiali Formation was deposited in a prodelta environment. Combined analyses of palaeocurrent indicators, conglomerate clast composition and U-Pb age spectra suggest that the CTMR is the main provenance for the Quemoco and Xialai formations; while the Triassic southern Qiangtang strata and Jinsha suture are the secondary source areas. The changes in the specific position of detrital zircon U-Pb age peaks around 500 Ma indicate evolving source terranes. Detrital zircon U-Pb geochronological data from the base of the Quemoco Formation and top of the Xiali Formation constrain the conservative maximum depositional ages to be 174.8 +/- 1.0 and 161.7 +/- 2.3 Ma, respectively. Combined with previous geochronology data, structural geology, and provenance studies across the Qiangtang terrane, the CTMR experienced rapid exhumation during Middle Jurassic and Late Cretaceous and slow exhumation since Eocene. The Jurassic uplift and exhumation of the CTMR were accompanied by the uplift of the southern Qiangtang terrane. The deformation and exhumation history is in favour of the hypothesis that plateau growth in the south-central Qiangtang terrane initiated during the Mesozoic, which is an important initial condition to quantify Cenozoic growth of the Tibetan Plateau.

AB  - Urban agglomerations - irrespective of their size or location - may act not only as engines of economic growth, but also as vehicles of environmental and climate sustainability that may stimulate both socioeconomic achievements and environmentally-benign outcomes. Clearly, the efficiency of these outcomes may differ for different types of urban agglomeration in the world. This paper aims to present and test an advanced methodology for assessing economic and sustainability-oriented performance strategies for global cities, by developing and applying a super-efficient Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model. We compare 40 global cities - included in the Global Power City Index (GPCI) database - in a benchmark study in order to trace the highest-performing urban regions from both an economic and environmental-climatological efficiency perspective, by applying relevant quantitative GPCI indicators to these 40 cities. Our ultimate goal is to test what is termed the 'delinking' hypothesis, from the viewpoint of both economic prosperity and urban size externalities.
   This approach will be applied empirically by examining the GPCI data set comprised of various multidimensional and empirically verified indicators on economic performance and climatological-environmental conditions for the 40 global cities concerned. We regard both the size of these agglomerations and their economic welfare position as critical parameters for assessing their economic and environmental efficiency performance. In the framework of our original DEA approach, these urban areas are categorised according to 2x2 dimensions, viz. in terms of both agglomeration size (big or medium-sized) and the economic development level of the area (highly developed or developing/emerging). Our contribution serves to assess - by means of regression techniques - the highest performing agglomerations among the urban sustainability champions on the basis of the two above-mentioned assessment criteria. This approach provides the opportunity to test the so-called Kuznets sustainability curve under two different conditions, viz. agglomeration size and economic development. The study presents and interprets the empirical findings for these four classes of global cities. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Iodine is an extremely important substance for living beings, which has a versatile biological activity and provides functional activity of almost all body systems due to participation in metabolism. The use of inorganic compounds of iodine salts is not always effective enough, as they are unstable, easily oxidized in air, as a result, the content of available iodine significantly reduces. In this regard, a promising direction in the correction of iodine deficiency is the use of organic forms of iodine, when the element is in chemical connection with any organic substance. Nowadays the work in this direction is conducted in Limited liability company "Phili N-Pharm" (Moscow) they let out the iodine-containing additives "Yoddar" and "Yoddar-Zn". The scientific and economic experience to study the impact of different forms of iodine feedings on the productivity of lactating sheep of Tushin breed was conducted in the Joint stock company "Saniba" the suburban district of the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania in the period from 2016 to 2017. For the experiment, 40 purebred young ewes, originating from first-class ewes and one inseminator sheep, were selected at birth. All the lambs were divided into 4 groups with 10 lambs in each: one control group and three experimental groups. The maintenance and feeding conditions of all groups were similar; the only difference was that the experienced young ewes' groups received different iodine medicaments in addition to their diet. The amount of iodine fertilizing was added to the feed based on the calculation of 2 mg of iodine per 1 kg of dry matter of the diet. Feed iodine supplements had a positive effect on the hematopoietic organs: their use helped to improve the overall condition of the blood: the number of red blood cells increased by 1.4-6.7%, hemoglobin-by 5.3-8.8% and leukocytes-by 4.4-7.6%. The best results on these indicators were obtained in lambs of experimental groups receiving "Yoddar-Zn".

AB  - Urban areas in Europe are facing a range of environmental public health challenges, such as air pollution, traffic noise and road injuries. The identification and quantification of the public health risks associated with exposure to environmental conditions is important for prioritising policies and interventions that aim to diminish the risks and improve the health of the population. With this purpose in mind, the EURO-HEALTHY project used a consistent approach to assess the impact of key environmental risk factors and urban environmental determinants on public health in European metropolitan areas. A number of environmental public health indicators, which are closely tied to the physical and built environment, were identified through stakeholder consultation; data were collected from six European metropolitan areas (Athens, Barcelona, Lisbon, London, Stockholm and Turin) covering the period 2000-2014, and a health impact assessment framework enabled the quantification of health effects (attributable deaths) associated with these indicators. The key environmental public health indicators were related to air pollution and certain urban environmental conditions (urban green spaces, road safety). The air pollution was generally the highest environmental public health risk; the associated number of deaths in Athens, Barcelona and London ranged between 800 and 2300 attributable deaths per year. The number of victims of road traffic accidents and the associated deaths were lowest in the most recent year compared with previous years. We also examined the positive impacts on health associated with urban green spaces by calculating reduced mortality impacts for populations residing in areas with greater green space coverage; results in Athens showed reductions of all-cause mortality of 26 per 100,000 inhabitants for populations with benefits of local greenspace. Based on our analysis, we discuss recommendations of potential interventions that could be implemented to reduce the environmental public health risks in the European metropolitan areas covered by this study.

AB  - A modelling approach for the thermal acclimation of plant photosynthesis and respiration is presented that accounts for changes in the maximum carbon (C) assimilation with changing growth temperature. It is motivated by one key observation, i.e. the optimum temperature for plant processes increases with increasing growth temperature, and two corollary expectations: (i) this determines a modification of the response curve of C assimilation, and (ii) plant C release (respiration) is also affected by changing growth temperature. Simple relations are proposed to model these phenomena, consistent with the Farquhar model of photosynthesis. The incorporation of temperature acclimation of plant photosynthesis and respiration into the Farquhar-based scheme of the Pasture Simulation model (PaSim; EMS: existing modelling solution, MMS: modified modelling solution) is proposed as a way to reduce the uncertainty in estimations of harvested or standing above ground biomass and C fluxes from grassland systems in Central France. Here we show that, across a flux tower grassland site spanning two alternative grazing regimes (Laqueuille, 45 degrees 38' N, 02 degrees 44' E, 1040 m a.s.l.), acclimation parameterizations improve model ability to reproduce observed ecosystem respiration (especially with extensive grazing, where root mean square error [RMSE] lowered from 15.20 to 11.59 g C m(-2) week(-1)). An assessment at two grassland systems (Saint-Genes-Champanelle and Theix, 45 degrees 43' N, 03 degrees 01' E, 880 m a.s.l.) with alternative cutting regimes and climate conditions also showed some improvements in biomass estimates (e.g. with frequent cutting and experimental extreme summer event RMSE changed from 0.86 to 0.40 t DM ha(-1)). The consequences of acclimation for simulated grassland outputs depend on the conditions evaluated which requires further studies. However, our results suggest that grassland modelling omitting plant temperature acclimation is likely to overestimate C emissions, thus biasing projections of future C storage and estimates of policy-making indicators.

AB  - A foodborne Escherichia coli 0157:H7 outbreak in December 2006 included 77 illnesses reported in Iowa and Minnesota. Epidemiologic investigations by health departments in those states and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified shredded iceberg lettuce (Lactuca sativa L) as the vehicle of transmission. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Minnesota and California public health agencies traced the lettuce to several growing regions in California based on information from a lettuce processor in Minnesota.
   Samples from an environmental investigation initiated by the California Food Emergency Response Team (CalFERT) revealed a genetic match between the outbreak strain and environmental samples from a single farm, leading to an in-depth systems-based analysis of the irrigation water system on that farm. This paper presents findings from that systems-based analysis, which assessed conditions on the farm potentially contributing to contamination of the lettuce. The farm had three sources of irrigation water: groundwater from onsite wells, surface water delivered by a water management agency and effluent from wastewater lagoons on nearby dairy farms. Wastewater effluent was blended with the other sources and used only to irrigate animal feed crops. However, water management on the farm, including control of wastewater blending, appeared to create potential for cross-contamination. Pressure gradients and lack of backflow measures in the irrigation system might have created conditions for cross-contamination of water used to irrigate lettuce. The irrigation network on the farm had evolved over time to meet various needs, without an overall analysis of how that evolution potentially created vulnerabilities to contamination,of irrigation water. The type of systems analysis described here is one method for helping to ensure that such vulnerabilities are identified and addressed. A preventive, risk-based management approach, such as the Water Safety Plan process for drinking water, may also be useful in managing irrigation water quality. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Suspended sediment and particle size measurements were in this study performed with two instruments based on laser diffraction. The measurements were conducted in the river Danube during a 1-year flood, which enabled measurements in a large scale and under conditions with high sediment load. The aim of this study was to compare LISST-SL stationary measurements with LISST-SL moving measurements to gain knowledge for extensive field surveys of large areas. The moving measurements were performed in four different depths along a transect and compared with stationary measurements in five verticals in the same depths. The results showed that the measured suspended sediment concentrations are smaller for the moving measurements compared to the stationary measurements. In addition thus the d(50) was smaller for the moving measurements, which is an indicator for the phenomena of non-isokinetic sampling. A comparison of the pump speed of the two operation modes proofed that during LISST-SL moving measurements a non-isokinetic sampling effect occurred. Hence, a suction effect happened, resulting in an underestimation of particles > 63 mu m. Beside the LISST-SL simultaneously a LISST-STX was used during the field survey to investigate the behavior and the results of the instrument under conditions where it is originally not designed for. However, the predominant suspended sediment concentrations in the river influenced the measurements and thus multiple scattering occurred. As a consequence the measurements of the suspended sediment concentrations showed lower values for the measured suspended sediment concentrations compared to the LISST-SL stationary measurements. It could also be seen that due to the high amount of fine particles, which were transported during the flood event, a re-scattering of light occurred also in case of measurements where the value for the optical transmission was with 0.38 above the standardized used limit of 0.3.

AB  - The loss of biodiversity caused by wetland degradation is a hot issue in ecology It is known that hydrological degradation is the primary reason resulting in wetland degradation, but little is known about the relationship between plant species richness and environmental factors in different wetland types along a hydrological gradient. According to the gradient from high to low water level, wetland remnants in the Sanjiang Plain of northeast China were classified into three wetland types, which were permanently inundated marshes (PIM), seasonally inundated marshes (SIM) and wet meadows (WM) respectively. In this paper, we aimed to identify the determinants of plant species richness in the three wetland types and discern the transition of the determinants along a hydrological gradient. Plant species richness as well as area, habitat heterogeneity and resource availability was investigated in 51 wetland remnants, which were composed of 6 PIM, 25 SIM and 20 WM. Averagely, the area of wetland remnants occupied by PIM, SIM and WM was 0.35 +/- 0.17 ha, 2.81 +/- 2.88 ha and 1.34 +/- 1.18 ha respectively. Aggregating the species in each wetland type, there were 67, 244 and 170 species recorded in PIM, SIM and WM. The determinants of species richness varied in different wetland types: standing water depth in PIM, area and water heterogeneity in SIM, and soil fertility and area in WM. With the decreasing water level, the influence of hydrological condition on species richness in the three wetland types declined while the impact of area and soil fertility gradually increased. Thus, hydrological condition was probably responsible for the transition of the determinants of species richness in different wetland types. Moreover, the habitat specialists of wetland would be lost when PIM or SIM degraded to WM. In order to conserve and restore plant diversity, specific measures should be taken including preventing area loss for all wetland remnants, managing the hydrological process for PIM and SIM, and regulating soil nutrient for WM.

AB  - Benthic foraminifera are established indicators for Water Quality (WQ) in Florida and the Caribbean. However, nearshore coral reefs of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and other Pacific regions are also subjected to increased nutrient and sediment loads. Here, we investigate the use of benthic foraminifera as indicators to assess status and trends of WQ on GBR reefs. We quantified several sediment parameters and the foraminiferan assemblage composition on 20 reefs in four geographic regions of the GBR, and along a water column nutrient and turbidity gradient. Twenty-seven easily recognisable benthic foraminiferan taxa (>63 mu m) were distinguished. All four geographic regions differed significantly ( p < 0.05, ANOSIM) in their assemblage composition, and a redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that sediment parameters only explained a small proportion of the variance in the assemblage composition. On nine reefs along a previously studied water quality gradient, foraminifera showed a distinct shift in assemblage composition towards larger symbiont-bearing taxa from turbid inner shelf towards clearer outer shelf reefs. A RDA separated symbiotic and aposymbiotic (heterotrophic) taxa. In addition, total suspended solid and water column chlorophyll a concentrations were negatively correlated, and optical depth and distance to the mainland were positively correlated, with the abundance of symbiont-bearing taxa. Several large foraminifera were identified as indicators for offshore, clear water conditions. In contrast, heterotrophic rotaliids and a species retaining plastids (Elphidium sp.) where highly characteristic for low light, higher nutrient conditions. Application of the FORAM index to GBR assemblage composition showed a significant increase in the value,of this index with increased distance from the mainland in the Whitsunday region (r(2) = 0.75, p < 0.001), and therefore with increasing light and decreased nutrient availability. We conclude that it will be possible to apply this index to GBR and possibly other Pacific reefs after some adaptations and additional experimental work on species-specific limiting factors.

AB  - Assessing the persistence of chemicals in the environment is a key element in existing regulatory frameworks to protect human health and ecosystems. Persistence in the environment depends on many fate processes, including abiotic and biotic transformations and physical partitioning, which depend on substances' physicochemical properties and environmental conditions. A main challenge in persistence assessment is that existing frameworks rely on simplistic and reductionist evaluation schemes that may lead substances to be falsely assessed as persistent or the other way around-to be falsely assessed as nonpersistent. Those evaluation schemes typically assess persistence against degradation half-lives determined in single-compartment simulation tests or against degradation levels measured in stringent screening tests. Most of the available test methods, however, do not apply to all types of substances, especially substances that are poorly soluble, complex in composition, highly sorptive, or volatile. In addition, the currently applied half-life criteria are derived mainly from a few legacy persistent organic pollutants, which do not represent the large diversity of substances entering the environment. Persistence assessment would undoubtedly benefit from the development of more flexible and holistic evaluation schemes including new concepts and methods. A weight-of-evidence (WoE) approach incorporating multiple influencing factors is needed to account for chemical fate and transformation in the whole environment so as to assess overall persistence. The present paper's aim is to begin to develop an integrated assessment framework that combines multimedia approaches to organize and interpret data using a clear WoE approach to allow for a more consistent, transparent, and thorough assessment of persistence.

AB  - Grasslands are crucial components of ecosystems. In recent years, owing to certain natural and socio-economic factors, alpine grassland ecosystems have experienced significant degradation. This study integrated the frequency ratio model (FR) and Bayesian belief networks (BBN) for grassland degradation risk assessment to mitigate several issues found in previous studies. Firstly, the identification of non-encroached degraded grasslands and shrub-encroached grasslands could help stakeholders more accurately understand the status of different types of alpine grassland degradation. In addition, the index discretization method based on the FR model can more accurately ascertain the relationship between grassland degradation and driving factors to improve the accuracy of results. On this basis, the application of BBN not only effectively expresses the complex causal relationships among various variables in the process of grassland degradation, but also solves the problem of identifying key factors and assessing grassland degradation risks under uncertain conditions caused by a lack of information. The obtained result showed that the accuracies based on the confusion matrix of the slope of NDVI change (NDVIs), shrub-encroached grasslands, and grassland degradation indicators in the BBN model were 85.27, 88.99, and 74.37%, respectively. The areas under the curve based on the ROC curve of NDVIs, shrub-encroached grasslands, and grassland degradation were 75.39% (P < 0.05), 66.57% (P < 0.05), and 66.11% (P < 0.05), respectively. Therefore, this model could be used to infer the probability of grassland degradation risk. The results obtained using the model showed that the area with a higher probability of degradation (P > 30%) was 2.22 million ha (15.94%), with 1.742 million ha (78.46%) based on NDVIs and 0.478 million ha (21.54%) based on shrub-encroached grasslands. Moreover, the higher probability of grassland degradation risk was mainly distributed in regions with lower vegetation coverage, lower temperatures, less potential evapotranspiration, and higher soil sand content. Our research can provide guidance for decision-makers when formulating scientific measures for alpine grassland restoration.

AB  - Uganda faces a considerable challenge to match its food production to an annual population growth rate of 3%. Cooking bananas are the country's most produced staple crop but the annual national harvest is not increasing. The crop grows on infertile soils that are normally fertilised organically and often susceptible to erosion. Soil nematodes are well-established as bioindicators of soil quality that can support environmental monitoring and assessment of the sustainability of agricultural systems. These invertebrates are a highly ranked indicator of biodiversity with molecular approaches available. Consequently, we have applied next-generation DNA sequencing of soil nematodes to evaluate soil quality of Ugandan banana plantations. The aim is to establish a method for constructing an aspect of an environmental biosafety dossier with the future aim of assessing the impact of transgenic crops and improving current cropping systems. The soil samples did not differ significantly in any of the measured soil chemistry factors, soil texture or percentage of organic matter. Thirty taxons of soil nematodes other than the plant parasites were recovered from soil supporting nine banana plantations plus three each from coffee and banana-coffee interplants from East and West Uganda. Cluster analysis correctly allocated each plantation to the crop/intercrop being grown when based on the abundance of taxa rather than taxa presence or absence. This indicates that the host has considerable effects on the abundance of specific nematode species within the soil. Overall, nematodes were more abundant in soil from coffee plantations than from bananacoffee interplants with the lowest values being from fields supporting just banana. Only the basal and trophic diversity indices and the percentage of nematodes that are rapid colonisers varied between the three plantation types. The soil of all fifteen plantations can be classified as having a mature soil web condition with low physical disturbance, limited chemical stressors, moderately high nutrient enrichment and balanced decomposition channels.

AB  - This paper presents the paleoenvironmental reconstruction of a mire sequence near the village Blatuga, with a focus on changes in vegetation composition, hydrological regime and fire history of the Banovina/Kordun area during the last two millennia. For this purpose, pollen, non-pollen and charcoal analysis were done. By the application of CONISS statistical analysis three different pollen assemblage (sub)zones could have been distinguished: a dominance of alder-beech/oaks from the 2nd to the middle of the 7th century, followed by a prevalence of grasses-beech/oaks till the end of the 13th century. Finally, an assemblage of grasses-hornbeam/oaks populated the area from the 14th to the beginning of the 20th century. The high abundance of peat mosses (Sphagnum) from the 11th to the end of the 14th century must indicate increased precipitation and higher frequencies of rainfall during the Medieval Climate Anomaly. Transition from an ombrotrophic to minerotrophic phase of mire evolution during the Little ke Age is caused by changing in moisture level, with somewhat wetter period prevailing till the middle of the 17th century followed by drier conditions till the beginning of the 20th century. Although cereal pollen grains first appear from the layers dated to the late 14th century and the proportion of secondary anthropogenic indicators were low during the entire Middle Ages, a large number of charcoal particles suggests stronger anthropogenic activity than indicated by observed changes in vegetation composition. Still, a sharp rise of non-arboreal pollen during the Migration period most likely reflect a general natural succession process on mire surface than persuable proof of Avaric-Slavic impact on vegetation. Direct anthropogenic pressure indicated by weeds and cereal pollen can be tracked from the Late Middle Ages onwards.

AB  - Earthworms are important ecosystem engineers, and assessment of the risk of plant protection products toward them is part of the European environmental risk assessment (ERA). In the current ERA scheme, exposure and effects are represented simplistically and are not well integrated, resulting in uncertainty when the results are applied to ecosystems. Modeling offers a powerful tool to integrate the effects observed in lower tier laboratory studies with the environmental conditions under which exposure is expected in the field. This paper provides a summary of the (In)Field Organism Risk modEling by coupling Soil Exposure and Effect (FORESEE) Workshop held 28-30 January 2020 in Dusseldorf, Germany. This workshop focused on toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TKTD) and population modeling of earthworms in the context of ERA. The goal was to bring together scientists from different stakeholder groups to discuss the current state of soil invertebrate modeling and to explore how earthworm modeling could be applied to risk assessments, in particular how the different model outputs can be used in the tiered ERA approach. In support of these goals, the workshop aimed at addressing the requirements and concerns of the different stakeholder groups to support further model development. The modeling approach included 4 submodules to cover the most relevant processes for earthworm risk assessment: environment, behavior (feeding, vertical movement), TKTD, and population. Four workgroups examined different aspects of the model with relevance for risk assessment, earthworm ecology, uptake routes, and cross-species extrapolation and model testing. Here, we present the perspectives of each workgroup and highlight how the collaborative effort of participants from multidisciplinary backgrounds helped to establish common ground. In addition, we provide a list of recommendations for how earthworm TKTD modeling could address some of the uncertainties in current risk assessments for plant protection products.Integr Environ Assess Manag2020;00:1-12.

AB  - The aim of European water policy is to achieve good ecological status in all rivers, lakes, coastal and transitional waters by 2027. Currently, more than half of water bodies are in a degraded condition and nutrient enrichment is one of the main culprits. Therefore, there is a pressing need to establish reliable and comparable nutrient criteria that are consistent with good ecological status.
   This paper highlights the wide range of nutrient criteria currently in use by Member States of the European Union to support good ecological status and goes on to suggest that inappropriate criteria may be hindering the achievement of good status. Along with a comprehensive overview of nutrient criteria, we provide a critical analysis of the threshold concentrations and approaches by which these are set. We identify four essential issues: (1) Different nutrients (nitrogen and/or phosphorus) are used for different water categories in different countries. (2) The use of different nutrient fractions (total, dissolved inorganic) and statistical summary metrics (e.g., mean, percentiles, seasonal, annual) currently hampers comparability between countries, particularly for rivers, transitional and coastal waters. (3) Wide ranges in nutrient threshold values within shared water body types, in some cases showing more than a 10-told difference in concentrations. (4) Different approaches used to set threshold nutrient concentrations to define the boundary between "good" and "moderate" ecological status. Expert judgement-based methods resulted in significantly higher (less stringent) good-moderate threshold values compared with data-driven approaches, highlighting the importance of consistent and rigorous approaches to criteria setting.
   We suggest that further development of nutrient criteria should be based on relationships between ecological status and nutrient concentrations, taking into account the need for comparability between different water categories, water body types within these categories, and countries.

AB  - Swales are popular stormwater source-control infrastructures put in place to mitigate the environmental impacts of urban or road runoff. Over the past 30 years, swale design has evolved with more emphasis on swale outflow quality, but still has a strong empirical basis. Therefore, there is a need to gain insight into the design aspects that could impinge on the treatment efficiency of a swale. To address these knowledge gaps, two pilot swales were specifically designed and built at the CSTB Nantes. Differences between the pilot swales derived from their soil materials in order to assess and compare the performances of a standard swale and a filtering swale. For this purpose, the pilot swales were equipped with a runoff simulator and various measuring devices (i.e. flowmeters and soil moisture sensors). Given the importance to generate high-quality data, the present paper details this measurement chain and examines its operation by simulating the same runoff event six times between November 2017 and April 2018. The reproducibility of the swale responses is discussed in light of the test procedure and the estimated measurement uncertainties. Overall, results emphasize the high reproducibility of the swale hydraulic responses and demonstrate that pollutant fluxes can be accurately monitored at the inlet and the outlet of each swale. Regarding hydraulic indicators, slight dispersion (variation coefficient cv < 5%) of the ratios between outgoing and incoming water (S/E) and between infiltrated and runoff water (I) are likely due to non-similar initial conditions (e.g., natural rainfall preceding the runoff event). Regarding performance indicators of the stormwater treatment, the mass and concentration reduction efficiencies for zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) are within the estimated replicability boundaries. Nevertheless, the high contamination level of Zn in incoming stormwater could explain the lower dispersion of its removal (cv < 30%) with respect to the dispersion of Cu removal (-185% <= cv <= 176%). Overall, the estimated uncertainties of both the monitoring devices and the analytical methods were identified as potential explanations for the observed variations.

AB  - Hydrological connectivity can strongly influence phytoplankton communities and ecological status through the interchange of nutrients and organisms in interconnected aquatic habitats. However, there is little consensus regarding the distinction of environmental variables influencing phytoplankton communities related to hydrological connectivity in different aquatic habitats. In this two-year (2013-2014) study, we investigated phytoplankton communities and their relationships with environmental variables in four hydrologically connected aquatic habitats (from upstream to downstream: the Nur Dongbei wetland, Lake Xiaoxingkai, Lake Xingkai, and the Song'acha River) in the Lake Xingkai basin in northeast China. Our aim was to study the effects of hydrological connectivity on phytoplankton communities, and to identify potential indicators of water quality for the basin. We observed that environmental variables and phytoplankton communities showed spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the four habitats, with higher phytoplankton metrics in Lake Xiaoxingkai and lower phytoplankton metrics in the Song'acha River, including species richness, abundance, biomass, and diversity. Increased nutrient concentrations occurred in those habitats connected to the eutrophic Lake Xiaoxingkai during the hydrologically connected period. Lake Xiaoxingkai, Lake Xingkai, and the Song'acha River were dominated by Chlorophyta, whereas Bacillariophyta was the major component of phytoplankton composition in the Nur Dongbei wetland. Environmental variables influencing phytoplankton communities differed during connected and disconnected periods across the four habitats. Results of Pearson correlation analysis and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that phytoplankton community was mainly affected by concentrations of iron (Fe2+), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) in the lakes; by water depth and transparency in the river; and by pH and silicate concentrations in the wetland. Based on the results of non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis, hydrological connectivity increased phytoplankton community similarity among different habitats during the connected period. Cyclotella meneghiniana and Anabaena azotica could be used as useful indicators to determine water quality conditions due to their strong sensitivity to nutrient concentrations in freshwater bodies. Our findings provide a scientific basis for water quality protection and management at the basin scale.

AB  - Rapid worldwide urbanization is creating novel environments to which animals must adapt, a topic of growing interest for biologists. Studies of how organisms are affected by cities historically centered on large-scale censusing of populations, but recent investigations have considered finer-scaled, urban-rural differences among individuals and species in their behavior, morphology, and physiology, specifically as they relate to urban stress. A number of factors (e. g., corticosterone (CORT)-related stress response) may contribute to the degree of stress experienced by animals living under urban versus natural conditions, but several physiological variables have yet to be considered together in a large-scale assessment. Here, in a widespread species of desert passerine (the house finch, Haemorhous mexicanus), we quantified variation in plasma oxidative stress, plasma concentrations of vitamins and carotenoids, and body-mass of males in three successive seasons (winter, spring, and late summer/early fall) along an urban-rural gradient in Phoenix, Arizona, USA. We found that degree of urbanization was: (1) negatively related to circulating vitamin A concentrations in winter, (2) positively correlated with body-mass during spring, and (3) negatively associated with plasma concentrations of two carotenoids: zeaxanthin (during breeding) and 3-hydroxy-echinenone (3HE) (during molting). The striking link between 3HE levels and urbanization is consistent with previous research showing that urban songbirds have lower carotenoid levels and faded plumage; our finding is the first to implicate specific effects on a metabolically derived carotenoid for coloration. The fact that we observed only season-specific links between urbanization and indicators of quality in finches suggests that (at least for these metrics) there are no strong, lasting urban pressures imposed on finch physiology over the year. Interestingly, we found that a metric of plasma oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation) was positively correlated with levels of two carotenoids (lutein during breeding and 3HE during molting), which is consistent with a prior study of ours showing that finches with redder plumage deposit higher levels of CORT in their feathers; taken together, our studies suggest complex associations between carotenoids and stress.

AB  - Several factors influence land availability for the growth of short rotation coppices (SRC) with fast-growing tree species, including the nationwide availability of agricultural land, economic efficiency, ecological impacts, political boundaries and environmental protection regulations. In this study, we analysed the growing potential of poplar and willow SRC for bioenergy purposes in Germany without negative ecological impacts or land use conflicts. The potential biomass production using SRC on agricultural land in Germany was assessed taking into account ecological, ethical, political and technical restrictions. Using a geographic information system (GIS), digital site maps, climate data and a digital terrain model, the SRC biomass production potential on cropland and grassland was estimated using water supply and mean temperature during the growing season as parameters. From this analysis, a yield model for SRC was developed based on the analysed growth data and site information of 62 short rotation plantations in Germany and France. To assess the technical, ethical and ecological potential of SRC, restrictions in protected areas, technical constraints and competition with food and feed production were investigated. Our results revealed that approximately 18% (2.12Mio.ha) of cropland and 54% (2.5Mio.ha) of grassland in Germany were highly suitable for SRC plantations, providing favourable water supplies and mean temperatures during the growing season. These identified sites produced an average yield of more than 14tons of dry matter per hectare per year. Due to local climate and soil conditions, the federal states in northern and eastern Germany had the highest theoretical SRC potential for agricultural land. After considering all ecological, ethical, political and technical restrictions, as well as future climate predictions, 5.7% (680000ha) of cropland and 33% (1.5Mio.ha) of grassland in Germany were classified as suitable for biomass production with fast-growing tree species in SRC.

AB  - Liming, the application of calcitic materials to soil, is increasingly used in acidic, base-poor sugar maple stands of eastern North America to restore nutritional status and vigor of sugar maple trees. However, few studies have evaluated the effect of base cation addition on other components of these ecosystems. The eastern red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus) is one of the most abundant vertebrates in forests of eastern North America, and is commonly used as an indicator of forest disturbances. So, it is important to know how it might be affected by soil liming. This is the first study dealing with the potential direct and short-term effect of liming on amphibians of North America.
   Lime, in the form of CaCO3 (3 Mg ha(-1)), was added at the surface of microcosms containing a low buffered soil and forest floor from a sugar maple stand to evaluate the short-term effect of this treatment on this amphibian species. Two grades of lime were used in this study: finely ground and sandy CaCO3. Finely powdered lime was included to verify if it could clog salamander skin pores, since this could negatively affect health and growth, and consequently induce mortality. The results suggest that, even when applied in finely ground form, direct contact with lime had no short-term effect on the species' health and survival rate. Given this, and the fact that it can be found in a wide range of soil pH conditions, the redbacked salamander is thus unlikely to be affected by the use of liming to restore acidic, base-poor sugar maple bushes. Some old liming trials carried out in forests of eastern North America could be used in the next years to verify the long-term effects of liming on this species. This should help foresters decide whether or not liming treatments are compatible with conservation, ecological and management objectives. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A 12-year study (2000-2012) of the stable isotopes of recent fluvial tufas has been performed in the Monasterio de Piedra Natural Park (River Piedra, NE Iberian Peninsula), an area of Mediterranean climate with intense tufa deposition since the Pleistocene. The biannual monitoring of the tufa calcite delta C-13 and delta O-18 signatures and of the water delta O-18 value has demonstrated a clear seasonal pattern for the tufa-calcite oxygen isotope composition, with less negative values for cool periods, which is consistent with regional temperature oscillations. The tufa calcite delta C-13 values only occasionally exhibit a pattern, which is inconclusive and opposite to the delta O-18 clear pattern. The water delta O-18 signature has a distinct seasonal pattern, also opposite to the tufa-calcite delta O-18 clear pattern. The temperature calculations from the tufa-calcite delta O-18 values and average water delta O-18 values agree with the seasonal pattern of measured water temperatures, with a mean difference of 2.3 degrees C between the calculated and measured temperatures.
   The anomalous values recorded for both the water and the tufa-calcite oxygen isotope composition during a two-year period are characterized by smoothing of the seasonal variations of the tufa calcite and by reversal of the water pattern. There is also an increase in the differences between the measured and estimated temperatures. The detected anomaly is roughly synchronous with a change in the isotopic signature of the regional precipitation delta O-18 values.
   This contribution demonstrates that tufas in this depositional and climatic context are good indicators of seasonal temperature oscillations, and that tufas can also record other interannual environmental changes such as variations in the isotopic composition of precipitation. These results can be extrapolated to ancient tufa systems developed in similar contexts, which would expand the potential of tufas as high-resolution records of paleoenvironmental conditions.

AB  - 1. In the absence of a standard procedure for characterizing the physical habitat of lakes in Europe, this paper describes the development of a multi-purpose Lake Habitat Survey (LHS). The technique has been designed to meet the hydromorphological assessment needs of the Water Framework Directive (WFD), as well as to assist in monitoring the condition of designated sites in the UK and for wider application in environmental impact assessments and restoration programmes.
   2. LHS involves detailed recording of shoreline features at a number of plots (Hab-Plots), complemented by a meso-scale survey of the entire lake, including shoreline characteristics and pressures, and modifications to the hydrological regime. A temperature and dissolved oxygen profile is also compiled at the deepest point of the lake (Index Site). Existing databases are exploited where possible, and remote sensing data (e.g. aerial photographs) are used to assist field-based observations.
   3. Initial field trials demonstrated that the consistency of the method, whether conducted by boat or on foot, was high. More than 250 surveys were carried out across the UK in 2004 through collaboration with the statutory environment and conservation agencies.
   4. Two levels of complexity were tested - a full version requiring 10 Hab-Plots and an abridged version, LHS,ore. involving four plots and omitting the Index Site. While 8-10 plots were required to capture the full diversity of features at complex sites. LHScore data were sufficient to generate metrics for classification purposes.
   5. A Lake Habitat Modification Score (LHMS) may be calculated from LHS data. This synthesizes a wide array of hydromorphological and human pressures and has direct applications for assessment of ecological status under the WFD. Preliminary analysis illustrates a spectrum of hydromorphological alteration of 82 lakes in the UK.
   6. Further considerations are discussed, including the prospect that the LHS protocol might form the basis of a European standard developed through CEN (Comite Europeen de Normalisation). Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons. Ltd.

AB  - A total of 8300 hatching eggs, laid for 10 successive days by Leghorn (strain G99 and H22), Rhode Island Red (R11), Sussex (S66), Greenleg Partridge, (Z11) and Yellowleg Partridge ((Z) over dot33) hens were investigated. Since all the hatching eggs were laid by hens managed under identical environmental conditions and the hatching process took place in the same hatcher, all the differences in the indicators of fertilization and hatching were considered to be determined by the genotype. The aim of the present experiment was to determine the extent of these differences among the 5 breeds studied. The longest total hatching period was characteristic of the strains Z11 and (Z) over dot33, the medium period of the Leghorn breed (G99 and H22), and the shortest of strain S66. Results of embryopathological analysis of reproductive offal indicate that most abnormalities were noted in the strains G99, R11 and H22 for 116 (10.9%), 90 (8.0%) and 89 (7.7%) embryos respectively. The most common defects were embryo malpositions (head under left wing, 29.8%) in S66, hyperaemia of shell membranes (14.6%) and skin (12.3%) in H22, and swollen head and neck (14.6%) in G99. The frequency of embryo, malpositions demonstrates that the most vulnerable strains are S66 (29.8%) followed by G99 (21.5%), while in the strains Z11 and (Z) over dot33 this defect is relatively rare (16.5% vs. 13.3%). Embryos in which the head is situated between the thighs are also rare (2.5% and 2.6%) as well as those with cerebral hernia (2.5% and 0.0%, respectively). Compared with the findings of Borzemska (1980) who investigated Leghorn hens among, others, the embryos of native breeds of hens, especially Z11 and Z33, are characterized by a much lower incidence of egg 7 malpositions and cephalic anomalies. The incidence of defects such as embryo head in the small end of the egg and head between thighs was also much higher in the studies of Mindur et al. (1987) than in the present experiment.

AB  - Forest soils are being exposed to nutrient deficiency and acidification at increasing rates as a result of intensive management. Mineral fertilization, however, provides a way to improve soil nutrient balance. The aim of this study is to present the effects of mineral fertilization on the properties of forest soil 11 years after fertilization. Our research investigated the effects of dolomite, magnesite and serpentinite fertilization on the physicochemical properties of the soil, soil biological activity, and fungal diversity. We also determined the condition of a new generation of fir trees after mineral fertilization. In autumn, 2008, fertilizers (dolomite, magnesite and serpentinite, specifically) in the amount of 4000 kg.ha(-1) were added to plots in the Wisla Forest District in Poland; one area was left unfertilized to act as the control area for this research. Our results reveal that all fertilization improved the selected soil's physicochemical properties (pH, Ca and Mg content) and accordingly, its biochemical activity; in particular, we found that dolomite (4000 kg.ha(-1)) contributed heavily to soil improvement. The findings also showed that soil pH and calcium content were strongly dependent on enzymatic activity, while dolomite fertilization resulted in a significant increase in biomass size in the fir trees included in this study. In addition to being associated with the highest plant biomass and amounts of enzymatic activity, dolomite-fertilized soil also had the highest number of fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs): 403, compared to 322 OTUs in the control soil. Finally, the fungal communities in the control soil varied significantly from the fungal communities in soils fertilized with dolomite and serpentinite. The results of this research support mineral fertilization, and in particular, fertilization using dolomite in amounts of 4000 kg.ha(-1), to improve soil nutrient supply and to shape the biological activity expressed by the enzymatic activity of forest soils.

AB  - Southern Siberia is currently undergoing rapid warming, inducing changes in vegetation, loss of permafrost, and impacts on the hydrodynamics of lakes and rivers. Lake sediments are key archives of environmental change and contain a record of ecosystem variability, as well as providing proxy indicators of wider environmental and climatic change. Investigating how hydrological systems have responded to past shifts in climate can provide essential context for better understanding future ecosystem changes in Siberia. Oxygen isotope ratios within lacustrine records provide fundamental information on past variability in hydrological systems. Here we present a new oxygen isotope record from diatom silica (delta O-18(diatom)) at Lake Baunt (55 degrees 11'15 '' N, 113 degrees 01,45 '' E), in the southern part of eastern Siberia, and consider how the site has responded to climate changes between the Younger Dryas and Early to Mid Holocene (ca. 12.4 to 6.2 ka cal BP). Excursions in delta O-18(diatom) are influenced by air temperature and the seasonality, quantity, and source of atmospheric precipitation. These variables are a function of the strength of the Siberian High, which controls temperature, the proportion and quantity of winter versus summer precipitation, and the relative dominance of Atlantic versus Pacific air masses. A regional comparison with other Siberian delta O-18(diatom) records, from lakes Baikal and Kotokel, suggests that delta O-18(diatom) variations in southern Siberia reflect increased continentality during the Younger Dryas, delayed Early Holocene warming in the region, and substantial climate instability between similar to 10.5 to similar to 8.2 ka cal BP. Unstable conditions during the Early Holocene thermal optimum most likely reflect localised changes from glacial melting. Taking the profiles from three very different lakes together, highlight the influence of site specific factors on the indi-vidual records, and how one site is not indicative of the region as a whole. Overall, the study documents how sensitive this important region is to both internal and external forcing.

AB  - Peri-urban lakes offer many valued ecosystem services, but their vulnerability to climate change and anthropogenic disturbances increases with increasing human populations the effects and interactions of multiple stressors on lakes can lead to unexpected outcomes, affecting societal and ecological values, it is necessary to evaluate ecosystem trajectories and respective drivers in peri-urban lakes. Better management practices could thus be applied to preserve ecosystem services of peri-urban lakes. We conducted a multi-proxy paleolimnological study on Cultus Lake, British Columbia, a Canadian peri-urban lake experiencing cultural eutrophication, to reconstruct a comprehensive ecological trajectory of the lake over the past similar to 200 years. We also integrated historical data as well as historical archival information to identify the potential drivers of the changes. We identified ca. 1800-1900 CE as a reference period, reflected in muted variations across most paleo-indicators. Minor increases in sedimentary delta N-15 ca. 1880-1940 CE coincided with the onset of anthropogenic modifications to the Cultus Lake watershed. Signs of early eutrophication were evident by ca. 1940 CE, as indicated by increases in all sedimentary pigments. By ca. 1970-1990 CE, elevated concentrations of sedimentary cyanobacterial pigments and changes in diatom species assemblages highlighted the potential interactive effects of multiple stressors, including cultural eutrophication, climate warming and declines in the endangered Cultus Lake sockeye salmon population. Recent (ca. 1990-2008 CE) declines in sedimentary pigments and increases in cladoceran fluxes suggested an increase in top-down control of the lake food web. From the collection of changes observed in the past similar to 200 years in our study, it is clear that Cultus Lake and its associated ecosystem services would benefit from abatement of nutrient loadings from terrestrial and atmospheric sources. Our study emphasizes the complexity and interactivity of drivers in peri-urban lake ecosystems and the necessity of long-term perspectives to contextualize modern ecological conditions to inform lake and watershed management.

AB  - Pineapple is among the most important fruits worldwide. However, the narrow genetic base of current commercial cultivars renders the industry at risk from environmental and other biological threats. Hence, there is a need to develop improved cultivars with tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Our prior research resulted in the establishment of a method for genetic transformation of pineapple. The genetically modified pineapple plants generated were characterized following acclimatization and during the subsequent 8 years under field conditions. The current work highlights the results obtained for histological characterization of roots and leaves of transgenic pineapple plants. The four treatments investigated were macropropagated control plants (untransformed), micropropagated control plants (untransformed), and micropropagated genetically transformed plants (clones 90 and 98). Twenty indicators were measured in plants: two of them did not show statistically significant differences among the four groups of plants (2/20 = 10.0%); six showed "Low" overall coefficients of variation (OCV) (6/20 = 30.0%); 12 showed "Medium" OCVs (12/20 = 60.0%); and only two indicators showed "High" OCVs (2/20 = 10.0%). Consideration of medium OCVs showed that the biomass of transgenic plants was slightly greater than those of the non-transgenic controls. Statistically significant differences between the lines were recorded except in the central cylinder diameter of roots and the D leaf adaxial cuticle thickness. "High" OCVs were observed for root exo- and endodermis thickness where transgenic clones showed statistically significantly higher values. In terms of the roots, five out of nine histological indicators showed "Medium" OCVs: cortex, rhyzodermis, and parenchyma thicknesses, pith diameter, and thickness of the transversal root ratio. Again, genetically transformed materials showed statistically significantly higher averages. Only three out of seven histological indicators showed "Medium" OCVs in the leaves: D leaf abaxial cuticle thickness, chlorophyll parenchyma thickness, and D leaf aquifer parenchyma thickness. As noted above, statistically significantly higher values were recorded in the transgenic pineapple plants. Since the differences observed did not ultimately affect fruit yield (as shown in our previous work), they do not appear to be consequences of genetic transformation that impact on reproductive yield.

AB  - Silicon-containing amorphous substances, such as silicon dioxide (silica) and aluminosilicates, have a wide range of applications due to their porosity, chemical inertness and thermal stability. These materials are conventionally produced from quartz, diatomite and silicates of various compositions. However, the existing methods for isolating pure compounds are quite expensive and energy intensive. Renewable biological waste containing large amounts of silicon, e.g. rice husks and straw (Oryza sativa), can be used as an alternative raw material. The main advantages of such a material consist in its low cost, almost constant chemical composition, as well as simple and relatively inexpensive processing methods. Due to the high content of silicon dioxide in rice husks and straw, their recycling products are effective adsorbents of many types of pollutants from aqueous solutions. Although some publications describe intera ction processes between microorganisms and highly- dispersive synthetic materials based on silicon dioxide of mineral origin, there is a lack of information on the biogenic forms of silica and aluminosilicates obtained from rice production wastes. In previous studies, we established the ability of a number of siliconcontaining samples isolated from rice production wastes, depending on the raw material (husk or straw) and production conditions, to bind different bacteria, e.g. Escherichia coli, Streptococcus aureus, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis. In this work, we studied the sorption action of amorphous silicon dioxide and aluminosilicates obtained from rice husks and straw against the test cultures of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. The reference materials were such commercial products as expanded vermiculite (natural aluminosilicate) and the `White Coal' sorbent containing approximately equal proportions of silica and microcrystalline cellulose. The obtained results were discussed in the co ntext of the physicochemical parameters of the studied substances, including their chemical composition, IR absorption spectra, characteristics of the acid-base properties of the surface assessed by the methods of pH-metry and adsorption of acid-base indicators (Hammett's method). It was established that the sorption capacity of a sorbent in relation to bacteria depends on the initial material, its composition and production method.

AB  - In this study the interannual variability of phytoplankton over a similar to 30-years period in the coastal site of LTER-Senigallia transect (N Adriatic Sea) was investigated to document patterns potentially related to environmental/climatic drivers. Comparing physical and chemical data of the periods 1988-2002 and 2007-2016 periods, we showed that phytoplankton abundance and biomass and inorganic nutrient concentrations increased in the last decade, indicating that the tendency to oligotrophication due to the drop of the Po River outflow in the years 2002-2007 was reversed in the period 2007-2016. The typical P-limited conditions of the N Adriatic Sea seem to have been attenuated in the study area. P levels were not explained by the P concentrations in the Po River waters, suggesting the possible influence of other local P sources that could be related to the anomalous meteorological events (intense rainfalls) that took place in the 2007-2016 period. In the last decade, the community structure and seasonality of phytoplankton markedly changed, as highlighted by the different indicator species for each season: the blooms of Skeletonema marinoi shifted from winter to spring. A significant decrease of coccolithophores was observed particularly in winter months in the 2007-2016 period: some indicator species among the most relevant in the 1988-2002 period (such as Emiliania huxleyi in winter, and Syracosphaera pulchra in spring) have lost this role in 2007-2016. Dinoflagellate abundances decreased, except in spring when the occasional proliferation of large sized species caused biomass peaks. The phytoplankton annual cycle became irregular with sudden diatom blooms, reflecting the variability of meteorological events in recent years. It is noteworthy that in the last decade, an allochthonous species, i.e. the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia multistriata, became a regular inhabitant of the autumn phytoplankton communities of the NW Adriatic Sea.

AB  - The faecal indicator Escherichia coli plays a central role in water quality assessment and monitoring. It is therefore essential to understand its fate under various environmental constraints such as predation by bacterivorous zooplankton. Whereas most studies have examined how protozooplankton communities (heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates) affect the fate of E. coli in water, the capacity of metazooplankton to control the faecal indicator remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how the common filter-feeding cladoceran, Daphnia pulex, affects the fate of E. coli under different experimental conditions. Daphnia ingested E. coli and increased its loss rates in water, but the latter rates decreased from 1.65 d(-1) to 0.62 d(-1) after a 1,000-fold reduction in E. coli initial concentrations, due to lower probability of encounter between Daphnia and E. coli. The combined use of culture and PMA qPCR (viability-qPCR) demonstrated that exposure to Daphnia did not result into the formation of viable but non-culturable E. coli cells. In lake water, a significant part of E. coli population loss was associated with matrix-related factors, most likely due to predation by other bacterivorous biota and/or bacterial competition. However, when exposing E. coli to a D. pulex gradient (from 0 to 65 ind. L-1), we observed an increasing impact of Daphnia on E. coli loss rates, which reached 0.47 d(-1) in presence of 65 ind. L-1. Our results suggest that the filter-feeder can exert a non-negligible predation pressure on E. coli, especially during seasonal Daphnia population peaks. Similar trials using other Daphnia species as well as stressed E. coli cells will increase our knowledge on the capacity of this widespread zooplankter to control E. coli in freshwater resources. Based on our results, we strongly advocate the use of natural matrices to study these biotic interactions in order to avoid overestimation of Daphnia impact.

AB  - The present study highlights the uranium (U) concentrations in water-soil-plant matrices and the efficiency considering a heterogeneous assemblage of terrestrial and aquatic native plant species to act as the biomonitor and phytoremediator for environmental U-contamination in the Sevilha mine (uraniferocts region of Beiras, Central Portugal). A total of 53 plant species belonging to 22 families was collected from 24 study sites along with ambient soil and/or water samples. The concentration of U showed wide range of variations in the ambient medium: 75 to 557 mg kg(-1) for soil and 0.4 to 113 mu g L-1 for water. The maximum potential ofU accumulation was recorded in roots of the following terrestrial plants: lanais squarrosus (450 mg kg(-1) DW), Cortina corymbo.sa (181 mg kg(-1) DW) and Juncus bufoniu.s (39.9 mg kg-1 DW), followed by the aquatic macrophytes, namely Callitriche stagnalis (55.6 mg kg(-1) DW) Lemna minor (53.0 mg kg(-1) DW) and Riccia fluitans (50.6 mg kg(-1) DW). Accumulation of U in plant tissues exhibited the following decreasing trend: root > leaves > stem > flowers/fruits and this confirms the unique efficiency of roots in accumulating this radionuclide from host soil/sediment (phytostabilization). Overall, the accumulation pattern in the studied aquatic plants (L. minor, R. fluitans, C. stagnatis and Lythrum portula) dominated over most of the terrestrial counterpart. Among terrestrial plants, the higher mean bioconcentration factor (approximate to 1 in roots/rhizomes of C. corymbosa and squarrosus) and translocation factor (31 in Anthyala integrifolia) were encountered in the representing families Asteraceae and juncaceae. Hence, these terrestrial plants can be treated as the promising candidates for the development of the phytostabilization or phytoextraction methodologies based on the accumulation, abundance and biomass production.

AB  - This study presents the adverse effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in effluent of wastewater treatment plants (WwTPs) on fish health. A study of chronic exposure to WwTPs effluent for 10 months was undertaken in high-back crucian carp (Carassius auratus) during different life stages, covering early-life-stage (ELS), prespawning period, and postspawning period. Condition factor (CF), gonadosomatic index (GSI), hepatosomatic index (HSI), and plasma vitellogenin (VTG) levels were employed as indicators to assess biological effects of effluent on this gynogenesis species. Meanwhile, some high-back crucian carp were caged in Demonstration Base of Biological Purification for Filter-feeding Fish (hereinafter, Demonstration Base), as WwTPs effluent exposure controls. In the meantime, a depuration study was carried out to determine whether or not the estrogenic effects caused by effluent exposure could be reduced after moving fish into EDCs-free water. CF, HSI, GSI, and plasma Vtg levels of high-back crucian carp caged in Demonstration Base were generally in accordance with seasonal change. Effluent exposure inhibited gonadal growth, reducing GSI in ELS while increasing it around spawning, sharpened liver burdens, increasing HSI, and induced abnormal Vtg expression in juvenile high-back crucian carp, augmenting Vtg concentrations in plasma. Around spawning period, Vtg in high-back crucian carp were mainly induced by endogenous estrogens, and EDCs in effluent had less influence on them. Staying in EDCs-free water for 30 days made high-back crucian carp recover from effects of previous effluent exposure, relieving inhibition of gonadal development and hypertrophy of liver as well as reducing Vtg induced by EDCs in effluent. The results revealed that high-back crucian carp in ELS are more sensitive to WwTPs effluent exposure. Additionally, the depuration study showed a clearance of the estrogenic effects caused by effluent.

AB  - The global distribution of the common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale Weber, sensu lato; Asteraceae), along with its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions, make this 'species' a particularly attractive candidate to evaluate for its value as a biological monitor of environmental metal contamination. To examine the metal content of dandelion leaves in relation to environmental metal levels, the concentrations of eight metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) were analyzed in leaf and soil samples collected at 29 sites in the mid-western United States differentially impacted by pollution. Sites were chosen primarily to cover a range of annual mean 24-h airborne particulate matter less than or equal to 10 mum (hereafter, PM10) exposure, with PM10 levels varying from those found in isolated rural areas to levels typical of the most industrialized urban locations in the mid-western United States. A positive, significant correlation was detected between soil concentrations of each metal and measures of PM10 at a site, signifying that airborne particulate matter is a good indicator of soil metal contamination. Leaf concentrations of four of the eight metals (Cr, Mn, Pb and Zn) examined were found to increase significantly as the soil levels of these metals increased, but the percentage of the total variation explained by the relationship in these cases was generally low. This latter finding, along with the lack of a significant relationship between leaf and soil concentrations for the four other metals, indicate that the factors affecting metal absorption from the soil by dandelions are complex and that, aside from soil metal concentrations, other soil, plant and/or other environmental factors affect metal uptake. There was also no evidence that leaf metal concentrations were positively correlated PM10. In addition, the concentrations to those collected at the same sites in the spring. These findings suggest that dandelions may not be a particularly effective tool for quantifying levels of env metal contamination, at least on the scale of pollution typifying ind urban of the mid-western United states.

AB  - Environmental impact assessment (EIA) has a potential role in sustainable development. However; its commonest application has been at the project level, where it fails to ensure adequate consideration of potentially serious trans-boundary, widespread, indirect, cumulative and synergistic ecological effects. The fact that ecological effects cannot be predicted or evaluated effectively if EIA is confined to single development actions and contrained by artificial boundaries is an important justification for moves towards the strategic application of EIA.
   The need for a more strategic approach to ecological assessment can be illustrated by reference to road development in the UK, where project-level EIA has failed to quantify the overall impact of new road development on biodiversity. Some form of strategic ecological assessment (SEcA) is required to ensure that proposed new road development is compatible with international obligations to conserve protected habitats and their associated species. In common with all forms of EIA, the effectiveness of SEcA depends on the ability to define the proposed action or set of actions and to characterize the receiving environment (baseline conditions). The ability to quantify potential impacts and to estimate their risk of occurrence is strongly dependent on the availability, accuracy, reliability and resolution of national data on the distributions of habitats, species and development proposals.
   This paper summarizes the results of a SEcA carried out to determine whether currently proposed road developments, when considered collectively, would be compatible with the safeguard of an internationally important and protected wildlife habitat (lowland heathland) and associated protected species. The study was carried out using a version of the Countryside Information System developed for the UK Department of the Environment by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology. Areas of lowland heathland are identified together with 'hot spots' where two protected lowland heathland species (sand lizard, Lacerta agilis and the Dartford warbler; Sylvia undata also occur: Possible risks attributable to proposed new road development are quantified for I km squares and evaluated on a county basis.

AB  - The enemy release hypothesis proposes that invasion by exotic plant species is driven by their release from natural enemies (i.e. herbivores and pathogens) in their introduced ranges. However, in many cases, natural enemies, which may be introduced or managed to regulate invasive species, may fail to impact target host populations. Landscape heterogeneity, which can affect both the population dynamics of the pathogen and the susceptibility and the density of hosts, may contribute to why pathogens fail to control hosts despite established negative disease impacts.
   We explored patterns of post-fire infection of the fungal head-smut pathogen Ustilago bullata on the invasive annual cheatgrass Bromus tectorum, which has caused the notorious grass-fire cycle and ecosystem degradation across Western North America. We asked whether infection level was a driver of host density or vice-versa, and how weather affected infection and how spatial patterns of infection varied with time since fire, using a combination of structural equation modelling (SEM), proportional odds modelling and entropy-based local indicator of spatial association (ELSA) on data from >700 plots spanning >100,000 ha remeasured annually for 4 years.
   Observed infection levels increased with greater prior-year cheatgrass cover, and disease severity did not suppress cheatgrass populations. Warm, humid fall/winters and proximity to fire refugia (unburned patches) were associated with more infections. Infection clustering was most evident 2-3 years following fire with warm-wet fall-winter conditions and decreased after two drier, colder winters.
   Synthesis. Severity of fungal disease did not result in measurable reductions of populations of a non-native, invasive host species, cheatgrass, which suggests that natural enemies may not strongly regulate cheatgrass in its introduced range. Landscape heterogeneity associated with disturbance and weather limited population-level infection of hosts by the fungal pathogen. Disturbance (specifically wildfire) and variable weather are key components of this and similar invasion systems, and likely need to be considered when evaluating disease dynamics and potential for natural enemies to influence invasion potential.

AB  - Restoration of ecological functions by reclamation of post-mining areas stimulates soil-formation processes and initiates biological activity on the surfaces of disposal sites. The purpose of this investigation was to study the relationships between soil properties, microbiological activity and diversity in Technosols 45 years following land reclamation. The study area was located in the vicinity of the former Fe sulphide and uranium mine in Rudki village (Holy Cross Mts., Poland). The soils developed from tailings containing Fe sulphides (profile R1 and R2) and Fe sulphide and dolomite-bearing post-flotation sludge covered with loamy material (profile R3) were studied. Soil properties and enzyme (dehydrogenase, arylsulphatase, beta-glucosidase, urease) activities, respiration activity (RA) and total microbial counts (TMC) were determined, as well as molecular analyses were performed. The most important soil properties influencing enzyme activities, RA and TMC were pH and soil salinity. Biological parameters were also dependent on TOC, TN, exchangeable K and available P contents. Enzyme activity, RA and TMC were significantly lower in strongly acidic and saline profile R1 than in profiles R2 and R3, which represent areas where land reclamation was successful. Moreover, a decrease of enzyme activities, RA and TMC were observed with increasing depth of soil profiles. The lower activity of arylsulphatase, beta-glucosidase and RA in A horizon of profile R3 in comparison with similar horizon in profile R2 may reflect the pollution of R3 topsoil by trace elements. Molecular analysis revealed that Bacillus genus predominate in the studied profiles. Soil properties (particularly pH) that are a repercussion of reclamation works seem to be the main variables conditioning biodiversity at the bacterial strains and species level. The obtained results indicated that enzyme activity, RA and TMC are sensitive indicators of microbiological activity and can be a measure in the assesment of soil biological activity following land reclamation.

AB  - We used the lesser prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus), an iconic grouse species that exhibits a boom-bust life history strategy, on the Southern High Plains, USA, as a bioindicator of main and interactive effects of severe drought and grazing. This region experienced the worst drought on record in 2011. We surveyed lesser prairie-chicken leks (i.e., communal breeding grounds) across 12years that represented 7years before the 2011 drought (predrought) and 4years during and following the 2011 drought (postdrought). Grazing was annually managed with the objective of achieving 50% utilization of aboveground vegetation biomass. We used lek (n=49) count data and covariates of weather and managed grazing to: (a) estimate long-term lesser prairie-chicken abundance and compare abundance predrought and postdrought; (b) examine the influence of annual and seasonal drought (modified Palmer drought index), temperature, and precipitation on long-term lesser prairie-chicken survival and recruitment; and (c) assess and compare the influence of grazing on lesser prairie-chicken population predrought and postdrought. Lesser prairie-chicken abundance was nearly seven times greater predrought than postdrought, and population declines were attributed to decreased survival and recruitment. The number of days with temperature >90th percentile had the greatest effect, particularly on recruitment. The population exhibited a substantial bust during 2011 and 2012 without a boom to recover in four postdrought years. Adaptive grazing positively influenced the population predrought, but had no effects postdrought. Results suggest that the severe drought in 2011 may have been beyond the range of environmental conditions to which lesser prairie-chickens, and likely other species, have adapted. Land management practices, such as grazing, should remain adaptive to ensure potential negative influences to all species are avoided. Increasing habitat quantity and quality by reducing habitat loss and fragmentation likely will increase resiliency of the ecosystem and individual species.

AB  - We previously reported the bioaccumulation of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), including pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and perfluorinated compounds, in field-collected juvenile Chinook salmon from urban estuaries of Puget Sound, WA (Meador et al., 2016). Although the toxicological impacts of CECs on salmon are poorly understood, several of the detected contaminants disrupt mitochondrial function in other species. Here, we sought to determine whether environmental exposures to CECs are associated with hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction in juvenile Chinook. Fish were exposed in the laboratory to a dietary mixture of 16 analytes representative of the predominant CECs detected in our field study. Liver mitochondrial content was reduced in fish exposed to CECs, which occurred concomitantly with a 24-32% reduction in expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) Y coactivator-la (pgc-1a), a positive transcriptional regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. The laboratory exposures also caused a 40-70% elevation of state 4 respiration per unit mitochondria, which drove a 29-38% reduction of efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation relative to controls. The mixture-induced elevation of respiration was associated with increased oxidative injury as evidenced by increased mitochondrial protein carbonyls, elevated expression of glutathione (GSH) peroxidase 4 (gpx4), a mitochondrial-associated GSH peroxidase that protects against lipid peroxidation, and reduction of mitochondria' GSH. Juvenile Chinook sampled in a WVVTP effluent-impacted estuary with demonstrated releases of CECs showed similar trends toward reduced liver mitochondria' content and elevated respiratory activity per mitochondria (including state 3 and uncoupled respiration). However, respiratory control ratios were greater in fish from the contaminated site relative to fish from a minimally-polluted reference site, which may have been due to differences in the timing of exposure to CECs under laboratory and field conditions. Our results indicate that exposure to CECs can affect both mitochondrial quality and content, and support the analysis of mitochondrial function as an indicator of the sublethal effects of CECs in wild fish.

AB  - Environmental risk assessment is an essential part of the approval process for pesticides. Exposure concentrations are compared with ecotoxicological data obtained from standardized laboratory studies and, if available, from field studies to determine the risk of a substance or formulation for aquatic communities. Predicted concentrations in surface waters are derived using, for example, the European FOrum for the Co-ordination of pesticide fate models and their USe (FOCUS) or the German Exposit models, which distinguish between exposure to dissolved and particle-associated pesticide concentrations, because the dissolved concentration is thought to be the best predictor of bioavailability and toxicity. Water and particle-associated concentrations are estimated based on the organic carbon-water partitioning coefficient (K-OC). This review summarizes published information on the influence of natural suspended solids on bioavailability and toxicity of pesticides to aquatic organisms (algae, invertebrates and fish), and the value of log K-OC and log K-OW (octanol-water coefficient) as sole predictors of the bioavailable fraction is discussed. The information showed that: 1) the quality and origin of suspended solids played an important role in influencing pesticide bioavailability and toxicity; 2) a decrease in toxicity due to the presence of suspended solids was shown only for pyrethroid insecticides with log K-OW greater than 5, but the extent of this reduction depended on particle concentration and size, and potentially also on the ecotoxicological endpoint; 3) for pesticides with a log K-OW less than 3 (e.g., triazines, carbamates, and organophosphates), the impact of particles on bioavailability and toxicity is small and species dependent; and 4) pesticide bioavailability is greatly influenced by the test species and their physiology (e.g., feeding behavior or digestion). We conclude that exposure of aquatic organisms to pesticides and environmental risk of many pesticides might be underestimated in prospective risk assessment, when predicted environmental concentration is estimated based on the K-OC of a compound.

AB  - Northern forest ecosystems are exposed to a range of anthropogenic processes including global warming, atmospheric deposition, and changing land-use. The vegetation of northern forests is composed of species with several functional traits related to these processes, whose effects may be difficult to disentangle. Here, we combined analyses of spatio-temporal dynamics and functional traits of ground flora species, including morphological characteristics, responses to macro- and microclimate, soil conditions, and disturbance. Based on data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory, we compared changes in occurrence of a large number of ground flora species during a 20-year period (1994-2013) in boreal and temperate Sweden respectively. Our results show that a majority of the common ground flora species have changed their overall frequency. Comparisons of functional traits between increasing and declining species, and of trends in mean trait values of sample plots, indicate that current floristic changes are caused by combined effects of climate warming, nitrogen deposition and changing land-use. Changes and their relations with plant traits were generally larger in temperate southern Sweden. Nutrient-demanding species with mesotrophic morphology were favored by ongoing eutrophication due to nitrogen deposition in the temperate zone, while dwarf shrubs with low demands on nitrogen decreased in frequency. An increase of species with less northern and less eastern distribution limits was also restricted to temperate Sweden, and indicates effects of a moister and milder macroclimate. A trend toward dense plantation forests is mirrored by a decrease of light-demanding species in both vegetation zones, and a decrease of grassland species in the temperate zone. Although denser tree canopies may buffer effects of a warmer climate and of nitrogen deposition to some extent, traits related to these processes were weakly correlated in the group of species with changing frequency. Hence, our results indicate specific effects of these often confounded anthropogenic processes.

AB  - We present long-term records of the Cs-137 and Sr-90 activity concentrations in soil, grass and milk from two lowland and two alpine pastures of Switzerland. The data is used for better understanding the long-term behavior of these radionuclides in the environment. Transfer factors between compartments are used as qualitative indicators of the magnitude of transfer and as a way to compare different elements (e.g. Cs and Sr) in similar conditions. The long-term behavior was quantified by means of the effective half-life which integrates all processes that cause a decrease of activity in a given medium such as leaching, fixation, erosion and radioactive decay. Our study shows that Sr-90 is more likely transferred from alpine soil to grass than Cs-137. This is explained by a stronger fixation of Cs in the soils. We observed higher transfers of Sr-90 to grass in soils with lower Ca concentrations, and vice versa. In contrast, the transfer of Cs-137 to grass was not affected by the variations of the K content in the soil. We provide evidence that shows that Cs-137, after intake by dairy cattle, is more likely transferred to milk than Sr-90. However, as the Sr-90 and Ca transfers to milk are influenced by parameters/processes that were not taken into account in our study, our result cannot be entirely validated. The effective half-lives of Cs-137 and Sr-90 in soil, grass and milk corresponded with previous estimates in alpine soils. We have found that processes other than radioactive decay are responsible for a major decrease of the Sr-90 activity in soil. For Cs-137, on the other hand, radioactive decay is among the most relevant process. Our data shows to be of interest in studying the trends of behavior of radionuclides in alpine regions.

AB  - Despite our growing knowledge on plants' functional responses to grazing, there is no consensus if an optimum level of functional aggregation exists for detecting grazing effects in drylands. With a comparative approach we searched for plant functional types (PFTs) with a consistent response to grazing across two areas differing in climatic aridity, situated in South Africa's grassland and savanna biomes. We aggregated herbaceous species into PFTs, using hierarchical combinations of traits (from single-to three-trait PFTs). Traits relate to life history, growth form and leaf width. We first confirmed that soil and grazing gradients were largely independent from each other, and then searched in each biome for PFTs with a sensitive response to grazing, avoiding confounding with soil conditions. We found no response consistency, but biome-specific optimum aggregation levels. Three-trait PFTs (e.g. broad-leaved perennial grasses) and two-trait PFTs (e. g. perennial grasses) performed best as indicators of grazing effects in the semi-arid grassland and in the arid savanna biome, respectively. Some PFTs increased with grazing pressure in the grassland, but decreased in the savanna. We applied biome-specific grazing indicators to evaluate if differences in grazing management related to land tenure (communal versus freehold) had effects on vegetation. Tenure effects were small, which we mainly attributed to large variability in grazing pressure across farms. We conclude that the striking lack of generalizable PFT responses to grazing is due to a convergence of aridity and grazing effects, and unlikely to be overcome by more refined classification approaches. Hence, PFTs with an opposite response to grazing in the two biomes rather have a unimodal response along a gradient of additive forces of aridity and grazing. The study advocates for hierarchical trait combinations to identify localized indicator sets for grazing effects. Its methodological approach may also be useful for identifying ecological indicators in other ecosystems.

AB  - Aim It is a central issue in ecology and biogeography to understand what governs community assembly and the maintenance of biodiversity in tropical rain forest ecosystems. A key question is the relative importance of environmental species sorting (niche assembly) and dispersal limitation (dispersal assembly), which we investigate using a large dataset from diverse palm communities. Location Lowland rain forest, western Amazon River Basin, Peru. Methods We inventoried palm communities, registering all palm individuals and recording environmental conditions in 149 transects of 5 m x 500 m. We used ordination, Mantel tests and indicator species analysis (ISA) to assess compositional patterns, species responses to geographical location and environmental factors. Mantel tests were used to assess the relative importance of geographical distance (as a proxy for dispersal limitation) and environmental differences as possible drivers of dissimilarity in palm species composition. We repeated the Mantel tests for subsets of species that differ in traits of likely importance for habitat specialization and dispersal (height and range size). Results We found a strong relationship between compositional dissimilarity and environmental distance and a weaker but also significant relationship between compositional dissimilarity and geographical distance. Consistent with expectations, relationships with environmental and geographical distance were stronger for understorey species than for canopy species. Geographical distance had a higher correlation with compositional dissimilarity for small-ranged species compared with large-ranged species, whereas the opposite was true for environmental distance. The main environmental correlates were inundation and soil nutrient levels. Main conclusions The assembly of palm communities in the western Amazon appears to be driven primarily by species sorting according to hydrology and soil, but with dispersal limitation also playing an important role. The importance of environmental characteristics and geographical distance varies depending on plant height and geographical range size in agreement with functional predictions, increasing our confidence in the inferred assembly mechanisms.

AB  - Sediment geochemistry and testate amoebae (thecamoebians) were used to track the spatial extent and temporal evolution of mine loading and its impact on aquatic biota in Lake Pyhajarvi, central Finland. Pyhasalmi is an operating Zn-Cu-S mine, located by Lake Pyhajarvi. Mine loading to the lake comes mainly from wastewater. Highest metal loading occurred in the 1970s and 1980s. Present loading consists mainly of Ca and S that nearly saturate dense wastewaters with gypsum. This affects oxygen concentration in the lake's northern basin, where effluent is presently discharged. Of 25 short sediment cores retrieved from Lake Pyhajarvi, 10 came from sites 'downstream' and 15 from 'upstream' of the mine. Three sample levels from each core were selected for further investigation after exploratory XRF metal analysis. Samples were chosen to represent lake conditions before the mine impact, during the peak impact phase, and at present. Results from pre-disturbance deposits show that the two lake basins are naturally different. The 'downstream' basin (Junttiselka) has lower oxygen and a higher sedimentation rate, which was revealed by concentrations of redox-sensitive and clastic-related elements, as well as faunal distributions. The peak mine impact is reflected in the high concentration of S and metals Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, which spread widely in the lake and increased > 100% at sites near the tailings area. These concentrations have since decreased, but not to pre-disturbance levels. The faunal response to peak metal concentrations was weak, spatially limited and masked by larger responses to other environmental factors, including eutrophication, oxygen concentration, and increased clastic input generated by land-use changes. These environmental factors and changes in mine water composition probably account for the reason that faunal assemblages did not return to the pre-mine situation. Instead, the modern fauna reflects a third assemblage type that developed after the peak-loading phase. Geochemical and thecamoebian analyses show that the mine has affected the two basins of the lake differently during the lake history. Results suggest that mining impacts could be mitigated with good planning and management.

AB  - Data were collected in the Tagus estuary from 1999-2007 on a monthly basis and combined with published results and for several previous years between 1980 and 1995, so that a comprehensive analysis could be performed over a non-continuous 27-year period. Sampling conditions and methods were similar for all datasets. Extreme wet and dry years were observed. River flow was strongly linked to phytoplankton abundance, with the highest biomass attained in dry years. The observed range of annual median Chl a was 1.8-7.6 A mu g L-1 and the overall median was 3.5 A mu g L-1. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and silicate showed a clear seasonal pattern, with a maximum in winter-spring, indicating a freshwater origin. Although wastewater treatment started in 1990, no difference was detected from 1980 to the present in terms of DIN and phosphorus. The recorded seasonal pattern for biomass with highest values in late spring-summer period is comparable to other temperate tidally influenced ecosystems. In spite of interannual differences in terms of Chl a concentration or the time of the maximum Chl a occurrence, a repeatable pattern could be identified. The mean growth development time for phytoplankton was 163 days (June 12) ranging 129-206 days (May 9-July 26) during the sampling period. No obvious changes in phytoplankton community structure were observed over time: diatoms were always the dominant group, and cryptophytes were relatively abundant throughout autumn-winter. The dominant species have remained essentially the same since 1969. River inflow, light availability, and temperature were the major factors shaping phytoplankton variability patterns. The strong influence of tidal mixing on the estuarine waters appears to lower the risk of potential eutrophication in the Tagus estuary. The lack of change in nutrients and phytoplankton biomass and composition observed in this study is an important contribution towards the assessment of natural variability versus responses to man-induced inputs in this severely anthropogenically disturbed estuary.

AB  - The author, present the beginnings of a planning support system (PSS) for agri-environmental measures exemplified by a virtual implementation of Colorfields and blooming strips on model farms, based on real-world data. This paper starts with an introduction to the Colorfields, a concept for transdisciplinary and Sustainable landscape design of set-aside land. Colorfields comprise of blooming strips of flowering annual or biennial plants, which are designed and drilled in pattern on fallow land creating Land Art. The temporary scenic arrangements of the Colorfields combine the advantages of ecological strips, e.g. providing habitats for insects (especially bees), improving soil fertility through the cultivation of intercrops, with improvements of the social recognition of farmers as producers of pleasant landscapes instead of monoculture fields.
   The prototype of the PSS uses two software tools of different scientific origin, the bio-economic modeling system MODAM and the landscape visualization system Lenne3D, which are linked based on geo-data. The resulting system helps to assess the economic effects and visualizes the effects of the specific landuse patterns under different scenarios.
   The economic assessment of blooming strips on arable land and of one Colorfield on fallow land shows that these measures prove to be profitable from an economic viewpoint assuming the Current area payments for the obligatory European Union set-aside program. Furthermore, the visualizations enable the design to be tested virtually by exploring the resultant scenery. They provide artists, planners and stakeholders including farmers with a tool to virtually wander through landscape scenarios supporting a collaborative design and a shared vision for the community.
   The results of the two model farms and previous Case Studies for Colorfields demonstrate how current policy conditions could be used for the improvement of environmental and scenic qualities. Furthermore, the ability of the tools, MODAM and Lenne3D, suggests to support and prornote these activities. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - [1] Increasingly available high-resolution topographic data from remote sensing motivates the search for topographic features that predict abiotic controls on the distribution and performance of biota. We investigated the extent to which periphyton distribution and stream ecosystem metabolism in a steep upland river drainage network could be predicted from physical conditions that varied with local topography. During the summers of 2003 and 2004, we measured periphyton standing crops and gross primary production and ecosystem respiration rates along a 5 km reach of the South Fork Eel River and six of its tributaries in northern California ( 39 degrees 44 ' N, 123 degrees 39 ' W). We also measured wetted stream width ( B), cross-sectionally averaged stream velocity ( U), and streambed photosynthetically active solar radiation ( PAR) at each site to investigate the degree to which periphyton abundance and metabolism were related to these indicators, which in turn are partially predictable from models relating environmental parameters to the topographic settings. Dimensional analysis, a technique widely used in the field of fluid mechanics, was used to investigate how biotic and abiotic variables may be interconnected in stream environments. Nondimensional groups of variables were formulated on the basis of our field estimates of chosen biotic and abiotic variables. Periphyton biomass was controlled by B(9/5), exposure to light PAR(1/5), nutrient concentration N(5/6), and inverse stream depth H(-5/6) and U(-1/2). The autotrophic-heterotrophic balance, quantified by the gross primary production to ecosystem respiration rate, scaled with the stream aspect ratio(B/H)(3/5) and Peclet number Pe = (UB/u(*)H)(3/10), where u(*) is the shear stress velocity. The scaling relationships were validated against reported field measurements from other geographical areas. The results show nonlinear dependencies among periphyton biomass, stream metabolism, and abiotic variables. These nonlinear relationships point to a need for detailed quantification of biotic and abiotic variables over a range of scales.

AB  - Wood abundance in streams is an indicator of its likely geomorphological and ecological importance. However, wood volume estimates can be highly variable, due in part to natural variability and the methodology used to characterize it. We measured wood volume in streams of similar sizes and riparian forest conditions using extended field surveys and simulation modelling. We surveyed a total of 3.1 km along four tributary streams of New Zealand's Waihaha River to obtain an estimate of wood volume in streams with similar basin positions (second order), forest types (podocarp/hardwood forest), disturbance histories (post volcanic eruption of Taupo ca. 180 AD) and stream sizes (2-3 m bankfull width). A `sliding window' analysis was conducted whereby the wood volume was calculated for a 'window' (i.e., reach survey of fixed length) that was progressively moved upstream in 10 m increments. The resulting frequency distributions of wood volume were bimodal and represented the range and relative proportion of reach volumes possible from the wood surveys. The wood volume based on all streams surveyed (23 m(3)/100 m) was equivalent to the 64th percentile of the sliding window distribution, suggesting that a randomly placed study reach would be likely to underestimate wood volume. The bimodal distribution was attributed to the inclusion/exclusion of relatively large (>= 10 m(3)), but rare (0.3 logs/100 m) logs. We also examined the variability of reach-level wood volume estimates (200 m and 400 m) for the Waihaha tributaries using the model OSU Stream Wood. The volume frequency distributions from the simulations were similar to those from the empirical approach, except that they were unimodal. We attribute the unimodal distribution to the greater number of reach-scale estimates used in the simulations (n=2000). The two independent approaches characterized the variation of wood volumes possible for this forest type and stream width. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Shrews ( genus Sorex, small insectivorous mammals) are well known for their extremely high basal metabolic rates (BMRs) even when corrected for their small body size. We measured energy expenditure of the common shrew ( Sorex araneus) under natural conditions ( field metabolic rate [FMR]) by doubly labeled water method to test whether FMR is proportional to high BMR in this species. The study was performed in summer in northeastern Poland. In addition to the FMR, we also measured maximum metabolic rates induced by cold exposure and by intense activity (MMRCOLD and MMRRUN, respectively) to evaluate the aerobic reserve (MMR - FMR) in S. araneus. This MMR - FMR aerobic reserve was used as an indicator of the potential for metabolic constraints. The FMR averaged 2.31 +/- 0.32 L CO2 d(-1) (+/- SD) or 58.1 +/- 8.0 kJ d(-1) in 8.2-g animals. This figure constituted 216% - 258% of a value predicted for a " standard" mammal of the same body mass and was the highest mass-specific field metabolic rate in mammals. Because of the high BMR level in S. araneus, the FMR to BMR ratio (2.4) was not far off mammalian standards ( median value of 3.1). The rate of water efflux determined in S. araneus (20.2 mL H2O d(-1) or 2.46 mL H2O g(-1) d(-1)) exceeded all figures reported to date in other mammals and was apparently linked to the high FMR level and relatively high water content of shrews' food. Maximal metabolic rates (MMRRUN of mL 23.5 +/- 1.9 mL O-2 g(-1) h(-1) and MMRCOLD of 23.5 +/- 1.9 mL O-2 g(-1) h(-1)) were not high in pro portion to BMR or FMR that resulted in relatively narrow aerobic reserve in S. araneus: 20% when calculated against the MMRRUN and 39% when compared with the MMRCOLD. Our study reveals that S. araneus has high energy costs of living and operates close to its physiological limits.

AB  - The elevational tree-limit constitutes an ideal and sensitive proxy indicator of climate change and variability, i.e. an essential part of monitoring systems focusing on global climate change. That contention is purported by multi-scale records and reconstructions of changes in altitudinal tree-limits and northern boreal forests. Climatically forced trends in their position, structure and composition have occurred at all temporal scales throughout the Holocene. A progressive elevational descent of Pinus sylvestris tree-limit since the earliest Holocene, concurs with the deterministic theory of millennial climate forcing by changes in the Earth's orbital parameters. The successively less seasonal climate with cooler, more humid summers and winters with increasing snow cover has preconditioned the emergence of a subalpine birch forest belt during the past ca. 7000 yrs BP as well as the growing gee-ecological prominence of Picea abies. Superimposed on this longterm trend, climatic anomalies of shorter duration have been inferred from the tree-limit chronology. Some exceptionally warm and stable centuries, with high tree-limits and dense montane forests occurred during the Medieval period. Thereafter, the Little Ice Age prevailed until the late 19th century. Northern and high-elevation ecosystems were profoundly stressed, disturbed and destabilized by cold, windy and highly variable climate conditions. An episode of warmer climate during the first half of the present century imposed some recovery of structures decayed by the Little Ice Age. However, tree-limits and high-elevation forests were far from restored to their medieval levels. During the past 4-5 decades, a more martime and slightly cooler climate has been instrumentally recorded. High-elevation arboreal vegetation has responded retrogressively by defoliation, retarded growth, ceasing regeneration and locally some tree-limit retraction. Neoglacial processes have been resumed, e.g. dieback of subalpine/alpine dwarf shrub heaths, followed by deflation of humus and surface mineral soils. These processes are readily monitored in a unique regional network, with baseline data since the early 20th century.

AB  - Shock loading of toxic substances into natural waterways is a pervasive practice which has substantial impacts on their biota. This paper describes the effects of shock (pulse) pollution loading from two major industries on a river and wetland system in southern Ontario, Canada. The assessment of shock loading frequency indicated that sporadic discharges of polluted water occurred on average once every other day during the 38 days of monitoring in the period April, 1986 to November, 1987.
   To estimate the frequency and intensity of the shock loads, an automatic pump sampler that was activated by a threshold conductivity was constructed and deployed. Samples were withdrawn from the river when the specific conductivity of the stream exceeded a threshold value of two times background. Background specific conductivity ranged between 200-250 mu S cm(-1). The impact of these shock load discharges on a downstream aquatic plant community in a Class One (Provincially Significant) wetland was examined. The area of Thompson's Creek upstream of the Cyanamid Chemical Company displayed a normal complement of aquatic organisms while downstream of the company's main discharges for a distance of nearly 2 km, the stream was barren of nearly all aquatic life. A reef-like structure in which nickel, chromium, and lead reached respectively 2900, 2100 and 2210 mg kg(-1) dry weight of sediment was located in the Welland River near the outfall of the Atlas-Mansfield storm sewer adjacent to the Atlas Specialty Steels Company. The average how rate at the outfall of the Atlas-Mansfield storm sewer into the Welland River was approximately 28 400 m(3) day(-1) in 1986 (MOE 1987). A small area referred to as the Atlas reef because of the high iron concentrations giving the sediments a cement-like condition, was devoid of all higher aquatic plants.

AB  - The nature and distribution of phenolic compounds were studied in suspended particles, sediment trap material and deposits in deltaic, marine and lagunal environments of the northwestern Mediterranean sea (Gulf of Lions).
   In deltaic environments (Rhone delta), the river flow controlled amounts of terrestrial run-off offshore as characterized by the abundance of phenolic compounds. A clear distinction appeared between surface water layers and deep layers. In the former, organic matter was less degraded and richer in phenolic acids than in the latter, where an abundant lithogenic phase was associated with degraded organic material rich in phenolic aldehydes, partly due to anthropogenic pollution. During the spate period, some compounds, such as phenolic aldehydes, were good indicators of hydrodynamic conditions, as they were carried down from the river bed to the prodelta. There, associated with the organo-mineral complex, they sank down to reach the benthic nepheloid layer and flowed out offshore.
   Considering the chemical nature of phenolics, suspended material contained more labile phenolic compounds such as syringyl phenols. In contrast, vanillyl phenols, which are rather refractory components, were more concentrated in sediments.
   In the Lacaze-Duthiers Canyon (south of the Gulf of Lions), trapped material from the euphotic zone was relatively rich in phenols of marine origin. Similarities in phenolic composition appeared between trapped organic material in bottom layers of the Tet prodelta and of the side of the Canyon, reflecting a transfer of particles by advective currents from the shelf to the deep sea.
   In deposits containing relatively abundant phenols, humic acids were richer in phenols than fulvic acids.
   In lagunal environments, phenol contents in suspended material and deposits were relatively high, resulting from the abundant vegetal cover. Highest dissolved phenol contents occurred in water at the end of summer and early autumn on the edges of the Canet lagoon where abundant debris of decaying plants accumulated. Their nature depended essentially on the extent of phanerogam populations (Ruppia maritima, Phragmites australis), which are their major sources. In this area, fine deposits contained humic fractions richer in phenols than coarse sediments were.

AB  - The ecological physiology of anthozoans, as well as their resistance to stressors, are strongly influenced by environmental factors and the availability of resources. The energy budget of anthozoans can vary seasonally in order to find an equilibrium between the available resources and respiration, polyp activity, growth, and reproduction processes. The variation in the biochemical composition of the animal tissues in these organisms results from a combination of the productivity processes of the water column coupled with the reproductive effort and potential starvation periods of the anthozoans. Here, the seasonal variation in the polyp activity of a slow-growing passive suspension feeder, the octocoral Alcyonium acaule, as well as their carbohydrate, protein and lipid contents, was investigated in a warm temperate environment using in-situ observations and biochemical analyses. Polyp activity exhibited a significant variability that was moderately dependent on season, while an aestivation phenomenon in A. acaule (i.e., a resting period in which the anthozoan is not capable of any polyp activity) during the warmer months is clearly observed. Carbohydrate concentrations in the coral species showed a significant increase in the late winter and spring seasons, and the lipid content increased during the spring. A higher abundance of lipids and carbohydrates coincided with a higher primary productivity in the water column, as well as with the octocoral reproduction period. In late autumn, there was a depletion of these biomolecules, with protein levels exhibiting great variability across sampling times. Complex alterations driven by climate change could affect the energy fluxes that depend on the dead or alive particles that are intercepted by marine animal forests. The obtained findings show a food shortage in late summer and autumn of the benthic suspension feeder A. acaule through the integrative descriptors of the ecophysiology of these anthozoans. This research contributes to the knowledge of energy storage capabilities in benthic suspension feeders in general, highlighting the importance of understanding the limits of resistance to starvation periods through these indicators.

AB  - Soil microbial community functions are essential indicators of ecosystem multifunctionality in managed land-use systems. Going forward, the development of adaptation strategies and predictive models under future climate scenarios will require a better understanding of how both land-use and climate disturbances influence soil microbial functions over time. Between March and November 2018, we assessed the effects of climate change on the magnitude and temporal stability of soil basal respiration, soil microbial biomass and soil functional diversity across a range of land-use types and intensities in a large-scale field experiment. Soils were sampled from five common land-use types including conventional and organic croplands, intensive and extensive meadows, and extensive pastures, under ambient and projected future climate conditions (reduced summer precipitation and increased temperature) at the Global Change Experimental Facility (GCEF) in Bad Lauchstadt, Germany. Land-use and climate treatment interaction effects were significant in September, a month when precipitation levels slightly rebounded following a period of drought in central Germany: compared to ambient climate, in future climate treatments, basal respiration declined in pastures and increased in intensive meadows, functional diversity declined in pastures and croplands, and respiration-to-biomass ratio increased in intensive and extensive meadows. Low rainfall between May and August likely strengthened soil microbial responses toward the future climate treatment in September. Although microbial biomass showed declining levels in extensive meadows and pastures under future climate treatments, overall, microbial function magnitudes were higher in these land-use types compared to croplands, indicating that improved management practices could sustain high microbial ecosystem functioning in future climates. In contrast to our hypothesis that more disturbed land-use systems would have destabilized microbial functions, intensive meadows and organic croplands showed stabilized soil microbial biomass compared to all other land-use types, suggesting that temporal stability, in addition to magnitude-based measurements, may be useful for revealing context-dependent effects on soil ecosystem functioning.

AB  - This study relates changes in social vulnerability of 20 counties on the northern coasts of the Persian Gulf (PG) and the Gulf of Oman (GO) over a 30-year period (1988-2017) to changing socio-economic conditions and environmental (climate) hazard. Social vulnerability in 2030, 2040 and 2050 is predicted based on the RCP8.5 climate change scenario that projects drought intensities and rising sea levels. Social vulnerability was based on the three dimensions of sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity using 18 socio-economic and five climate indicators identified by experts. All but one indicator related very strongly to the dimension it sought to represent. Despite improvements in adaptive capacity over time, social vulnerability increased between 1988 and 2017 and rates of change accelerated after change point years that occurred between 1998 and 2002 in most counties. Extrapolating past changes of each indicator over time enabled forecasts of social vulnerability in the future. While social variability decreased between 2017 and 2030, it increased again between 2030 and 2050. The lowest future social vulnerability is expected along the eastern PG coast, the greatest along the western PG and the GO. The worsening of socio-economic indicators contributed to increased sensitivity, and increased drought intensities plus the expected rise in sea levels will lead to social vulnerabilities in 2050 comparable to present levels. Between 1.4 and 1.7 M people will live in areas that are likely submerged by water in the future. About 80% of these people live in six counties with variable social vulnerabilities. While counties with lower social variabilities migh/be better able to cope with the challenges posed by climate change, adaptation programs to enhance the resilience of the residents in these and the remaining counties along the PG and the GO need to be implemented soon to avoid uncontrolled mass migration of millions of people from the region.

AB  - When evaluating the impact of a biodiversity conservation intervention, a counterfactual is typically needed. Counterfactuals are possible alternative system trajectories in the absence of an intervention. Comparing observed outcomes against the chosen counterfactual allows the impact (change attributable to the intervention) to be determined. Because counterfactuals by definition never occur, they must be estimated. Sometimes, there may be many plausible counterfactuals, including various drivers of biodiversity change and defined on a range of spatial or temporal scales. Here, we posit that, by definition, conservation interventions always take place in social-ecological systems (SES) (i.e., ecological systems integrated with human actors). Evaluating the impact of an intervention in an SES, therefore, means taking into account the counterfactuals assumed by different human actors. Use of different counterfactuals by different actors will give rise to perceived differences in the impacts of interventions, which may lead to disagreement about its success or the effectiveness of the underlying approach. Despite that there are biophysical biodiversity trends, it is often true that no single counterfactual is definitively the right one for conservation assessment, so multiple evaluations of intervention efficacy could be considered justifiable. Therefore, we propose calculating the sum of perceived differences, which captures the range of impact estimates associated with different actors in a given SES. The sum of perceived differences gives some indication of how closely actors in an SES agree on the impacts of an intervention. We applied the concept of perceived differences to a set of global, national, and regional case studies (e.g., global realization of Aichi Target 11 for marine protected areas, effect of biodiversity offsetting on vegetation condition in Australia, and influence of conservation measures on an endangered ungulate in Central Asia). We explored approaches for minimizing the sum, including a combination of negotiation and structured decision making, careful alignment of expectations on scope and measurement, and explicit recognition of any intractable differences between stakeholders.

AB  - Copper is an essential element in many biological processes, but may exert toxic effects at levels surplus to metabolic requirements. Herein we assess the effect of copper on zebrafish behaviour using two assays, namely the novel tank diving test and a T-maze test with food reward. Novel tank diving tests were conducted on days 0, 4, and 10 of a 10 day Cu exposure (at concentrations of 0.77 mu M (25% of the 240 h LC50) and 1.52 mu M (50% of the 240 h LC50) to assess the alterations of behavioural responses in repeating novel tank diving assays and the effect of Cu on these patterns. Results demonstrate habituation to novelty, which is an indicator of spatial memory. Copper exposure had no effect on the latency of entry into the upper zones of the tank, nor on the total time spent therein, but did cause a greater number of freezing bouts in comparison to the control group. Additionally, Cu exposure had no effect on the habituation responses of zebrafish. Using the T-maze assay, we tested the effect of prior exposure to Cu for 10 days on subsequent behavioural trainings. The T-maze protocol was based on associative learning, where a visual stimulus (colour) was linked with a natural stimulus (food). Results of the control group showed that zebrafish are able to perform associative learning tasks. Moreover, Cu was found to negatively affect the associative learning capabilities. Specifically, while zebrafish in the control group achieved a significant number of correct choices (leading to food reward) throughout the T-maze training, such a trend was not observed for Cu exposed fish. Thus at the exposure concentrations and exposure times considered herein, Cu has no determinative impact on instinctual behavioural responses of zebrafish in repeated novel tank diving assays but does limit the associative learning capabilities.

AB  - This study examined inter-period changes over two to three decades in the fish fauna of an urbanized estuary experiencing rapid population growth and a drying climate (Swan-Canning Estuary, Western Australia). Responses were compared at the fish community level (species composition; 1978-2009 in the shallows and 1993-2009 in deeper waters) and at the population and individual levels of an estuarine indicator species, black bream Acanthopagrus butcheri (biomass-abundance and per capita mass at age, respectively; 1993-2009). All three levels showed distinct shifts from earlier to later periods, but their patterns, sensitivity and breadth differed. Community composition changed markedly in the shallows of the lower-middle estuary between the late 1970s and all later periods and moderately between more disparate periods from 1995 to 2009. Several species trends could be linked to the increasing salinity of the estuary or declining dissolved oxygen levels in its middle-upper reaches. Community changes were, however, small or insignificant in the shallow and deeper waters of the upper estuary and deeper waters of the middle estuary, where environmental perturbations are often most pronounced. This may reflect the resilience of the limited suite of species that typify those reaches and thus their lack of sensitivity in reflecting longer-term change at the coarser level of mean abundance. One such species, the selected indicator, A. butcheri, did, however, show marked temporal changes at both the population and individual levels. Biomass decreased markedly in deeper waters while increasing in the shallows from earlier to later periods, presumably reflecting an onshore movement of fish, and per capita body mass in the 2+, 3+ and 4+ year classes fell steadily over time. Such changes probably indicate deteriorating habitat quality in the deeper waters. The study outcomes provide support for a multifaceted approach to the biomonitoring of estuaries using fishes and highlight the need for complementary monitoring of relevant stressors to better disentangle cause-effect pathways.

AB  - Measuring post-fire effects at landscape scales is critical to an ecological understanding of wildfire effects. Predominantly this is accomplished with either multi-spectral remote sensing data or through ground-based field sampling plots. While these methods are important, field data is usually limited to opportunistic post-fire observations, and spectral data often lacks validation with specific variables of change. Additional uncertainty remains regarding how best to account for environmental variables influencing fire effects (e.g., weather) for which observational data cannot easily be acquired, and whether pre-fire agents of change such as bark beetle and timber harvest impact model accuracy. This study quantifies wildfire effects by correlating changes in forest structure derived from multi-temporal Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) acquisitions to multi-temporal spectral changes captured by the Landsat Thematic Mapper and Operational Land Imager for the 2012 Pole Creek Fire in central Oregon. Spatial regression modeling was assessed as a methodology to account for spatial autocorrelation, and model consistency was quantified across areas impacted by pre-fire mountain pine beetle and timber harvest. The strongest relationship (pseudo-r(2) = 0.86, p < 0.0001) was observed between the ratio of shortwave infrared and near infrared reflectance (d74) and LiDAR-derived estimate of canopy cover change. Relationships between percentage of LiDAR returns in forest strata and spectral indices generally increased in strength with strata height. Structural measurements made closer to the ground were not well correlated. The spatial regression approach improved all relationships, demonstrating its utility, but model performance declined across pre-fire agents of change, suggesting that such studies should stratify by pre-fire forest condition. This study establishes that spectral indices such as d74 and dNBR are most sensitive to wildfire-caused structural changes such as reduction in canopy cover and perform best when that structure has not been reduced pre-fire.

AB  - Sunlight is known to be a pertinent factor governing the infectivity of waterborne viruses in the environment. Sunlight inactivates viruses via endogenous inactivation (promoted by absorption of solar light in the UVB range by the virus) and exogenous processes (promoted by adsorption of sunlight by external chromophores, which subsequently generate inactivating reactive species). The extent of inactivation is still difficult to predict, as it depends on multiple parameters including virus characteristics, solution composition, season and geographical location. In this work, we adapted a model typically used to estimate the photodegradation of organic pollutants, APEX, to explore the fate of two commonly used surrogates of human viruses (coliphages MS2 and phi X174) in waste stabilization pond and natural surface water. Based on experimental data obtained in previous work, we modeled virus inactivation as a function of water depth and composition, as well as season and latitude, and we apportioned the contributions of the different inactivation processes to total inactivation. Model results showed that phi X174 is inactivated more readily than MS2, except at latitudes >60 degrees. phi X174 inactivation varies greatly with both season (20-fold) and latitude (10-fold between 0 and 60 degrees), and is dominated by endogenous inactivation under all solution conditions considered. In contrast, exogenous processes contribute significantly to MS2 inactivation. Because exogenous inactivation can be promoted by longer wavelengths, which are less affected by changes in season and latitude, MS2 exhibits smaller fluctuations in inactivation throughout the year (10-fold) and across the globe (3-fold between 0 and 60 degrees) compared to phi X174. While a full model validation is currently not possible due to the lack of sufficient field data, our estimated inactivation rates corresponded well to those reported in field studies. Overall, this study constitutes a step toward estimating microbial water quality as a function of spatio-temporal information and easy-to-determine solution parameters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - High mountain environments located in the tropics account for as much as 10 % of the total surface area of high mountain ecosystems worldwide, yet their ecology has been studied much less thoroughly than outside the tropics. The dry Puna is the largest ecosystem of the high tropical Andes and one of the leading biodiversity hotspots worldwide. In this high mountain environment, the main stress factors are the long period of water shortage, high degree of potential evapotranspiration, wind erosion, low soil nutrient content, and extreme thermal variation. The aim of this study was to deepen our understanding of the relation between the dry Puna species composition and diversity, and environmental/anthropogenic variables. Species cover was determined and soil samples were analysed from 121 plots, along altitudinal transects located between 3,900 and 4,900 m a.s.l. in South Peru. The data were statistically analysed by means of Multivariate regression tree analysis, Indicator Species analysis and Redundancy analysis. The hypothesis that in the dry Puna, altitudinal gradient, aspect and rockiness are key factors that mainly determine the floristic composition of the vegetation was confirmed. The local soil features emerged as a secondary driver in the plant community composition. Moreover, disturbance intensity appeared to be a main factor in determining changes in the plant community diversity, also modifying the site ecology (nutrient content, pH) and the structure of ecosystems (from grass dominated systems to dwarf shrub-dominated communities). High grazing intensities caused the spread of species with avoidance strategies such as thorny dwarf shrubs (Tetraglochin cristaturn), annual and prostrate plants. Harsh conditions (thin and coarse soil, severe solar radiation, low temperatures and thermal fluctuations) promoted the spread of cushion plants (Pycnophyllurn sp. pl.), while aspect and soil features (pH, silt % and potassium content) shaped the species composition of Festuca orthophylla tall grassland, the dominant plant community in the dry Puna.

AB  - Biogeochemical processes were investigated in alpine river-Kamnika Bistrica River (North Slovenia), which represents an ideal natural laboratory for studying anthropogenic impacts in catchments with high weathering capacity. The Kamnika Bistrica River water chemistry is dominated by HCO3 (-), Ca2+ and Mg2+, and Ca2+/Mg2+ molar ratios indicate that calcite weathering is the major source of solutes to the river system. The Kamnika Bistrica River and its tributaries are oversaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite. pCO(2) concentrations were on average up to 25 times over atmospheric values. delta C-13(DIC) values ranged from -12.7 to -2.7 aEuro degrees, controlled by biogeochemical processes in the catchment and within the stream; carbonate dissolution is the most important biogeochemical process affecting carbon isotopes in the upstream portions of the catchment, while carbonate dissolution and organic matter degradation control carbon isotope signatures downstream. Contributions of DIC from various biogeochemical processes were determined using steady state equations for different sampling seasons at the mouth of the Kamnika Bistrica River; results indicate that: (1) 1.9-2.2 % of DIC came from exchange with atmospheric CO2, (2) 0-27.5 % of DIC came from degradation of organic matter, (3) 25.4-41.5 % of DIC came from dissolution of carbonates and (4) 33-85 % of DIC came from tributaries. delta N-15 values of nitrate ranged from -5.2 aEuro degrees at the headwater spring to 9.8 aEuro degrees in the lower reaches. Higher delta N-15 values in the lower reaches of the river suggest anthropogenic pollution from agricultural activity. Based on seasonal and longitudinal changes of chemical and isotopic indicators of carbon and nitrogen in Kamnika Bistrica River, it can be concluded that seasonal changes are observed (higher concentrations are detected at low discharge conditions) and it turns from pristine alpine river to anthropogenic influenced river in central flow.

AB  - In this study we analyzed and modelled spatial distribution of hard bottom benthic communities in the Lagoon of Venice, and used the model to derive functional response of these communities to changing environmental conditions.
   Three communities were identified by using a fuzzy clustering algorithm to experimental observations (macrophytobenthos and macrozoobenthos data), and interpreted from a biological perspective by considering their indicator and dominant taxa. The results showed that the lagoon can be divided in areas dominated by a 'marine', an 'intermediate' and a 'confined' benthic community. Some differences in the extension of the three communities between the two years of monitoring were observed and related to significant differences in environmental parameters.
   The relationships between benthic communities' membership grades and a set of water quality, hydrodynamics and sediment composition parameters were then modelled by means of an artificial neural network model, using a back-propagation algorithm. Furthermore, the model was used to assess the relative contribution of predictors on membership grades of different communities, and to understand the relationships between cluster membership grades and predictors with highest relative contribution. Several responses of benthic communities to environmental parameters were non-linear and complex, which confirmed the advantage of using neural networks instead of other, more traditional statistical methods. The benthic community showed mainly 'marine' characteristics with low temperature, silt percentage in sediments and POC concentration in water. The 'confined' characteristics were pronounced in areas of low PO4 and high DOP concentrations in water, low water energy and on wooden substrates. The 'intermediate' community was that predicted worst and was related mainly to high water salinity and temperatures around 16 degrees C.
   Finally, the model was used as a tool for the detection of anomalies, i.e., cases in which the predicted community was different from that observed. The anomalies were inspected and related to possible causes, such as a not optimal substrate, very low-bottom depth, complex local morphology, human disturbances, and slow adaptation of communities to changing abiotic characteristic.

AB  - The predominant data used in ecological risk assessment today are individual-based rather than population-based; yet environmental policies are usually designed to protect populations of threatened species or communities. Most current methods in ecotoxicology are limited by largely logistic/technology-driven requirements that yield data for a relatively small number of test species and end points that focus on acute lethality or sublethal nonproduction-based parameters (e.g., biomarkers, mutagenesis, genetic change, physiological condition). A contrasting example is presented here showing the predictive ability of meiobenthos-based full life cycle toxicity testing to extrapolate multi-generational effects of chemicals on variables of import to population growth and maintenance. Less than 24-h-old larvae of a meiobenthic copepod were reared individually in 96-well microplate exposures to parent and degradates of the phenylpyrazole insecticide fipronil. Survival, development rates, sex ratio change, fertility, fecundity, and hatching success were tracked daily for 32 d through mating and production of three broods in spiked seawater. These data were then inserted in a Leslie (Lefkovitch) matrix stage-based population growth model to predict relative rates of population increase (A) and changes in net population growth with time and toxicant concentration. Field-reported test concentrations produced strong reproductive (52-88%) and net production (40-80%) depressions for parent (at 0.25 and 0.5 mug/L), desthionyl (0.25 and 0.5 mug/L), and sulfide (0.15 mug/L) moieties as compared to controls. Spiked sediment exposures of 65-300 ng of fipronil/g of dry sediment yielded significantly reduced production rates per female that were 67-50% of control production. The consistent reproductively linked impacts of fipronil and its degradation products at the population maintenance levels suggest risks to sediment-dwelling crustaceans at concentrations well below noneffects for most aquatic test species based on risk assessment data from primarily acute and sub-life cycle toxicity tests.

AB  - The relationship between diatom taxa preserved in surface soils and environmental variables at 31 sites in Water Conservation Area 2A (WCA-2A) of the Florida Everglades was explored using multivariate analyses. Surface soils were collected along a phosphorus (P) gradient and analyzed for diatoms, total P, % nitrogen (N), %carbon (C), calcium (Ca), and biogenic silica (BSi). Phosphorus varied from 315-1781 mu g g(-1), and was not found to be correlated with the other geochemical variables. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to examine which environmental variables correlated most closely with the distributions in diatom taxa. Canonical correspondence analysis with forward selection, constrained and partial CCA, and Monte Carlo permutation tests of significance show the most significant changes in diatom assemblages along the P gradient (p < 0.01), with additional species differences correlated with soil C, N, Ca, and BSi.
   Weighted-averaging (WA) regression and calibration models of diatom assemblages to P and BSi were developed. The diatom-based inference model for soil [P] had a high apparent r(2) (0.86) with RMSEboot = 218 mu g g(-1). Indicator diatom species identified by assessing species WA optima and WA tolerance to [P], such as Nitzschia amphibia and N. palea for high [P] (similar to 1300-1400 mu g(-1)) and Achnanthes minutissima var. scotica and Mastogloia smithii for low [P] (similar to 400-600 mu g g(-1)), may be useful as monitoring tools for eutrophication in WCA-2A as well as other areas of the Everglades. Diatom assemblages analyzed by cluster analysis were related to location within WCA-2A, and dominant taxa within clusters are discussed in relation to the geochemical variables measured as well as hydrology and pH. Diversity of diatom assemblages and a 'Disturbance Index' based on diatom data are discussed in relation to the historically P-limited Everglades ecosystem. Diatom assemblages should be very useful for reconstructions of [P] through time in the Florida Everglades, provided diatoms are well preserved in soil cores.

AB  - In this study, we examine, identify, and discuss fossil remains of large branchiopod crustaceans collected from six sites across the Beringian region (north-eastern Asia and north-western North America). Eggs and mandibles from Anostraca and Notostraca, as well as a notostracan telson fragment and a possible notostracan second maxilla, were collected from both paleosediment samples and also from large mammal hair. The remains of large branchiopods and other species that are limited to seasonally astatic aquatic habitats (temporary wetlands) could be useful indicator organisms of paleoecological conditions. Different recent large branchiopod species have very different ecological preferences, with each species limited to specific geochemical component tolerance ranges regarding various salinity, cation, and gypsum concentrations. Our purpose is to bring the potential usefulness of these common fossil organisms to the attention of paleoecologists.

AB  - Due to the practical process engineering implications of hydraulic/organic overloading, and the sensitivity of anaerobic systems to process instabilities, the scope of this review is limited to the effects of hydraulic and organic shock/transient loading on various anaerobic systems. The responses of anaerobic systems under dynamic conditions and the complex interactions of environmental factors including kinetic, thermodynamic, nutritional, and mass transfer limitations often make the monitoring and prediction of system instability complicated. Process engineering requires multiple process indicators for rapid monitoring of overloaded systems and the various aspects of process indicators during hydraulic/organic shock/transient loadings are extensively discussed in this review.

AB  - Cat colony records for the period 1991 to 2011 were used to determine spatial characteristics and relationships between cat colony density, human population, social conditions and the physical environment. Results show a positive correlation between cat colonies, population density, social indicators and the types of land where they are located. A temporal increase in the density of cat colonies is noticeable in areas where they are frequently reported, supporting the hypothesis that cat colonies are a persistent feature of Auckland's urban landscape. Complementing an earlier paper on stray cats, this paper seeks to provide information to support the implementation of management measures to mitigate both social and animal welfare concerns.

AB  - It is now, widely accepted that stomatal ozone uptake provides a more reliable indicator for the assessment of risk of ozone damage to forest trees than ozone exposure. Thus, environmental factors influencing stomatal opening strongly affect the sensitivity of forest trees towards high ozone concentrations. In this study the hydrological model WAWAHAMO is used to simulate stomatal opening dependent oil air temperature, solar radiation, vapor pressure deficit and soil beater potential. Then, a statistical analysis was carried out to investigate relations between crown defoliation and ozone concentrations dependent oil stomatal opening. The results support the hypothesis that tropospheric ozone contributes to the observed crown defoliation. However, environmental factors strongly affect tree response to high ozone concentrations.

AB  - The subfossil assemblages of Chydoridae from Late Glacial/Preboreal sediments of four sites from 603 m to 2290 m asl were analysed to trace the community response to rapid climatic warming that occurred at this period of time. In each site, distinct signals at the Younger Dryas/Preboreal boundary were recorded by density of remains, species diversity or community composition. However, responses varied considerably among the sites. This variation was attributed to the situation that the chydorid community structure is determined not only by temporal (Younger Dryas/Preboreal boundary) and spatial (among the sites) temperature gradients, but also by the specific local ecological conditions at the sites. In some species the classification with respect to cold tolerance should be reconsidered. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A high-resolution SEM examination of the warty layer in tracheids of the Australasian softwood genus Callitris Vent. has revealed that warts in 12 of the 16 species have variable, complex morphology and nodule-like projections, giving them a 'nodulated' or 'branched' appearance similar to those described for certain hardwoods.  Pairs of warts were occasionally anastomosed.  Warts could be categorised into two types; large and nodulated, or small and hemispherical.  In the four Callitris species native to high rainfall environments, warts were invariably of the latter type and were morphologically distinct from the mixed populations of small hemispherical and large nodulated warts found in species from dry habitats.  This suggests that large nodulated warts are of adaptive value in water-stress conditions.  Wart morphology was useful as an indicator of Callitris species although intra-specific variation limited the accuracy of diagnosis.

AB  - Test results on nitrogen input and nitrogen extraction for soils with varied productivity but under identical cultivation are illustrated by an example of a nitrate-polluted watershed in North Hesse. Increased nitrate leaching usually follows excessive fertilizing of poor soils with low productivity. The applied nitrogen is not utilized by the plants and suffers increased susceptibility to leaching into the ground water. The available water capacity (AWC) in the root zone is a complex indicator characterizing both the soil's susceptibility to nitrate leaching and its productivity as part of the soil's moisture balance. This indicator thus seems suitable as a basis for judging a site's inherent properties and consequently for determining location-adapted utilization of the land. On the basis of these findings, a programme to reduce nitrate lixiviation through site-adapted agriculture is presented with examples.

AB  - We present data on dispersed gold and associated disseminated mineralization of leucogranites controlling the location of the Dukat epithermal Au-Ag deposit. The data suggest the formation and burial of small portions of oversaturated gold-bearing fluids in hypabyssal magmatic bodies. The lower (relative to silver) contents of gold in the deposit ores and the high Ag/Au ratios (350-550) are due to the limited occurrence of oxidized gold-bearing fractions of magmatogene fluids. This limitation is explained by the active interaction of late magmatic portions of fluids and the material of the host carbonaceous volcanosedimcntary unit and by the formation of an environment favorable for the concentration, migration, and deposition of manganese, silver, and nonferrous-metal compounds.

AB  - Indigo carmine is a blue synthetic dye widely used in textile industry, as a food additive, in pharmaceutical industries, and as pH indicator. The use of this dye can leave to contamination of waste water and environment, damaging aquatic fauna and flora. An alternative for the treatment of water contaminated by dyes would be the degradation through oxidative processes. In this work, the indigo carmine degradation through a heterogeneous Fenton process using fly ash, an industrial waste, as Fe(II) source, was evaluated.. The dye final concentration was quantified by ultraviolet/visible light absorption spectroscopy. The optimal reaction conditions were determined using factorial design. The results showed that fly ash is able to remove approximately 42 % of the indigo carmine dye from solution without any pre-treatment.

TI  - Rapid environmental assessment in the nearshore
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
LA  - English
AB  - An instrument suite has been developed to assist in performing Rapid Environmental Assessment (REA) in the nearshore. The suite permits real-time monitoring of point values of wave height, wave period, wave direction, mean water level, and longshore currents, local meteorological conditions, and spatial information such as shoreline location, surf zone width, number of lines of surf and the location of shallow topographic features. Composed of three major components, the suite includes a pressure-current meter, a meteorological station, and a video monitoring system. All individual components include an energy source, a separate CPU and satellite communication systems so that they can autonomously provide real-time information remotely. Data examples from a test deployment during the MREA04 field trial are presented and control measurements from traditionally deployed instruments are used to help assess instrument reliability and the general utility of such measurement in the nearshore.

TI  - Principles of typification of soil combinations upon studying agrogenic changes in the soil cover
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - Methodological approaches to studying the agrogenic transformation of the soil cover are discussed using the example of several key sites in the center of the Russian Plain. The interpretation of factual data is based on the concept of soil cover patterns. An original typification of soil combinations is suggested with respect to (a) the degree of soil hydromorphism and the development of crosional-aggradational processes and (b) the position of particular soil combinations in the catenary system. The zonal features of the agrogenic transformation of the soil cover have their own specificity in different parts of catenary systems. The role of microrelief as a factor and an indicator of the agrogenic transformation of the soil cover is discussed. It is argued that regional systems of soil and landscape indicators of the agrogenic transformation of the soil cover should be created with due respect for local environmental conditions.

AB  - Distributions of freshwater midges, including Chironomidae, Chaoboridae, and Ceratopogonidae, were analyzed along a transect of lakes extending north from Whitehorse (Yukon Territory) to the Arctic Ocean (Northwest Territories). Abiskomyia, Mesocricotopus, Monodiamesa, and Paracladius were restricted to arctic tundra lakes, whereas Chaoborus, Pseudochironomus, Polypedilium, and Glyptotendipes were clearly associated with forest and forest-tundra environments. Many other taxa were broadly distributed with little apparent regard to latitude or ecoclimatic region. Canonical correspondence analyses revealed that midge distributions were most strongly correlated with total Kjeldahl N, maximum lake depth, pH, and summer surface water temperature. The distribution patterns suggest that subfossil midges may provide valuable proxy evidence for paleoenvironmental conditions in the Beringian region of northwestern Canada and Alaska.

AB  - Enteric bacteria exposed to the marine environment simultaneously encounter a variety of abiotic and biotic challenges. Among the former, light appears to be critical in affecting seawater survival: previous growth history plays a major part in preadaptation of the cells, and stationary phase cells are generally more resistant than exponentially growing ones. Predation, mostly by protozoa, is probably the most significant biotic factor. Using Escherichia coli as a model, a surprisingly small number of genes was found that, when mutated, significantly affect seawater sensitivity of this bacterium. Most prominent among those is rpoS, which was also dominant among genes induced upon transfer to seawater. (C) 2001 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

AB  - Observed ozone concentrations are valuable indicators of possible health and environmental impacts. However, they are also used to monitor changes and trends in the sources of ozone and of its precursors, and for this purpose the influence of meteorological variables is a confounding Factor, This paper examines ozone concentrations and meteorology in the Chicago area. The data are described using least absolute deviations and local regression. The key relationships observed in these analyses are then used to construct a nonlinear regression model relating ozone to meteorology. The model can be used to estimate that part of the trend in ozone levels that cannot be accounted for by trends in meteorology and to 'adjust' observed ozone concentrations for anomalous weather conditions.

AB  - We analyzed a rich palynological assemblage from the Tura Formation consisting of 55 genera and 89 species of dinoflagellate cysts, fungal remains; spores and pollen grains, along with a numerous marine microforaminiferal linings. The composition of palynotaxa, clay minerals and stable isotope ratios indicate a warm, humid climate with tropical-subtropical climate conditions during sediment deposition. Based on similar palynotaxa compositions and carbon isotope signatures, we conclude that the Tura Formation was deposited during early Eocene. The presence of terrestrial, coastal and marine elements in the assemblages is indicative of a shallowmarine environment in proximity to the shore line. The rock eval pyrolysis results suggest that the organic matter composition is primarily type III kerogen, which is a primary source of thermally immature hydrocarbons. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Channel Studencista provides the water supply from Biljana's Sources and is closely connected with the Studencista Wetland and Lake Ohrid. This channel is an important winter habitat for the endemic Alburnus scoranza Heckel & Kner, 1858 (Cyprinidae). In the last decade, the channel has been intensely used as a marina, which has caused major changes in the aquatic ecosystem. Similarly, in recent years, when the water level of the lake and the channel was lowered, fish pestilence was often recorded. We present data on histological and haematological studies of population of A. scoranza from the Channel Studencista. Our results suggest good health condition of fish population. The oxygen saturation of the water is a crucial factor for fish health during the winter 2017 and 2018.

AB  - Knowledge of the impacts of research can be done by querying in the literature the convergence between demand and supply of research in developing countries where innovation statistics are scarce. We are dealing with this question in the context of the agri-food sector in Cameroon. The demand for research is estimated by the indicators of needs developed from the opinions of business managers on the business climate and the protection of environment. The research supply is measured by a relevance indicator of the themes treated in scientific publications by Cameroonian authors. The study uses bibliometric data for the period 1991-2015, and the 2008 general census of enterprises. It notes a weak alignment between the development needs of agribusinesses and the scientific literature, and discusses the conditions of use of the proposed method.

AB  - In this paper, an active domestic solar water heater is modeled under the climate conditions of five cities of Maghreb Arab Union countries by using Transient System Simulation Software Program. The aim is to evaluate the energy saving, payback period as an economic indicator, and the environmental benefit in reduction of greenhouse gases.
   Depending on the climate zone, it is found that the system has the potential to save annually between 3506-4130 kWh with a mean annual solar fraction between 71-100 % and has a payback period of 9.07-27.48 years. Another benefit of using the proposed system is the environmental issue; which results in reducing CO2 emission by an amount between 2-3.8 tCO2. These variations between can be attributed to the energy considerations in each country.

AB  - Nitrogen isotope ratios in tissues are often used to aid in the reconstruction of the marine component of diets in past populations. Elevated delta N-15 values normally found with high trophic level marine resource consumption can, however, also be mimicked by physiological conditions (breastfeeding, pathological states affecting nitrogen balance), climate (aridity), and anthropogenic environments (manuring). This paper presents a pilot study testing whether bromine concentrations can provide a tool for teasing apart possible causes of variation in nitrogen isotope ratios. Blind analyses of bromine in archaeological samples correctly identified individuals derived from coastal vs. inland regions and high vs. low marine consumption time periods. Thus, bromine can provide an important supplement to other isotopic analyses of diet. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - After the publishing of the Red list of Bulgarian bryophytes in 2006 (listed 228 threatened bryophytes), new data were collected about the distribution of 57 threatened bryophyte species estimated so far as Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN), Vulnerable (VU), and Near Threatened (NT). The high habitat diversity in higher mountains supports higher species diversity. These areas harbor a larger number of threatened species, as well. Recent studies contributed additional data on bryophyte diversity in Northeast Bulgaria, Black Sea coast, Danubian Plain, Western Balkan Range. Threatened bryophytes are analyzed with respect to distribution type, substrate, habitat preferences and life history in an attempt to reveal the reasons for their rarity. New chorological data, together with assessment of ecological condition of bryophyte habitats and threats for these species allow further re-evaluation of their threat status according IUCN criteria.

AB  - The assessment of landscape qualities is an essential theme in applied geomorphological research incorporated in environmental impact assessments. An integral method for geomorphological impact assessment is presented, based on a functional approach. Five groups of landform functions can be distinguished in the Netherlands: orientation functions, information functions, ordering functions, regulation functions and carriage functions. The catena principle is used to select relevant criteria to assess landform functions. Evaluation criteria chosen for the five groups of functions are: complexity and visibility; representativity, visibility, rarity and condition; geomorphological position, topographical position and complexity; geographical position and relief; and relief, respectively. The method was applied in an environmental impact assessment of sand and gravel extraction sites in a fluvial lowland area in the Netherlands. A 1:50000 analytical geomorphological map was used for the assessment. Results helped to differentiate between the various alternatives for extraction.

AB  - Quantification of adsorption processes on clay mineral surfaces is often necessary to predict the extent and the evolution of contaminants' migration in surficial and underground environments. Many studies have been dedicated to retention measurement as a function of pH and ionic strength in relation with the two main identified adsorption processes for clay minerals, that is, cation exchange on their basal surfaces and surface complexation on their edge surfaces. The latest process has been repeatedly assessed as an effective retention mechanism at circumneutral pH conditions, which often prevail in natural environments. This assessment must however be tempered by the lack of information about competitive processes that can take place with the numerous chemical species present in natural settings, compared to Coe - simplified systems investigated in laboratory experiments. In this study, we quantified experimentally the competition between Pb2+, Co2+, Zn2+, and Mg2+ for specific adsorption on montmorillonite edge surfaces. Zn2+ was an effective competitor with Pb2+ and Co2+, and our results showed also unambiguously the influence of Mg2+ concentration levels on the specific adsorption of Pb2+ and Co2+. Because of the high ionic strength used in the experiments, cation exchange with Mg2+ was dismissed as a possible reason for such competition process, leaving specific competitive adsorption on edge surfaces as a unique explanation for our observations. Modeling of Pb2+ adsorption data with a state-of-art electrostatic complexation model for montmorillonite edge surfaces, supported by state-of-the-art, made it possible to distinguish two types of possible competition driving forces: Zn2+ competition for adsorption site occupancy but also detrimental changes in surface electrostatic potential following Mg2+ adsorption on sites neighboring those of Pb2+ adsorption. Mg2+ competition observed in our experiment should apply in most of clayey environments. Consequently, adsorption data obtained on pure clay mineral phases, and the associated models that have been built based on these data without considering the geochemical background in competitive species, may overestimate the retention properties of clay minerals when applied to natural settings.

AB  - Adaptive capacity, one of the three determinants of vulnerability to climate change, is defined as the capacity of species to persist in their current location by coping with novel environmental conditions through acclimation and/or evolution. Although studies have identified indicators of adaptive capacity, few have assessed this capacity in a quantitative way that is comparable across tree species. Yet, such multispecies assessments are needed by forest management and conservation programs to refine vulnerability assessments and to guide the choice of adaptation measures. In this paper, we propose a framework to quantitatively evaluate five key components of tree adaptive capacity to climate change: individual adaptation through phenotypic plasticity, population phenotypic diversity as influenced by genetic diversity, genetic exchange within populations, genetic exchange between populations, and genetic exchange between species. For each component, we define the main mechanisms that underlie adaptive capacity and present associated metrics that can be used as indices. To illustrate the use of this framework, we evaluate the relative adaptive capacity of 26 northeastern North American tree species using values reported in the literature. Our results show adaptive capacity to be highly variable among species and between components of adaptive capacity, such that no one species ranks consistently across all components. On average, the conifer Picea glauca and the broadleaves Acer rubrum and A. saccharinum show the greatest adaptive capacity among the 26 species we documented, whereas the conifers Picea rubens and Thuja occidentalis, and the broadleaf Ostrya virginiana possess the lowest. We discuss limitations that arise when comparing adaptive capacity among species, including poor data availability and comparability issues in metrics derived from different methods or studies. The breadth of data required for such an assessment exemplifies the multidisciplinary nature of adaptive capacity and the necessity of continued cross-collaboration to better anticipate the impacts of a changing climate.

AB  - The aim of this study was to understand heteroaggregation of mixture of ZnO and CuO nanoparticles (NPs) with clay, for the first time as per the authors' knowledge. Aggregation studies of mixture of ZnO and CuO nanoparticles with clay was done (ionic strength =5 mM; pH 7; nanoparticles concentration = 0.1 mg/L, 1 mg/L, 10 mg/L; Clay concentration = 1, 10, and 100 mg/L and HA concentration = 0.1,1, and 10 mg/L as total organic carbon). Critical coagulation concentration (CCC) and attachment efficiency values of suspensions with ZnO: CuO ratio = 0.1, 1, 10 were also determined. Aggregation and liquid portions of mixture suspension at equal mass ratio were characterized for size, zeta potential (ZP), metal and ion contents, pH and conductivity. Results indicated that CCC was found to be 120.7 mM for ZnO: CuO ratio 10 and 1144 mM for ZnO: CuO ratio 1. Values of attachment efficiency were obtained to be 0.9 and 0.8 for these two ZnO:CuO ratio. At natural water ionic strength (IS) condition, aggregate rate constant of mixture of particles ranged from 0281 to 8.63 nm/min for 10 mg/L NP concentration. Aggregation in suspension containing mixture of particles was found to be affected by NP concentration, clay concentration, and humic add (p < 0.05). During a 1-h aggregation study, 2.67 mg Cu metal/g aggregate and 0.38 mg Zn/g aggregate were found in aggregates of 5 mM suspension. Overall, this study provided information on aggregation characterization of mixture of metal oxide nanoparticles (ZnO and CuO) in HA and clay presence, which is useful in understanding aggregation formation and in characterizing exposure dose for environmental risk assessment. More detailed information on a three -particle system with natural colloids is required for predicting their fate in aquatic system and defining risk. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the development of organic matter (OM) source tracking tools, it is critical to validate if (1) the tracers are conservative with source mixing, and (2) they can be conservative under diagenetic processes (e.g., microbial degradation). In this study, these two critical points were rigorously tested for three commonly-used source tracking tools (i.e., absorbance and fluorescence proxies, stable carbon isotopes and lipid biomarkers) via a controlled experiment at laboratory scale. To this end, two end-members (e.g., soil and algae), which represent the most common and contrasted sources of OM to sediments in an aquatic environment, were mixed in different ratios and then incubated under different oxygen conditions (oxic versus anoxic) in the dark at 25 degrees C for 60 days. The initial and final signals of the source tracking tools were analyzed and compared for each mixing ratio. Based on three evaluation criteria concerning the linearity of the relationships, discrimination sensitivity, and conservative mixing behavior, we evaluated the applicability of the tools to trace the sediment organic matter in the aquatic environment. Although most of the source tracking proxies evaluated in this study showed a conservative nature after incubation, there are only a few that demonstrated both conservative behaviors with the sources mixing and under early diagenetic processes. The fluorescence proxies such as the relative distribution of a humic-like component associated with refractory source material (Ex/Em: 220/430 nm), modified fluorescence index (YFI), humification index (HIX), and carbon stable isotope ratios were identified to be the most reliable tracers for tracking sedimentary OM sources under early diagenetic processes. This study provides strong insights into the validation of common OM source tracking tools for sediment and a reasonable guideline to select the optimum indices for source discrimination via end-member mixing analysis.

AB  - Methane, CH4, is a powerful greenhouse gas released to the atmosphere by both anthropogenic and natural sources. Urban areas play an important role in greenhouse gas emissions, yet few efforts have been made to investigate CH4 concentration and its spatial variability in cities. In this paper, a case study to monitor the spatial pattern and determinants of near-surface urban CH4 concentration was conducted in Shanghai, the commercial and financial center of mainland China. A total of 173 sampling points were collected to examine the atmospheric CH4 concentration across different land use types and urban-rural gradients at a height of 2 m above the ground in April and May 2014. The contributions of potential influencing factors, including four indicators of human activities (e.g., distance to natural gas pipelines [Dist_gas], distance to sewage plants (Dist_sew), population density [Den_pop), density of road network [Den-road]) and two indicators of natural conditions (i.e., planetary boundary layer height [BLH] and land surface temperature [LST]), in determining spatial CH4 concentrations were investigated using Lindeman-Merenda-Gold (LMG) metric. The results indicated that the average CH4 concentration in the morning for the region was 1,897 +/- 92 parts per billion by volume (ppbv), with significant spatial heterogeneity. Atmospheric CH4 had negative correlation with the distance to urban center except the influence of obvious emission sources, such as petrochemical plants etc. The six selected influencing factors could explain 76.3% of the CH4 spatial variability. Population density was the dominant factor for about 27.2%, while the distance to the natural gas pipelines, planetary boundary layer height and distance to the sewage plants were about 14.4%, 14.2% and 12.6%, respectively. The finding in this study might help to build a better understanding of the mechanics of CH4 variations and evaluation of the potentially influencing factors.

AB  - Serving as "natural laboratories", altitudinal gradients can be used to study changes in the distribution of microorganisms in response to changing environmental conditions that typically occur over short geographical distances. Besides, rhizosphere zones of plants are known to be hot-spots for microbial diversity and to contain different microbial communities when compared with surrounding bulk soil. To discriminate the effects of altitude and plants, we investigated the microbial communities in the rhizosphere of Ranunculus glacialis and bulk soil along a high-alpine altitudinal gradient (2,600-3,400m a.s.l.). The research area of this study was Mount (Mt.) "Schrankogel" in the Central Alps of Tyrol (Austria). Our results point to significantly different microbial diversities and community compositions in the different altitudinal belts. In the case of prokaryotes, environmental parameters could explain 41% of the total variation of soil communities, with pH and temperature being the strongest influencing factors. Comparing the effects derived from fraction (bulk vs. rhizosphere soil) and environmental factors, the effects of the roots of R. glacialis accounted for about one third of the explained variation. Fungal communities on the other hand were nearly exclusively influenced by environmental parameters accounting for 37.4% of the total variation. Both, for altitudinal zones as well as for bulk and rhizosphere fractions a couple of very specific biomarker taxa could be identified. Generally, the patterns of abundance of several taxa did not follow a steady increased or decreased trend along the altitudinal gradient but in many cases a maximal or minimal occurrence was established at mid-altitudes (3,000-3,100m). This mid-altitudinal zone is a transition zone (the so-called alpine-nival ecotone) between the (lower) alpine grassland/ tundra zone and the (upper) sparsely vegetated nival zone and was shown to correspond with the summer snow line. Climate change and the associated increase in temperature will shift this transition zone and thus, might also shift the described microbial patterns and biomarkers.

AB  - Managing forests to preserve biodiversity requires a good knowledge not only of the factors driving its dynamics but also of the structural elements that actually support biodiversity. Tree-related microhabitats (e.g. cavities, cracks, conks of fungi) are tree-borne features that are reputed to support specific biodiversity for at least a part of species' life cycles. While several studies have analysed the drivers of microhabitats number and occurrence at the tree scale, they remain limited to a few tree species located in relatively narrow biogeographical ranges. We used a nationwide database of forest reserves where microhabitats were inventoried on more than 22,000 trees. We analysed the effect of tree diameter and living status (alive or dead) on microhabitat number and occurrence per tree, taking into account biogeoclimatic variables and tree genus. We confirmed that larger trees and dead trees bore more microhabitats than their smaller or living counterparts did; we extended these results to a wider range of tree genera and ecological conditions than those studied before. Contrary to our expectations, the total number of microhabitat types per tree barely varied with tree genus-though we did find slightly higher accumulation levels for broad-leaves than for conifers-nor did it vary with elevation or soil pH, whatever the living status. We observed the same results for the occurrence of individual microhabitat types. However, accumulation levels with diameter and occurrence on dead trees were higher for microhabitats linked with wood decay processes (e.g. dead branches or woodpecker feeding holes) than for other, epixylic, microhabitats such as epiphytes (ivy, mosses and lichens). Promoting large living and dead trees of several tree species may be a relevant, and nearly universal, way to favour microhabitats and enhance the substrates needed to support specific biodiversity. In the future, a better understanding of microhabitat drivers and dynamics at the tree scale may help to better define their role as biodiversity indicators for large-scale monitoring.

AB  - Present study aims to explore the effectiveness of environmental factors as predictive markers for assessing their impact on stress and endocrine physiology in selected five ecologically important fish species of Sundarban mangrove estuarine area, India. Our goal was to develop a realistic integrated conceptual model to analyze and envisage the consequence of fluctuating environmental parameters on the stress physiology of these fishes and their adaptive responses to thrive in such environment. Fishes were collected monthly throughout the year from 3 different study sites and various anti-oxidant (enzymatic and non-enzymatic) and detoxification enzymes were measured. Levels of the stress hormone cortisol and reproductive hormone 17 beta-estradiol were also measured as indicators of stress accumulation and reproductive status of the selected fish species. The study sites showed variations in physical factors such as pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature and salinity, which may be related to environmental fluctuation and/or pollution level. Such panel of multiple enzyme and hormone biomarkers in fish might be a useful tool to develop an assessment model. This study demonstrated a sharp indication of variation in the antioxidant enzyme profiles depending on the physical environment but the changes is exclusively site as well as species specific. To justify our assumptions cluster and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis have been done to investigate the ordination of physiological parameters and water quality parameters; if it varies for each species or not. Levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidise (GPx), malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) showed variations depending on the physical environment but the changes is exclusively site as well as species specific. Finally, the prediction model and NMDS scaling confirmed MDA, GST and GSH as decisive factor to envisage steroid hormone, whereas organic carbon, temperature, ammonia and alkalinity as the major contributor of its prediction.

AB  - Shipping industry and seaborne trade have rapidly increased over the last fifty years, mainly due to the continuous increasing demand for chemicals and fuels. Consequently, despite current regulations, the occurrence of accidental spills poses an important risk. Hazardous and noxious substances (HNSs) have been raising major concern among environmental managers and scientific community for their heterogeneity, hazardous potential towards aquatic organisms and associated social-economic impacts. A literature review on ecotoxicological hazards to aquatic organisms was conducted for seven HNSs: acrylonitrile, n-butyl acrylate, cyclohexylbenzene, hexane, isononanol, trichloroethylene and xylene. Information on the mechanisms of action of the selected HNS was also reviewed. The main purpose was to identify: i) knowledge gaps in need of being addressed in future research; and ii) a set of possible biomarkers suitable for ecotoxicological assessment and monitoring in both estuarine and marine systems.
   Main gaps found concern the scarcity of information available on ecotoxicological effects of HNS towards marine species and their poorly understood mode of action in wildlife. Differences were found between the sensitivity of freshwater and seawater organisms, so endpoints produced in the former may not be straightforwardly employed in evaluations for the marine environment. The relationship between sub-individual effects and higher level detrimental alterations (e.g. behavioural, morphological, reproductive effects and mortality) are not fully understood. In this context, a set of biomarkers associated to neurotoxicity, detoxification and anti-oxidant defences is suggested as potential indicators of toxic exposure/effects of HNS in marine organisms.
   Overall, to support the development of contingency plans and the establishment of environmental safety thresholds, it will be necessary to undertake targeted research on HNS ecotoxicity in the marine environment. Research should address these issues under more realistic exposure scenarios reflecting the prevailing spatial and temporal variability in ecological and environmental conditions.

AB  - The area of land covered by forest and trees is an important indicator of environmental condition. This study presents and analyses results from the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015 (FRA 2015) of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. FRA 2015 was based on responses to surveys by individual countries using a common reporting framework, agreed definitions and reporting standards. Results indicated that total forest area declined by 3%, from 4128 M ha in 1990 to 3999 M ha in 2015. The annual rate of net forest loss halved from 73 M ha y(-1) in the 1990s to 3.3 M ha y(-1) between 2010 and 2015. Natural forest area declined from 3961 M ha to 3721 M ha between 1990 and 2015, while planted forest (including rubber plantations) increased from 168 M ha to 278 M ha. From 2010 to 2015, tropical forest area declined at a rate of 5.5 M ha y(-1) - only 58% of the rate in the 1990s - while temperate forest area expanded at a rate of 2.2 M ha y(-1). Boreal and sub-tropical forest areas showed little net change. Forest area expanded in Europe, North America, the Caribbean, East Asia, and Western-Central Asia, but declined in Central America, South America, South and Southeast Asia and all three regions in Africa. Analysis indicates that, between 1990 and 2015, 13 tropical countries may have either passed through their forest transitions from net forest loss to net forest expansion, or continued along the path of forest expansion that follows these transitions. Comparing FRA 2015 statistics with the findings of global and pan-tropical remote-sensing forest area surveys was challenging, due to differences in assessment periods, the definitions of forest and remote sensing methods. More investment in national and global forest monitoring is needed to provide better support for international initiatives to increase sustainable forest management and reduce forest loss, particularly in tropical countries.

AB  - Objectives: We aimed to investigate suitable conditions of 8-hydroxy-20-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and micronucleus (MN) as genotoxic biomarkers at different levels of occupational chromate exposure.
   Design: A cross-sectional study was used.
   Participants: 84 workers who were exposed to chromate for at least 1 year were chosen as the chromate exposed group, while 30 non-exposed individuals were used as controls.
   Main outcome measures: Environmental and biological exposure to chromate was respectively assessed by measuring the concentration of chromate in the air (CrA) and blood (CrB) by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) in all participants. MN indicators, including micronucleus cell count (MNCC), micro-nucleus count (MNC), nuclear bridge (NPB) and nuclear bud (NBUD) were calculated by the cytokinesis-block micronucleus test (CBMN), while the urinary 8-OHdG was measured by the ELISA method and normalised by the concentration of Cre.
   Results: Compared with the control group, the levels of CrA, CrB, MNCC, MNC and 8-OHdG in the chromate-exposed group were all significantly higher (p<0.05). There were positive correlations between log(8-OHdG) and LnMNCC or LnMNC (r=0.377 and 0.362). The levels of LnMNCC, LnMNC and log (8-OHdG) all have parabola correlations with the concentration of CrB. However, there was a significantly positive correlation between log (8-OHdG) and CrB when the CrB level was below 10.50 mu g/L (r=0.355), while a positive correlation was also found between LnMNCC or LnMNC and CrB when the CrB level was lower than 9.10 mu g/L (r=0.365 and 0.269, respectively).
   Conclusions: MN and 8-OHdG can be used as genotoxic biomarkers in the chromate-exposed group, but it is only when CrB levels are lower than 9.10 and 10.50 mu g/L, respectively, that they can accurately reflect the degree of genetic damage.

AB  - Questions Is there evidence for biotic homogenization of upland vegetation? Do the magnitude and nature of floristic and compositional change vary between vegetation types? What can be inferred about the drivers responsible for the observed changes? Location Upland heath, mire and grassland communities of the northwest Highlands of Scotland, UK. Methods We re-survey plots first described in a phytosociological study of 19561958 to assess the changes in plant species composition over the last 50 yr in five major upland vegetation types. Using a combination of multivariate analysis, dissimilarity measures, diversity metrics and published data on species attributes; we quantify, characterize and link potential drivers of environmental change with the observed changes in species composition. Results Grassland and heath vegetation declined in species richness and variation in community composition, while mires showed little change. Previously distinct vegetation types became more similar in composition, characterized by the increased dominance of generalist upland graminoids and reduced dwarf-shrub, forb and lichen cover, although novel assemblages were not apparent. Species with an oceanic distribution increased at the expense of those with an arctic-montane distribution. Temperature, precipitation and acidity were found to be potentially important in explaining changes in species composition: species that had undergone the greatest increases had a preference for warmer, drier and more acidic conditions. Conclusions The vegetation of the northwest Scottish Highlands has undergone marked biotic homogenization over the last 50 yr, manifested through a loss of various aspects of diversity at the local, community and landscape scales. The magnitude of change varies between vegetation types, although the nature of change shows many similar characteristics. Analyses of species attributes suggest these changes are driven by climate warming and acidification, although over-grazing may also be important. This study highlights the importance of the link between the loss of plant diversity and homogenization at multiple scales, and demonstrates that boreal heath communities are particularly at risk from these processes.

AB  - The bottom trawl fishery developed on the slope off Balearic Islands (western Mediterranean) has been analysed from different sources of information: (i) data obtained during experimental bottom trawl surveys developed annually since 2001; (ii) daily sale bills from the bottom trawl fleet, available since 2000. Considering both hydrographical and geomorphologic conditions, the study area was divided in four geographical sectors. Multivariate techniques were applied to identify assemblages and their main species, and to investigate the influence of environmental variables in the slope communities. Fishery-independent and fishery-dependent indicators were calculated, both at specific and community level, for the assemblages identified. In all cases, they were summarised using the Traffic Light approach. Three assemblages have been identified in the slope trawl fishing grounds off the Balearic Islands: (1) the almost unexploited shelf break, where teleosts predominate; (2) the upper slope, where teleosts still predominate but crustaceans are also very important (with Nephrops norvegicus as target species); (3) and the middle slope, where crustaceans predominate (with Aristeus antennatus as target species). Depth was the main factor affecting the species composition of the assemblages, although other factors such as area, year and effort level also affect. Indicators estimated from both sets of data suggested an improvement in the state of N. norvegicus, although the results suggest the influence of other factors than fishing impact in the state of this resource. For A. antennatus, marked differences have been found depending on the data source. In the upper slope, indicators suggested an improvement in the state of this assemblage, which can be related to a decreasing trend found in the fishing effort exerted in this depth range. Indicators from the middle slope showed differences for both sets of data. The characteristics of both data sources and of the species analysed are discussed as responsible of these differences.

AB  - One of the major factors in favor of soil conservation measures is the prevention of top fertile soil removal, which adversely affects the crop productivity, depending upon the type of crop, soil, and erosion intensity. This reasoning has generally been assigned qualitatively and has rarely been supported through a quantitative relationship between soil loss and crop productivity The soil loss tolerance limit (T value) is one of the several indicators to properly explain this phenomenon. The T value can be used as a guide to decide the maximum soil loss that can be removed before the long-term soil productivity is adversely affected. In this paper, two methods have been compared in determining T value on a regional scale for Doon Valley conditions in India. The first approach is based on assessment of the productivity index (PI) that considers permissible soil productivity loss rate (delta) and planning horizon (H) for sustainable land use. Productivity index is assessed and then related with tolerable rate of soil loss. The second approach is based on a quantitative weighted additive model, which has been used to define the current state of the soil resource. Both methods have been found to be good indices of soil loss tolerance value. However, the PI-based approach requires a complicated depth-wise dataset, including available water capacity, bulk density, and pH, which at present is not available for most of the ecological regions of India. Generating such a database may require long time and large investment. On the other hand, the weighted additive model requires a minimum data set of six soil attributes, which are readily available. Using the sensitivity index, the different T value at each of the study sites was separately compared. The overall mean of the sensitivity index was statistically insignificant at p < 0.05 for each location. Both methods were able to provide a reliable estimate of T value at different locations. However, the weighted additive model proved to be more reasonable as it requires a readily available dataset.

AB  - Reports of malformed amphibians and global amphibian declines have led to public concern, particularly because amphibians are thought to be indicator species of overall environmental health. The topic also draws scientific attention because there is no obvious, simple answer to the question of what is causing amphibian declines? Complex interactions of several anthropogenic factors are probably at work, and understanding amphibian declines may thus serve as a model for understanding species declines in general. While we have fewer answers than we would like, there are six leading hypotheses that we sort into two classes. For class I hypotheses, alien species, over-exploitation and land use change, we have a good understanding of the ecological mechanisms underlying declines; these causes have affected amphibian populations negatively for more than a century. However, the question remains as to whether the magnitude of these negative effects increased in the 1980s, as scientists began to notice a global decline of amphibians. Further, remedies for these problems are not simple. For class II hypotheses, global change (including UV radiation and global climate change), contaminants and emerging infectious diseases we have a poor, but improving understanding of how each might cause declines. Class II factors involve complex and subtle mechanistic underpinnings, with probable interactions among multiple ecological and evolutionary variables. They may also interact with class I hypotheses. Suspected mechanisms associated with class II hypotheses are relatively recent, dating from at least the middle of the 20th century. Did these causes act independently or in concert with pre-existing negative forces of class I hypotheses to increase the rate of amphibian declines to a level that drew global attention? We need more studies that connect the suspected mechanisms underlying both classes of hypotheses with quantitative changes in amphibian population sizes and species numbers. An important step forward in this task is clarifying the hypotheses and conditions under which the various causes operate alone or together.

AB  - Regulation of GM crops prior to their commercial release requires research under controlled conditions, either in confined field trials, in greenhouses, and/or in the laboratory. Authorizations in Argentina can be obtained for experimental or confined field trials and "counter-season" production of regulated seed. These trials represent the first controlled introduction of GM crops in the environment. The goal is to prevent dissemination of GM pollen, seed, or plant parts outside the growing area and avoid consumption by humans and animals. During the trials, data is also collected on agronomic performance and potential environmental impacts. The purpose of this document is to provide a summary of the regulatory requirements governing contained and confined field trials of GM crops in Argentina.

AB  - The dermis of cetaceans is in constant contact with microbial species. Although the skin of the bottlenose dolphin provides adequate defense against most disease-causing microbes, it also provides an environment for microbial community development. Microbial community uniqueness and richness associated with bottlenose dolphin skin is a function of varying habitats and changing environmental conditions. The current study uses ribosomal DNA as a marker to identify bacteria found on the skin of coastal and offshore bottlenose dolphins off of Southern California. The unique microbial communities recovered from these dolphins suggest a greater microbial diversity on the skin of offshore ecotype bottlenose dolphins, while microbial populations associated with the coastal ecotype include species that are more closely related to each other and that suggest exposure to communities that are likely to be associated with terrestrial runoff.

AB  - Using an analytic-synthetic model of ergonomic research of management information systems (MIS) in coal mines, we identified 13 elements which were used to define eight factors that impact operator's performance. These eight factors were further reduced to five key factors after the application of expert assessment. We have defined 23 indicators for these key factors, ranked by means of the analytic hierarchy process method. This paper includes a detailed ergonomic analysis of the five key operator quality indicators, namely, shape and size of the control panel, functionality of the video display terminal, keyboard functionality, alarm response time and expansion of the MIS with environmental parameters. Based on the condition prior to and after the proposed changes, we were able to use this approach to determine and discuss the operator quality index.

AB  - Juvenile seedstock availability and costs are some of the main biological aspects to be considered on species for intensive culture assessment studies, together with market importance and performance under culture conditions, especially the growth rate and yields. A juvenile yield index (JYi) is described, as one of the judgment indicator of juvenile efficiency utilization on edible size culture production of tropical marine fishes. This index is expressed as the number of juveniles required per metric ton per year, and combines fish growth rate during grow-out, survival, and commercial size at harvest. The JYi could be combined with production costs and wholesale prices, to estimate a juvenile gross profit index (JGPi), and expressed in terms of estimated gross profit per juvenile number required per ton produced per year.

CP  - 2nd National Symposium on Environmental Chemistry
AB  - For some time the honeybee has proven to be an excellent bioindicator of pesticides. This technique was used between 1995 and 1996 in the coastal regions of Emilia-Romagna where 21 monitoring stations were employed. A sample of dead bees was analysed in the laboratory every time the critical threshold of the death rate was exceeded. In 1995 a particularly worrisome situation came to light with the discovery of lindane in two inhabited areas of Ravenna where the use of this substance could not be justified by the local conditions. Dangerous and obsolete molecules such as parathion and endosulfan also indicate the difficulty of local agriculture in relinquishing the old methods of protecting cultivation. In any case, the area studied in these two years showed an overall medium-low level of contamination. The model proposed for processing the data proved to be optimum for this type of environmental study.

AB  - The natural flood pulse of the Amazon basin has been altered progressively by the installation of hydroelectric dams, which have had a potentially adverse impact on the local fauna. Fish are sensitive to environmental changes, and one the way to assess how they respond is through the analysis of life history traits, such as growth patterns and reproduction. Here, we evaluated the life history traits of two sedentary cichlids, Geophagus argyrostictus and Geophagus altifrons, in the middle Xingu River (upstream and downstream sectors) pre- and postimpoundment including the flood and low water hydrological seasons. The mass-length relationship, condition factor (K), gonadossomatic index (GSI), breeding season, gonadal stages, and the length at 50% sexual maturity (L50) were analyzed. Data on river flow rates and the characteristics of the fish were collected during the pre- and post-impoundment periods. Post-impoundment, the discharge of the Xingu decreased in downstream sector. During the pre-impoundment period, the K of G. argyrostictus and female G. altifrons was lower in the upstream sector in both seasons, but higher in the downstream sector to G. argyrostictus. The GSI was lower in the postimpoundment period in both sectors and seasons in G. argyrostictus, whereas in the G. altifrons females, it was higher in the downstream sector in the low water season, but lower in the upstream sector in both seasons. In G. argyrostictus, spawning occurred in a single phase and was restricted to the low water season in both periods, whereas in G. altifrons, spawning was multiple. There was a reduction in the frequency of immature individuals in the upstream sector post-impoundment. The L50 was lower, principally in the upstream sector, in both species. Our results indicate that the growth patterns and reproduction of the two populations has been impacted, especially in the endemic G. argyrostictus. The construction of dams thus appears to place endemic species under a greatest risk of extirpation. These results provide important insights for the improvement of fish resource monitoring and the development of adequate management techniques.

AB  - Results of the study about pollutants content in soils of urbanized landscapes are presented. Patterns of their migration and accumulation in main soil types of Brovary are grounded. Correlation relationships between the individual components of ecological-geochemical system of urbanized territory were analyzed. Dependences of landscape resistance to technogenic pollution on the level of conservation of natural geochemical parameters of soils, degree of their anthropogenic transformation and level of heavy metals were determined. According to geochemical criteria technogenic associations of heavy metals in soils are determined, which are represented by the following elements: Cu>Pb>Zn>Co>Cr>V>Mo>Mn>Ni. Level of gross content of chemical elements compounds in soils of different zones of the city is heterogeneous. City zones with the highest polyelement contamination of soil have been identified. Maximum technogenic load is recorded in urban areas of transport infrastructure zone and zone of production and communal-warehouse facilities. Ecological and geochemical assessment on the total index of pollution by using methods of Y.E. Saeta, is shown. Value of this topsoil parameter in Brovary (0-10 cm) ranges from 30 to 106, the average is 65, which corresponds to hazardous level of soil pollution. According to the total indicator of technogenic pollution, Brovary belongs to cities with high pollution level. Soils in all parts of the city, except for residential areas, are classified as hazardous. Studied soils of the city are characterized by plumbum geochemical specialization. High levels of zinc, manganese, cobalt and chromium were also found (the maximal permissible concentrations in soil exceeds by 1.7-4.7 times). Especial attention is paid to the patterns, mechanisms of pollutants influence on the complex of soil properties and processes that determine the ecological condition of soils and their resistance to anthropogenic flows. Soil contamination by pollutants leads to changes in their physical and chemical properties (cation exchange capacity pH, organic matter content) which causes a low buffering capacity of soil cover of the city.

AB  - Marine mammals respond to, and thereby reflect, changes in Arctic ecosystems that are important both to practitioners of conventional science (CS) and to holders of indigenous knowledge (IK). Although often seen as contrasting approaches to tracking ecosystem variability, when CS and IK are combined they can provide complementary and synergistic information. Despite exceptions, ecosystem-focused CS is often spatially broad and time shallow (1000 s km, decades) while IK is comparatively narrow spatially and time deep (10 s km, centuries). In addition, differences in how information is gathered, stored, applied and communicated can confound information integration from these two knowledge systems. Over the past four decades, research partnerships between CS practitioners and IK holders have provided novel insights to an Alaskan Arctic marine ecosystem in rapid transition. We identify insights from some of those projects, as they relate to changes in sea ice, oceanography, and more broadly to marine mammal ecology and health. From those insights and the protocols of existing community-based programs, we suggest that the strong seasonal cycle of Arctic environmental events should be leveraged as a shared framework to provide common ground for communication when developing projects related to marine mammal health and ecology. Adopting a shared temporal framework would foster joint CS-IK thinking and support the development of novel and nonlinear approaches to shared questions and concerns regarding marine mammals. The overarching goal is to extend the range and depth of a common understanding of marine mammal health and ecology during a period of rapid ecosystem alteration. The current focus on CS-IK co-production of knowledge and recent inclusion of marine mammals as essential variables in global ocean observatories makes this an opportune time to find common ground for understanding and adapting to the rapid changes now underway in Arctic marine ecosystems.

AB  - The beginning of the 21st century has witnessed a growth in our understanding of the importance of planning urban landscapes in the context of urban population growth and unpredictable climatic conditions. In the search for responses to the challenges set by the development of contemporary urban landscapes, researchers have offered solutions based on the concept of sustainable and resilient cities, whose spatial development would be based on an interdisciplinary approach to strategy development: biodiversity, urban ecological networks and connectivity, multifunctionality and modularity. Although the concepts of a green infrastructure, in their spatial and functional dimensions, allow the application of such strategies, there are still problems when it comes to implementation and measuring the results achieved. At the same time, there is a growing discussion of the important role played by urban forestry in the context of the collaborative planning of urban landscapes and the application of the ideas of a green infrastructure. The key question is: what are the modalities of application of the concept of green infrastructure in the process of planning the development of the modem city and how can the resulting benefits be evaluated? With the modalities of application of the concept of green infrastructure in mind, we discuss its multi-scale and multifunctional dimensions as applied in the case of Serbia. The realisation of the green infrastructure concept is presented through the example of the Urban Forest Management Plan for the City of Belgrade - Mladenovac Municipality. The results of using the spatial-ecological approach in creating the plan and establishing connectivity as a new aim in forest management planning show that the implementation of the green infrastructure concept, and the achieved multifunctional ecosystem values, can be presented on the basis of the parameters of landscape metrics. In light of the new urban world, future research should focus on the application of the landscape ecological approach of the green infrastructure concept in collaborative planning at the urban landscape scale, which allows the creation of ecosystem services and benefits to human well-being.

AB  - Phytoplankton indicated by its photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll-a is an important pointer on lake ecology and a regularly monitored parameter within the European Water Framework Directive. Along with eutrophication and global warming cyanobacteria gain increasing importance concerning human health aspects. Optical remote sensing may support both the monitoring of horizontal distribution of phytoplankton and cyanobacteria at the lake surface and the reduction of spatial uncertainties associated with limited water sample analyses. Temporal and spatial resolution of using only one satellite sensor, however, may constrain its information value. To discuss the advantages of a multi-sensor approach the sensor-independent, physically based model MIP (Modular Inversion and Processing System) was applied at Lake Kummerow, Germany, and lake surface chlorophyll-a was derived from 33 images of five different sensors (MODIS-Terra, MODIS-Aqua, Landsat 8, Landsat 7 and Sentinel-2A). Remotely sensed lake average chlorophyll-a concentration showed a reasonable development and varied between 2.3 +/- 0.4 and 35.8 +/- 2.0 mg.m(-3) from July to October 2015. Match-ups between in situ and satellite chlorophyll-a revealed varying performances of Landsat 8 (RMSE: 3.6 and 19.7 mg.m(-3)), Landsat 7 (RMSE: 6.2 mg.m(-3)), Sentinel-2A (RMSE: 5.1 mg.m(-3)) and MODIS (RMSE: 12.8 mg.m(-3)), whereas an in situ data uncertainty of 48% needs to be respected. The temporal development of an index on harmful algal blooms corresponded well with the cyanobacteria biomass development during summer months. Satellite chlorophyll-a maps allowed to follow spatial patterns of chlorophyll-a distribution during a phytoplankton bloom event. Wind conditions mainly explained spatial patterns. Integrating satellite chlorophyll-a into trophic state assessment resulted in different trophic classes. Our study endorsed a combined use of satellite and in situ chlorophyll-a data to alleviate weaknesses of both approaches and to better characterise and understand phytoplankton development in lakes.

AB  - This article presents the results of studies of the properties of marmalade with natural plant cryoadditives during storage for 3 months (90 days). To improve the organoleptic characteristics and antioxidant properties of marmalade, plant additives of cryogenic origin were used, namely cryopastes from quince, apple, carrot, pumpkin, grapes, and cryopowders from rose hips, sea buckthorn, and grapes. It is shown that the use of plant cryoadditives makes it possible to increase the biological value and antioxidant properties of new types of marmalade. For new types of marmalade with cryoadditives, during its shelf life, these properties have not been studied earlier. However, it should be noted that such studies are necessary and relevant for solving the problem of preserving the quality indicators and antioxidant capacity of marmalade with cryoadditives. New kinds of marmalade have high organoleptic characteristics during the whole storage period. It is shown that the storage conditions of marmalade, according to current regulatory documentation, are suitable for new marmalade products, since the physico-chemical and microbiological indicators vary, but remain within acceptable limits. Thus, the moisture content decreases to almost 31%, the acidity rises by 12-16%, compared to freshly prepared samples. The content of reducing substances increases by 30-64%. It is determined that the value of the antioxidant capacity of all the samples developed is much higher almost 2.3-8 times than the same figure for the control sample. After the storage period, the antioxidant capacity is reduced by 15-35%, but this data also significantly exceeds the antioxidant capacity of the control sample. Storage of marmalade with cryopastes and cryopowders for 90 days is possible, since all the basic physico-chemical, microbiological, and organoleptic indicators at the end of shelf life meet the requirements. Indicators of antioxidant capacity for them also remain at a fairly high level. New technologies of jelly-fruit marmalade with plant cryoadditives have been introduced at 4 enterprises. 2 utility model patents have been received, and regulatory documents have been developed and approved for the manufacture of new jelly products.

AB  - The influence of the environmental conditions during larval development on the resulting recruitment strength was investigated for European sardine (Sardina pilchardus) at Atlanto-Iberian waters. Satellite-derived Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla) data from the previous spawning seasons (January to March/April and October to December of the previous year) were related to recruitment success data in the main recruitment hotspots. Recruitment data was taken from yearly acoustic scientific cruises and from the ICES recruitment index estimated by an age-structured model for the entire stock. A linear discriminant analysis model using SST, Chla, and the abundance of spawners during the spawning season identified years of high and low recruitment for all the recruitment hotspots with an accuracy of >= 79%. In general, high recruitment years were associated with high Chla and low SST, although the most important variables to discriminate between the groups were area-specific. High recruitment years were mostly related to high food availability (Chla), particularly during the last quarter of the previous year. In Western Iberia and in the Gulf of Cadiz, high recruitment years were also associated to lower SST, whereas in the Bay of Biscay, where SST during the winter was generally below the optimal range approximate to 11-12 degrees C for sardine larval development, higher recruitment was associated with high SST. For ICES data of the southern European sardine stock, lower SST and higher Chla during the last quarter of the previous year were associated with high recruitment years and SST alone was able to discriminate between the two recruitment groups with 73% accuracy. Although the time-series of available data are still small, these significant relationships are consistent with field and laboratory studies relating larval growth and mortality with main environmental drivers. These relationships should be further investigated in the following years to evaluate if they can be used to construct reliable indicators to predict the level of recruitment and abundance with sufficient advance to help in the management of this important fishing resource.

AB  - American ginseng, Panax quinquefolius L., is a long-lived medicinal understory herb, which has been heavily harvested since the 1700s. Because of the economic value of the root, and the increasing rarity of this plant, P. quinquefolius is often reintroduced across its range. Land managers and hobby growers recommend using 'associate species' as a way to determine ideal site conditions for reintroduction. However, the accuracy of these putative indicator species in identifying sites that will maximize growth of this rare herb has not been tested. Using a long-term ecological dataset of 26 populations, we evaluated if 20 putative indicators (herbs, shrubs, and trees) could predict P. quinquefolius performance, as measured by the relative growth rate of the leaf area, at the population and microsite level. Of the indicators, only one tree species was able to predict positive performance. If a P. quinquefolius was within 10 m of a Liriodendron tulipifera L., the plant would have increased growth, in terms of leaf area, as compared to plants that were not within 10 m of this tree. Surprisingly, the presence of most putative indicator species was found to be unreliable as a site quality measure. At the population level, four putative indicators, Aralia nudicaulis L., Acer rubrum L., Betula lenta L., and Lindera benzoin (L.) Blume, were actually contra-indicators, as their presence at a site implied lower P. quinquefolius performance. If Podophyllum peltatum L was absent from a site, but B. lenta present, P. quinquefolius had reduced growth as compared to plants present in other combinations of P. peltatum and B. lenta. The results from this study have important implications for in situ conservation strategies of this rare medicinal plant. Planting P. quinquefolius in sites that increase performance can help ensure that reintroduction projects likely have a greater chance of success, effectively reducing the waste of time, money, and resources spent on projects that have lower levels of success.

AB  - In this study, the dispersal of wastes from offshore fish farms was evaluated by analyzing nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta N-15) in macroalgae incubated in the water column at sites located at an increasing distance from the fish cages. Bioassays were performed at three fish farms situated in separate localities with different nutritional conditions (Canary Islands, Murcia and Catalonia) and varying in size, species of fish reared and annual production. Macroalgal bioassays were carried out in two different directions (DI and DII) and they were replicated at each distance in order to evaluate the effect of small-scale variability on the spatial extent of fish farm wastes. The results obtained with delta N-15 contribute to a better understanding of the application of nitrogen stable isotopes ratios in macroalgae as an effective bioindicator for tracing the dispersion of offshore fish farm wastes, and demonstrate that fish farm wastes can be traced even over distances of some km from the pollution source. In the Canary Islands, the maximum distance obtained for detection of fish farm wastes was between 450 and 700 m. Of the three installations studied, Murcia presented the greatest distance for detection of fish farm waste influence, ranging from between 1550 and 2450 m, whilst in Catalonia this distance was less than 120 m. In Catalonia, the results were masked by the influence of other sources of nitrogen, and thus fish farm wastes were detected at more reduced distances than expected. These results confirm that fish farm wastes can be traced using the nitrogen stable isotope ratios of macroalgae and that this method can also be useful for identifying areas of potential risk to some sensitive ecosystems, and as an early signal that changes in the community structure might occur.

AB  - The kinetics of NH4+, the assimilation of NH4+ and nitrate uptake by Catenella nipae (Rhodo-phyta) were compared with Ulva lactuca (Chlorophyta). Both algal species demonstrated saturable NH4+ and nitrate uptake kinetics. Uptake of NH3 by simple diffusion across the plasmalemma could not account for the observed saturation uptake kinetics of ammonia-N (NH3 + NH4+), so NH4+ was the chemical form being taken up by the transport systems of the cells. Although the V, a, of NH4+. uptake by C. nipae and U. lactuca was high (approximate to550 and 450 mumol g(-1) DW h(-1), respectively), the K-m for U. lactuca (approximate to85 muM) was much lower than that for C. nipae (approximate to692 muM). The K-m and V-max values for nitrate uptake were much lower than for NH4+ for both C. nipae (K-m approximate to 5 muM; V-max 8.3 mumol g(-1) DW h(-1)) and U. lactuca (K-m approximate to 34 muM; V-max approximate to 116 mumol g(-1) DW h(-1)). Over the incubation times used (up to 28 min) there was no apparent induction of nitrate transport in either species. There was no evidence for induction of NH4+ transport in C. nipae but incubation time did affect the kinetics of NH4+ uptake in U. lactuca. At high concentrations of NH4+, U. lactuca rapidly assimilated it into organic N with limited build-up of intracellular NH4+ whereas C. nipae accumulated large amounts of NH4+ because uptake of NH4+ overtook the rate of assimilation. The effects of species-specific differences and experimental design on uptake-kinetic estimates are discussed in the light of the results of this other comparable studies. C. nipae is promising as a bioindicator species of the N-status of estuaries but U. lactuca changes its N-status too quickly for it to be a useful bioindicator of environmental conditions.

AB  - Nitrate leaching to streams is a sensitive indicator of the biogeochemical status of forest ecosystems. Two primary theories predicting long-term (decadal) changes in nitrate loss rates (N saturation theory and the nutrient retention hypothesis) both predict increasing dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) losses for watershed 6 (W6), the biogeochemical reference watershed at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF). Measured values, however, have declined substantially since measurements began in the mid-1960s. Are these theories wrong, or are there other important controls on DIN losses at the annual to decadal time scale that have obscured the tendency toward higher losses over time? We tested the individual and combined effects of several forms of disturbance on DIN loss rates from northern hardwood forests by comparing predictions from a relatively simple model of forest carbon, nitrogen, and water dynamics (PnET-CN) with the long-term record of annual DIN loss from W6 at HBEF. Perturbations tested include interannual climate variation, changes in atmospheric chemistry (CO2, O-3, N deposition), and physical and biotic disturbances (two harvests, a hurricane salvage, and a defoliation event). No single disturbance caused changes in DIN losses to mimic measured values. Only when run with all of the disturbances combined did the model-predicted pattern of interannual change in DIN loss approach the measured record. Single-disturbance simulations allow an estimation of the role of each in the total pattern of DIN loss. We conclude that DIN losses from W6 were elevated in the 1960s by a combination of recovery from extreme drought and a significant defoliation event. N deposition alone, in the absence of other disturbances, would have increased DIN losses by 0.35 g N m(-2)y(-1). These findings indicate that predictions of DIN losses must take into account the full spectrum of disturbance events and changes in environmental conditions impacting the systems examined.

AB  - The concept of tipping points and critical transitions helps inform our understanding of the catastrophic effects that global change may have on ecosystems, Earth system components, and the whole Earth system. The search for early warning indicators is ongoing, and spatial self-organization has been interpreted as one such signal. Here, we review how spatial self-organization can aid complex systems to evade tipping points and can therefore be a signal of resilience instead. Evading tipping points through various pathways of spatial pattern formation may be relevant for many ecosystems and Earth system components that hitherto have been identified as tipping prone, including for the entire Earth system. We propose a systematic analysis that may reveal the broad range of conditions under which tipping is evaded and resilience emerges.

AB  - In this article, the results of a piloted flight simulator campaign aimed at measuring biomechanical performance indicators of a helicopter pilot performing complex, realistic tasks are presented. The upper limbs' motion and the activation of the main muscle groups of the left arm were measured during ship-deck landings, performed flying several helicopter configurations with sea conditions of variable intensity. The analysis of the results shows an increase in the muscle activity relative to the increase in task difficulty, in agreement with subjective ratings (Bedford workload scale). The study provides useful indications to improve the corresponding biomechanical simulations, as well as to characterize pilot's performance during specific tasks.

AB  - In many OECD countries, changes in demography and health conditions are putting pressure on public finance. To prevent further expansion of government spending as a percentage of GDP, public spending efficiency will need to be raised. This paper uses data envelopment analysis (DEA) to assess the efficiency of welfare spending (normalized by the working-age population) in a sample of OECD countries around 2012, focussing on health care, secondary education, and general public services. The DEA model has a two input-one output structure, with at least one of the variables representing a composite indicator controlling for country-specific factors (socio-economic environment and lifestyle factors, for example). We find wide dispersion in efficiency measures across OECD countries and provide possible quantified improvements for both output and input efficiency.

AB  - This paper evaluates the investment efficiency of the new energy industry in China and investigates factors that explain variations in investment efficiency across firms and over time. Applying a four-stage semi-parametric DEA analysis framework to a sample of listed new energy firms over the period 2012-2015, we find that the overall investment efficiency of the new energy industry is relatively low, with an average total technical efficiency of 44%, pure technical efficiency of 48%, and scale efficiency of 90%. We also find that new energy firms' investment efficiency is affected by both macroeconomic conditions and firm-specific characteristics. Our results are robust and have significant implications for policy makers and firm managers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All lights reserved.

AB  - Changing climatic conditions have influenced the monsoon pattern in recent years. Variations in bacterial population in one such tropical environment were observed everyday over two years and point out intra and inter annual changes driven by the intensity of rainfall. Vibrio spp. were abundant during the monsoon and so were faecal coliforms. Vibrio alginolyticus were negatively influenced by nitrate, whereas, silicate and rainfall positively influenced Vibrio parahaemolyticus numbers. It is also known that pathogenic bacteria are associated with the plankton. Changes in the abundance of plankton, which are governed mainly by environmental changes, could be responsible for variation in pathogenic bacterial abundance during monsoon, other than the land runoff due to precipitation and influx of fresh water.

AB  - Carbon monoxide is a member of the gasotransmitter family, which also includes NO and H2S, and has been implicated in a variety of pathological and physiological conditions. Whereas exogenous therapeutic additions of CO to tissues and whole animals have been well-studied, the real-time spatial and temporal tracking of CO at the cellular level remains an open challenge. Here we report a new type of turn-on fluorescent probe for selective CO detection based on palladium-mediated carbonylation reactivity. CO Probe 1 (COP-1) is capable of detecting CO both in aqueous buffer and in live cells with high selectivity over a range of biologically relevant reactive small molecules, providing a potentially powerful approach for interrogating its chemistry in biological systems.

AB  - The problem of a thermal explosion in the cylinder has been solved taking into account the natural convection. Both the classical solution of the Frank-Kamenetskii model and a realistic model of a thermal emission which takes into consideration reverse endothermic processes have been considered. It is shown that in this case the solution exists for any value of the energy influx into system. However, under certain conditions a sharp transition into the area of high temperatures still occurs which corresponds to the thermal explosion. It is shown that convection leads to significant change of the parameters of the thermal explosion. The results of this consideration are of interest for the theory of lasers and discharges where the Rayleigh numbers are rather large and the influence of convection appears to be essential.

AB  - Based on > 1500 ICP-MS analyses of REE obtained for 15 years during exploitation of a MONO-SPEC 1000 unit in the Institute of the Lithosphere of the Marginal and Inner Seas, Russian Academy of Sciences, we compared REE contents in the main rock complexes of the Eastern Baltic Shield. Using these analyses, we were able to trace the evolution of REE contents over the geodynamic evolution of the shield. This resulted in increasing variability of REE distribution in rocks and La/Yb ratio in their individual varieties. These regular variations in REE contents can be related to changes in brittleness of the Earth's crust and the whole lithosphere, which increased the penetration depth of faults that participate in the generation of conditions causing shock decompression, which is responsible for partial melting and the abrupt discharge of fluids.

LA  - English
CP  - 220th Meeting of the American-Chemical-Society
AB  - Terrestrial field dissipation studies are useful for determining the rate of dissipation of parent compounds under actual use conditions, providing information on the simultaneous formation and decline of important metabolites, and providing an indication of leaching potential and accumulation of residues in soil. No significant changes to the basic study design currently used by industry are needed to meet these study objectives. Study modules to examine such processes as leaching, volatilization from soil, metabolism and formation of bound residues, and residues in plants can be added when most of the applied material reaches the soil at application. Soil sampling can also be added to studies with foliar applications, but usually obtaining precise soil dissipation rates should not be an objective of such a study. The results of terrestrial field dissipation studies should be used in environmental risk assessments, and study designs should reflect the use of the experimental results in risk assessments.

AB  - Hydroxamate siderophores of virulent Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica strains were purified using a simple large-scale isolation procedure, and identified by various spectroscopic techniques as the macrocyclic dihydroxamate siderophore trivially known as alcaligin, 1,8(S),11,18(S)-tetrahydroxy-1,6,11,16-tetraazacycloeicosane-2,5,12,15-tetrone, which was previously isolated from the taxonomically-related bacterial species Alcaligenes denitrificans subsp, xylosoxydans. Alcaligin purified from iron-depleted cultures of B. pertussis and B. buonchiseptica exhibited specific growth-promoting activity under iron-restricted conditions for Bordetella indicator strains, and were active in [Fe-55]ferric alcaligin transport assays. Evidence suggests that several C-2-symmetric conformations of alcaligin exist simultaneously in both methanolic and aqueous solution.

AB  - The spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) associated with wastewater is a significant environmental concern, but little is known about the persistence and proliferation of these organisms in receiving water bodies after discharge. To address this knowledge gap, we performed a series of microcosm experiments in which river water was amended with either untreated or treated wastewater, and the abundance of viable ciprofloxacin-, Bactrim-, and erythromycin resistant bacteria was monitored for 72 h. Both types of wastewater amendments significantly increased the initial abundance of ARB compared to microcosms containing only river water (all p < 0.03). The increase was greatest with untreated wastewater, but that effect decreased steadily over time. In contrast, microcosms amended with treated wastewater saw a smaller initial increase and more complex temporal dynamics. Following a brief lag, ARB abundance bloomed for all three of the antibiotics that we considered. This suggests that ARB that survive wastewater treatment are particularly hardy and may proliferate in riverine conditions after a short recovery period. To determine how interactions with the native river microbial community impacted the persistence of wastewater associated ARB, an additional set of microcosms was prepared using filter-sterilized river water. Peak abundance in these microcosms was significantly higher by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to microcosms containing an intact river microbial community (all p < 0.05), which suggests that biotic interactions play a significant role in regulating the persistence and proliferation of ARB. The data presented in this paper are among the first available that specifically consider persistence of viable ARB and represent an important step toward understanding AR-related human health risks downstream from wastewater discharge points and following sewer overflow events. Additional studies that consider longer time scales and the interplay of biotic and abiotic variables are essential for modeling public health risks associated with wastewater inputs of ARB to rivers and other aquatic environments.

AB  - This study portrays the dissipation behaviour of the herbicide mixture of clomazone and 2,4-D (clomazone 20% + 2,4-D ethyl ester 30% EC) in a rice field system. The combined formulation is widely used in India as it controls a broad spectrum of weeds, but its fate in tropical environment and the risks involved to the consumer as well as to the environment are still unexplored. Therefore, a supervised field trial was conducted following the post-emergence application of clomazone 20% + 2,4-D ethyl ester 30% EC at recommended (625 g a.i./ha) and double the recommended dose (1250 g a.i./ha) in rice in two consecutive seasons (Kharif and Rabi). The analytical methods for both clomazone and 2,4-D validated as per the SANTE guideline. The residues of clomazone were extracted by the modified QuEChERS method and analysed by GC-MS/MS, whereas the residues 2,4-D were extracted by classical partitioning method and analysed by LC-MS/MS. The recovery percentage of both the compounds ranged between 86-95% with LOQ 0.01 mg/kg for all matrices (rice grain, straw, husk, and field soil). The dissipation of both the compounds followed first-order kinetics. The half-life of clomazone and 2,4-D in soil ranged between 1.06-1.27 days and 4.74-6.24 days, respectively. The residues of clomazone and 2,4-D were below quantification level (BLOQ) in the harvested rice co-products (rice grain, husk and straw) and soil samples. Therefore, it can be summarised that the application of this herbicide mixture in rice cultivation will not pose any residual toxicity and the rice grains are safe for human consumption. Besides, the soil ecological risk assessment indicated that both the compounds possess low risk towards earthworm and soil arthropods. However, there was a concern about soil algal toxicity, which needs to be reconfirmed by further studies to establish a conclusive inference.

AB  - Environmental risk assessment of contaminated soils requires bioindicators that allow the assessment of bioavailability and toxicity of chemicals. Although many bioassays can determine the ecotoxicity of soil samples in the laboratory, few are available and standardized for on-site application. Bioassays based on specific threshold values that assess the in situ and ex situ bioavailability and risk of metal(loid)s and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in soils to the land snail Cantareus aspersus have never been simultaneously applied to the same soils. The aims of this study were to compare the results provided by in situ and ex situ bioassays and to determine their respective importance for environmental risk assessment. The feasibility and reproducibility of the in situ bioassay were assessed using an international ring test. This study used five plots located at a former industrial site and six laboratories participated in the ring test. The results revealed the impact of environmental parameters on the bioavailability of metal(loid)s and PAHs to snails exposed in the field to structured soils and vegetation compared to those exposed under laboratory conditions to soil collected from the same field site (excavated soils). The risk coefficients were generally higher ex situ than in situ, with some exceptions (mainly due to Cd and Mo), which might be explained by the in situ contribution of plants and humus layer as sources of exposure of snails to contaminants and by climatic parameters. The ring test showed good agreement among laboratories, which determined the same levels of risk in most of the plots. Comparison of the bioavailability to land snails and the subsequent risk estimated in situ or ex situ highlighted the complementarity between both approaches in the environmental risk assessment of contaminated soils, namely, to guide decisions on the fate and future use of the sites (e.g., excavation, embankments, and land restoration).

AB  - Soils contaminated with heavy metals (HMs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been becoming a worldwide concerned environmental problem because of threatening public healthy via food chain exposure. Thus soils polluted by HMs and PAHs need to be remediated urgently. Physical and chemical remediation methods usually have some disadvantages, e.g., cost-expensiveness and incomplete removal, easily causing secondary pollution, which are hence not environmental-friendly. Conventional microbial approaches are mostly used to treat a single contaminant in soils and lack high efficiency and specificity for combined contaminants. Genetically engineered microorganisms (GEMs) have emerged as a desired requirement of higher bioremediation efficiency for soils polluted with HMs and PAHs and environmental sustainability, which can provide a more ecofriendly and cost-effective strategy in comparison with some conventional techniques. This review comments the recent advances about successful bioremediation techniques and approaches for soil contaminated with HMs and/or PAHs by GEMs, and discusses some challenges in the simultaneous removal of HMs and PAHs from soil by designing multi-functional genetic engineering microorganisms (MFGEMs), such as improvement of higher efficiency, strict environmental conditions, and possible ecological risks. Also, the modern biotechnological techniques and approaches in improving the ability of microbial enzymes to effectively degrade combined contaminants at a faster rate are introduced, such as reasonable gene editing, metabolic pathway modification, and protoplast fusion. Although MFGEMs are more potent than the native microbes and can quickly adapt to combined contaminants in soils, the ecological risk of MFGEMs needs to be evaluated under a regulatory, safety, or costs benefit-driving system in a way of stratified regulation. Nevertheless, the innovation of genetic engineering to produce MFGEMs should be inspired for the welfare of successful bioremediation for soils contaminated with HMs and PAHs but it must be supervised by the public, authorities, and laws.

   This study analyzed the abundance and diversity of dung beetle communities at several disturbed sites in a tropical dry forest ecosystem in southern Ecuador. Dung beetle community diversity indices with different land uses were related to environmental variables (altitude, temperature), soil physicochemical properties, and food supply (manure). The results indicated that the species Canthon balteatus, Dichotomius problematicus, and Onthophagus confusus are abundant in disturbed sites, where soils are generally more compact and less fertile but contain a greater food supply. These findings can help decision makers to identify disturbed areas and to implement adequate policies for sustainable environmental management.
   This study evaluated the effects of land-use change (L-UCH) on dung beetle community structure (Scarabaeinae) in a disturbed dry ecosystem in southern Ecuador. Five different L-UCH classes were analyzed by capturing the dung beetle species at each site using 120 pitfall traps in total. To determine dung beetle abundance and diversity at each L-UCH, a general linear model (GLM) and a redundancy analysis (RDA) were applied, which correlated environmental and edaphic conditions to the community structure. Furthermore, changes in dung-producing vertebrate fauna were examined, which varied significantly between the different L-UCH classes due to the specific anthropogenic use or level of ecosystem disturbance. The results indicated that soil organic matter, pH, potassium, and phosphorus (RDA: component 1), as well as temperature and altitude (RDA: component 2) significantly affect the abundance of beetles (GLM: p value < 0.001), besides the food availability (dung). The highest abundance and diversity (Simpson's index > 0.4, Shannon-Wiener index > 1.10) was found in highly disturbed sites, where soils were generally more compacted, but with a greater food supply due to the introduced farm animals. At highly disturbed sites, the species Canthon balteatus, Dichotomius problematicus, and Onthphagus confuses were found specifically, which makes them useful as bio-indicators for disturbed dry forest ecosystems in southern Ecuador.

AB  - Soil solution chemistry is influenced by atmospheric deposition of air pollutants, exchange processes with the soil matrix and soil-rhizosphere-plant interactions. In this study we present the results of the long-term Intercantonal Forest Observation Program in Switzerland with soil solution measurements since 1998 on a current total of 47 plots. The forest sites comprise two major forest types of Switzerland including a wide range of ecological gradients such as different nitrogen (N) deposition and soil conditions. The long-term data set of 20 years of soil solution measurements revealed an ongoing, but site-specific soil acidification. In strongly acidified soils (soil pH below 4.2), acidification indicators changed only slowly over the measured period, possibly due to high buffering capacity of the aluminum buffer (pH 4.2-3.8). In contrast, in less acidified sites we observed an increasing acidification rate over time, reflected, for example, by the continuous decrease in the ratio of base cations to aluminum (BC/Al ratio). Nowadays, the main driver of soil acidification is the high rate of N deposition, causing cation losses and hampering sustainable nutrient balances for tree nutrition. Mean nitrate leaching rates for the years 2005-2017 were 9.4 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1), ranging from 0.04 to 53 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1). Three plots with high N input had a remarkable low nitrate leaching. Both N deposition and nitrate leaching have decreased since 2000. However, the latter trend may be partly explained due to increased drought in recent years. Nonetheless, those high N depositions are still affecting the majority of the forest sites. Taken together, this study gives evidence of anthropogenic soil acidification in Swiss forest stands. The underlying long-term measurements of soil solution provides important information on nutrient leaching losses and the impact climate change effects such as droughts. Furthermore, this study improves the understanding of forest management and tree mortality regarding varying nitrate leaching rates.

AB  - Including biodiversity assessments in forest management planning is becoming increasingly important due to the importance of biodiversity for forest ecosystem resilience provision and sustainable functioning. Here we investigated the potential to include biodiversity indicators into forest management planning in Europe. In particular, we aimed to (i) identify biodiversity indicators and data collection methods for biodiversity assessments at the stand and landscape levels, and (ii) evaluate the practicality of those indicators for forest management planning. We performed a literature review in which we screened 188 research studies published between 1990 and 2020. We selected 94 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria and examined in more detail. We considered three aspects of biodiversity: structure, composition, and function, and four forest management categories: unmanaged, managed, plantation, and silvopastoral. We used three criteria to evaluate the practicality of forest biodiversity indicators: cost-effectiveness, ease of application, and time-effectiveness. We identified differences in the practicality of biodiversity indicators for their incorporation into management plans. Stand-level indicators are more practical than landscape-level indicators. Moreover, structural biodiversity indicators (e.g., large trees, canopy openness, and old forest stands) are more useful in management plans than compositional indicators, as these are easily observable by non-professionals and can be obtained by forest inventories. Compositional indicators such are vascular plants, fungi, bryophyte, lichens, and invertebrate species are hard to identify by non-professionals and thus are impractical. Functional indicators (e.g., nutrient cycling) are not sufficiently addressed in the literature. Using recently updated existing databases (e.g., national forest inventories and bird atlases) is very time and cost-efficient. Remote sensing and other technology (e.g., smartphone applications) are promising for efficient data collection in the future. However, more research is needed to make these tools more accurate and applicable to a variety of ecological conditions and scales. Until then, forest stand structural variables derived from inventories can help improve management plans to prepare European forests towards an uncertain future.

AB  - The aim of this work was to highlight the main ecological predictors driving invertebrate distribution in eight glacier-fed streams in the Southern Alps. Thirty-five sites belonging to four stream types were sampled monthly during the ablation season of one, two or three years between 1996 and 2014. Taxa from glacial (kryal and glacio-rhithral) and non-glacial (kreno-rhithral and lake outlet) sites were separated by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) along a glacial influence gradient and a hydrological-altitudinal gradient. High glacial influence was associated mainly with low maximum water temperature (Tmax), high Glacial Index (calculated as a function of glacier area and distance from the glacier), and the abundance of Diamesa species (D. steinboecki, D. goetghebueri, D. zernyi, and D. latitarsis). Change-point analysis and Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis confirmed the CCA results in identifying these Diamesa species as the taxa with the strongest preference for high percent glacier cover in the catchment (change point similar to 30%) and low Tmax (change point similar to 6 degrees C). Temporal changes in community structure were highlighted in seven sites fed by glaciers under different retreat rates. Where the rate was faster and the remaining glacier smaller (<< 1 km(2)), the most cold-stenothermal kryal inhabitant, D. steinboecki, almost disappeared or survived only as brachypterous populations, whereas other Diamesinae (Pseudokiefferiella parva), Orthocladiinae (e.g. Eukiefferiella, Orthocladius), Limoniidae, Baetidae, Nemouridae, and non-insect taxa (e.g. Oligochaeta, Hydracarina) became more abundant. Upstream migration was observed in Diamesa spp. which conquered new stream reaches left free by the retreating glacier, and euriecious taxa which colonized reaches with ameliorated environmental conditions, no longer the exclusive habitat of Diamesa spp. Co-occurrence of stochastic and deterministic assembly processes seem to drive spatio-temporal changes in these invertebrate communities. Long-term ecological studies on the adaptive biology of kryal species will be useful to predict the fate of Alpine biodiversity. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - European farmers are facing challenges that call for important transformations on their agricultural production systems, including an increasing number of regulations aimed at reducing environmental impacts from farming practices. Climate change is also expected to affect agricultural production in most European regions, and in Southern Europe this effect is expected to negatively impact yields. In this study, we present the application of an innovative participatory approach to assess the potential of innovative agricultural systems to reconcile environmental sustainability with economic viability while contributing to local and global food security. Our approach consisted of combining (1) the participation of local stakeholders in the design of narrative scenarios, and (2) an integrated assessment of scenarios through the calculation of indicators at different scale with a bio-economic model. We tested our approach with a case study situated in the Camargue region of Southern France. Rice is currently the main crop in this region, but farmers there face adverse economic conditions linked to the recent reform of European Common Agriculture Policy. After identifying the main drivers of change, local stakeholders developed narrative scenarios and described how farmers would adapt within the context of those changes. These elements were then translated into model inputs. At the regional level, the four scenarios led to variations in farmland acreage (28,000-33,000 ha), as well as the proportion of rice crops (19-75%) and areas cultivated under organic farming standards (8-43%). The four scenarios also led to different values for indicators of agricultural economic welfare, food production, and environmental impacts. Trade-offs between these indicators and the associated objectives assigned to agriculture were identified and discussed with the stakeholders. We end with a discussion of the limitations and advantages of our approach to the participatory development and assessment of locally developed narrative scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Semi-natural grassland habitats have markedly declined from their historical coverage, thus causing substantial losses for agricultural biodiversity and establishing a consequent need to spot the remaining habitat patches. These patches are generally remnants of once larger habitat areas, formed by uninterrupted and low-intensity management for centuries, but then later being isolated and fragmented into smaller pieces. In the light of this development, past landscape phases have a crucial role for the present existence of semi-natural grasslands. The importance of historical factors has been indicated in many studies but evaluation of their added value, or actual site-specific effects compared to observations of only the present landscape characteristics, is not generally provided. As data related to the past is often difficult to obtain, tedious to process and challenging to interpret, assessment of its advantages and related effects - or consequences of potential exclusion - would be needed. In this study, we used maximum entropy approach to model the distribution of Fumewort (Corydalis solida) which in the study area is a good indicator of valuable semi-natural habitats. We constructed three different models - one based on only the contemporary environment with expected indicators of habitat stability, one solely on the historical landscape phases and long-term dynamics, and one combining variables from the past and the present. Predictions of the three models were validated and compared with each other, followed by an analysis indicating the similarity of model results with known Fumewort occurrences. Our results indicate that present landscapes may provide workable surrogates to delineate larger core habitats, but utilization of historical data markedly improves the detection of small outlying patches. These conclusions emphasize the importance of previous landscape phases particularly in detecting Marginal semi-natural grassland habitats, existing in contemporarily suboptimal conditions and being prone to disappear if no further actions are taken.

AB  - There is a great deal of scientific information about the biogeochemical processes in sediments near fish farms and how those processes may be driven under nutrient enrichment to environmental negative effects, as biodiversity decrease is observed in benthic assemblages. Within an adaptive management framework, a good monitoring program can be used to adjust farm management to avert serious and persistent impacts to the sediment. Macrobenthic community represents a good indicator able to detect environmental effects resulting from organic enrichment and, based on this, was selected to monitor Italian marine fish farms. In order to assess the environmental sediment disturbance resulting from marine aquaculture along the Italian coasts three marine fish farms were considered based on their different environmental features: two located in the Tyrrhenian Sea and one in the Adriatic Sea. The selected cage fish farms produce European sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax (L.), gilthead sea-bream Sparus aurata (L.) and meagre Argyrosomus regius (A.) The study ranges from 2001 to 2012, at different times in each fish farm, and was planned according to the fattening cycles. The samples for benthic community analyses were collected by means of a van Veen grab in selected stations located from 0 to 1000 m from the sea cages, the farthest as control stations. In total 134 stations were sampled for more of 20,000 individuals belonging to more than 450 species. Data analyses were performed with statistical methods and biotic indices were calculated. The results showed changes in benthic communities at the stations located just beneath the cages and connected with high cultured biomass. The impacted sites showed loss of biodiversity and increase of opportunistic species such as Capitella Sp. I and Nebalia strausi. Changes in the benthic communities were more or less evident in relation to substrata composition, hydrodynamic conditions and cultured biomass. The observed impact was limited to a few tens of meters around the sea cages of all the three studied fish farms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The performance of stormwater detention tanks with alternative design configurations (insertion in the storm sewer network; volume per impervious hectare) and operating conditions (continuous and intermittent emptying rules) have been evaluated according to an integrated approach. Various performance indices have been adopted to describe the mitigation of the pollution impact to the natural environment, the reduction of the management and maintenance charges for the urban drainage system, the preservation of the normal purification efficiency, and the limitation of the costs at the treatment plant. The US EPA Storm Water Management Model has been used to simulate the rainfall-runoff process and the pollutant dynamics on theoretical catchments and storm sewer networks for an individual event, as well as for a continuous run of events and inter event periods of one year recorded at the rain gauge of Cascina Scala (Pavia, northern Italy). Also the influence of the main characteristics of the urban catchment and the drainage system (area of the catchment and slope of the network) on the performance of alternative design and operating solutions has been examined. Stormwater detention tanks combined with flow regulators demonstrated good performance with respect to environmental pollution: satisfactory performance indicators can be obtained with fairly low flow rates of flow regulators (0.5-1 L/s per hectare of impervious area) and tank volumes of about 35-50 m(3) per impervious hectare. Continuous emptying guaranteed the lowest number and duration of overflows, while an intermittent operation minimised the volume sent for purification reducing the costs and the risks of impairment in the normal treatment efficiency of the plant. Overall, simulation outcomes revealed that the performance indexes are scarcely affected by the area of the catchment and the slope of the drainage network. The result of this study represents a key issue for the implementation of environmental policies in large urban areas. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite a growing attention to the dissolved organic matter (DOM) in terrestrial ecosystems and evidence of the fact that vegetation affects the quality of both undissolved and dissolved organic matter in soil, the role of DOM as a biological indicator is still poorly under stood. In this work, the fertility of 59 sites, divided into eight key alliances of the order Fagetalia sylvaticae Pawl., was studied considering chemical and biological parameters such as soil DOM, hormone-like activity, low-molecular-weight (LMW) aliphatic and phenolic acids, and floristic data.
   Both non-parametric tests and principal component analysis (PCA) revealed differences between silver fir and beech forests and within each type of forest. There were also differences between neutrophilous and acidophilous types. What's more, PCA reveals the dominance of the auxin (IAA)-like activity, and of some phenolic acids in distinguishing the acidophilous beeches (ACI) form the other types, whereas the gibberellin (GA)-like activity is more relevant in neutrophilous conditions such as thermophilous (THE) and mesophilous (MESO) beeches and montane (MO), high montane (HMA), high montane (HMC) silver fir forests. The GA-like activity is also related to the succinic, fumaric, malonic, and L-malic acids in the MO, HMA and HMC silver fir forests. Moreover, the role of LMW aliphatic acids in mobilizing the hormone-like activity, which improves forest growth, is stressed.
   The growth of seedlings of Picea abies was influenced by the phenolic acid content. At concentrations between 1 and 100 mu M, phenylacetic and protocatechuic acids inhibited root growth to the same extent as indoleacetic acid, while p-hydroxybenzoic acid had a stimulating effect comparable to that of gibberellic acid.
   The aliphatic and phenolic acids appear to be related to plant strategies that influence soil fertility affecting plant growth through rhizodeposition. The role of LMW aliphatic and phenolic acids as molecular markers of ecosystem function is noted. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Low-midshore boulder fields in Europe are increasingly subject to degradation related to beach fishing for crabs and abalones. The aim of the study was to better understand the structure and species diversity of macrofaunal assemblages living in a low-midshore boulder field in order to define conservation strategies for this biotope. Sampling strategy involved different spatial scales ('macro-' and 'microstrata') relative to the complexity and heterogeneity of the habitat. Assemblages of species and the corresponding habitats were identified by multifactorial analysis and compared by ANOVAs. The results show a hierarchical organization of the macrofauna within the boulder field, corresponding to three spatial levels of habitat structure: (i) eight 'microhabitats' at the lowest level of spatial organization, each defined by a specific assemblage (subcommunity); (ii) three 'habitats' at a middle level combining these microhabitats, each associated with a specific community (open rock, protected rock and sediment); and (iii) three 'macrohabitats' at the uppermost level (corresponding to the scale of the entire boulder field and including the main geomorphological features of the beach), each defined by a specific assemblage of species (boulders on boulders, boulders on bedrock, and boulders on sediment). Two microhabitats with particularly high species diversity were regarded as the most important ecological units of the field in terms of conservation of specific and functional biodiversity. Comparison of habitat/community parameters showed (i) that habitat heterogeneity was not an accurate indicator of faunal diversity, and (ii) that habitat complexity enhanced the species richness of the fauna, but only above a threshold value. This enhancement was due to semi-sheltered microhabitats, which were found only in the most complex areas of the boulder field. It is likely that this complexity affects species richness qualitatively more than by the diversity of microhabitats. In other words, a cross-scale effect is apparent in which high habitat complexity on the middle spatial scale creates microhabitats on the lowest spatial scale that are characterized by stable semi-sheltered environmental conditions conducive to a maximum of species.

AB  - The Terang-Sirasun Field in the East Java Sea of Indonesia contains 1.0 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of dry gas reserves, which are made up of over 99.5% methane with delta(13)C of -65 parts per thousand and delta D of -185 parts per thousand. The methane was formed exclusively by methanogenic bacteria via the CO2 reduction pathway. The primary source sediments for the methane were identified based on bulk geochemical and absolute biomarker concentrations. Specifically, the C-25 acyclic isoprenoid 2,6,10,15,19-pentamethyleicosane (PME), and related isoprenyl glyceryl ethers, which are well known markers for methanogenic archaebacteria, were used as indicators for sediment layers thought to have had the most abundant methanogen activity. Burial history analysis and precise biostratigraphic age control provided the framework for assessing the timing of hydrocarbon fill. Our findings show that methanogenic activity was highest in marine shelfal claystones (mid-outer neritic) ranging in age from 8 Ma (Late Miocene) to present. The gas is reservoired in limestones and sands of the Paciran Member, which are dated from 6.5 to 1.3 Ma (Late Miocene-Pliocene). The top seal for the present accumulation was deposited less than 0.5 Ma ago (Quaternary), although there is strong geological evidence that older seals existed. These older seals were catastrophically removed by submarine slumping resulting in the loss of earlier accumulated gas. Methanogenesis from older source beds continued, and the trap was recharged after deposition of the current top seal. The information obtained from this held study provides evidence that large accumulations of bacterial methane do not necessarily require early entrapment of methane from Freshly deposited marine sediments. Traps may be filled with bacterial gas long after the deposition of source beds, provided that the required conditions for active methanogenesis are maintained throughout this period.

AB  - Sunlight influences microbial water quality of surface waters. Previous studies have investigated photoinactivation mechanisms and cellular photostress responses of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), including Escherichia coli and enterococci, but further work is needed to characterize photostress responses of bacterial pathogens. Here we investigate the photoinactivation of Staphylococcus aureus (strain Newman), a pigmented, waterborne pathogen of emerging concern. We measured photodecay using standard culture-based assays and cellular membrane integrity and investigated photostress response by measuring the relative number of mRNA transcripts of select oxidative stress, DNA repair, and metabolism genes. Photoinactivation experiments were performed in both oxic and anoxic systems to further investigate the role of oxygen-mediated and non-oxygen-mediated photoinactivation mechanisms. S. aureus lost culturability much faster in oxic systems than in anoxic systems, indicating an important role for oxygen in photodecay mechanisms. S. aureus cell membranes were damaged by sunlight exposure in anoxic systems but not in oxic systems, as measured by cell membrane permeability to propidium iodide. After sunlight exposure, S. aureus increased expression of a gene coding for methionine sulfoxide reductase after 12 h of sunlight exposure in the oxic system and after 6 h of sunlight exposure in the anoxic system, suggesting that methionine sulfoxide reductase is an important enzyme for defense against both oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent photostresses. This research highlights the importance of oxygen in bacterial photoinactivation in environmentally relevant systems and the complexity of the bacterial photostress response with respect to cell structure and transcriptional regulation.
   IMPORTANCE Staphylococcus aureus is a pathogenic bacterium that causes gastrointestinal, respiratory, and skin infections. In severe cases, S. aureus infection can lead to life-threatening diseases, including pneumonia and sepsis. Cases of community-acquired S. aureus infection have been increasing in recent years, pointing to the importance of considering S. aureus transmission pathways outside the hospital environment. Associations have been observed between recreational water contact and staphylococcal skin infections, suggesting that recreational waters may be an important environmental transmission pathway for S. aureus. However, prediction of human health risk in recreational waters is hindered by incomplete knowledge of pathogen sources, fate, and transport in this environment. This study is an in-depth investigation of the inactivation of a representative strain of S. aureus by sunlight exposure, one of the most important factors controlling the fate of microbial contaminants in clear waters, which will improve our ability to predict water quality changes and human health risk in recreational waters.

AB  - Aims Drought significantly impacts ecosystem structure and function, especially the transformation rates of soil carbon and nitrogen. This study explores how drought affects ecosystem respiration (R-e), methane (CH4) uptake and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in temperate desert steppes and the underlying mechanisms. Methods An in-situ experiment was conducted in the Inner Mongolia desert steppe in northern China to study the effect of drought on R-e, CH4 and N2O fluxes. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to establish the relationship between R-e, CH4 uptake and N2O emissions and plant functional traits and environmental factors. Results Ecosystem respiration and CH4 uptake were both significantly reduced by chronic drought (66 % precipitation reduction from 1 May to 31 August) but not by pulse drought (100 % precipitation reduction in June and July). In contrast, no significant impact on N2O emissions was observed under chronic or pulse drought. There were no significant direct effects of soil moisture on R-e, CH4 uptake or N2O emissions. However, soil moisture had an important indirect effect on R-e, CH4 uptake and N2O emissions, mainly through its influence on plant functional traits, plant above-ground biomass and soil nutrients. Plant biomass and soil temperature were the key indicators of R-e, and plant leaf nitrogen content was the key plant trait associated with N2O emissions. In contrast, plant specific leaf area and biomass were the key traits associated with CH4 uptake. Conclusions Overall, R-e and CH4 uptake were reduced by chronic drought in this desert steppe, but there was no significant effect on N2O emissions. Ecosystem respiration, CH4 uptake and N2O emissions were associated with plant functional traits. This provides new insight for the understanding of soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics in desert steppe systems under drought conditions and an important theoretical basis for the revision of model parameters.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Some aphid species are important as pests on plants growing in urban areas. The aim of the study was to determine and compare plant communities and the assemblages of aphids associated with them in different urban park habitats. The study was carried out in Bydgoszcz (northern Poland), and four parks were taken into consideration. We have indicated plant communities and plant species most affected by aphids and the least. for example pear, elderberry, maple and jasmine were among those most affected by aphids, and acacia was not. This should be taken into account for aesthetic reasons when arranging parks. The density of buildings turned out to be the factor that differentiated the most from aphids.
   Some aphid species are important agricultural pests, sometimes also found on plants growing in urban areas. In this work, we set out to identify the plant species, communities or habitats that are more attractive to aphids in order to limit their spread into new green areas. The aim of the study was to determine and compare plant communities and the assemblages of aphids associated with them in different urban park habitats. The research hypothesis assumed that the differences between aphid assemblages depend on plant diversity and hence reflect urban park habitat environmental conditions, in particular the plant communities and the floral structure. The study was carried out in Bydgoszcz (northern Poland), and four parks were taken into consideration. Herein, floristic lists were used to calculate ecological indicator values for each park. The aphid species richness was determined, as well as the relative abundance and dominance structure similarities of the aphid assemblages. Our results demonstrated that Prunus spp. were strongly infested by Hyalopterus pruni, similarly as Philadelphus inodorus by Aphis fabae, Sambucus nigra by Aphis sambuci, and Acer platanoides and A. pseudoplatanus by Periphyllus testudinaceus. Park plantations of Robinia pseudoacacia were not very attractive to aphids. The most attractive plant communities to aphids were syntaxonomically identifiable as alluvial alder forests in the layer of trees and Cornus sanguinea in the layer of shrubs.

AB  - The development of alternative energy is one way to solve the global problem of our time - the energy crisis. Countries in Europe and around the world already have hundreds of thousands of hectares of energy plantations. Ukraine also has significant areas of energy plantations of wood and herbaceous crops. However, there are many environmental issues with the creation of energy plantations. These are soil and climatic conditions and the ecological safety of their cultivation technology. Studies conducted by us on remote by treatment drained organogenic soils of the Supiy River floodplain (Panfilsky Research Station of NSC "Institute of Agriculture NAAS", Ukraine) showed that the plantation cultivation of Giant miscanthus, Almond-leaved willow, Basket willow, Gray willow, and poplar hybrids in 2016-2020, in terms of annual biomass inputs is about 24.9-25.7 tons per 1 ha of dry weight on average. Regarding the safety of cultivation technologies, we have found that under drained old- fallow soils, mineralization of organic matter and accumulation of mobile nitrogen in the active layer of soil under miscanthus plantations and annual crops (267-324 mg per 100 ha of dry soil) is intense, while tree plantations had the lowest indicators (57-120 mg). The content of mobile phosphorus and potassium was highest in tree crop plantations, respectively, 106-172 and 224-462 mg. Their soil content with miscanthus plantations and annual crops were, respectively, 52-66 and 91-171 mg per 100 soil. A significant influence on the content of elements was the process of high total evaporation by tree crop plantations and entering together with capillary water of the bedrock, rich in various mineral compounds, into the active layer of soil. We have found that the creation of wood (willow and poplar) energy plantations on drained old-fallow organogenic soils provides environmentally safe and efficient use, prevents intensive mineralization of the organic mass of peat, and contributes to a significant reduction of pollution of ground and river water by nutrients.

AB  - Corbu I Lake, analyzed between July 24th and 29th , 2019, had a brackish water that from a physicochemical point of view, presented oxygen supersaturation, a high degree of mineralization, a rather alkaline pH and a subunitaly index of water transparency. Also, the water of Corbu I Lake corresponded to a moderate ecological status (III) at the time of taking the surface samples, due to the pointlike and local diffuse anthropogenic influences. From a chemical point of view, the biogenic elements containing nitrogen and phosphorus, sulphates and detergents, were not conforming with the maximum permitted levels specified by the Order No. 161/2006, published in the Official Journal of Romania by the Ministry of Environment and Water Management. Regarding the eutrophication degree, the indicators of total mineral nitrogen and total phosphorus corresponded to the eutro-hypertrophic and, respectively, hypertrophic stages. The N-T (mineral)/P-T ratio ranged between 5.72 and 68.53, indicating the more pronounced incidence of eutrophication in this lake, which also had a high content of organic matter (>20 mg/l), due to the zonal diffuse sources of pollution. The ecological status of the studied aquatic environment was from good to weak classes for nitrites, ammonium and phosphates, moderate for sulphates and weak for detergents. It had a low content of silica, as well as anaerobic fermentation products (H2S and S2-) that were undetectable and quantitatively insignificant. The granulometry of the bottom-sediment samples of Corbu I Lake has identified muds, with the clay fraction subordinated to the silt. Due to the accumulated and decomposed biogenic material, black and unctuous muds with a specific odor were found. The interpretation of the data resulting from the grain size analysis highlighted the deposition of the sediments by suspensions in calm water with poor circulation, a different and poorly sorting and an excess of fine clastic material.

AB  - An increasing number of studies have suggested a more important role of precipitation during specific segments of the year than annual amount in determining the aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP). In semi-arid grasslands of China, highly irregular distribution and intensity of precipitation supply induced by current climate changes often causes soil drought or water pulses in spring when plants are at their early growing stage. Here we tested the impact of spring precipitation supply on plant growth and nutrient uptakes, as well as dynamics of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) in soil microbial biomass (MB) and abiotic labile forms over the growing season in a semi-arid grassland of China. We conducted a spring rainfall-simulating experiment by manual watering (using drought plots as control) under field conditions from late April to May, and started sampling monthly from June to October. The results clearly showed that spring watering increased ANPP and microbial biomass C (MBC), and these effects were consistent throughout the entire growing season. Treatment effects can be detected in soil microbial biomass but not in abiotic labile pools. Throughout the growing season, soil water content and N availabilities were the main factors controlling soil microbial dynamics across treatments. Nevertheless, markedly higher microbial biomass P (MBP) and lower MB C:P ratio were observed in watering plots in September when plant P uptake had dropped down in watering plots but still kept increasing in drought plots. This suggested a delay of phenological period of plants induced by spring drought and P competition existing between plants and microorganisms. Overall, the present work highlights the importance of spring precipitation and provides implications for understanding current and future ANPP variations. In addition, we suggest to use MBC as a good soil indicator for soil fertility and plant productivity under changing seasonal precipitation patterns.

AB  - After dredging of contaminated sediment, additional remediation technique is required before its final disposal. For this purpose, this research was based on the long-term stabilization/solidification (S/S) process of highly contaminated sediment (dominantly by heavy metals) from a European environmental hot spot, the Great Batka Canal. Due to optimisation of remediation techniques, this sediment is treated with selected immobilization agents: kaolinite, quicklime and Portland cement. The use of pseudo-total metal content (selected priority substances: Cr, Ni, Cu, Cd, Zn, Pb and As) in untreated sediment, determined that sediment urgently requires remediation. Short-term (after 7 and 28 days) and long-term (after 7 years) monitoring were done in order to estimate the concentrations of metals and effect on biota from S/S mixtures during this processes.
   The environmental risk assessment encompassed the application of several appropriate analytical methods: the pseudo-total metal content, the German standard leaching test - DIN 3841-4 S-4 and Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure -TCLP test leaching tests and sequential extraction procedure (BCR) on S/S mixtures, testing the aging process and toxicity effects. After simulating real environmental conditions using all tests in all three mixtures, metals do not exceed the prescribed limit values and as such S/S mixtures are classified as nonhazardous waste. Sequential extraction procedure showed that the highest percentage of metals are in the residual phase, bound to silicates and crystalline structure. After 7 years of S/S mixture aging, kaolinite showed the highest binding capacity that was reflected in the content of metals in the residual phase (34.8% of Ni to 77.6% of Cr). DIN and TCLP leaching tests confirmed that the exchangeable phase has a minor effect on the environment. Accordingly, this remediation technology could be well applied for final disposal of this and similar extremely contaminated sediment dominantly with inorganic pollutants. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rivers provide numerous ecological and cultural services for humans and wildlife that are vulnerable to increasing demands for freshwater and renewable energy production. Run-of-river (RoR) dams are becoming a common energy production alternative on coastal mountain streams throughout the world, but their ecological impacts remain poorly understood. A well-described indicator of water quality sharing steep mountain stream habitat with RoR developments, the American dipper (Cinclus mexicanus) river bird is an ideal species for studying potential eco-hydrological impacts of RoR dams. We monitored American dipper populations over two years at stream sites with and without RoR dams across three watersheds in coastal British Columbia, Canada. We found that dippers selected regulated streams across seasons, with the headpond and diversion reach frequently used for foraging. Regulated streams also had higher dipper densities in the slow-flowing habitats, a higher occupancy rate of banded dippers, a higher rate of confirmed year-round residents, and a greater proportion of adults; however, fewer hatch-year dippers were recorded on regulated streams, which may indicate lower reproductive potential or juvenile survival. RoR reaches modified by flow abstraction may offer an opportunity for altitudinal migrant dippers to exploit a consistent food resource closer to their high elevation breeding territory, enabling them to take on a "resident strategy" that is more typical of low elevation river habitats. However, the long-term consequences of year-round occupancy and foraging in headponds requires further investigation, as it could have positive or negative impacts on dippers and their associated foodweb. Collectively, our data suggest that high elevation, RoR-regulated streams provide stable year-round habitat for the American dipper and that presence and density of this species can be used to accurately track changes in stream flow and condition following dam installation.

AB  - Electricity generated by solar Photovoltaic (PV) power systems is emerging as one of the most promising cleaner alternatives to replace conventional energy sources, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. This study examines managerial sources of operational efficiency or inefficiency on 855 large commercial rooftop PV power systems in California by examining both scale efficiency and Returns to Scale (RTS). For the research purpose, this study utilizes Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) as a methodology to assess the scale measures. A difficulty in applying DEA to the performance analysis of PV power systems is that it contains uncontrollable variables such as ambient temperature and solar irradiation, all of which are influenced by weather. It is also widely known that PV power systems cannot produce electricity during night, so being unable to serve as a base load. Thus, these uncontrollable factors often influence the performance of PV power systems. Paying attention to the effects of those uncontrollable factors, this study discusses how to measure scale efficiency and RTS within the framework of DEA. Then, as an application of the proposed approach, this study examines the performance of large commercial rooftop PV power systems in California. This study finds that they belong to increasing (48), constant (807) and decreasing (0) RTS, implying that most of the PV power systems in California have been operating in their appropriate sizes. This further indicates that the operational inefficiency of PV power systems is due to managerial inappropriateness, not their sizes for generation. Thus, there is a space to improve operational efficiency of rooftop PV systems under constant RTS, through managerial efforts such as increase in transmission capacity and operational flexibility to improve solar penetration, and routine maintenance to minimize detrimental effects of dust deposition.

AB  - Chemical prroducts used in farming and wastes from livestock can contaminate pond water in agroecosystems due to runoff. Amphibians using these ponds for breeding are probably exposed to pollutants, and serious consequences might be observed afterward at the population level. Assessment biological endpoints of anuran to water quality give a realistic estimate of the probability of occurrence of adverse effects and provide an early warning signal. In this study, the ecotoxicity of agroecosystem ponds from the south of Cordoba province, Argentina, was investigated. Ponds in four sites with different degrees of human disturbance were selected: three agroecosystems (A1, A2, A3) and a site without crops or livestock (SM). The effect of pond water quality on the biological endpoint of Rhinella arenarum tadpoles was examined using microcosms with pond water from sites. Biological endpoints assessed were as follows: mortality, growth, development, morphological abnormalities (in body shape, gut, and labial tooth row formula), behavior, and blood cell parameters (micronucleus and nuclear abnormalities). Results indicated that water from agroecosystems has adverse effect on early life stage of R. arenarum. High mortality and fewer metamorphs were recorded in the A1 and A3 treatments. Tadpoles and metamorphs from A1 and A2 treatments had lower body condition. Tadpoles from A1 and A3 showed the highest prevalence of morphological abnormalities. The lowest amount of tadpoles feeding and the highest percentage of tadpoles swimming on the surface were observed in treatments with agroecosystem pond water. The higher frequencies of micronuclei and nuclear abnormalities were recorded in tadpoles from A1, A2, and A3 treatments. We check the sensitivity of the biological endpoints of R. arenarum tadpoles like early warning indicators of water quality. We found that the poor water quality of agroecosystem ponds has impact on the health of the tadpoles, and this could affect the persistence of populations. We recommend implementation of management actions before the harmful effects of agroecosystem pond water on early life stage of anuran become evident in higher ecological levels.

AB  - Flow diversions are widespread and numerous throughout the semi-arid mountains of the western United States. Diversions vary greatly in their structure and ability to divert water, but can alter the magnitude and duration of base and peak flows, depending upon their size and management. Channel geometry and riparian plant communities have adapted to unique hydrologic and geomorphic conditions existing in the areas subject to fluvial processes. We use geomorphic and vegetation data from low-gradient (3%) streams in the Rocky Mountains of north-central Colorado to assess potential effects of diversion. Data were collected at 37 reaches, including 16 paired upstream and downstream reaches and five unpaired reaches. Channel geometry data were derived from surveys of bankfull channel dimensions and substrate. Vegetation was sampled using a line-point intercept method along transects oriented perpendicular to the channel, with a total of 100 sampling points per reach. Elevation above and distance from the channel were measured at each vegetation sampling point to analyze differences in lateral and vertical zonation of plant communities between upstream and downstream reaches. Geomorphic data were analyzed using mixed effects models. Bankfull width, depth, and cross-sectional area decreased downstream from diversions. Vegetation data were analyzed using biological diversity metrics, richness, evenness and diversity, as well as multivariate community analysis. Evenness increased downstream from diversions, through reduced frequency of wetland indicator species and increased frequency of upland indicator species. Probability of occurrence for upland species downstream of a diversion increases at a greater rate beginning around 05m above active channel. The results suggest that channel morphology and riparian plant communities along low-gradient reaches in montane environments in the Colorado Rocky Mountains are impacted by diversion-induced flow alteration, with the net effect of simplifying and narrowing the channel and homogenizing and terrestrializing riparian plant communities.

AB  - River channelization and the construction of high-head storage schemes have been the basis of agricultural and socio-economic development in many alpine regions. One example is the Upper-Rhone River in Switzerland. The Upper-Rhone's morphology changed considerably between 1863 and 1960 as a result of two major channelizations and, from 1950 on, the construction of a large number of high-head storage hydropower schemes in the catchment. These modifications have brought large benefits to the local population, at the cost, however, of substantial disturbances in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in and along the river. A primary factor behind these disturbances is the alteration of the natural flow regime, namely hydropeaking due to the operation of the high-head storage hydropower plants. For sustainable river-restoration projects on regulated rivers, scientists and engineers now widely accept the necessity of integrated management of the river. Different aspects such as river morphology, sediment management, water quality, temperature, and the naturally variable flow regime should be considered simultaneously. Mitigation of non-natural, sub-daily flow fluctuations due to hydropeaking is a crucial step in restoring natural flow regimes, but is especially challenging due to the economic constraints such mitigation places upon hydropower plants. With the goal of addressing this challenge, this paper proposes three indicators to describe the flow regime of rivers in alpine catchments with and without high-head storage hydropower plants. The indicators quantify: (1) the seasonal distribution and transfer of water, (2) sub-daily flow fluctuations, and (3) the intensity and frequency of flow changes. Indicators are evaluated in a case study of the Upper-Rhone River for pre- and post-impact situations, and the benefit of a multipurpose project reducing hydropeaking on hydrologic conditions is quantified. Furthermore, the paper explores the possibility of using these indicators to link aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem well being to their hydrology.

AB  - Recreational water quality at beaches in California and elsewhere is often poor near the outlets of rivers, estuaries, and lagoons. This condition has prompted interest in the role of wetlands in modulating surface water concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), the basis of water quality standards internationally. A model was developed and applied to predict the dry-weather tidal cycling of FIB in Talbert Marsh, an estuarine, intertidal wetland in Huntington Beach, California, in response to loads from urban runoff, bird feces, and resuspended sediments. The model predicts the advection, dispersion and die-off of total coliform, Escherichia coli, and enterococci using a depth-integrated formulation. We find that urban runoff and resuspension of contaminated wetland sediments are responsible for surface water concentrations of FIB in the wetland. Model predictions show that urban runoff controls surface water concentrations at inland sites and sediment resuspension controls surface water concentrations near the mouth. Direct wash-off of bird feces into the surface water is not a significant contributor, although bird feces can contribute to the sediment bacteria load. The key parameters needed to accurately predict FIB concentrations, using a validated hydrodynamic model, are: the load due to urban runoff, sediment erodibility parameters, and sediment concentrations and surface water die-off rates of enteric bacteria. In the present study, literature values for sediment erodibility and water column die-off rates are used and average concentrations of FIB are predicted within 1/2 log unit of measurements. Total coliform are predicted more accurately than E coli or enterococci, both in terms of magnitude and tidal variability. Since wetland-dependent animals are natural sources of FIB, and FIB survive for long periods of time and may multiply in wetland sediments, these results highlight limitations of FIB as indicators of human fecal pollution in and near wetlands.

AB  - In many parts of the foothills of the Orinoquia region of Colombia, cattle production takes place on poorly drained soils. The region is dominated by extensive grazing systems of Brachiaira humidicola cv. Humidicola, a grass with high adaptation potential under temporal waterlogging conditions. Inadequate management practices and low soil fertility result in degradation, however, with important negative effects on pasture productivity and the quality and provision of (soil) ecosystem services-a situation that is likely to worsen in the near future due to climate change. Against this background, AGROSAVIA (Corporacion Colombiana de Investigacion Agropecuaria) selected Arachis pintoi CIAT 22160 cv. Centauro (Centauro) as a promising alternative for the sustainable intensification of livestock production and rehabilitation of degraded areas. This study assesses dual-purpose milk production in the foothills of the Colombian Orinoquia from an economic perspective. We compare two production systems: the Centauro-Brachiaira humidicola cv. Humidicola association (new system) and Brachiaira humidicola cv. Humidicola as a monoculture (traditional system). We used cashflow and risk assessment models to estimate economic indicators. The projections for economic returns consider changes in forage characteristics under regional climate change scenarios RCP (2.6, 8.5). The LIFE-SIM model was used to simulate dairy production. Results show that the inclusion of Centauro has the potential to increase animal productivity and profitability under different market scenarios. The impact of climatic variables on forage production is considerable in both climate change scenarios. Both total area and potential distribution of Centauro could change, and biomass production could decline. Brachiaira humidicola cv. Humidicola showed better persistence due to higher nitrogen levels in soil when grown in association with Centauro. The legume also provides a number of ecosystem services, such as improving soil structure and composition, and also contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This helps to improve the adaptation and mitigation capacity of the system.

AB  - Long chain alkyl diols (LCDs) in marine environments are useful indicators of source organisms, ambient temperature, upwelling and nutrient conditions. However, the distribution of LCDs in the western Pacific marginal seas has been rarely reported, where wide shallow continental shelves and huge freshwater input from many rivers occur. In this study, we analyzed LCDs in surface sediments distributed from the Changjiang River estuary (CRE) to the East China Sea shelf to evaluate their sources and associated environmental proxies. Our results showed that the fractional abundance of C-32 1,15-diol (F-C32 1,15(-diol)) was highest in coastal area close to the CRE, with F-C32 1,15(-diol) > 15% implying significant freshwater input. The C-28 and C-30 1,13-diols showed a similar spatial distribution to the C-32 1,15-diol, suggesting that the long chain diol index (LDI), a sea surface temperature (SST) proxy, may be biased by freshwater-derived diols. By excluding the freshwater-influenced samples (i.e., F-C32 1,15(-diol) > 15%), LDI reflected the autumn SST, yielding minimum temperature residuals (0.2 +/- 1.5 degrees C). The C-28, C-30 and C-30:1 1,14-diols were abundant in the mid-depth (15-45 m) offshore environment that was affected only slightly by the Changjiang River plume, and decreased toward both the eutrophic estuarine and oligotrophic marine environments; whereas the C-28:1 1,14-diol showed higher fractional abundances close to the CE. The spatial distribution of 1,14-diols is similar to that reported for Proboscia diatoms in this region, although the exact sources of 1,14-diol requires further study. Nutrient proxies based on 1,14-diols did not correlate well with nutrient concentrations in this river-dominated marginal sea, where nutrient supply is dominated by the Changjiang River input.

AB  - Changes in the soil quality of urban areas is a critical issue emerging from urban expansion, soil compaction, and other anthropogenic exercises. The evaluation of urban soil quality (USQ) is helpful in landscape and urban planning projects. The present study employed the following USQ models-Cornell Soil Health Test (CSHT) and the Improved Soil Environmental Quality Evaluation (ISEQE) for urban management and planning-to assess USQ in the forest, local, and riverside parks of Ahvaz situated in a saline groundwater area of Iran. The ISEQE model was developed in light of the improvement of the Soil Environmental Quality Evaluation (SEQE) model under the environmental conditions of this area. In this manner, salinity, sodium absorption ratio, compaction, soil structure, and water quality factors were added to SEQE. The parameters of these models were determined on the basis of lab experiments or pedotransfer functions. As indicated by CSHT, average overall quality scores among indicator types in all parks were physical < chemical < biological. Moreover, average overall quality scores among park types were local parks > riverside parks > forest parks, which is believed to be connected with lower aggregate stability, lower water storage capacity, and higher soil hardness due to foot traffic, compaction, and lower organic matter. On the other hand, USQ determined by ISEQE models was in various orders: forest parks > local parks > riverside parks. Differences in the assessment of USQ between CSHT and ISEQE models refer to the selected indices in relation to urban environmental pollution factors for assessing USQ in the ISEQE model. Therefore, soils receiving pollutants will be of a lower quality. In this study, the USQ of the local parks with higher vegetation cover was less than that of the forest park as a result of high concentrations of heavy metals in the local parks. In light of field observation, the ISEQE model was the most effective model to assess USQ. Consequently, the ISEQE model can be helpful in determining USQ for green space management in Ahvaz.

AB  - At the mouth of the Amazon River, a widespread carbonate ecosystem exists below the river plume, generating a hard-bottom reef (similar to 9500 km(2)) that includes mainly large sponges but also rhodolith beds. The mesozooplankton associated with the pelagic realm over the reef formation was characterized, considering the estuarine plume and oceanic influence. Vertical hauls were carried out using a standard plankton net with 200 mu m mesh size during September 2014. An indicator index was applied to express species importance as ecological indicators in community. Information on functional traits was gathered for the most abundant copepod species. Overall, 179 zooplankton taxa were recorded. Copepods were the richest (92 species), most diverse and most abundant group, whereas meroplankton were rare and less abundant. Species diversity (> 3.0 bits.ind(-1)) and evenness (> 0.6) were high, indicating a complex community. Small holoplanktonic species dominated the zooplankton, and the total density varied from 107.98 ind.m(-3) over the reef area to 2,609.24 ind.m(-3) in the estuarine plume, with a significant difference between coastal and oceanic areas. The most abundant copepods were the coastal species Oithona plumifera and Clausocalanus furcatus and early stages copepodites of Paracalanidae. The holoplanktonic Oikopleura, an important producer of mucous houses, was very abundant on the reefs. The indicator species index revealed three groups: (1) indicative of coastal waters under the influence of the estuarine plume [Euterpina acutifrons, Parvocalanus crassirostris, Oikopleura (Vexillaria) dioica and Hydromedusae]; (2) characterized coastal and oceanic conditions (Clausocalanus); (3) characterized the reef system (O. plumifera). Two major copepods functional groups were identified and sorted according to their trophic strategy and coastal-oceanic distribution. The species that dominated the coastal area and the area over the rhodolith beds are indicators of the estuarine plume and are mixed with species of the North Brazil Current. These species practically disappear offshore, where occur

AB  - The International Wellbeing Index covers two complementary measures, the Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI) and the National Wellbeing Index (NWI). The focus group study reported here tested the understanding of the NWI when translated into isiXhosa, a language spoken by 6 million South Africans, or 16% of the country's population. A challenge for the NWI in measuring national well-being is the tendency for meaning to get 'lost in translation' in the wording of the instrument, owing to the disparities that exist between levels of living in developed and developing nations. The focussed discussions with native isiXhosa speakers conveyed the different shades of meaning associated with the six domains that make up the NWI. The isiXhosa keywords for the domains of social conditions, the natural environment, national security, and management of the country's affairs (government) were readily understood, but discussants asked for further clarification of keywords for the domains relating to the economy and business. Conversations showed up the close link between personal and national well-being: discussants drew upon their personal and parochial life experiences along with their knowledge of current affairs to evaluate the nation's quality of life. They described the social contract between citizens and their government to create a 'caring society' that promotes well-being across key domains of national life. Many of the reference standards used to evaluate national well-being were ones postulated to influence personal well-being (Michalos A.C, Social Indicators Research 16(4): 347-413 1985 ). The study also pointed to a potential problem for longitudinal studies if the bipolar satisfaction scale, formerly used to measure the International Wellbeing Index's PWI and NWI, is changed to a unipolar one. Findings from this pilot study confirm the potential of the NWI as a tool for measuring national well-being cross-culturally.

AB  - Questions: Do ferns, which are physiologically less well adapted to conserve water than angiosperms but have more efficient propagule dispersal, show different vegetation-environment relationships than co-occurring angiosperm herbs? We hypothesized that ferns should show closer relationships to local environmental conditions and might be more closely associated with humid and shady microhabitats.
   Location: Pono and Bariri, two sites in lower montane primary tropical forest, Lore Lindu National Park, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia.
   Methods: At each site, all terrestrial herbaceous plants were sampled in 200 plots of 5 m 9 5 m. Sixteen environmental factors describing soils, topography and canopy openness were recorded. Correlations were calculated to test the degree of similarity in the species richness and turnover of ferns and angiosperms, and their relationships with environmental factors. Species optima were calculated on each environmental axis and compared between plant groups via randomization tests.
   Results: In total, 184 herb morphospecies were encountered at Pono and 135 at Bariri, of which almost 60% at each site were ferns. At both sites, fern species turnover showed closer correlations with soil variables than did angiosperm turnover. At the more topographically heterogeneous site (Bariri) fern species turnover was also more closely associated with topographic differences than was angiosperm turnover. Habitat preferences of ferns and angiosperms appeared more similar at Bariri than Pono, with both tending towards lower topographic positions and richer soils, but steeper slopes, than expected at random. At Bariri, neither plant group tended towards shady microsites, whereas at Pono ferns were better represented than angiosperms in microhabitats with open canopies.
   Conclusions: As expected, ferns showed closer correlations with environmental factors than angiosperm herbs. Ferns did not, however, consistently favour humid microhabitats at both sites, and were not significantly associated with shady microhabitats at either site. Furthermore, it appears that physiological differences in water use do not lead to marked divergence in fern and angiosperm herb distributions in the humid understorey of this lower montane rainforest.

AB  - Norway spruce (Picea abies) is one of the most widespread and economically valuable tree species in Europe, however recently it has been experiencing a large-scale decline. In the western Carpathians, particularly forests in the Beskids Mountains have recorded the most extensive health decline ever documented. Climate change during the last several decades has had a significant impact on the functioning of these forest ecosystems. To contribute to the debate on the causes of the spruce decline we conducted a dendroecological study in the Beskids Mountains. A large sample of ring-width series were collected along a transect spanning the large range of ecological conditions in the region. Non-metric multidimensional scaling was used to identify structural similarities between spruce trees in terms of their response to climate variation and to identify the most relevant site- and stand-related variables. Cluster analysis was applied to identify relevant groups of trees. Step-wise linear regression was used to build climate-growth models for chronologies in the clusters. A shifting correlation in 20-year moving segments was used to identify temporal change in spruce climate-growth relationships. Results show that needle loss significantly changed the character of the response when trees with different intensity of defoliation, growing at the same altitude, responded oppositely to the mean summer temperature. In addition, we observe shifts in the climate-growth relationships of spruce trees to spring and summer temperatures when the relationship of trees without or with low defoliation started to decline between 1990 and 1998. This deterioration indicates three hypotheses: (i) climate change; (ii) trees that were considered healthy when observed might have started to decline, and this will be visually detectable in the near future; and (iii) rapid reduction of emissions in interaction with the recent climate change.

AB  - The analysis of the systematic transitions in the forested landscape and the study of the forest fragmentation patterns allow us to deepen our understanding of the changes in the vegetation ground cover. The importance of knowing the intricate patterns of the land usage of the upper basin of the Amazon region is widely recognized. This zone is one of the most diverse biological areas in the world, is home to large areas of mature tropical cloud forest and demonstrates high probabilities of stable climatic conditions in light of global warming. The research quantified systematic transitions through the "loss" and 'gain of the different categories of landscape during the eighteen-year study period of the Ecuadorian Amazon Region (EAR), the forest fragmentation patterns were also analyzed based on a set of indicators. Therefore, with respect to the entirety of the landscape, the results registered for the ground coverage in forested areas during the first period (1990-2000), show a decrease of 6.99% and an increase of 0.68%; and during the second period (2000-2008), show a decrease of 3.99% and an increase of 2.14%. It demonstrated that forest and agricultural areas tended to replace or be replaced by herbaceous vegetation faster than expected fortuitously. Finally, the indices of fragmentation signaled intense changes during the 1990-2000 period with a reduction during the period 2000-2008. Percentages registered in the Largest Patch Index (LPI) were between 79.58%; 52.39% and 49.99% respectively; while the Patch Density (PD) varied between 0.04; 0.06 and 0.07. This suggests the propensity of forest cover to remain intact. The results of this investigation suggest a tendency towards stability in Ecuador's Amazon landscape. Within the framework for development and management of this area, the tendency is natural regeneration. This permits a consolidation of the conservation, reforestation, forestation and agricultural forestry plans, programs and systems for the protected areas in EAR.

AB  - Aim In response to environmental changes and to avoid extinction, species may either track suitable environmental conditions or adapt to the modified environment. However, whether and how species adapt to environmental changes remains unclear. By focusing on the realized niche (i.e. the actual space that a species inhabits and the resources it can access as a result of limiting biotic factors present in its habitat), we here examine shifts in the realized-niche width (i.e. ecological amplitude) and position (i.e. ecological optimum) of 26 common and widespread forest understorey plants across their distributional ranges.
   Location Temperate forests along a ca. 1800-km-long latitudinal gradient from northern France to central Sweden and Estonia.
   Methods We derived species' realized-niche width from a -diversity metric, which increases if the focal species co-occurs with more species. Based on the concept that species' scores in a detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) represent the locations of their realized-niche positions, we developed a novel approach to run species-specific DCAs allowing the focal species to shift its realized-niche position along the studied latitudinal gradient while the realized-niche positions of other species were held constant.
   Results None of the 26 species maintained both their realized-niche width and position along the latitudinal gradient. Few species (9 of 26: 35%) shifted their realized-niche width, but all shifted their realized-niche position. With increasing latitude, most species (22 of 26: 85%) shifted their realized-niche position for soil nutrients and pH towards nutrient-poorer and more acidic soils.
   Main conclusions Forest understorey plants shifted their realized niche along the latitudinal gradient, suggesting local adaptation and/or plasticity. This macroecological pattern casts doubt on the idea that the realized niche is stable in space and time, which is a key assumption of species distribution models used to predict the future of biodiversity, hence raising concern about predicted extinction rates.

AB  - Interannual changes in abundance of the autumn cohort of neon flying squid Ommastraphes bartramii during 1979 to 2006 were examined in relation to the large-scale climate shift in the central North Pacific Ocean. Catch per unit of effort (CPUE) of driftnet surveys, which is assumed to reflect the squid stock level, was very low during 1999 to 2002, which was an anomalous climate period. Given that the autumn cohort uses productive areas near and north of the transition zone chlorophyll front (TZCF) as favorable nursery and feeding grounds, we examined 3 covariates-(1) the winter position of the TZCF in the neon flying squid nursery ground, (2) the summer position of the TZCF in the feeding ground and (3) fishing mortality-to estimate which covariates were significantly correlated with low CPUE time periods. Multiple linear regression analysis suggested that only the effect of winter position of the TZCF in the nursery ground best predicted the change in the CPUE. The anomalous climate conditions caused a significant reduction in net primary production over an extended area within the subtropical frontal zone (STFZ), which is the main nursery ground for the autumn cohort. Hence, we assume that food availability for juvenile neon flying squid could be critical for the level of stock recruitment of this cohort. Furthermore, the sea level anomaly (SLA), which is considered to be a useful index of variability in the upper ocean structure, significantly correlated to the CPUE during spawning and nursery periods in the STFZ. Our study supports the hypothesis that the bottom-up effect of the climate shift can be manifested rapidly in neon flying squid, indicating that squid abundance can act as a productivity integrator and a real-time ecosystem indicator that respond to large-scale environment changes.

AB  - A substantial amount of global carbon is stored in mature trees. However, no experiments to date test how warming affects mature tree carbon storage. Using a unique, citywide, factorial experiment, we investigated how warming and insect herbivory affected physiological function and carbon sequestration (carbon stored per year) of mature trees. Urban warming increased herbivorous arthropod abundance on trees, but these herbivores had negligible effects on tree carbon sequestration. Instead, urban warming was associated with an estimated 12% loss of carbon sequestration, in part because photosynthesis was reduced at hotter sites. Ecosystem service assessments that do not consider urban conditions may overestimate urban tree carbon storage. Because urban and global warming are becoming more intense, our results suggest that urban trees will sequester even less carbon in the future.

AB  - This paper describes specimens of Pediastrum argentinense-type in Late Quaternary sediments, focusing on their morphological variability and stressing their value for palaeobotanical studies. Although the taxon strongly resembles P. argentinense Bourrelly et Tell in Tell, known only from South America, some morphological differences between P. argentinense and P. argentinense-type lead to the conclusion that we are dealing with a separate taxon provisionally named P. aigentinense-type. To make its taxonomic position clear, there is a need for detailed morphological observations of living specimens and molecular analyses. This taxon was found in sections spanning the entire Late Glacial and Holocene periods across Central Europe. Its affinity to sediments originating in shallow and strongly overgrown water bodies makes it a good indicator of such conditions in past environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This work examines four essentially different and widely established methods for the treatment of sewage sludge and determines the applicability of each one of them in the economical, geographical and environmental settings of the island of Crete in Greece. Under these conditions, the combination of lime stabilization and solar drying appears to be the optimum solution for sewage sludge management. For each of the treatment technologies considered, cost indicator spreadsheets were developed that enabled the automatic calculation of the total cost. The cost of the lime stabilization-soar drying combined treatment is comparable to the cost of composting or thermal drying alone. The judgment criteria and the economical parameters used for the evaluation of the methods may be a useful tool for other wastewater treatment plants in various Mediterranean islands.

AB  - The study presents habitat and phytosociological analyses of the Chara intermedia phytocenoses, rare described in Europe. 16 physico-chemical water parameters were analysed, coming from the samples taken in 20 phytocenoses of 13 lakes located in western Poland. The analysed community appeared in naturally shallow lakes representing last stages of the disappearance of glacial water basins. The study attempts to estimate the bioindicative value of the charophyta meadow Charetum intermediae in relation to its habitat. A particular attention has been paid to the determination of the habitat trophic condition, and to the concentration of elements connected with the hardness of water and the content of humic substances. The study shows crucial habitat gradients of the C. intermediae association, taking into account also the species composition of phytocenoses.

AB  - Maximum entropy method (MEM) was used for resolving multiple decay components in synthetic and experimental time-resolved fluorescence decay. The distribution of lifetimes is unimodal or multimodal and there is a one-to-one correspondence between the results of MEM and discrete exponential analysis. The distribution is symmetric in log(tau) space and approximately Gaussian. The width of the distribution is sensitive to several factors related to the experimental or analysis conditions, such as the peak count, discretization in tau space, completeness of decay and the chi(2) stopping criterion. Therefore, the width of the distribution cannot be a useful indicator of the extent of heterogeneity of lifetimes in a sample of a complex biological system.

AB  - Land surface phenology (LSP), as a precise bio-indicator that responds to climate change, has received much attention in fields concerned with climate change and ecology. Yet, the dynamics of LSP changes in the Qinling Mountains (QMs)-A transition zone between warm-temperate and north subtropical climates with complex vegetation structure-under significant climatic environmental evolution are unclear. Here, we analyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of LSP for different vegetation types in the QMs from 2001 to 2019 and quantified the degree of influence of meteorological factors (temperature, precipitation, and shortwave radiation), and soil (temperature and moisture), and biological factors (maximum of NDVI and middle date during the growing season) on LSP changes using random forest models. The results show that there is an advanced trend (0.15 days/year) for the start of the growing season (SOS), a delayed trend (0.24 days/year) for the end of the growing season (EOS), and an overall extended trend (0.39 days/year) for the length of the growing season (LOS) in the QMs over the past two decades. Advanced SOS and delayed EOS were the dominant patterns leading to a lengthened vegetation growing season, followed by a joint delay of SOS and EOS, and the latter was particularly common in shrub and evergreen broadleaved forests. The growth season length increased significantly in western QMs. Furthermore, we confirmed that meteorological factors are the main factors affecting the interannual variations in SOS and EOS, especially the meteorological factor of preseason mean shortwave radiation (SWP). The grass and crop are most influenced by SWP. The soil condition has, overall, a minor influence the regional LSP. This study highlighted the specificity of different vegetation growth in the QMs under warming, which should be considered in the accurate prediction of vegetation growth in the future.

AB  - Concerns have increased regarding water quality deterioration in arid land water. Water age is a useful indicator of the susceptibility of water bodies to water quality deterioration and is helpful for knowing the basic mechanisms governing the transport of materials through water bodies. In the current study, the spatial distributions of water age in the small lake of Bosten Lake (hereinafter referred to as small lake) were investigated with a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model built on the basis of the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) model. In particular, the influences of different water flow periods, farmland drainages, and wind directions on water age distributions in the small lake were investigated. The modeled water age in the small lake has high spatial variability. The water age is maximum at the northeastern part and minimum at the center of the small lake. The water age in the small lake is lower during wet periods and gets larger for dry periods. After five years' simulation, the average water age in the whole small lake system was 594, 684, and 794 days under wet, normal, and dry periods. Increasing the hydraulic connectivity of the small lake can reduce its water age by opening its ecological gate inflow and Ahongkou gate outflow. This is the more favorable hydraulic conditions promoting water exchange in most regions of the small lake and can be used in hydraulic engineering to improve its water age. The farmland drainages should be controlled around the small lake. The mean water age of the whole small lake under the northwestern wind is lower than that under the southwestern wind. The simulated results provide important information for comprehending the water exchange efficiency, help in discovery of areas of the small lake most likely to experience water quality degradation, and can be used to design the engineering projects to improve or protect the water environment.

AB  - Simple Summary Long-distance transport in the global swine industry is more the rule than the exception. We tested the impact on the rates of temperature change and air enthalpy on the stress response and muscle pH in pigs subjected to long-distance travel from Spain to Portugal performed in the summer and winter. We found that winter journeys are more adverse for the animals because during the journey, abrupt variations in rates of temperature change and air enthalpy caused a marked physiological stress response and effects on the meat pH after 45 min. These results indicate the need to develop new environmental control strategies that mitigate abrupt temperature changes during travel to attenuate the biological cost of such long-distance transport on the animals. Current legislation in the European Union places limits on live pig transport according to outside temperature, but less is known about the effects of sudden changes in the thermal microenvironment in trailers, particularly during long-distance transport. In this study, we measured the temperature and relative humidity inside livestock vehicles carrying 1920 Spanish finisher pigs (live weight 100 kg and 240 animals per journey) during eight long-distance (>15 h) commercial journeys to slaughter from northern Spain to Portugal in the summer and winter. Here, we report the rate of change in the air temperature (degrees C x min(-1)) and air enthalpies in the transport vehicle (kg water kg dry air-1). At sticking, blood samples were taken for to measure cortisol, glucose, and creatine kinase (CK) as stress response indicators, and the meat pH after 45 min and the pH after 24 h were also determined. The rate of change in the air temperature and enthalpy was higher inside the livestock vehicle during the winter months and was positively related with higher cortisol and glucose levels and lower pH after 45 min (p < 0.05). It is proposed that the rate of temperature change and air enthalpy represent useful integrated indices of thermal stress for pigs during transport.

AB  - Reclamation of highly degraded mine lands to a sustainable environmental quality has become a major policy concern in many countries with a long mining tradition. This paper reports the soil quality status of a historical mine site fifteen years after its reclamation, using indicators of chemical reactivity, soil fertility and health, and discusses the progress and effectiveness of the implemented measures by a comparative analysis between pre- and post-reclamation conditions. Twenty composite surface samples (0-20 cm depth) were obtained for physical and chemical characterization from the open pit mine and waste disposal area, using a stratified random sampling approach. Additionally seven sites were selected to collect topsoil samples for microbiological testing. Results showed that soil quality changed noticeably over the study period (2003-2018), with overall improvements in key properties, such as structural stability, cation exchange capacity, degree of base saturation, soil organic carbon, and available phosphorus. Prior to reclamation, the mine soil was unable to support vegetation due to hyperacidity coupled with elevated levels of toxic metals and nutrient deficiencies. The combined use of sugar beet lime and composted biosolids as a low-cost, locally available, soil amendment was effective in neutralizing both active and exchangeable acidity, and reducing the mobility, plant uptake and human bio-accessibility of trace elements. The amendment addition also enhanced soil fertility, carbon storage, nutrient availability and microbial biomass (bacteria and fungi). Revegetation with Pinus pinea and Nerium oleander has proven to be a successful strategy to create a vegetative cover aesthetically pleasant and environmentally compatible with the surrounding undisturbed landscape, although further efforts should be made to monitor over time the phytotoxic and bioaccessible levels of residual metals, notably Cd, Cu and Zn. The insights gained from this land reclamation experience provide success criteria for assisting natural attenuation in other abandoned mining sites worldwide.

AB  - Air compression is the main energy consumption process in cryogenic air separation units (ASUs), while compression waste heat occupies over 60% of the total compression power. However, the compression waste heat has not yet been recovered in existing ASUs, implying a great potential for energy efficiency improvement. In this paper, an organic Rankine-vapor compression cycle (ORVC) assisted three-stage air compression system (ORVC-ACS) is proposed. The compression waste heat is recovered by the ORVC to generate cooling capacity to precool the inlet air of the air compressors, which thus reduces its compression power consumption. Humidity constraint is specially considered in the thermodynamic model as the heat source is pressurized humid air. The feed air conditions (i.e., temperature and humidity) and operation parameters (i.e., the compressed air temperatures, evaporation temperatures and condensation temperature) are first investigated and optimized to study their effects on system performance. The operating ranges of the feed air and operation parameters are further analyzed and identified to ensure no condensed water during the air compressor operation. The optimization results show that the maximum energy saving ratio (ESR) of the ORVC-ACS reaches 4.2%, corresponding to a total annual energy saving of 7500 MWh for a 60,000-Nm(3)/h scale ASUs. It is found that the proposed ORVC-ACS is able to work under the feed air temperature range of 5.35-22.5 degrees C and relative humidity range of 0-0.8. In addition, economic and environmental assessment shows that a discounted pay-back period of 3.1 years and annual carbon-dioxide emission reduction of 5400 t are attainable with the proposed ORVC-ACS, indicating that it is economic viable with excellent decarbonization potential. This work would provide guidance for practical compression system operation in cryogenic ASUs.

AB  - Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is classifed as a most widely spread natural-focal zoonotic infection in the forest and forest-steppe regions of Russia, taking a leading position by the incidence rate among the population. The Saratov region is enzootic as regards to HFRS, but it is not included in the list of constituent entities characterized by sustainably high morbidity rates. In some years, given favorable ecological conditions, explosive growth in the numbers of the red vole (the main carrier of Hantavirus) is registered, which leads to epidemic complications. In the winter 2018-2019 season, an intensive subniveal breeding of the red vole occurred, which led to an increase in the numbers of the species in the spring. The density of such animals increased, they began to spread widely across the territory. Intensive and extensive epizooties in rodent settlements developed in the natural foci of HFRS. This was especially evident in the territory of the forest park zone "Kumysnaya Polyana," located in the vicinity of the regional center. The numbers of rodents in ravine and floodplain deciduous forests increased everywhere and amounted to 37.6% in spring and 53.7% in autumn per 100 capture gears, which was 1.6-2 times higher than the average long-term level. The index of dominance of the red vole has also doubled and amounted to 69.5%. In general, the infection rate of rodents increased by 2-3 times in the region. This indicator in the territory of the Saratov forest park was 20.6% in spring and 35.3% in autumn. Against this background, a record outbreak of HFRS was registered in 2019, namely, 109.7 cases per 100 thousand of the population, which was ten times higher than the long-term indicator (7.2). The results of this research should be taken into account when organizing and conducting epizootiological monitoring and preventive measures in the natural foci of HFRS and other zoonotic infections.

AB  - In the last decade, particular attention has been paid to the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) power plant, a technology that implements a classical steam Rankine cycle using low-boiling fluid of organic origin. Depending on the specific application and the choice of the designer, the ORC can be optimized using one or several criteria. The selected objectives reflect various system performance aspects, such as: thermodynamic, economic, environmental or other. In this study, a novel criterion called exergy utilization index (XUI) is defined and used to maximize the utilization of an energy source in the ORC system. The maximization of the proposed indicator is equivalent to bring the heat carrier outlet temperature to the ambient temperature as close as possible. In the studied case, the XUI is applied along with the total heat transfer area of the system, and the multi-objective optimization is performed in order to determine the optimal operating conditions of the ORC. Moreover, to reveal a relationship between the XUI and important ORC performance indicators, a parametric study is conducted. Based on the results, it has been found that high values of the XUI (similar to 80%) correspond to optimal values of exergy-based indicators such as: exergy efficiency, waste exergy ratio, environmental effect factor or exergetic sustainability index. Furthermore, the values of the XUI = 60%-80% are associated with beneficial economic characteristics reflected in a low payback period (<11.3 years). When considering the ecological aspect, the maximization of XU/ has resulted in minimization of exergy waste to the environment. In general, the simple formulation and straightforward meaning make the XUI a particularly useful indicator for the preliminary evaluation and design of the ORC. Furthermore, the comparative analysis with respect to other well-known performance indicators has shown that it has a potential to be successfully applied as the objective function in the optimization of ORC power plants.

AB  - With the rapid economic growth and social development in China, conflicts over water resources between human and nature are continuously increasing which is attracting the attention of researchers. At the same time, discharge of water pollutants and exploitation of water resources pose a daunting challenge to the sustainable development of economy and society. China consists of 34 provincial administrative regions having similar or different characteristics in the levels of economic development, water resource endowment, water environmental capacity and water environmental pressure. Among these, it is meaningful to analyze spatial similarities and variations in water environmental carrying capacity (WECC), which contributes to carrying out different and scientific strategies for the management of water environment and for sustainable economic and social development in China. An index system is established to quantify WECC from the perspectives of carrying capacity, environmental pressure, vulnerability of water environment and exploitation and utilization potential. The k means clustering method is applied to conduct the similarity combination based on the quantification of 4 integrated indicators using catastrophe progression method. The silhouette coefficient is introduced to measure the quality of clustering and to determine the optimal clustering number. The obtained results indicate that carrying condition of water environment becomes more and more better and exploitation and utilization potential of WECC is decreasing gradually from the east to the west in China, and there are more overload in the north provinces and less in the south. In addition, water environmental vulnerability in the west is higher than that of central and eastern provinces in China. The optimal clustering number is 4 obtained by calculating the silhouette coefficient. Also, 31 provinces are categorized into 4 sub-areas i.e. key protected area, controlled development area, optimized development area and prioritized development area. The suggestions on the corresponding bidirectional regulation to different sub-areas are also put forward to provide a scientific reference to rational distribution of economic development, elaborate management of water environment as well as regional sustainable development in the future.

AB  - The status of European legislation regarding inland water quality after the enactment of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) originated scientific effort to develop reliable methods, primarily based on biological parameters. An important aspect of the process was to ensure that quality assessment was comparable between the different Member States. The Intercalibration process (IC), required in the WFD ensures the unbiased application of the norm. The presented results were developed in the context of the 2nd IC phase. An overview of the reservoir type definition of the Lake Mediterranean Geographical Intercalibration Group, where four types were considered divided by both alkalinity and climate, together with the results for selection of Maximum Ecological Potential sites (MEP) are presented. MEP reservoirs were selected based on pressure and biological variables. Three phytoplankton-based assessment methods were intercalibrated using data from Mediterranean countries. The Mediterranean Assessment System for Reservoirs Phytoplankton (Spain), the New Mediterranean Assessment System for Reservoirs Phytoplankton (Portugal and Cyprus) and the New Italian Method (Italy) were applied. These three methods were compared through option 3 of the Intercalibration Guide. The similarity of the assessments was quantified, and the Good/Moderate (GM) boundaries assessed. All three methods stood as comparable at the GM boundary except for the MASRP in siliceous wet reservoirs, which was slightly stricter. Finally, the main taxonomic groups represented in the phytoplankton community at MEP conditions were identified, as well as their main changes with an increasing trophic status. MEP sites are dominated by chrysophytes in siliceous wet reservoirs and by the diatoms Cyclotella and Achnanthes in calcareous ones. Cyanobacteria take over the community in both calcareous and siliceous wet reservoirs as eutrophication increases. In summary, the relevance and reliability of the quality assessment methods compared were confirmed both from an ecological perspective and a health risk management point of view.

AB  - The importance of plants in the accumulation of organic contaminants from air and soil was recognized to the point that even regulatory predictive approaches now include a vegetation compartment or sub-compartment. However, it has recently been shown that many of such approaches lack ecological realism to properly evaluate the dynamic of air/plant/soil exchange, especially when environmental conditions are subject to sudden variations of meteorological or ecological parameters. This paper focuses on the development of a fully dynamic scenario in which the variability of concentrations of selected chemicals in air and plant leaves was studied weekly and related to the corresponding meteorological and ecological parameters, to the evaluate their influence. To develop scenarios for modelling purposes, two different sampling campaigns were performed to measure temporal variability of: 1) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations in air of a clearing and a forest site, as well as in leaves of two broadleaf species and 2) two important leaf and canopy traits, specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf area index (LAI). The aim was to evaluate in detail how the variability of meteorological and ecological parameters (SLA and LAI) can influence the uptake/release of organic contaminants by plants and therefore air concentrations. A principal component analysis demonstrated how both meteorological and ecological parameters jointly influence PAR air concentrations. SLA, LAI, as well as leaf density were showed to change over time and among species and to be directly proportional to leaf/canopy uptake rate. While hazelnut had the higher leaf uptake rate, maple became the most important species when considering the canopy uptake rate due to its higher LAI. Other species specific traits, such as the seasonal variation in production of new leaves and the timing of bud burst, were also shown to influence the uptake rate of PAHs by vegetation.

Transgenerational epigenetics is the phenomenon that the information of the environment of (usually) a female animal is translated into memory-like responses preparing the offspring. As a consequence, individuals of the next generation may show different phenotypic traits depending whether their mothers were kept under different environmental conditions. This may result in either positive or negative effects on the next-generation individuals, which is different from individuals from mothers that have been kept in a different environment. Transgenerational epigenetic effects have been proposed and indicated for specific immune (T cell and antibody) responses (especially in mammals, but also in birds) and innate immunity (nonvertebrates), but surprisingly very little is known of transgenerational effects on innate immunity in chickens. Given the short lifespan of the chicken and therefore the likely dependence of chicken on innate immune mechanisms, more attention should be given to this arm of immunity and mechanisms of inheritance including transgenerational effects that can be initiated in the breeder generation. In addition, it is becoming evident that innate immunity also underlies metabolic disorders in broilers. In the current paper, we will argue that although very little is known of transgenerational effects of innate immunity in poultry, more attention should be given to this type of study. We will illustrate examples of transgenerational epigenetics, and finally propose strategies that should reveal the presence of transgenerational epigenetic effects on innate immunity in chickens and strategies to modulate breeder birds such that these effects positively affect innate immunity of broilers. It is suggested that a mismatch between breeder environment and broiler environment may account for unwanted effects of innate immunity in the broiler.

AB  - The appearance of assimilable organic carbon (AOC), microbial regrowth, disinfection by-products (DBPs), and pipe corrosion in drinking water distribution systems are among those major safe drinking water issues in many countries. The water distribution system of Cheng-Ching Lake Water Treatment Plant (CCLWTP) was selected in this study to evaluate the: (1) fate and transport of AOC, DBPs [e.g., trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs)], and other organic carbon indicators in the selected distribution system, (2) correlations between AOC (or DBPs) and major water quality parameters [e.g. dissolved oxygen (DO), free residual chlorine, and bacteria, and (3) causes and significance of corrosion problems of the water pipes in this system. In this study, seasonal water samples were collected from 13 representative locations in the distribution system for analyses of AOC, DBPs, and other water quality indicators. Results indicate that residual free chlorine concentrations in the distribution system met the drinking water standards (0.2 to 1 mg l(-1)) established by Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (TEPA). Results show that AOC measurements correlated positively with total organic carbon (TOC) and UV-254 (an organic indicator) values in this system. Moreover, AOC concentrations at some locations were higher than the 50 mu g acetate-C l(-1) standard established by Taiwan Water Company. This indicates that the microbial regrowth might be a potential water quality problem in this system. Higher DO measurements (> 5.7 mg l(-1)) might cause the aerobic biodegradation of THMs and HAAs in the system, and thus, low THMs (< 0.035 mg l(-1)) and HAAs (< 0.019 mg l(-1)) concentrations were observed at all sampling locations. Results from the observed negative Langelier Saturation Index (LSI) values, higher Ryznar Stability Index (RSI) values, and high Fe(3+)concentrations at some pipe-end locations indicate that highly oxidative and corrosive conditions occurred. This reveals that pipe replacement should be considered at these locations. These findings would be helpful in managing the water distribution system for maintaining a safe drinking water quality.

AB  - The study was aimed at determining age of the trees growing on the cupola of the Stazki raised bog, at elucidating anthropogenic influences on the water level in the bog, and at exploring effects of climatic factors on the Scots pine tree-ring growth. Samples were collected. with Pressler's bores, front 22 Scots Pines and from a single downy birch. Tree-ring widths, measured to 0.01 mm, were used to compile - based on the classic dating methods - 143-year-long (1862-2004) ST chronologies. The mean annual ring growth was found to amount to 0.87 mm. The chronologies obtained served as a basis with which to analyse signature years and response functions. Dendroclimatological analyses produced no unequivocal and statistically significant results: the signature years and response function analyses failed to identify a dominant factor and to indicate unambiguously a period during which the weather components studied exerted a decisive effect. Because of that. no climatic reconstructions were carried out. The ring growth of the trees examined was found to be primarily affected by changes in the water level, related mainly to anthropogenic activities. The bog evolution (drying-out and Scots pine invasion) was reconstructed with this assumption in mind. A mass appearance of trees on the bog was dated in the last decade of the 19th century. It was assumed to be triggered by draining operations carried out to lower the water level so that peat could be cut. As a result, conditions amenable for the bog surface to be colonised by Scots pine seedlings were created. The data obtained are important from the standpoint of raised bog conservation they demonstrate that pine forests growing on raised bogs are not always the final stage of succession, but provide evidence of disturbed bog hydrology and serve as an indicator of a perturbed bog ecosystem.

AB  - Calcium (Ca) is an essential macronutrient in plants and is an important component of many cellular structures and physiological processes as well as overall forest function. Aluminum (Al) in soil solution can inhibit Ca uptake by plants and disrupt many Ca-dependent metabolic and physiological processes of plants. The ratio of Ca to Al in soil solution can be an important indicator of forest health, especially on acid soils. We used sequential chemical extractions (water, acetic acid and hydrochloric acid) to assess the chemical availability of Ca and Al in foliage from mature red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) trees growing under ambient environmental conditions. In plants deficient in Ca and with intermediate total foliar Ca concentration ([Ca]), Ca preferentially accrued in labile and physiologically available forms (water- and acetic acid-extractable). In plants with total foliar [Ca] above a "sufficiency" threshold, Ca also accrued in a chemically sequestered form with low solubility (HCl-extractable), suggesting that Ca sequestration is an inducible process in response to excess foliar Ca. Because it has low solubility, it is likely that sequestered Ca is unavailable for Ca-dependent physiological processes. Immobilization of Al in foliage was related to Ca sequestration, suggesting that Ca sequestration may provide a passive mechanism for Al tolerance in the foliage of these trees. Aluminum immobilization was evident based on the ratio of HCl-extractable Al to the more labile (water- and acetic acid-extractable) forms of Al. Sufficient labile Ca combined with Al sequestration was associated with plant health, including enhanced foliar accretion of Mg and Mn, greater tree growth, enhanced foliar cold hardiness and reduced winter injury. These findings demonstrate that not all chemical forms of foliar Ca and Al are of equal physiological significance and underscore the importance of assessing the biologically significant element forms in biogeochemical research.

AB  - Titanium dioxide (TiO2) engineered particles are widely used in the urban environment as pigments in paints, and as active ingredients in photocatalytic coatings. Consequently, studies are necessary to quantify TiO2 engineered particle concentrations and their temporal variability in surface waters to gain better understanding about their abundance and environmental fate in order to minimize their potential environmental impacts. The objective of this study was to determine the temporal variability in the concentration of TiO2 engineered particles in the Broad River, Columbia, South Carolina, United States during dry and wet weather conditions and to examine the relationship between flow discharge, water quality indicators, and the concentration of TiO2 engineered particles. TiO2 engineered particle concentration in the Broad River water was determined by mass balance calculation using bulk titanium concentration and the increase in Tifigb ratio above the natural background ratio. The relative abundance of single metal and multi-metal Ti-bearing particles was determined by single particle-inductively coupled plasma-time of flight-mass spectrometer (SP-ICP-TOF-MS). Additionally, the elemental ratios of Ti/Nb, Ti/Al, and Ti/Fe within multi-metal Ti-bearing particles were determined at the single particle level. Discharge, bulk elemental concentrations (e.g., Ti, Al, Fe, and Nb), bulk elemental ratios (e.g, Ti/Al, Ti/Fe, and Ti/Nb), TiO2 engineered particle concentration, and turbidity displayed the same trend of rise and fall following storm events. Linear relationships were established between turbidity and TiO2 engineered particle concentrations in the Broad River for different flow regimes. However, no correlation was observed between TiO2 engineered particle concentrations and flow discharge, dissolved oxygen, pH, or ionic strength. The established correlations between turbidity and TiO2 engineered particle concentrations are important as they can be used to translate the continuously monitored turbidity to TiO2 concentrations.

AB  - The article presents a comparative analysis of contemporary migration processes in two Russian regions, geographically distant from each other, but having common historical and socio-cultural roots - the Republic of Kalmykia and the Republic of Tuva. They also have similar social and economic performance indicators, and a high level of poverty, all of which tends to push the populations out of both regions. At the same time, the background for labor migration is quite different: while Kalmykia is experiencing depopulation, Tuva's population is growing.
   The authors have analyzed different stages of the migration process in Kalmykia and Tuva, ranging from making a decision to move out of the region, choosing a destination and job search channels, to << adaptability >> to the peculiarities of climatic, living and sociocultural conditions, satisfaction with the level of wages in the new region of residence, as well as further life strategies, such as timing the move or prospects of returning. Special attention was paid to the issues of preserving ethnic and religious identity in a different ethnic environment, to the surviving ties with home area, as well as to the gender aspects of labor migration.
   For its sources, the study relies on statistics, and on the in-depth interviews 43 respondents gave in 2021. All of them moved out of their own regions. The respondents from Tuva found the main reason for their migration in the need to pay off credit arrears and to provide for children. For respondents from Kalmykia, migration to the Far North is an opportunity to realize their professional potential and career development, since it is unattainable in their home republic. In-depth interviews confirm that labor migrants maintain close ties with their home area, express a desire to preserve their ethnic and religious identity, and tend to join or start ethnic communities in places of migration.
   To conclude, labor migration, despite its recurrent nature, is becoming a prolonged process, and ay in the future become a source of demographic and personnel problems for donor regions, such as Kalmykia and Tuva.

AB  - Tropical coastal waters are understudied, despite their ecological and economic importance. They also reflect projected climate change scenarios for other climate zones, e.g., increased rainfall and water temperatures. We conducted an exploratory microbial water quality study at a tropical beach influenced by sewage-contaminated rivers, and tested the hypothesis that fecal microorganisms (fecal coliforms, enterococci, Clostridium perfringens, somatic and male-specific coliphages, pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), Bacteroides HF183, norovirus genogroup I (NoVGI), Salmonella, Cryptosporidium and Giardia) would vary by season and tidal stage. Most microorganisms' concentrations were greater in the rainy season; however, NoVGI was only detected in the dry season and Cryptosporidium was the only pathogen most frequently detected in rainy season. Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) levels exceeded recreational water quality criteria standards in >85% of river samples and in <50% of ocean samples, regardless of the FIB or regulatory criterion. Chronic sewage contamination was demonstrated by detection of HF183 and PMMoV in 100% of river samples, and in >89% of ocean samples. Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Salmonella, and NoVGI were frequently detected in rivers (39%, 39%, 26%, and 39% of samples, respectively), but infrequently in ocean water, particularly during the dry season. Multivariate analysis showed that C. perfringens, somatic coliphage, male-specific coliphage, and PMMoV were the subset of indicators that maximized the correlation with pathogens in the rivers. In the ocean, the best subset of indicators was enterococci, male-specific coliphage, and PMMoV. We also executed redudancy analyses on environmental parameters and microorganim concentrations, and found that rainfall best predicted microbial concentrations. The seasonal interplay of rainfall and pathogen prevalence undoubtedly influences beach users' health risks. Relationships are likely to be complex, with some risk factors increasing and others decreasing each season. Future use of multivariate approaches to better understand linkages among environmental conditions, microbial predictors (fecal indicators and MST markers), and pathogens will improve prediction of high-risk scenarios at recreational beaches.

AB  - Disentangling the role of natural and anthropogenic factors is a major challenge in paleofire studies. Here, we introduce the molecular biomarkers of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs), combined with charcoal and black carbon in sediments of archaeological sites, to identify anthropogenic signals of environmental change during the middle Holocene. In the prehistoric period, an intensified-fire regime period, inferred on the basis of PAHs, char and macro-charcoal levels, has been attributed to intensified anthropogenic biomass burning from dry crop cultivation between 6500 and 5000 and 3900-3600 yr BP., corresponding to the earliest Chinese settlements during the Miaodigou & Banpo IV Culture and the development of the Erlitou Culture under drier climate conditions. Subsequently, the fire frequency decreased notably between 4500 and 4000 yr BP. as the climate became wetter and there were shifts in the frequency of high-magnitude floods, corresponding to the abandonment of late Neolithic settlements in the floodplain. Changes in the PAH fluxes in sediments are positively correlated with intensified-fire regime periods, consistent with the charcoal and black carbon fluxes during those periods. Principal component analysis of PAH fluxes suggests that these intensified-fire events have a pyrogenic signature, implying that the PAHs were derived from biomass burning of fuelwood and other woody plants. In this study, PAHs in loess sediments have been used as the indicators of anthropogenic biomass burning through time. Meanwhile, PAHs also record the shift of modes of production and the evolution of human settlements as well as the choices made in response to limited natural resources. To comprehensively analyze the paleofire records of PAHs, charcoal and black carbon combined with multiproxy evidence are needed to understand wildfire history as well as human land use and social and cultural development across the study regions in depth.

AB  - Bryophytes are sensitive to changing atmospheric conditions. Potentially, typical alpine bryophytes are valuable indicators of climate change for alpine ecosystems. However, little is known about the effects of climate change on the dominant alpine bryophytes of the Tibetan Plateau. In this study, we compared suitable habitats and predicted the effects of key environmental variables, in three climate change scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), on the distribution of two dominant moss genera, a typically alpine xerophytic functional group, Bryoerythrophyllum and Didymodon in Pottiaceae. We used Maximum Entropy model (MaxEnt) modelling, for the 2050s and 2070s in Tibet. Simulation-based estimates suggest that Bryoerythrophyllum are more suited to habitats from semi-humid regions to semi-arid regions while Didymodon are relatively drought-resistant mosses that mainly inhabit drought regions. The variables associated with temperature will have the strongest effect on the future distribution patterns of both Bryoerythrophyllum and Didymodon when compared with precipitation and topographic variables. However, Climate change should affect Didymodon the most, due to its relatively narrow temperature and precipitation range for optimum growth. Additionally, Bryoerythrophyllum is predicted with a ratio of increase in suitable areas at 19.08%, 141.49% and 121.56% and 55.22%, 129.93% and 172.08% under all three scenarios, for 2050 and 2070, respectively. In contrast, Didymodon has a ratio of increase in suitable areas at -25.36%, 12.51% and 51.1% and 13.71%, 14.27% and 131.91%, for all three scenarios for the two future decades, respectively. However, there are more obviously regular expansions and contractions can be easily caught for Didymodon than for Bryoerythrophyllum with GHG emissions from low to high. In summary, although Bryoerythrophyllum and Didymodon are evolutionarily closely related and have similar distribution patterns and future upward and northward shifts, Didymodon will respond more to climate warming under each climatic scenario for the 2050s and 2070s. Therefore, Didymodon is recommended as an indicator of climate change on the Tibetan Plateau.

AB  - BackgroundAquaculture is a fast-growing industry and therefore welfare and environmental impact have become of utmost importance. Preventing stress associated to common aquaculture practices and optimizing the fish stress response by quantification of the stress level, are important steps towards the improvement of welfare standards. Stress is characterized by a cascade of physiological responses that, in-turn, induce further changes at the whole-animal level. These can either increase fitness or impair welfare. Nevertheless, monitorization of this dynamic process has, up until now, relied on indicators that are only a snapshot of the stress level experienced. Promising technological tools, such as proteomics, allow an unbiased approach for the discovery of potential biomarkers for stress monitoring. Within this scope, using Gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) as a model, three chronic stress conditions, namely overcrowding, handling and hypoxia, were employed to evaluate the potential of the fish protein-based adaptations as reliable signatures of chronic stress, in contrast with the commonly used hormonal and metabolic indicators.ResultsA broad spectrum of biological variation regarding cortisol and glucose levels was observed, the values of which rose higher in net-handled fish. In this sense, a potential pattern of stressor-specificity was clear, as the level of response varied markedly between a persistent (crowding) and a repetitive stressor (handling). Gel-based proteomics analysis of the plasma proteome also revealed that net-handled fish had the highest number of differential proteins, compared to the other trials. Mass spectrometric analysis, followed by gene ontology enrichment and protein-protein interaction analyses, characterized those as humoral components of the innate immune system and key elements of the response to stimulus.ConclusionsOverall, this study represents the first screening of more reliable signatures of physiological adaptation to chronic stress in fish, allowing the future development of novel biomarker models to monitor fish welfare.

AB  - Understanding the net photosynthesis of plant canopies requires quantifying photosynthesis in challenging environments, principally due to the variable light intensities and qualities generated by sunlight interactions with clouds and surrounding foliage. The dynamics of sunflecks and rates of change in light intensity at the beginning and end of sustained light (SL) events makes photosynthetic measurements difficult, especially when dealing with less accessible parts of plant foliage. High time resolved photosynthetic monitoring from pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometers has limited applicability due to the invasive nature of frequently applied saturating flashes. An alternative approach used here provides remote (<5m), high time resolution (10 s), PAM equivalent but minimally invasive measurements of photosynthetic parameters. We assessed the efficacy of the Q(A) flash protocol from the Light-Induced Fluorescence Transient (LIFT) technique for monitoring photosynthesis in mature outer canopy leaves of potted Persea americana Mill. cv. Haas (Avocado) trees in a semi-controlled environment and outdoors. Initially we established that LIFT measurements were leaf angle independent between +/- 40 degrees from perpendicular and moreover, that estimates of 685 nm reflectance (R-685) from leaves of similar chlorophyll content provide a species dependent, but reasonable proxy for incident light intensity. Photosynthetic responses during brief light events (<= 10 min), and the initial stages of SL events, showed similar declines in the quantum yield of photosystem II (phi(II)) with large transient increases in 'constitutive loss processes' (phi(NO)) prior to dissipation of excitation by non-photochemical quenching (phi(NPQ)). Our results demonstrate the capacity of LIFT to monitor photosynthesis at a distance during highly dynamic light conditions that potentially may improve models of canopy photosynthesis and estimates of plant productivity. For example, generalized additive modelling performed on the 85 dynamic light events monitored identified negative relationships between light event length and.FII and.electron transport rate using either.photosynthetically active radiation or Delta R-685 as indicators of leaf irradiance.

AB  - Palaeoclimatic reconstructions from lake sediment biological records can be challenging, due to variation in non-climatic factors, which alter ecosystem responses. To consider this, it is important to replicate a study regionally, so as to gain information on spatial variability of ecosystem response and the influence of site-specific conditions. Previous pollen-based palaeoclimatic records from three well-dated Arctic lake sites highlight the response of regional Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Mountain Birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) forest-tundra transition to Holocene climatic variability and suggest the northernmost Peninsulas of Finnmark to be climatically sensitive. This study analysed dated sediment sequences between c. 3970 and c. 6200cal. yr BP from these three previously published shallow lakes: Liten ap'pesjav'ri (LCJ), over Gunnarsfjorden (OGF) and over Kobbkrokvatnet (OKV), for freshwater diatoms. Diatom assemblages showed an increase in the planktonic diatoms relative to benthic diatoms, with an onset towards higher abundances of small centric planktonic diatoms at OGF (between c. 5270 and 5350cal. yr BP) and OKV (between c. 5280 and 5350cal. yr BP). Additionally, a diatom compositional shift was detected at LCJ between c. 5180 and 5300cal. yr BP. Trend analysis found the main diatom compositional change at all three sites to occur at 5300cal. yr BP. However, this synchronous diatom shift during the mid-Holocene varies in magnitude within the three Finnmark lakes. The abrupt planktonic:benthic diatom ratio changes are independent of the Pinus:Betula ratios and are likely to be a result of lake ice-cover changes, allowing longer growing seasons, greater water column stability and higher nutrient concentrations from surrounding catchments. This study highlights the significant differences in aquatic ecosystem and terrestrial vegetation response to climatic changes, with diatom assemblages at these sites either responding before the regional tree-line shift or to a separate climatic event within the mid-Holocene.

AB  - The paper examines, under specific local situation of planning of innovative solutions for municipal solid waste treatment, the results obtained from a technical, economic and environmental comparison between two different scenarios for waste management: the first scenario foresees the gasification of the residual waste after separate collection and the energetic utilization of the produced syngas, while the second one is based on a mechanical separation of the residual waste in three fluxes: a combustible flux to be utilized, after quality improvement, as RDF (residue derived fuel), a wet organic flux to be sent to anaerobic digestion and a residual essentially mineral flux. For both the scenarios different levels of separate collection were considered.
   The comparison took into account environmental and economic aspects.
   From the environmental point of view, the tool of LCA (life cycle assessment) has been used to address some key environmental aspects and the global acceptance of the two scenarios. As concerns the economic point of view, conventional economic criteria, i.e. investment and operating costs transferred to citizens, have been considered.
   For the practical implementation of the scenarios and in order to verify the possibility to adopt them in a specific territorial situation, additional aspects of practical management, reliability and need to individuate synergies with other territorial infrastructures have been considered.
   The results of the analysis for this specific case revealed that the MBT (mechanical biological treatment) option is preferable from the environmental point of view, while the pyro-gasification option is better from the economic point of view under the vast majority of operating conditions considered. Different practical implementations problems characterize both the scenarios.
   More generally, the comparison methodology that has been defined and used for the scenarios of the considered case can establish a more general useful approach, in order to help the definition of the best solution for waste management planning. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an essential component of the carbon cycle and a critical driver in controlling variety of biogeochemical and ecological processes in wetlands. The quality of this DOM as it relates to composition and reactivity is directly related to its sources and may vary on temporal and spatial scales. However, large scale, long-term studies of DOM dynamics in wetlands are still scarce in the literature. Here we present a multi-year DOM characterization study for monthly surface water samples collected at 14 sampling stations along two transects within the greater Everglades, a subtropical, oligotrophic, coastal freshwater wetland-mangrove-estuarine ecosystem. In an attempt to assess quantitative and qualitative variations of DOM on both spatial and temporal scales, we determined dissolved organic carbon (DOC) values and DOM optical properties, respectively. DOM quality was assessed using, excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence coupled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Variations of the PARAFAC components abundance and composition were clearly observed on spatial and seasonal scales. Dry versus wet season DOC concentrations were affected by dry-down and re-wetting processes in the freshwater marshes, while DOM compositional features were controlled by soil and higher plant versus periphyton sources respectively. Peat-soil based freshwater marsh sites could be clearly differentiated from marl-soil based sites based on EEM-PARAFAC data. Freshwater marsh DOM was enriched in higher plant and soil-derived humic-like compounds, compared to estuarine sites which were more controlled by algae- and microbial-derived inputs. DOM from fringe mangrove sites could be differentiated between tidally influenced sites and sites exposed to long inundation periods. As such coastal estuarine sites were significantly controlled by hydrology, while DOM dynamics in Florida Bay were seasonally driven by both primary productivity and hydrology. This study exemplifies the application of long term optical properties monitoring as an effective technique to investigate DOM dynamics in aquatic ecosystems. The work presented here also serves as a pre-restoration condition dataset for DOM in the context of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP).

AB  - Although novel nanomaterials are being produced and applied in our daily lives at a rapid pace, related health and environmental toxicity assessments are lagging behind. Recent reports have concluded that the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles (NPs) have a crucial influence on their toxicities and should be evaluated during risk assessments. Nevertheless, several controversies exist regarding the biological effects of NP size and surface area. In addition, relatively few reports describe the extents to which the physicochemical properties of NPs influence their toxicity. In this study, we used six self-synthesized and two commercial ZnO and TiO2 nanomaterials to evaluate the effects of the major physicochemical properties of NPs (size, shape, surface area, phase, and composition) on human lung epithelium cells (A549). We characterized these NPs using transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method, and dynamic laser scattering. From methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MU) and Interleukin 8 (IL-8) assays of both rod- and sphere-like ZnO NPs, we found that smaller NPs had greater toxicity than larger ones-a finding that differs from those of previous studies. Furthermore, at a fixed NP size and surface area, we found that the nanorod ZnO particles were more toxic than the corresponding spherical ones, suggesting that both the size and shape of ZnO NPs influence their cytotoxicity. In terms of the effect of the surface area, we found that the contact area between a single NP and a single cell was more important than the total specific surface area of the NP. All of the TiO2 NP samples exhibited cytotoxicities lower than those of the ZnO NP samples; among the TiO2 NPs, the cytotoxicity in :Teased in the following order: amorphous > anatase > anatase/rutile; thus, the phase of the NPs can also play an important role under size-, surface area-, and shape-controlled conditions.

AB  - This new numerical approach proposes a solution to a fundamental and difficult question in ecology, consisting of the correct geographical representation of multidimensional structures. Firstly, transformation was applied to the original matrix (n sites x q variables) in order to satisfy the condition of multinormality. Then, a hierarchical cluster analysis was used and cacti hierarchical level was Studied and characterised by a certain probability level. For each cut off level an algorithm based on the computation of the Bayesian probabilities produced a smaller matrix (n sites x c groups). These conditional probabilities measure the chance that each site has in belonging to a predefined group of sites. Spatial distributions of these probability values for each group of sites were mapped using kriging interpolation. Finally, the maps were used to define homogenous zones on a single map by superimposing one map on the other. The maximal value of interpolated probability was used as criterion to assign cacti point of the map to the zones predefined by this classification.
   This method was applied to map demersal fish habitats by using a dataset from bottom trawl surveys in the Bay of Biscay (France) during October 1990. The boundaries between habitats were identified objectively. Then, the indicator species and species assemblages characterising the different habitats were identified by using an indicator value index. This index integrates the specificity and the fidelity quantities calculated for each species in each habitat. The obtained results showed that this method presented a robust tool to describe the habitat of exploited species. The obtained habitats were validated by their correspondence with depth strata, sediment type and also by the biological characteristics of the indicator species.
   The proposed method is useful in the study of temporal variations of habitats with regards to species assemblages and can also be generalised to other multivariate databases of different descriptors (physical, chemical, biological, etc.).

AB  - Aims The study of microbial inactivation rates in aquifer systems has most often been determined in aerobic and oxidized systems. This study examined the inactivation (i.e. loss of infectivity) of MS2, poliovirus type 1 (PV1) and Cryptosporidium parvum in an anaerobic and reduced groundwater system that has been identified as storage zones for aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) facilities. Methods and Results Anaerobic and reduced (ORP < (-)250 mV) groundwater from an artesian well was diverted to an above-ground, flow-through mesocosm that contained diffusion chambers filled with MS2, PV1 or Cryptosporidium parvum. The respective infectivity assays were performed on microorganisms recovered from the diffusion chambers during 30- to 58-day experiments. The net reduction in infectivity was 5.73 log(10) over 30 days for MS2, 5.00 log(10) over 58 days for PV1 and 4.07 log(10) over 37 days for C. parvum. The best fit inactivation model for PV1 was the log-linear model and the Weibull model for MS2 and C. parvum, with respective inactivation rates (95% confidence interval) of 0.19 (0.17-0.21) log(10) day(-1), 0.31 (0.19-0.89) log(10) day(-1) and 0.20 (0.14-0.37) log(10) day(-1). Conclusions The groundwater geochemical conditions in this aquifer enhanced the inactivation of MS2, PV1, and C. parvum at rates approximately 2.0-5.3-fold, 1.2-17.0-fold, and 4.5-5.6-fold greater, respectively, than those from published studies that used diffusion chambers in aerobic-to-anoxic groundwater systems, with positive redox potentials. Significance and Impact of the Study Geochemical conditions like those in the aquifer zone in this study can naturally and significantly reduce concentrations of microbial indicators and pathogens of human health concern in injected surface water. Appropriate storage times for injected surface water could complement above-ground engineered processes for microorganism removal and inactivation (e.g. filtration, disinfection) by naturally increasing overall microorganism log-inactivation rates of ASR facilities.

AB  - Uneven seasonal rainfall results in insufficient water supply and low yelds of Camellia oleifera growing in mountainous and hilly areas without irrigation conditions. To assess the effectiveness of mulching on the yield and quality of three cultivars of C. oleifera ('Hengdongdatao', 'Huashuo' and 'Xianglin 210') and its influence of preserving soil moisture, a field experiment was conducted in 2016 in Changning, Hunan. Mulching materials of ecological pad (T1), straw (T2), straw and ecological pad (T3), gravel (T4), sawdust (T5) and camellia shell (T6) were tested and compared with un-mulched (CK). The mulch material with the strongest cooling effect in high temperature weather was T2. The possible reason is that the surface roughness of the mulching material is good for reflecting light. T3 was the most effective at maintaining soil moisture. The reason is that straw and ecological pad increased the thickness of the cover layer and their small pore size, thus the evaporation rate decreased. It can appropriately stable the temperature in high-temperature weather and can better maintain the soil moisture to provide adequate water for growth. T1showed soil moisture by 14.93%, 14.98%, 14.89% for three cultivars, respectively. All treatments increased yield compared to CK. T1 showed the highest yield and was higher than CK by 58%, 61% and 124% for Hengdongdatao, Huashuo, and Xianglin 210, respectively. Mulching with T1 (40.23% and 39.63%) resulted in the highest oil content ratio in 'Hengdongdatao' and 'Huashuo' and mulching with T4 (36.93%) resulted in highest oil content ratio in 'Xianglin 210'. Treatment of the 'Xianglin 210'cultivar with T1 was re-tested in 2017. In all months analyzed, related indicators measured were significantly different compared with CK. This research suggests that mulching organic material to C. oleifera hilly area is an effective measure to solve seasonal drought and increase yield when there are no irrigation conditions present.

AB  - Frequent, region-wide monitoring of changes in pasture quality due to human disturbances or climatic conditions is impossible by field measurements or traditional ecological surveying methods. Remote sensing imagery offers distinctive advantages for monitoring spatial and temporal patterns. The chemical parameters that are widely used as indicators of ecological quality are crude protein (CP) content and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content. In this study, we investigated the relationship between CP, NDF, and reflectance in the visible-near-infrared-shortwave infrared (VIS-NIR-SWIR) spectral range, using field, laboratory measurements, and satellite imagery (Sentinel-2). Statistical models were developed using different calibration and validation data sample sets: (1) a mix of laboratory and field measurements (e.g., fresh and dry vegetation) and (2) random selection. In addition, we used three vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI), Soil-adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI)) as proxies to CP and NDF estimation. The best models found for predicting CP and NDF contents were based on reflectance measurements (R-2 = 0.71, RMSEP = 2.1% for CP; and R-2 = 0.78, RMSEP = 5.5% for NDF). These models contained fresh and dry vegetation samples in calibration and validation data sets. Random sample selection in a model generated similar accuracy estimations. Our results also indicate that vegetation indices provide poor accuracy. Eight Sentinel-2 images (December 2015-April 2017) were examined in order to better understand the variability of vegetation quality over spatial and temporal scales. The spatial and temporal patterns of CP and NDF contents exhibit strong seasonal dependence, influenced by climatological (precipitation) and topographical (northern vs. southern hillslopes) conditions. The total CP/NDF content increases/decrease (respectively) from December to March, when the concentrations reach their maximum/minimum values, followed by a decline/incline that begins in April, reaching minimum values in July.

AB  - This paper proposes a model for assessing the risk posed by natural hazards to infrastructures, with a focus on the indirect losses and loss of stability for the population relying on the infrastructure. The model prescribes a three-level analysis with increasing level of detail, moving from qualitative to quantitative analysis. The focus is on a methodology for semi-quantitative analyses to be performed at the second level. The purpose of this type of analysis is to perform a screening of the scenarios of natural hazards threatening the infrastructures, identifying the most critical scenarios and investigating the need for further analyses (third level). The proposed semi-quantitative methodology considers the frequency of the natural hazard, different aspects of vulnerability, including the physical vulnerability of the infrastructure itself, and the societal dependency on the infrastructure. An indicator-based approach is applied, ranking the indicators on a relative scale according to pre-defined ranking criteria. The proposed indicators, which characterise conditions that influence the probability of an infrastructure malfunctioning caused by a natural event, are defined as (1) robustness and buffer capacity, (2) level of protection, (3) quality/level of maintenance and renewal, (4) adaptability and quality of operational procedures and (5) transparency/complexity/degree of coupling. Further indicators describe conditions influencing the socio-economic consequences of the infrastructure malfunctioning, such as (1) redundancy and/or substitution, (2) cascading effects and dependencies, (3) preparedness and (4) early warning, emergency response and measures. The aggregated risk estimate is a combination of the semiquantitative vulnerability indicators, as well as quantitative estimates of the frequency of the natural hazard, the potential duration of the infrastructure malfunctioning (e. g. depending on the required restoration effort) and the number of users of the infrastructure.
   Case studies for two Norwegian municipalities are presented for demonstration purposes, where risk posed by adverse weather and natural hazards to primary road, water supply and power networks is assessed. The application examples show that the proposed model provides a useful tool for screening of potential undesirable events, contributing to a targeted reduction of the risk.

AB  - ObjectiveTo compare the capacity of the 2004 diagnostic guidelines for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH-2004) with the capacity of the preliminary diagnostic guidelines for systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)-associated macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) to discriminate MAS complicating systemic JIA from 2 potentially confusable conditions, represented by active systemic JIA without MAS and systemic infection.
   MethodsInternational pediatric rheumatologists and hemato-oncologists were asked to retrospectively collect clinical information from patients with systemic JIA-associated MAS and confusable conditions. The ability of the guidelines to differentiate MAS from the control diseases was evaluated by calculating the sensitivity and specificity of each set of guidelines and the kappa statistics for concordance with the physician's diagnosis. Owing to the fact that not all patients were assessed for hemophagocytosis on bone marrow aspirates and given the lack of data on natural killer cell activity and soluble CD25 levels, the HLH-2004 guidelines were adapted to enable the diagnosis of MAS when 3 of 5 of the remaining items (3/5-adapted) or 4 of 5 of the remaining items (4/5-adapted) were present.
   ResultsThe study sample included 362 patients with systemic JIA and MAS, 404 patients with active systemic JIA without MAS, and 345 patients with systemic infection. The best capacity to differentiate MAS from systemic JIA without MAS was found when the preliminary MAS guidelines were applied. The 3/5-adapted HLH-2004 guidelines performed better than the 4/5-adapted guidelines in distinguishing MAS from active systemic JIA without MAS. The 3/5-adapted HLH-2004 guidelines and the preliminary MAS guidelines with the addition of ferritin levels 500 ng/ml discriminated best between MAS and systemic infections.
   ConclusionThe preliminary MAS guidelines showed the strongest ability to identify MAS in systemic JIA. The addition of hyperferritinemia enhanced their capacity to differentiate MAS from systemic infections. The HLH-2004 guidelines are likely not appropriate for identification of MAS in children with systemic JIA.

AB  - Sequentially coupled advanced oxidation-biodegradation systems have proven effective for treating a variety of wastewaters, but in several cases the pretreatment did not improve, or even hindered, subsequent biodegradation. Therefore, investigating the relationship between advanced oxidation pretreated effluent and subsequent bioreactor performance can help to optimize these systems. Here, a photocatalytic reactor was used to produce four unique effluents from 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (TCP) by varying light wavelength, catalyst presence, and reaction time, demonstrating that the conditions of photocatalytic pretreatment can be tuned to achieve a variety of treatment objectives. The photocatalytic effluents were characterized for chemical oxygen demand (COD), chloride release, aromaticity, and residual TCP concentration. The four effluents were normalized to 40 mg COD/L, combined with biological medium components, and fed to continuous bioreactors. Bioreactors were assayed for COD removal, TCP removal, optical density (OD), and microbial diversity via denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. In general COD removal in the bioreactors increased as aromatic character of the photoeffluent decreased, but the least aromatic effluent performed poorly indicating the nuanced relationship between photoreactor effluent composition and bioreactor performance. While neither indicator of community diversity, richness nor evenness, correlated with COD removal or biomass accumulation, each effluent produced a unique community as indicated through similarity indices. All conditions demonstrated strong overall TCP removal. After two weeks at steady state, the reactors were perturbed with a 120-mu M spike of TCP. Overall the most aromatic photoeffluent produced the most resistant community to the perturbation, while the optimum effluents at steady state produced communities with poor resistance in terms of biomass accumulation and COD removal.

AB  - A faunal record of chironomid remains was analyzed in the upper 280 cm of a 543 cm long sediment core from Plesne jezero (Plesne Lake), the Bohemian Forest (Sumava, Bohmerwald), Czech Republic. The chronology of the sediment was established by means of 5 AMS-dated plant macroremains. The resolution of individual 3-cm sediment layers is similar to 115 years and the analyzed upper 280 cm of the sediment core represent 10.4 cal. ka BP. As the results of DCA show, two marked changes were recorded in the otherwise relatively stable Holocene chironomid composition: (1) at the beginning of the Holocene (ca. 10.4-10.1 cal. ka BP) only oligotrophic and cold-adapted taxa (Diamesa sp., M. insignilobus-type, H. grimshawi-type) were present in the chironomid assemblages, clearly reflecting a cool climate oscillation during the Preboreal period, and (2) during an event dated in the interval 1540-1771 AD, when most taxa vanished entirely and only Zavrelimyia sp. and Procladius sp. were alternately present accompanied by Tanytarsus sp. Although, the age of this event is in agreement with the dating of the Little Ice Age, the most probable reason for the elimination of many chironomid taxa was very low sums recorded in this part of the sediment, rather than cool conditions connected with the LIA. Variations in the chironomid fauna after the Preboreal period were reflected mainly by changes in abundances of dominant taxa rather than by changes in species composition. These variations could be explained by: (1) climatic changes, namely temperature and amount of rainfall resulting in oscillations in lake level, with changes in the occurrence of macrophytes in the littoral and (2) increasingly dense afforestation which led to a considerable input of organic material into the lake and a subsequent increase in the trophic status of the lake water.

AB  - During Jurassic times, especially within the Maim zeta stage, local depressions formed on the Eastern Bavarian Carbonate Platform that were surrounded by wall reefs. This created a unique depositional environment, where in an open-marine setting stagnant and anoxic bottom waters developed in an intra-reef depression. Anoxic conditions were stabilized below wave base by enhanced salinity in the bottom waters and establishment of a density stratification. Biomarker analysis was applied to characterize palaeosalinity and redox conditions, utilizing organic sulfur compound, methylated chroman, hopanoid and saturated isoprenoid distributions. Prevention of terrigenous influx by protecting reef walls lead to iron deficiency in intra-reefal sediments causing early diagenetic sulfurization of functionalized lipids. Absence of clay-mineral catalysts and early sulfurization favored an unusual steroid distribution lacking rearranged analogues but providing coexistence of saturated steranes with beta alpha alpha-, alpha alpha alpha- and alpha beta beta-configuration, Delta(13(17))-spirosterenes, unknown sterenes and steradienes as well as mono-, di- and triaromatic steroids. Desulfurization of the polar fraction was carried out for two samples to verify that palaeoenvironment reconstruction based on free hydrocarbon and heterocompound distribution was not invalidated by sulfur quenching of selected compounds. Gammacerane was found to be the only component to occur exclusively in the sulfur-bound fraction. Only minor amounts of hydrocarbons were released upon desulfurization implying that free bitumen analysis was applicable for organofacies characterization. Organic petrological investigation of organic mat, revealed the presence of two different types of such structures. Comparison of organoclast fluorescence spectra with those of extracted porphyrin fractions indicate an origin of porphyrins exclusively from cyanobacterial mats whereas algal dominated mats yield no porphyrins. This aims towards a better localization of specific biomarker origin In geological samples.: (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Neonicotinoids are currently the most widely used and sold insecticides in the world, providing effective pest control. Risk assessment of these and other pesticides by lab-based indicators is common. Yet, empirically and theoretically underpinning of extrapolation to indicators used in field surveys is severely limited. Consequently, the aim of our study was to quantify the toxicological and ecological impact of the neonicotinoids imidacloprid and thiacloprid to aquatic invertebrates. We derived Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSDs) based on chronic LC50 data and Mean Species Abundance Relationships (MSARs), comparing these lab-based approaches to field data as well. MSARs are changes in mean species abundance (MSA) as a function of chemical exposure, providing insight into the overall decline of a community. The MSA expresses the mean abundance of species in disturbed conditions relative to their abundance in undisturbed habitat. The medians of the SSD of imidacloprid and thiacloprid for the different species were 16.45 mu g/L and 26.40 mu g/L, respectively. HC50s of the MSAR of imidacloprid and thiacloprid were 4.25 mu g/L and 5.12 mu g/L, respectively. The three taxonomic groups tested (insects, crustaceans and mollusks) did not differ significantly in sensitivity for imidacloprid and thiacloprid, both according to the SSDs and MSARs derived. Quantile exposure-response curves (99%-tile) were plotted showing the relative abundance (RA) of aquatic invertebrate species at increasing imidacloprid levels. The 99%-tile of the Relative Abundances (RA99) of species and corresponding imidacloprid concentrations monitored in field surveys in the Netherlands was significantly lower than the Potentially Affected Fraction (PAF) calculated from the SSD. Yet, the MSA was similar to the RA99, suggesting that MSAR is an ecologically meaningful relationship for toxic stress estimated from lab data. Future efforts should be directed to additional empirical underpinning as well as determining the relationship of PAF to other metrics for ecosystem diversity and productivity.

AB  - Large-scale application of biochar on agricultural land offers the prospect of soil improvement and carbon sequestration for climate-change mitigation. However, negative side-effects on the soil microbial ecosystem are poorly understood, notably in relation to the functions of native microbiomes under realistic routes of biochar exposure. Due to divergent properties, different biochars might interact with soil in complex ways. This might result in decreased or increased ecotoxicity from biochar contaminants, such as heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Using five biochars produced from straw and wood under contrasting pyrolysis conditions, we traced their ecotoxicological dose-effect using a bioassay for potential ammonia oxidation (PAO), through microorganisms that are sensitive stress indicators. Assays were made after soil/biochar interaction for up to 3 weeks, where straw biochar with the lowest PAH content (<0.5 mg kg(-1)) showed the most pronounced dose-effects to PAO, corresponding to a 10% effect concentration (EC10) of 4.6% (dry weight biochar/dry weight soil). In comparison, straw biochar with the highest PAH content was least ecotoxic (EC10, 15.2% after 3 weeks) and wood biochars pyrolysed at high temperature (700-725 degrees C) showed no ecotoxicity to PAO. Interactions between biochars and anionic surfactants, i.e., linear alkylbenzene sulfonates, which are common soil pollutants, resulted in varying effects on PAO, but the effects were small and of limited ecological importance for soil-amended biochars. In conclusion, the results showed that short-term microbial side-effects of biochar in the soil ecosystem were minor at relevant field application rates (such as <30 Mg ha(-1) mixed into a plough layer of 20 cm), and that inherent PAHs in biochar were not a likely source of short-term ecotoxicity. However, there were notable differences in the effects eventually observed at very high biochar rates, stressing that individual biochars need specific ecotoxicological assessment before their safe application at large scale in agricultural soils.

AB  - Maps of regulating urban ecosystem services (UES) aid identification of priority areas for green-blue infrastructure investment to improve urban resilience to environmental hazards. Current mapping approaches however may present coarse spatial resolutions, and often fail to consider how UES flows serve resident demand at the appropriate micro-scale. In addition, prohibitive costs involved in collecting primary data to validate UES model parameters to local conditions may enforce the use of proxy methods, thereby inferring ambiguity in parameterisation and uncertainty in mapping outputs. This study examines both issues through the implementation of a high-spatial resolution approach to map multiple urban regulating ecosystem service (temperature regulation, stormwater absorption, and carbon storage) deprivation in Manchester, UK. Poorly performing UES areas are defined as the lowest 10% combined ecosystem service indicator values ('coldspots') at 100m grid resolution. Coldspots are compared to population demand levels, disaggregated from weighted population estimates, indicating neighbourhoods deprived of UES. Ambiguity in proxy method implementation is examined using combinations of UES parameter settings (n = 16) within various demand measures (n = 3) to measure changes in relationships between UES, and variation in final map outputs across the study area. Uncertainty is therefore quantified as an interactive process, whereby input parameter ambiguity affects local uncertainty in map outputs, due to varying landcover composition. As explicit sensitivity analysis in current UES mapping studies is limited, the study demonstrates how ambiguity in method parameterisation may impact UES mapping exercises. Complex interactions governing spatial variance in map uncertainty may therefore be addressed through identification of consistent areas of interest (e.g. hotspots, coldspots) by contrasting outputs realised from different parameterisations. As such, the study demonstrates the mapping approach as a transferable citywide visualisation tool, using accessible data and methods, to investigate regulating UES deprivation at practical scales required to retrofit existing urban infrastructure with green-blue infrastructure investment.

AB  - The composition of the bacterial community of carrageenophyte-attached and planktonic bacteria was studied in two bays of Vietnam with contrasting anthropogenic inputs to assess their role as ecological indicators. Clear differences (similar to 73% dissimilarity) between carrageenophyte-attached bacteria and bacterioplankton were detected in terms of genus composition: mainly Agaribacter, Ruegeria, Alteromonas, the Pir4 lineage and Vibrio for the carrageenophytes and Candidatus Actinomarina, HIMB 11, NS groups and SAR Glades for the bacterioplankton. The copiotrophic nature, potential for complex-polymer degradation, and ability to form and defend biofilms were common features inferred for the carrageenophyte-attached microbiome. Significant differences between the bays were detected in the concentration of most inorganic nutrients. More eutrophic conditions and presumptive wastewater pollution in Cam Ranh (CR) bay were primarily indicated by the dominance of Rubripirellula, Leptobacterium, Hypnocyclicus and Porphyrobacter and their correlations with phosphate. In terms of bacterioplankton, the influence of intensive aquaculture in CR bay was suggested by the dominance of the N55 and N54 marine groups, the SUP05 cluster, Flavobacteriaceae unclassified and SAR 11 Glade III as well as their strong correlations with ammonium and phosphate. The link between silicate and other inorganic nutrients suggests freshwater input in CR bay. Arenicellaceae unclassified and Formosa were also potential indicators of eutrophication. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of Marinagarivorans, Cobetia, Vibrio, Alteromonas and Pseudoalteromonas were typical of the carrageenophytes showing ice-ice disease symptoms. Vibrio and Alteromonas were also common among healthy macroalgae, and differences at the OTU level suggested potential succession of species from the healthy to the diseased state. The probable beneficial roles of some bacteria, such as Ruegeria, Cutibacterium and unidentified members of the family Rhizobiaceae, were discussed. This study provides pioneering insights into the bacterial community composition of carrageenophytes and highlights their ecological value as strong indicators of the sources of organic matter, anthropogenic impacts and health status of marine systems.

AB  - The use of lipid biomarkers as paleoenvironmental proxies relies on an accurate assessment of their organic matter (OM) sources. In this study, we analyzed multiple lipids in core sediments recovered from the Zhejiang-Fujian coastal mud area to provide a 160-year record of OM input to the East China Sea (ECS) coastal sediments and to reconstruct paleoenvironmental conditions over this interval. The molecular composition of the samples was characterized by a mixture of natural lipids, particularly those derived from terrestrial vascular plants, marine/riverine plankton and macrophytes, and bacteria. The sources of some lipid components were ambiguous/mixed as they were potentially derived from multiple precursor organisms and because of limitations associated with modern survey techniques. There is evidence that early diagenesis caused the preferential degradation of labile aquatic lipids and that the degradation of terrestrial lipids was more severe when subjected to complex horizontal-vertical transportation processes associated with deposition, resuspension, and redeposition. These processes may have led to an enhanced terrestrial OM signal in the normal (n)-alkane and n-alkanol records, which is at odds with, for example, those of the n-fatty acids, hopanoids, steranes, and sterols, which suggest a dominant marine OM source. Furthermore, we conclude that the occurrence of multiple sources, selective diagenesis, and test error has led to the distortion of redox and maturity indicators based on evidence from pristane-to-phytane (Pr/Ph) ratios and sterane/hopane indices in century scale. Overall, the phytol record suggests an increase in productivity after the early 20th century. Correspondingly, the diatom lipid biomarker records (based on C-25 highly branched isoprenoid alkenes and C-18:1 omega 9 fatty acids) reveal a fluctuating but overall increasing diatom productivity after the early 20th century, which coincides with a decreased proportion of the contribution from diatoms relative to that of total phytoplankton. This is believed to correspond to natural environmental changes, as well as anthropogenic impact.

AB  - Respiratory disease symptoms in children are aggravated by frequent changes in meteorological conditions. The net effective temperature (NET) integrates temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed as a cooling indicator. This study aims to assess the effect of daily changes in meteorological factors and corresponding NET data on children's hospitalizations for different ages, genders and subtypes of respiratory infections in Baotou, China. Distributed lag non-linear models were constructed to simultaneously assess the exposure-response associations between daily admission counts of children with respiratory diseases and daily NET and other meteorological factors, as well as their lag dependencies. As air pollution significantly affects the respiratory tract, it was considered as confounding factor. In general, the cumulative meteorological factors had greater effects on lower respiratory tract infections than upper respiratory tract infections (RR: temperature [5.21 vs. 2.33], wind speed [4.89 vs. 3.12], and humidity [1.77 vs. 0.97]). The effects of cumulative meteorological factors on female children were greater than those on male children (RR: temperature [2.14 vs. 1.82], wind speed [5.46 vs. 1.90], and humidity [1.60 vs. 1.55]). Temperature and wind speed showed an influence on 4-7-year-old children, but these factors had no influence on other age groups; humidity only showed an influence on the 0-3-year-old group. The NET value had a large effect on lower respiratory infections, in the 4-7-year-old group and female children. In conclusion, a complex non-linear relationship exists between climate variability and children's respiratory diseases. The results of the study can be used to support the development of important meteorological information tools for early warnings of respiratory disease events in children. Concurrently, the NET values can be used for comprehensive assessments of climate change in the future, which will help the government and health authorities better minimize the impacts of children's respiratory diseases.

AB  - Ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE) is a key indicator that depicts the carbon-water coupling relationship in terrestrial ecosystems. Separating the effects of climate change and human activities to the variation in WUE are essential for water resources and ecosystem management, especially for fragile ecosystems such as the Tibetan Plateau (TP). In this study, we introduced an analytical framework that combined the attribution approach with the elastic coefficient separation method to assess the impact of climate change and human activities on WUE variation in the TP from 1982 to 2015. The results are the following: (1) the multiyear mean annual WUE over the TP was 0.65 g C.kg(-1) H2O and had a slightly increasing trend with a slope of 0.004 g C.kg(-1) H2O yr(-1) with about 87% of the vegetated area showed increasing trend. (2) WUE was positively correlated with temperature, precipitation and air pressure. The northwest TP tends to be a water-limited condition, while the thermal stress is spatially universal in the TP, climate warming and wetting promoted the gross primary productivity (GPP) and WUE enhancement in the TP. (3) WUE was more sensitive to GPP, and variation in WUE was mainly contributed by GPP. Climate change and human activities tend to cause more variations in GPP rather than evapotranspiration (ET), but great differences exist for different regions and vegetation types. (4) There was a good consistency between the WUE variation calculated by the framework and the actual WUE variation (R-2 = 0.95). Climate change dominated the increase of WUE in the TP with a contribution rate of 79.8%, while human activities tend to reduce WUE (-20.2%). Ecological projects played a positive role in the ecological restoration of the TP, but there may be other human activities, which caused ecological degradation, that may need more attention in future ecological protections.

AB  - The model SYNOPS was developed to calculate national risk indicators for assessing the aquatic and terrestrial risk potential of pesticides in Germany. For Switzerland, a national aquatic risk indicator is currently being developed based on SYNOPS. It aims at evaluating long-term trends in aquatic risks based on changing pesticide usage and risk mitigation measures. In a first step, parameters of the fate models of SYNOPS were parametrized for the Swiss geographical context. Apart from data about pesticides and their specific usage, SYNOPS requires information about climate, soil and site-specific properties and crop stage. Based on these inputs, SYNOPS calculates the predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) of pesticides in water bodies and the associated exposure-toxicity-ratios (i.e., risks). To consider the effects of risk mitigation measures in risk indicators, a realistic representation of the contribution of different routes of entry (run-off, erosion, drainage, drift) is essential. To parametrize SYNOPS, a sensitivity analysis of the aquatic transport and fate models of SYNOPS was conducted: realistic ranges of Swiss-specific parameters and their combinations were defined and used as input for the sensitivity analysis. The impacts of input parameters on total PEC values and on the contribution of different routes of entry were analyzed. The sensitivity analysis revealed that slope and K-OC were the parameters with the highest impact on pesticide concentration and that run-off was the dominant route of entry in most tested scenarios. From over 40,000 tested environmental scenarios, a reduced set of 75-113 environmental scenarios was finally selected, which predicted similar PEC values and comparable contributions of different routes of entry compared with the full set. With the parametrization and reduction of used environmental scenarios, fate calculations became more efficient and realistic for Swiss conditions. The findings of this study provide a solid basis for developing a national aquatic risk indicator using SYNOPS. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - There has been a growing interest in studying the labile C pool in order to promote the sequestration and stabilization of soil organic carbon (SOC). Although labile SOC fractions have emerged as standardized indicators because of their potential to detect early SOC trends over time, the relationships between microbial attributes and labile SOC remains poorly understood. In this study, we explored the influence of labile SOC fractions on the topsoil bacteria-archaea community across 28 sites with different land use, climate aridity, and soil types across a wide range of SOC content (0.6-12%) in central Chile. We applied Illumina sequencing to the 16S rRNA to examine shifts in the diversity and composition of these soil microbial communities. Additionally, labile SOC fractions such as the permanganate oxidizable carbon (PDXC) and light fraction organic matter (LFOM), along with the soil physicochemical properties were analyzed. The results demonstrated that among all of the environmental factors tested, the pH, PDXC/SOC ratio and LFOM were key drivers of microbial community structure (beta-diversity). The alpha-diversity metrics exhibited a decreasing trend when aridity increased, and community structure was found to vary, with high PDXC/SOC in sites associated with drier conditions. In addition, PDXC/SOC ratios and LFOM were clearly related to shifts in the relative abundances of specific taxonomic groups at genera level. When there was high PDXC/SOC and low LFOM content, members of Bacteroidetes (Adhaeribacter, Flavisolibacter, and Niastella), Proteobacteria (Skermanella, Ramlibacter, and Sphingomonas), and Archaea (Thaumarchaeota) were found to be the most dominant groups; however, the microbial taxa responded differently to both labile C fraction types. These results have implications for understanding how labile C content can potentially be used to predict shifts in the microbial community, thus facilitating the development of predictive ecosystem models, as well as early warning indicators for soil degradation.

AB  - The Say'un-Masila rift, one of the most important basins of Yemen, contains unconventional resources of organic-rich rocks. In the present work, geochemical and palynofacies analyses were performed on the organic-rich source rock (argillaceous limestone) of the late Jurassic-early Cretaceous Naifa Formation in the Say'un-Masila Rift Basin to investigate its hydrocarbon generation potential. The geochemical analysis of the organic matter reveals that the argillaceous limestone unit has total organic carbon contents of 0.5-2.6%, which indicate fair to good hydrocarbon source potential. The organic matter in the analyzed samples is dominated by Type II/III and Type III kerogens, with minor Type II kerogen, referring to both oil- and gas-prone source rocks. The dominant kerogen Types II/III and Type III are indicated further from quantitative results based on an open pyrolysis-gas chromatography analysis. Biological markers and palynofacies analysis suggest that the kerogen was formed through a combination of mixed marine and high land plant organic matter and was preserved under sub-oxic sedimentary conditions. The different geochemical and optical maturity parameters indicate that the analyzed argillaceous limestone of the Naifa Formation is thermally mature, equivalent to early mature of oil-generation window. This implies that the burial depth of the analyzed samples is not deep enough; therefore, only the deeper parts of the Naifa source rocks at the basin have reached a satisfactory maturity level to be considered as potentially effective petroleum source rock. The biomarker source and depositional environment indicators presented and discussed in this study are useful for future exploration in the Say'un-Masila Basin for oil-to-oil and oil-to-source geochemical correlations and offer guidance for potential prospecting targets that may occur within the basin.

AB  - Background. Though many studies have long considered the broad social implications of climate change, researchers have only recently started to consider the gendered unevenness of the global landscape of vulnerability, exposure, and adaptive capacity to environmental stressors and shocks. Historically, policies and interventions addressing natural resource-based livelihoods have rarely considered underlying gender dynamics despite the global pervasiveness of gendered disparities in both economic opportunities and welfare outcomes. Methods/Design. Using two electronic databases, Web of Science and Scopus, we conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed academic literature describing livelihoods policies or interventions that included documentation of gendered impacts. We focused on natural resource-based livelihoods most likely to be affected by climate change, centering on interventions targeting agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture, and forestry. Review Results/Synthesis. We identified 131 relevant articles, most of which focus on adoption or participation in interventions rather than outcomes. In general, women are less likely than men to engage with sustainable livelihoods interventions. When women do engage, some researchers have documented income and food security gains as well as improvements in environmental indicators in the short-term. However, these initiatives have also been found to increase women's labor burden without corresponding gains in income. Few studies measure longer-term effects of women's engagement on welfare and environmental outcomes, a key gap in the literature. Additionally, relatively few studies explore the intersectional impacts of initiatives, such as the added burdens of ethnicity, class, education, or other differences that modify gender disparities. Discussion. Climate change has gendered impacts on natural resource-based livelihoods. In general, existing initiatives designed to increase livelihood resilience fail to reduce gender disparities and improve women's livelihoods. Greater attention should be paid to gender when designing sustainable livelihoods policies and interventions in order to increase adoption and participation, negotiate trade-offs, improve environmental conditions, and promote broadly beneficial welfare outcomes.

AB  - Recently, anthropogenic enrichment of rare earth elements (REEs) have been reported in natural environments clue to increasing use and discharges of hospital, industrial wastewaters. Gadolinium (Gd), which is mainly used as contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging in medical exams, may reach concentrations in water up to two orders of magnitude larger than baseline levels. Nevertheless, in marine systems scarce information is available concerning the toxicity of RLE towards inhabiting organisms. This study aimed to evaluate the biochemical impact of anthropogenic Gd in the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, which is a species of commercial interest and one of the most accepted pollution bioindicator Organisms were exposed to different concentrations of Gd (0, 15, 30, 60, 120 mu g/L) for 28 days. At the end of the experiments, biomarkers related to mussels metabolic (electron transport system activity and energy reserves content), oxidative stress status (cellular damage and the activity of antioxidant and biotransformation enzymes) and neurotoxic effects (activity of the enzyme Acetylcholinesterase) were measured, as well as Gd bioconcentration in organisms. Results showed a high content of Gd (2.5 +/- 0.50 mu g/g) in mussels exposed to the highest concentration, contrary to those at control condition and at 15 and 30 mu g/L of Gd (levels below 0.38 mu g/g). Although no mortality was observed during the experimental period, exposure to Gd strongly affected the biochemical performance of M. galloprovincialis, including the decrease on mussels' metabolism, induction of oxidative stress and neurotoxicity, particularly evidenced at intermediate concentrations. These results may indicate that up to certain stressful levels, although lowering their metabolism, organisms may be able to activate defence strategies to avoid cellular injuries which, on the other hand, may compromise mussels physiological performance such as growth and reproduction success. Nevertheless, our findings support that the widespread utilization of Gd may represent an environmental risk in the future. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Chaco vegetation is conditioned by several environmental pressures affecting the physiognomy of the landscape. With the aim to recognize the spatial changes of vegetation and distinguish indicators of natural (floods, droughts) and/or anthropogenic disturbances (fires, weeds of crops and grazing), we analyzed the composition and distribution of pollen assemblages of surface sediments along an environmental in the north of Argentine Chaco region (23 degrees-27 degrees S, 59 degrees-63 degrees W). Thirty-five samples were taken into an environmental gradient comprising 600 km length in SE-NW direction. The analyses was performed by multivariate methods and the importance value index (IVI). Zonation showed a gradual replacement of biotypes and taxa. In the Eastern zone, the pollen of pahns (Copernica alba), herbs (Poaceae) and high trees (Schinopsis balansae) were dominant. Towards the middle zone, the pollen of low trees (Schinus, Prosopis ruscifolia, Pisonia zapallo), shrubs (Celtis, Castela) and herbs (Amaranthaceae/Chenopodiaceae, Poaceae) were dominant. The western zone recorded the highest content of pollen of high trees (Schinopsis balansae, Schinopsis lorentzii, Astronium). Pollen types were detected that allowed to discern environmental contingencies, such as floods (Copernicia alba, Juncaginaceae, Cyperaceae) and anthropic activities, such as fires (Trithrinar, Shinus, Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco), weeds of crops (Amaranthacea/Chenopodiaceae, Gomphrena, Urticaceae, Ambrosia)and grazing (Prosopis ruscifolia, Prosopis kunitzei, Capparicordis,Cerciduim praecox). The most important pollen types were: Schinopsis balansae (9 %), Celtis (8.4 %), Poaceae (7.5 %), Schinus (6.9 %), Copernicia alba (3.7 %), among others. Three pollen assemblages were differentiated which represent the follow communities: 1) palms and savannas, 2) low forests and scrublands and 3) high forests, that are distributed in precipitation thresholds corresponding to, 1 100 - 1000, 1 000 - 850 and 850 - 700 mm respectively. Results expand the knowledge about the pollen assemblages of the Argentine Chaco region, offering a good perspective to interpret the dynamic of the landscape during the Holocene in the region.

AB  - 1. Despite increasing policies of protection, few localities in the Caribbean remain spared from human impacts. These lightly affected areas can better reflect the past composition of reef fish assemblages and provide baseline information about the natural factors driving fish distributions in the region. 2. Reef fish assemblage structures were analysed in 21 Caribbean fished areas and marine protected areas (MPAs) along a gradient of distance to the nearest major market place. Assemblage structures by size and by trophic group were significantly related to the distance to market. 3. Relationships of reef fish life-history traits, families, and vulnerability indicators were examined with the seascape and the benthic composition at Los Roques Archipelago, the most isolated MPA in the analysis. Factors linked to seascape features were more important than benthic composition or human activities in explaining fish assemblage structure. 4. Wave exposure was the most influential seascape metric. Exposed habitats were dominated by octocorals and sponges. More sheltered habitats were characterized by high coral cover, while leeward sites were characterized by steep slopes with close proximity to deeper water. 5. Exposed habitats were mostly occupied by unspecialized fish species. Piscivore densities were high at south and south-west sites, and were likely related to the large concentrations of planktivorous fishes found there. South and south-west sites experience full oceanic conditions, and supported the highest species richness and densities within the archipelago. 6. Los Roques National Park is one of the oldest and most remote Caribbean MPAs. Its fish assemblage structure is healthier than other fished or protected areas, with higher species richness, higher density of piscivores, and an abundance of large species. Predator-prey relationships provided additional evidence that Los Roques reef fish assemblage presented specific characteristics. 7. The main patterns observed in this study represent a baseline for assessing reef fish assemblages elsewhere in the southern Caribbean.

AB  - Hazard assessment of chemical contaminants often relies on short term or partial life-cycle ecotoxicological tests, while the impact of low dose throughout the entire life cycle of species across multiple generations has been neglected. This study aimed at identifying the individual and population-level consequences of chronic water contamination by environmental concentrations of three organic micropollutants, ibuprofen, bisphenol A and benzo[a]pyrene, on Aedes aegypti mosquito populations in experimental conditions. Life-history assays spanning the full life-cycle of exposed individuals and their progeny associated with population dynamics modelling evidenced life-history traits alterations in unexposed progenies of individuals chronically exposed to 1 a ibuprofen or 0.6 a benzo[a]pyrene. The progeny of individuals exposed to ibuprofen showed an accelerated development while the progeny of individuals exposed to benzo[a]pyrene showed a developmental acceleration associated with an increase in mortality rate during development. These life-history changes due to pollutants exposure resulted in relatively shallow increase of Ae. aegypti asymptotic population growth rate. Multigenerational exposure for six generations revealed an evolution of population response to ibuprofen and benzo[a]pyrene across generations, leading to a loss of previously identified transgenerational effects and to the emergence of a tolerance to the bioinsecticide Bacillus turingiensis israelensis (Bti). This study shed light on the short and long term impact of environmentally relevant doses of ibuprofen and benzo[a]pyrene on Ae. aegypti life history traits and insecticide tolerance, raising unprecedented perspectives about the influence of surface water pollution on vector-control strategies. Overall, our approach highlights the importance of considering the entire life cycle of organisms, and the necessity to assess the transgenerational effects of pollutants in ecotoxicological studies for ecological risk assessment. Finally, this multi-generational study gives new insight about the influence of surface water pollution on microevolutionary processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is a gradual change towards explicitly considering landscapes in regulatory risk assessment. To realise the objective of developing representative scenarios for risk assessment it is necessary to know how detailed a landscape representation is needed to generate a realistic risk assessment, and indeed how to generate such landscapes. This paper evaluates the contribution of landscape and farming components to a model based risk assessment of a fictitious endocrine disruptor on hares. In addition, we present methods and code examples for generation of landscape structures and farming simulation from data collected primarily for EU agricultural subsidy support and GIS map data.
   Ten different Danish landscapes were generated and the ERA carried out for each landscape using two different assumed toxicities. The results showed negative impacts in all cases, but the extent and formin terms of impacts on abundance or occupancy differed greatly between landscapes. A meta-model was created, predicting impact from landscape and farming characteristics. Scenarios based on all combinations of farming and landscape for five landscapes representing extreme and middle impacts were created. The meta-models developed from the 10 real landscapes failed to predict impacts for these 25 scenarios. Landscape, farming, and the emergent density of hares all influenced the results of the risk assessment considerably.
   The study indicates that prediction of a reasonable worst case scenario is difficult from structural, farming or population metrics; rather the emergent properties generated from interactions between landscape, management and ecology are needed. Meta-modelling may also fail to predict impacts, even when restricting inputs to combinations of those used to create the model. Future ERA may therefore need to make use of multiple scenarios representing a wide range of conditions to avoid locally unacceptable risks. This approach could now be feasible Europe wide given the landscape generation methods presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, dam management guidelines need to estimate the effects of downstream flow on environment. However, high-flowalters physical conditions such as water depth, flow velocity and water temperature in the downstream side of the river. These changes will lead to alteration in fish habitat of the river. In this paper, an eco-hydraulic model was used to determine the levels of fish habitat in the Colorado River downstream from the Glen Canyon Dam. This model has been proposed by combining hydrodynamic and heat transfer model with a habitat suitability index model based on fish preference curves. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and flannelmouth sucker (Catostomus latipinnis) were chosen as target species because they represent both native and non-native fish in the study area. Flow velocity, water depth and water temperature were selected as the suitability indicators. The hydrological data from three high-flow experiments were analyzed to determine the effects of high-flow on the Colorado River ecosystem. Numerical model simulations were undertaken as follows: firstly, based on the hydrodynamic and heat transfer equation, three hydraulic factors including water depth, velocity and temperature distribution were simulated and the associated suitability for each was obtained based on the fish preference curves. Later, the habitat suitability equation was developed to simulate the target species' habitat situation in high flow effects. Finally, the WUA (weighted usable area) and OSI (overall suitability index) of the spawning fish species were quantitatively calculated to evaluate the sensitivity of the high flow. The results show that the effects of three HFE are more severe in spawning flannelmouth sucker than in spawning rainbow trout. It is worth noting that the one day HFE was beneficial to spawning rainbow trout and harmful to spawning flannelmouth sucker but in the HFE of more than 8 days, both the spawning habitats were completely destroyed.

AB  - The Tarium Niryutait MPA (TNMPA) was created in 2010, through the collaborative efforts of Fisheries and Oceans Canada, the Inuvialuit, private industry and local stakeholders. The purpose of the TNMPA is to conserve and protect the biological resources within the Mackenzie Estuary, ensuring viability of a healthy population of beluga whales. TNMPA regulations allow for the conduct of certain industry activities (e.g., dredging, transportation, and hydrocarbon exploration and production activity), as long as disturbance, damage, destruction or removal of belugas do not occur or are not expected. Our goal is to summarize baseline knowledge of the times, areas and patterns of aggregation of belugas in the TNMPA, to inform future monitoring, research and environmental assessments of any developments proposed for the TNMPA. Sightings of surfaced belugas in the Mackenzie River estuary made during seven summers of aerial surveys between 1977 and 1992 were examined using contemporary geospatial analytical methods. A total of 77 aerial surveys met the minimum criteria for inclusion: flown in their entirety, without interruption, under calm sea conditions, and with full visibility. The distribution of surfaced belugas was significantly clustered in three time periods (June 26 July 9, July 10-20, July 21-31) and in all sub areas of the TNMPA (Ripley's L, p <0.0001). Sighting rates varied by subarea and time period, with Niaqunnaq Bay having rates 3-4 times higher (p < 0.0001) in the corresponding period, compared with West Mackenzie (WM), East Mackenzie (EM) and Kugmallit (KB) bays, in all but WM in late July. During early and mid-July of 1977-1985, belugas were aggregated in seven localized, recurrent geographic areas within the TNMPA, termed here as 'hot spots'. Results will foster more confident and informed decisions about the acceptability of proposed industry activities in the TNMPA, ensuring assessments are evidence-based and not unnecessary restrictive.

AB  - Thermal environment is a major factor that can negatively affect cow performance, especially in animals of high genetic value. Environmental conditions and in particular seasonal variations in air temperature and relative humidity are considered physiological stressors which affect the animal's biological system. The effect of seasonal variation (winter, spring, summer and autumn) on some haematochemical parameters was evaluated on 43 multiparous Piemontese cows (5-12 years, mean body weight 530+/-78 kg), obtained from a farm located in Sicily, Italy (latitude 36 degrees 53' 27 '' N, longitude 15 degrees 4' 37 '' E, 152 m above sea level). For each season, ambient temperature and relative humidity were recorded by means of a data logger. The temperature-humidity index (THI) was also calculated as indicator of thermal comfort for animals. Blood samples were collected from each subject in January (T1 - winter season), April (T2 - spring season), July (T3 - summer season) and October (T4 - autumn season). Sera obtained were assessed by means of an automated analyzer UV Spectrophotometer (SEAC, Slim, Florence, Italy) on the following hematochemical parameters: total protein (TP), albumin, globulin, creatinine, urea, total bilirubin (TB), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT). One-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to determine significant effects of time on haematochemical parameters studied. P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The results obtained showed a statistical significant effect of time on: total protein (P<0.0001), albumin (P=0.01), globulin (P<0.0001), creatinine (P<0.0001), urea (P<0.0001), total bilirubin (P<0.0001), gamma-glutamyitransferase (P<0.0001), aspartate aminotransferase (P<0.0001) and alanine aminotransferase (P<0.0001).
   Our results showed variations in haematochemical parameters related to changes in ambient temperature, relative humidity and temperature-humidity index, although within the physiological range for cattle. Therefore, we can claim that the seasonal variations can influence the metabolic profile of Piemontese cow. These results provide insights into physiological responses of Piemontese cow to different seasons, allowing to better evaluate its ability to adapt and cope with environmental stress.

AB  - Background: Major Depressive Disorder is one of the most challenging mental health problems of our time. Although effective psychotherapeutic treatments are available, many patients fail to demonstrate clinically significant improvements. Difficulties in emotion regulation have been identified as putative risk and maintaining factors for Major Depressive Disorder. Systematically enhancing adaptive emotion regulation skills should thus help reduce depressive symptom severity. However, at this point, no study has systematically evaluated effects of increasing adaptive emotion regulation skills application on symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder. In the intended study, we aim to evaluate stand-alone effects of a group-based training explicitly and exclusively targeting general emotion regulation skills on depressive symptom severity and assess whether this training augments the outcome of subsequent individual cognitive behavioral therapy for depression.
   Methods/Design: In the evaluation of the Affect Regulation Training, we will conduct a prospective randomized-controlled trial. Effects of the Affect Regulation Training on depressive symptom severity and outcomes of subsequent individual therapy for depression will be compared with an active, common factor based treatment and a waitlist control condition. The study sample will include 120 outpatients meeting criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. Depressive symptom severity as assessed by the Hamilton Rating Scale will serve as our primary study outcome. Secondary outcomes will include further indicators of mental health and changes in adaptive emotion regulation skills application. All outcomes will be assessed at intake and at 10 points in time over the course of the 15-month study period. Measures will include self-reports, observer ratings, momentary ecological assessments, and will be complemented in subsamples by experimental investigations and the analysis of hair steroids.
   Discussion: If findings should support the hypothesis that enhancing regulation skills reduces symptom severity in Major Depressive Disorder, systematic emotion regulation skills training can enhance the efficacy and efficiency of current treatments for this severe and highly prevalent disorder.

AB  - This study is an attempt to use closely related inter-complementary paleo-archives of a local landscape to access understanding of Late Pleistocene-Holocene environmental changes in the region. The study site is a small intermountain basin in the Sayan-Tuva Upland, 51 degrees N., 97 degrees E., 1300 m a.s.l. Paleo-archives covering about 13,000 yrs were studied: paleosol-sedimentary sequences on a delta-alluvial fan of a small river, lacustrine sediments in bottom cores and on palsa-islands and soils of palsa-islands. The following sequence of environmental changes was established. The fluvial activity in the basin reached its maximum at the end of the Late Pleistocene. The sharp decrease of the fluvial activity is terminated by two successive paleosols of Pleistocene-Holocene transition. The older paleosol indicates meadow-steppe (or tundra-steppe) conditions with a shallow permafrost table and impeded drainage. The younger paleosol testifies on sharp aridization, biological activity suppression, contrasting water regime, and warming. Dammed lake appeared in the midst of the trough about 11,000 cal yr BP. Sedimentation on delta-alluvial fan was fairly inconsiderable in Holocene. The first part of Holocene (before 4000 cal yr BP) was most balanced in annual distribution of precipitation. Runoff, even being prominently enhanced in a fluvial and relatively warm sub-phase 8000-6250 cal yr BP, was canalized, without giving seasonal floods. Sub-phase 6250-3800 is characterized by increased continentality and relative aridization caused reduction of runoff, lowering of the lake level, and enhancement of cryogenic processes. The next phase 3800-2000 cal yr BP was more humid. It caused slight revival of fluvial processes and rise of lake level. The last 2000 years climate was more continental and the most arid within the studied period. The lake level and runoff values dropped again, and fluvial activity totally decreased. In contemporary soils aridization is reflected in widely spread Natric features and progressive salinization. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The integrated use of hydrogeologic and multi-isotopic approaches (delta N-15, delta O-18(NO3), delta S-34, delta O-18(SO4) and delta C-13(HCO3)) was applied in the Selva basin area (NE Spain) to characterize NO3- and SO42- sources and to evaluate which geochemical processes affect NO3- in groundwater. The studied basin is within a basin-and-range physiographic province where natural hydrodynamics have been modified and different scale flow systems converge as a consequence of recent groundwater development and exploitation rates. As a result, groundwaters related to the local recharge flow system (affected by anthropogenic activities) and to the generally deeper regional flow system (recharged from the surrounding ranges) undergo mixing processes. The delta N-15, delta O-18(NO3) and delta S-34 indicated that the predominant sources of contamination in the basin are pig manure and synthetic fertilizers. Hydrochemical data along with delta N-15, delta O-18(NO3), delta S-34, delta O-18(SO4) and delta C-13(HCO3) of some wells confirmed mixing between regional and local flow systems. Apart from dilution processes that can contribute to the decrease of NO3- concentrations, the positive correlation between delta N-15 and delta O-18(NO3) agreed with the occurrence of denitrification processes. The delta S-34 and delta O-18(SO4) indicated that pyrite oxidation is not linked to denitrification, and delta C-13(HCO3) did not clearly point to a role of organic matter as an electron donor. Therefore, it is proposed that the mixing processes between deeper regional and local surface groundwater allow denitrification to occur due to the reducing conditions of the regional groundwater. Thus, isotopic data add useful complementary information to hydrochemical studies, especially in those areas where hydrochemical data is not conclusive. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Geochemical investigations of tidal flat coastal sediments at Ogori, Ozuki, and Kasado in Yamaguchi Bay of southwest Japan were conducted to determine their metal concentrations and to assess contamination levels, compared with sediment quality guidelines (SQG) and several pollutant indicators. Selected major oxides, trace elements, and total sulfur (TS) were determined by X-ray fluorescence. pH values of most samples were alkaline, indicating anoxic conditions. Average abundances of As, Pb, Zn, Cu, Ni, and Cr in Ozuki sediments were 11, 27, 109, 21, 19, and 52 mg/kg, respectively, compared to 9, 29, 80, 16, 18, and 42 mg/kg at Ogori and 12, 27, 151, 34, 30 and 80 mg/kg at Kasado, respectively. Average concentrations of As, Zn, and Cu in all samples and TiO2, Fe2O3, and P2O5 at Kasado were greater than those of the upper continental crust. Contamination levels were assessed based on SQG, contamination factors (CF), pollution load index (PLI), enrichment factor (EF), and index of geoaccumulation (Igeo). According to the SQG of the US EPA, the sediments were heavily polluted with respect to As, whereas Zn, Cu, Ni, and Cr were classed as moderately polluted. The elevated CF values of As, Pb, and Zn identify moderate to considerable contamination, indicating that these metals are potentially toxic in the study area. Based on PLI and EF, the study sites are moderate to moderately severe polluted with As and Pb, moderately polluted with Zn, and weakly contaminated to noncontaminated with Cu, Ni, and Cr. The highest Igeo values for As, Pb, and Zn in the surface and core sediments reflected the tendency of metal contamination that seems to be related to their fine-grained nature, organic matter-rich sediments, and anthropogenic point sources. Trace metal contents were strongly correlated with Fe2O3 and TiO2, suggesting that Fe oxyhydroxides and detrital clastic load play a role in controlling abundances in the study area.

AB  - There is an increasing concern over the safety of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) to humans and the environment and it is likely that the environmental risks of these particles will have to be tested under regulatory schemes Such as REACH. Due to their unique properties and the fact that their detection and characterisation in complex matrices is challenging, existing analytical methods and test approaches for assessing environmental risk may not be appropriate for ENPs. In this article we discuss the challenges associated with the testing of ENPs to generate data on persistence, mobility, bioavailability and ecotoxicity in the environment. It is essential that careful consideration is given to the selection of the test material, the test system (including test vessels and study media) and the test exposure conditions. During a study it is critical that not only the concentration of the ENP is determined but also its characteristics (e.g. size, shape, degree of aggregation and dissolution). A range of analytical techniques is available including microscopy-based approaches (e.g transmission and scanning electron microscopy), dynamic light scattering, and size separation approaches (e.g. field flow fractionation and hydrodynamic chromatography) coupled to detection methods such as inductively Coupled plasma MS. All of these have their disadvantages: some are unable to distinguish between ENPs and natural interferences; some techniques require sample preparation approaches that can introduce artefacts; and others are complex and time-consuming. A combination of techniques is therefore needed. Our knowledge in this area is still limited, and co-ordinated research is required to gain a better understanding of the factors and processes affecting ENP fate and effects in the environment as well as to develop more usable, robust and sensitive methods for characterisation and detection of ENPs in environmental systems.

AB  - Direct measurement of the accumulation of non-radioactive trace elements in aquatic biota near uranium mining or processing sites has been relatively rare, with greater focus on the radiological activity in the adjacent soils and groundwater. To evaluate the potential ecological concern associated with trace elements at a former uranium mill site in southeastern Utah, benthic macroinvertebrates were collected and analyzed for 17 trace elements from multiple locations within a small on-site stream, Montezuma Creek, and a nearby reference stream. Key questions of this study relate to the spatial and temporal extent of contamination in aquatic biota, the potential ecological risks associated with that contamination, and the usefulness of benthic macroinvertebrates as a monitoring tool at this site. Composite samples of similar macroinvertebrate taxa and functional feeding groups were collected from each site over a two year period that was representative of normal and dry-year conditions. In both years, mean concentrations of arsenic, molybdenum, selenium, and vanadium were significantly higher (a factor of 2-4 times; P < 0.05) in macroinvertebrates collected from one or both of the two Montezuma Creek sites immediately downstream of the mill tailing site in comparison to concentrations from reference locations. Mean uranium concentrations in invertebrates immediately downstream of the mill site were more than 10 times higher than at reference sites. The site-to-site pattern of contamination in Montezuma Creek invertebrates was similar in 1995 and 1996, with mill-related trace elements showing a downstream decreasing trend. However, nine of seventeen contaminant concentrations were higher in the second year of the study, possibly due to a higher influx of deep groundwater during the drier second year of the study. A preliminary assessment of ecological risks, based on the benthic macroinvertebrate bioaccumulation data, suggests that aquatic and terrestrial population risks are low. Benthic macroinvertebrates appeared to be sensitive integrators of trace element inputs to the aquatic environment from a former uranium mill tailing site, and provided useful spatial and temporal patterns of contamination not easily obtained using conventional surface water or groundwater measures.

AB  - Rock fragments (RFs, material particles with diameter > 2 mm) are widely distributed in soils over globe. However, spatial pattern of RF content (RFC) and its roles on hydrological and ecological patterns have remained unclear at the global scale. In this study, based on the collected global datasets, we investigated the relationships between mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP), elevation and RFC at 0-5 cm soil depth. In addition, we also examined the links of RFC to representative hydrological and ecological indicators (soil water content or SWC, and normalized difference vegetation index or NDVI, respectively). Results showed that through affecting the pedogenic and morphogenic processes, temperature, precipitation and elevation presented significant relationships with RFC over the globe. When MAT < 20 degrees C, RFC decreased with MAT increasing, due to that high temperature could promote RF weathering and thus soil production; while when MAT > 20 degrees C, RFC slightly increased with MAT increasing, due to that extreme high temperature induced arid condition would surpass soil production. RFC decreased with MAP increasing, because precipitation increased SWC and hydrologic flow and thus enhanced soil production. In addition, higher elevation zones usually had colder condition and greater loss of fine-textured soils due to erosion, and thus RFC increased with elevation increasing. Furthermore, a RFC threshold of about 0.2 m(3) m(-3) was identified. When RFC < 0.2 m(3) m(-3), existence of RFs may improve the soil pore structure and thus water and nutrient retention capacity. Therefore, higher SWC and NDVI were observed. However, when RFC > 0.2 m(3) m(-3), due to poor soil water and nutrient retention capacity, as well as lower MAT with higher elevation, or lower MAP, lower SWC and NDVI were observed. These findings can supplement the lack of knowledge on RFs and its effects from the global perspective.

AB  - Drought can have pervasive and wide-spread impacts to forest health, as evidenced in several severe events occurring over the recent decades. Extensive forest die-off due to drought can impair the ecological functioning of forests, impacting habitat, water yield and quality from forested lands, and altering forest fire dynamics and intensity. Satellite remote sensing provides an effective means for detecting and monitoring spatial patterns of forest mortality over large areas, exploiting free and open long-term image archives available at a range in spatial and temporal resolutions. While remotely sensed surface reflectances and vegetation indices have been widely used to study optical response of forest canopies to drought events, retrievals of evapotranspiration (ET) derived from thermal satellite imagery - particularly at resolutions approaching crown scale can provide insights into cumulative tree stresses that can incite disease and trigger mortality. In this study, we applied a multi-sensor satellite data fusion approach to estimate daily 30-m resolution ET and an associated Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) to study drought-induced mortality in a temperate forest at the Missouri Ozark AmeriFlux (MOFLUX) site, located in the central United States. The study covered the period from 2010 to 2014, including an exceptional drought year of 2012. Modeled ET agreed well with eddy flux measurements from the MOFLUX tower, with average monthly relative errors of 15%. Plot-scale ESI, describing temporal anomalies in the ratio of actual-to-reference ET, was used as an index of relative forest health to investigate relationships between forest mortality and drought severity. ESI showed good agreement with observed predawn leaf water potential, especially during the drought year. Furthermore, plot scale ESI was also correlated with the subsequent year's tree mortality, suggesting the importance of considering the forest health condition prior to drought when studying drought-induced forest impacts. This study demonstrates the utility of multi-year ET remote sensing data at the stand or plot scale as an indicator of forest health and as a predictor of future mortality due to drought.

T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Damage caused to cultivated carrots by the hawthorn-carrot aphid, Dysaphis crataegi Kalt. (Hemiptera: Aphididae) is one of the factors limiting carrot production in Poland. Planting resistant and tolerant cultivars could reduce yield losses due to the damage caused by this pest. This study was conducted to evaluate the resistance and/or tolerance of 10 carrot genotypes to hawthorn-carrot aphid. Their field resistance was determined under field conditions based on five indicators, namely, mean number of alates (migrants) per plant and mean percentage of plants colonized by them, mean seasonal number of aphids per plant, mean number of aphids per plant and mean percentage of infested plants at peak abundance. Antibiosis experiments were conducted under laboratory conditions and pre-reproductive, reproductive time, fertility, and demographic parameters, represented by the net reproduction rate (R-o), intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) and mean generation time (T), were calculated. Five cultivars, Afro F-1, Nipomo F-1, Samba F-1, White Satin F-1, and Yellowstone showed field resistance. Antibiosis experiments revealed significant differences among the carrot cultivars in the length of the reproductive period, female fecundity in the time equal to the pre-reproduction time, and total progeny of hawthorn-carrot aphid. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)) for apterous aphids varied significantly, ranging between 0.181 (Nipomo F-1) and 0.343 females/female/day (White Satin F-1). Additionally, the estimated net reproductive rate (R-0) was the lowest on Nipomo F-1, and this genotype was determined to be resistant. Our results suggest that a very high density of trichomes on the leaf petioles (71.94 trichomes/cm(2)) could adversely affect the feeding, bionomy, and demographic parameters of hawthorn-carrot aphid on the cultivar Nipomo F-1. In addition, Napa F-1 and Kongo F-1 demonstrated high tolerance. Considering all the results collectively, four genotypes, Afro F-1, Kongo F-1, Napa F-1 and Nipomo F-1, were relatively resistant/tolerant to the hawthorn-carrot aphid.

AB  - Mineralogical, geochemical and the potentiality of source shale rocks in the Khabour Formation from the Akkas1 well, western Iraq and the Chia Zinnar section exposed in extreme northern Iraq were studied. Whole rock minerals observed are quartz, feldspars (labradorite, albite and orthoclase), pyrite and rare calcite. The main clay minerals observed in the studied shales are illite, chlorite, kaolinite, and mixed layer illite. SEM analysis shows that kaolinite is typically present as hexagonal plates and booklets, some of which are degraded, illite is commonly present as fibers and fine white flakes. Mixed layer illite is commonly observed as framboidal shapes while chlorite is observed as disc-shaped chlorite. Two samples from the upper, Hirnantian, part of the Akkas-1 well exhibit great differences from post Archean Australian shale (PAAS) in both major and trace element geochemistry. This is in contrast to the 13 other samples from the Akkas-1 well which have a trace element composition very close to PAAS. These differences are hard to interpret but they may record the impact of the Hirnantian glaciation. Common redox indicators (Th/U, Cu/Zn, V/Rb, Mn) all suggest an oxic environmental conditions prevailed during deposition of the Khabour Formation in the Akkas-1 well; this is supported by low TOC values. Khabour shales from the Akkas-1 well are organically lean (TOC 0.04-0.84%) and are late to post mature for oil generation. They represent poor sedimentary organic matter (SOM) but the presence of bitumen in the samples suggest source rocks do exist in this part of the succession. The studied samples from the Chia Zinnar section (extreme northern Iraq) are organically lean (TOC < 0.2%) and have no source potential. Acritarchs provide new age constraints for the Khabour Formation at outcrop in northern Iraq. Six samples from the Chia Zinnar section contain Tremadocian acritachs and are assigned to the PZ10 palynozone. The surface section is therefore a chronostratigraphical equivalent to the basal shale unit observed in the Akkas-1 well.

AB  - Lakes are particularly sensitive to environmental fluctuations, which are recorded in their facies and stratigraphy. Ephemeral lakes reveal their sensitivity to palaeoenvironmental changes in the overprinting of the sedimentary features in every single bed. Tetrapod-track taphonomic-modes and ichnological taphonomic-pathways can be used as sensitive indicators of environmental conditions of the track-bearing beds during deposition and imprinting. The Middle Triassic Cerro de las Cabras succession (Cuyana Basin, Argentina) provides an excellent opportunity to these environmental indicators in an underfilled palaeolake. A model of ichnological preservation for underfilled lake systems is proposed and the role of the ichnology record in the sequence stratigraphy analysis is evaluated, based on the integration of tetrapod-track modes, taphonomic-pathways of playa-lake ichnofauna, mineralogy and physical data. Soft-ground suites include those dominated by invertebrate grazing traces and arthropod locomotion traces (Suite 1), and those overprinted by horizontal-vertical dwelling burrows with tetrapod tracks preserved in taphonomic modes B and C (Suite 2). The firm-ground suite (Suite 3) comprises tetrapod-tracks with the best preservation styles (modes A and B) along less abundant invertebrate dwelling and feeding traces as found in Suite 2. Clay mineralogy (dominated by illite with subordinate smectite) suggests low plasticity of the layers, in agreement with low-relief deformation structures observed in tetrapod-track taphonomic-modes. The well-preserved track tetrapod features documented in the Cerro de las Cabras succession, together with the absence of pedogenic disturbance, trampling obliterating the footprints, and/or evidence of strong disturbance by wind, desiccation and/or precipitation, supports short periods of exposure of the imprinted surface particular to this succession. An integrated multiproxy approach is proposed to evaluate the evolutionary interpretation and identification of autogenic versus allogenic controls in underfilled lake-basin histories. The observed aggradational-trend suggests an equilibrium between rates of accommodation change and sediment supply, and that the basin-centre did not experience prolonged sediment-starved conditions.

AB  - Simple Summary In the current socioeconomic situation, consumers' concerns about farm animal welfare can prevent them from buying some products, and this influences the sustainability of intensive systems. Consumers perceive the need to increase the level of welfare in farm animals, despite the fact that their level of knowledge about farming and animal welfare issues is relatively low. Consumers concerns are not equally distributed among the different farm species, nor is there consistency in the willingness to pay to enhance animal welfare. Therefore, farmers, businesses, and members of the food chain need to be informed of the evolution of public perceptions and consumer concerns to make informed decisions that help them improve their sustainability, social responsibility, and public credibility, which will allow them to maintain their social license through social ethical approval.
   Abstract In this paper, we explore the evolution of consumers' perceptions and concerns about the effects that intensification of production systems could have on the welfare of farm animals. Despite the differences in definitions of animal welfare that make perceptions about this complex subject extremely variable, there is a growing perception that farm animal welfare should be protected and improved. There is an increasing appreciation of animal welfare parameters over other quality attributes, and animal-friendly products are considered healthier, safer, tastier, more hygienic, authentic, environmentally friendly, and traditional by many consumers. The willingness to pay for the increases in price that higher levels of farm animal welfare could produce could be promoted by means of adequate information about management and housing conditions of the different farming species. Welfare-friendly products that are properly labeled with clear information provided by an internationally accepted, transparent, and traceable monitoring system will increase consumers' confidence in the food chain participants. Both consumers and citizens have the opportunity to improve the welfare of millions of farmed animals now and in the future, consumers by assuming their responsibility at the buying point, purchasing welfare-friendly products, and citizens by driving legislation to achieve some minimum standard of welfare conditions that could meet animals' needs.

AB  - Diatom fossils in sediment samples are useful environmental indicators often considered in paleoenvironmental reconstructions. The aims of this study were to determine how the distribution of diatoms in surface sediments on the inner shelf of the East China Sea varied by season and because of a typhoon, by examining samples collected in three surveys, one in December 2008 and two in August 2009, before and after a typhoon. We identified 64 species and varieties of diatoms from 27 genera in the samples. The diatom abundances were considerably higher in August 2009 than in December 2008; the absolute diatom abundances ranged from 319 to 3380 valves/g in December 2008, but ranged from 79 to 14,956 valves/g in early August 2009 before Typhoon Morakot, and from 830 to 14,584 valves/g in mid-August 2009 after Typhoon Morakot. The higher nutrient concentration in summer, relative to winter, was clearly the factor controlling diatom abundance within the study area. The composition of the diatom species in the surface sediment between December 2008 and August 2009 reflected growth during spring and summer on the Min-Zhe Coast and the influence of runoff from the Oujiang River and the Taiwan Warm Current. We identified five diatom assemblages that represented the different oceanographic conditions in the study area, the spatial distributions of which were closely related to the environmental conditions. Assemblages WIT and SIT represented, and reflected changes in, the Taiwan Warm Current. Assemblages WI, SI, and SIII represented coastal and intertidal groups, coastal and intertidal groups mixed with fresh water species, and coastal and planktonic groups, respectively. The distribution of diatoms in surface sediments in the study area were modified considerably by Typhoon Morakot, which suggests that the diatoms' seasonal cycle is completely disrupted because of typhoons that mainly occur in August and September.

AB  - Much attention is given to the trunk wood of forest-forming species of primary forest communities in studying biological productivity of forest stands We have carried out the research in the middle taiga subzone (South Karelia) in 2014 in order to determine the influence of site conditions on anatomical indicators of trunk wood of Picea abies (L.) Karst. Study objects were the most common types of forest communities for the region. Five test plots were grounded. Twenty trees of II-III classes of growth and development (according to Kraft's classification) were chosen on each of the plots. Hewings of the trunk wood were picked at the end of the vegetation period at a height of 1.3 m; increments for the last 3 years were analyzed. Preparations were made from the hewings. Width of the tree-ring, width of the autumn wood zone and number of tracheid rows were measured on the preparations in three spots. It was found that tree-ring width and wood quality decrease with deterioration of the site conditions. This indicator in sorrel spruce forest (3.59 mm) is 3.6, 5.6, 8.8 and 11.6 % higher in comparison with myrtillus, vaccinium, swampy with grass and sphagnum spruce forests respectively. Furthermore, larger number of tracheid rows (51 pcs) is formed in sorrel spruce forest in comparison with myrtillus, vaccinium, swampy with grass and sphagnum spruce forests by 5.9, 15.7, 20.0 and 27.5 % respectively; as well as the greatest width of autumn wood zone (1.37 mm). The last indicator in myrtillus, vaccinium, swampy with grass and sphagnum spruce forests is 7.9, 13.6, 20.0 and 28.6 % less respectively. Proportion of autumn wood reaches its maximum in sorrel spruce forest (38.9 %) during the tree-ring formation. Values of this indicator in myrtillus, vaccinium, swampy with grass and sphagnum spruce forests are 37.1, 36.0, 34.6 and 34.1 % respectively.

AB  - Aspen ecosystems (upland Populus-dominated forests) support diverse species assemblages in many parts of the northern hemisphere, yet are imperiled by common stressors. Extended drought, fire suppression, human development, and chronic herbivory serve to limit the sustainability of this keystone species. Here we assess conditions at a renowned quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) grove purportedly the largest living organism on earth with ramifications for aspen biogeography globally. The "Pando" clone is 43 ha and estimated to contain 47,000 genetically identical aspen ramets. This iconic forest is threatened in particular by herbivory, and current management activities aim to reverse the potential for type conversion, likely to a non-forest state. We set out to gauge agents affecting recent deterioration through a network of monitoring plots and by examining a chronosequence of historic aerial photos to better understand the timing of putative departure from a sustainable course. Sixty-five permanent forest monitoring plots were located in three management regimes existing within Pando: no fencing, fencing with active and passive treatments, fencing with passive-only treatment. At each sample plot we measured live and dead mature trees, stem recruitment and regeneration, forest and shrub cover, browse level, and feces counts as a surrogate for ungulate presence. Ordination results indicate that aspen regeneration was the strongest indicator of overall forest conditions at Pando, and that mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) presence strongly impacts successful regeneration. Additionally, fencing with active/passive treatments yielded the most robust regeneration levels; however, a fence penetrable by ungulates in the passive-only treatment most likely played a role in this outcome. The aerial photo sequence depicts various human intrusions over the past seven decades, but perhaps most telling, a decline in self-replacement beginning 30-40 years ago. Aspen communities in many locations in North American and Europe are impacted by unchecked herbivory. The Pando clone presents a unique opportunity for understanding browse mechanisms in a forest where tree genotype, closely aligned with growth and chemical defense, is uniform.

AB  - QuestionsNumerous grassland biodiversity experiments have explored how plant diversity influences colonization by vascular plants, but no such studies have examined how sown vascular plant diversity structures colonization by bryophytes, which can contribute greatly to grassland diversity.
   LocationGrassland biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment), Germany.
   MethodsWe studied bryophyte composition in experimental grasslands encompassing a gradient of vascular plant species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 60 species), functional group richness and composition (one to four; grasses, legumes, tall herbs, small herbs) as well as in additional bare ground and spontaneously colonized plots and semi-natural control meadows.
   ResultsIncreasing vascular plant species richness and functional group richness as well as the presence of legume species decreased bryophyte species richness and increased the spatial variability of this richness. Bryophyte species richness and cover responded positively to grass presence, which also decreased the spatial variability of both. The proportion of acrocarpous species was largest in bare ground plots and decreased with increasing vascular plant species richness and with grass and legume presence. Non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed that bryophyte species composition followed the gradient in sown vascular plant species richness and was dependent on grass and legume presence. The effect of plant diversity on bryophytes was only partly attributable to increased vascular plant species cover. Bryophyte habitat indicator values suggested that conditions in communities of higher vascular plant diversity that included grasses were more shady, moist and nutrient-rich than in communities with lower vascular plant diversity and without grasses, whereas bryophyte assemblages in communities with legumes indicated well-lit nutrient-rich conditions. Even after 6yr, bryophyte species richness and cover was considerably lower in experimental grasslands than in semi-natural meadows, suggesting a role for dispersal limitation or habitat filtering.
   ConclusionsOur study shows that bryophyte colonization is not random, rather it is structured by vascular plant species diversity and composition. Not all components of a plant community respond positively to increased vascular plant diversity and advocating increased richness of one taxonomic group over another in grassland may reduce net species diversity.

AB  - Anthropometric traits observed during military medical examinations are excellent indicators of individual health and nutritional status, and more generally reflect historical socio-economic conditions. Historical demographers have shown little interest in the association of anthropometric traits with demographic family characteristics, except with sibship size according to the resource dilution hypothesis (RDH). In this study we present an analysis of both height and chest circumference of conscripts of Villagrande in Sardinia, Italy, born between 1853 and 1935. Among a total of 1499 conscripts who passed their first examination, height and chest circumference were recorded respectively for 1432 and 1253 conscripts. These traits were almost normally distributed around the average height of 157.60cm and chest circumference of 81.89cm. A multivariate regression analysis was performed using height or chest circumference as dependent variables and a set of demographic variables as potentially explanatory factors. The strongest explanatory power was observed for the year of birth indicating a significant secular increase, for conscript's age at the first medical examination and the maternal age at conscript's birth. The mortality rate under age five within the sibship shows a negative association with height only, whereas neither parity nor intergenesic intervals show any statistically significant impact. Finally, the relative birth index is associated with the chest circumference only, with larger values for conscripts born within the younger half of the sibship. Overall, our findings are consistent with the general statement that height and chest circumference are largely under genetic control although they may be partially modulated by the environmental and socio-economic conditions of the individual's life. This study also aimed to test RDH. Although conscripts who were an only child may have had a slight increase in height and chest circumference, no significant negative linear or log-linear trend was detected for the two body parameters in respect of sibship size.

AB  - Objectives: This study investigates risk of mortality associated with nurses' assessments of patients by physiological system. We hypothesise that nursing assessments of in-patients performed at entry correlate with in-hospital mortality, and those performed just before discharge correlate with postdischarge mortality.
   Design: Cohort study of in-hospital and postdischarge mortality of patients over two 1-year periods.
   Setting: An 805-bed community hospital in Sarasota, Florida, USA.
   Subjects: 42 302 inpatients admitted for any reason, excluding obstetrics, paediatric and psychiatric patients.
   Outcome measures: All-cause mortalities and mortality OR.
   Results: Patients whose entry nursing assessments, other than pain, did not meet minimum standards had significantly higher in-hospital mortality than patients meeting minimums; and final nursing assessments before discharge had large OR for postdischarge mortality. In-hospital mortality OR were found to be: food, 7.0; neurological, 9.4; musculoskeletal, 6.9; safety, 5.6; psychosocial, 6.7; respiratory, 8.1; skin, 5.2; genitourinary, 3.0; gastrointestinal, 2.3; peripheral-vascular, 3.9; cardiac, 2.8; and pain, 1.1. CI at 95% are within +/-20% of these values, with p<0.001 (except for pain). Similar results applied to postdischarge mortality. All results were comparable across the two 1-year periods, with 0.85 intraclass correlation coefficient.
   Conclusions: Nursing assessments are strongly correlated with in-hospital and postdischarge mortality. No multivariate analysis has yet been performed, and will be the subject of a future study, thus there may be confounding factors. Nonetheless, we conclude that these assessments are clinically meaningful and valid. Nursing assessment data, which are currently unused, may allow physicians to improve patient care. The mortality OR and the dynamic nature of nursing assessments suggest that nursing assessments are sensitive indicators of a patient's condition. While these conclusions must remain qualified, pending future multivariate analyses, nursing assessment data ought to be incorporated in risk-related health research, and changes in record-keeping software are needed to make this information more accessible.

AB  - As part of a program to select maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) genotypes for resistance to low winter temperatures, we examined variation in photosystem II activity by chlorophyll fluorescence. Populations and families within populations from contrasting climates were tested during two consecutive winters through two progeny trials, one located at a continental and xeric site and one at a mesic site with Atlantic influence. We also obtained the LT50, or the temperature that causes 50% damage, by controlled freezing and the subsequent analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence in needles and stems that were collected from populations at the continental trial site. P. pinaster showed sensitivity to winter stress at the continental site, during the colder winter. The combination of low temperatures, high solar irradiation and low precipitation caused sustained decreases in maximal photochemical efficiency (F-v/F-m), quantum yield of non-cyclic electron transport (Phi(PSII)) and photochemical quenching (qP). The variation in photochemical parameters was larger among families than among populations, and population differences appeared only under the harshest conditions at the continental site. As expected, the environmental effects (winter and site) on the photochemical parameters were much larger than the genotypic effects (population or family). LT50 was closely related to the minimum winter temperatures of the population's range. The dark-adapted F-v/F-m ratio discriminated clearly between interior and coastal populations. In conclusion, variations in F-v/F-m, Phi(PSII), qP and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) in response to winter stress were primarily due to the differences between the winter conditions and the sites and secondarily due to the differences among families and their interactions with the environment. Populations from continental climates showed higher frost tolerance (LT50) than coastal populations that typically experience mild winters. Therefore, LT50, as estimated by F-v/F-m, is a reliable indicator of frost tolerance among P. pinaster populations.

AB  - A set of 55 recent pollen spectra from the Alashan Plateau and the Qilian Mountains (Qilianshan), northwestern China has been analyzed. The established relationships between the pollen spectra and modem vegetation and precipitation patterns of the studied area have been applied to 65 fossil pollen spectra from a 825 cm long sediment record collected in the topographic depression formerly occupied by Eastern Juyan palaeolake (41.89degreesN; 101.85degreesE; 892 m a.s.l.). Several qualitative approaches (e.g. indicator plant species;, Artemisia/Chenopodiaceae and Ephedra fragilis-type s.l./Ephedra distachya-type pollen ratios) and quantitative methods of vegetation and climate reconstruction have been tested with the surface pollen and then applied to the Eastern Juyan pollen record. Fossil pollen data reveal pronounced environmental changes in the studied area of the Alashan Plateau between ca. 10,700 and 1700 cal. yr B.P. Desert taxa, as Chenopodiaceae, Nitraria, Calligonum, Reaumuria were abundant in the vegetation cover around the study site through the whole record. Pollen spectra dated to ca. 10,700-5400 cal. yr B.P. are characterised by highest values of Chenopodiaceae, E.fragilis-type and other desert indicating taxa, suggesting rather (try climate. Most favourable conditions are reconstructed between 5400 and 3900 cal. year B.P. on the basis of relative increase in abundance of Artemisia pollen. A return to dry conditions occurred at about 3900 cal. yr B.P. The lake finally desiccated after 1700 cal. yr B.P. Reconstructed dry climate oscillations between 5900 and 5400 and 3 100 cal. yr B.P. correlate well with similar events found in the published records from northern and western China and central Mongolia. However, Eastern Juyan record does not show the early Holocene humidity maximum, as suggested by the sedimentary data from monsoon-influenced areas of China. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A assay was developed to detect the level of contaminating male fertile rapeseeds within a population of male sterile Ogu-INRA seeds, based on PCR amplification of DNA and fluorescence technology. A molecular beacon was constructed to recognize a specific sequence of the male fertile plant. However, this sequence was also present in the male sterile plant at a very low concentration because of the recombinant structure of the Ogu-INRA mitochondrial genome. Conditions for quantitative PCR were found to take into account this biological data in order to develop an effective test. A 1% contamination can be detected with the naked eye with an ultraviolet light table or by use of a spectrofluorometer. The sensitivity of this method is dependent upon the molecular beacon concentration.

TI  - Assessment of environmental changes in the Orinoco River delta
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
LA  - English
AB  - Major anthropogenic driven changes in the hydrologic and sedimentation patterns of the Orinoco River have had an impact on environmental conditions in the delta. The abrupt water flow reduction from 3,600 to 200 m(3) s(-1) in one of its major distributaries resulting from dam construction forced its transformation from a fresh-water body into a tidal channel with an increase in salinity level (as far as 100 km upstream) and with well-mixed water at the mouth and estuarine connection to the Paria Gulf. Three different sectors along this distributary can be identified (indicated by the Na/Cl ratio in the water). As a result, noticeable changes have occurred in the mangrove community which moved about 60 km further upstream. The changes have also promoted the formation of new islands of sediment progradation at the mouth of this distributary, where successional colonization and species replacement by different species of grasses and mangroves take place.

AB  - Head capsules of chironomids of the genera Chironomus, Glyptotendipes and Microtendipes in two cores from Lough Neagh, Northern Ireland, were identified to instar. The proportions of 3rd and 4th instars did not stay constant throughout the lengths of the cores and it is possible there was differential preservation of the instars. Plotting diagrams using only one instar could give misleading information about the occurrence of a genus, while plotting total number of head capsules may result in individuals being counted twice. Counting the most numerous taxon at each level in the sediment avoids the latter problem while retaining maximum information about the fauna. Non-metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling ordination diagrams calculated using the different methods illustrate the similarity of plot obtained.

AB  - Parametrizing soil reflectance spectra with variables related to specific shape characteristics of the spectral profile permits organic carbon concentrations in soils to be estimated on the basis of regionally validated regression models. An important feature of the approach is that it can not only be applied to continuous spectra but, without notable loss in accuracy, also to the spectral resolution of operational earth observation satellites such as the Landsat-TM or -ETM systems. Using this type of imagery, it can also be shown that soil organic matter is positively correlated to growth conditions for cereal crops in dryland agriculture. Strong correlations with qualitative erosion indicators that can be derived through spectral unmixing approaches demonstrate that soil organic matter is an important indicator for assessing land degradation processes in dry ecosystems from space.

AB  - One of the problems facing the program in the wake of the Chernobyl accident is the estimation of genetic damage to plants and animals. Special attention was directed to studying the influence of radioactive pollutants at the accident site by means of an appropriate test system, using standard genetic subjects. The present study describes such investigations. Levels of persistent genetic damage in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster found in the vicinity of the Chernobyl accident site were examined from August 1986 to September 1989. Evidence is presented which indicates a relationship between the levels of radioactive pollution resulting from the Chernobyl accident and increasing genetic damage to exposed populations. The possible reasons for the decrease of mutation frequency observed in 1988 and 1989 are also discussed. Furthermore, evidence is presented which suggests that radiosensitive Drosophila mutants may be particularly sensitive indicators of radioactive pollution.

AB  - This study provides a preliminary agro-environmental, economic and energetic analysis to critically evaluate the biomass potential of an area of central Italy (Tuscia Romana). This area is selected as representative for agro-forestry from its orographic characteristics, climatic conditions, land use and potential energy sources. Accordingly, the model we have obtained could be used for other similar areas of central Italy. We have assessed the potential agro-forestry biomass availability, energy potential and transport infrastructure using multi criteria analysis and geographic information system approaches. Finally, optimum locations to develop an energy plant were identified. This model could be applied at a local level to help deliver environmental policy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Dissolved oxygen is a measure of the quantity of oxygen present in water and is one of the best indicators of the health of a water ecosystem. Dissolved oxygen levels in water can be increased by creating turbulent conditions where fine air bubbles are carried into the bulk of the flow. This is achieved by hydraulic structures. A free-surface conduit is a particular instance of this. In the present work, a series of experiments were conducted to investigate the aeration efficiency of free-surface conduit flow systems. The results indicate that free-surface conduit flow systems are very effective for oxygen transfer. At Froude numbers greater than 15, almost full oxygen transfer up to the saturation value was reached. Moreover, from experimental data, a regression equation was obtained with a very high correlation coefficient, showing the effect of various parameters on the aeration efficiency.

AB  - Rumenic (cis-9, trans-11 18: 2) acid is the main conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomer in milk and other ruminant fats. Anhydrous regular and high-CLA butterfats were heated at 200 degrees C for 2, 4, and 6 h under atmospheric conditions. [1,5] Sigmatropic isomerization of rumenic acid occurred, resulting in the formation of trans-8, cis-10 18: 2 acid, as determined by mass spectrometry of its 4,4-dimethyloxazoline derivative. Rate of isomerization was monitored by gas-liquid chromatography, using a 120-m capillary column coated with 70% equivalent cyanoalkylpolysiloxane polymer, and reaction was of first order. Furthermore, [ 1,5] sigmatropic rearrangement product analysis can be used as an indicator of heat treatment of natural fats and oils containing CLA.

AB  - This study deals with the structure of Peracarida populations in four ports in the NW Aegean Sea, Greece, and with the degree this structure is influenced by the particular biotic and abiotic conditions that prevail in the ports. Quantitative samples were taken during summer and winter in two successive years from artificial hard substrates and were analysed using common biocoenotic methods. The examination of approximately 81,250 specimens revealed the presence of 24 Peracarida species, the most dominant of which were Corophium acutum, Leptochelia savignyi and Elasmopus rapax. All species are very common and have been reported from many sites and assemblages in the N Aegean Sea. The ratios of certain Peracarida genera are discussed as possible indicators of environmental health that may be used in long-term biomonitoring programmes on the impact of pollution in harbours.

AB  - Verification of dissociative identity disorder presents challenges given the complex nature of the illness. This study addressed the concern that this disorder can be successfully malingered on objective and projective psychological tests. 50 undergraduate women were assigned to a Malingering or a Control condition, then completed the Rorschach Inkblot Test and the Dissociative Experiences Scale II. The Malingering group were asked to simulate dissociative identity disorder; controls received instructions to answer all materials honestly. Analysis indicated that malingerers were significantly more likely to endorse dissociative experiences on the Dissociative Experiences Scale II in the range common to patients with diagnosed dissociative identity disorder. However, on the Rorschach there were no significant differences between the two groups. Results suggest that the assessment of dissociative identity disorder requires a multifaceted approach with both objective and projective assessment tools. Research is needed to assess these issues in clinical populations.

AB  - Sublittoral and profundal chironomid community structure, depth distribution and relationship to the trophic level of the waters were investigated in Lake Vico (Central Italy) during 1985-1986. PCA analysis indicated a depth-dependent group of true profunda! stations at 20, 30 and 40 m depths, characterized by Micropsectra, Procladius, Microtendipes, Tanytarsus and Paratendipes, and a group of 10 m stations, characterized by Cryptochironomus, Polypedilum b'tcrenatum gr., Cladopelma lateralis gr. and C. laccophila gr., representing the sublittoral features of this depth. In agreement with the chemical data, the chironomid community indicated a mesotrophic condition of Lake Vico, with a tendency towards an increasing trophic level in the deepest zone. A significant role in revealing future trophic changes in the lake may be attributed to the key-indicator Micropsectra.

AB  - Urbanization affects the local wind and water cycle by changing the natural surface and atmospheric conditions, which further changes the local climate and climate system. Assessment of built-up-area changes in a rapidly growing urban area within a short time is a prime factor for administrators for better environmental assessment and sustainable development of urban areas. Traditional survey approaches, on the other hand, are unable to meet the demand for rapid urban land management development, and there is a pressing need to develop new methods to address the limitations of existing ones. This study compares various urban spectral indices to other existing approaches in order to determine which index provides a better representation of the impervious area in the urban watershed. Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) satellite images acquired on 15 March 2014 and 31 March 2020 are used in the present study. Indices, namely Modified Built-up Index (MBUI), SwiRed Index (SwiRed), and Enhanced Built-up and Bareness Index (EBBI), were utilized to extract impervious areas. Thresholding of indices is done by comparing them with 1000 reference points taken from Google Earth imagery of the respective years. The accuracy of the urban indices is assessed by comparing the results with high-resolution Google Earth Satellite Images. The impervious area is extracted from spectral indices and other remote sensing techniques such as maximum likelihood classification and support vector machine classification techniques. The overall accuracy of SVM, MLC, MBUI, EBBI, and SwiRed for the 2014 dataset was found to be 95.1%, 90.8%, 83.9%, 78.9%, and 87.3%, respectively, and the overall accuracy of SVM, MLC, MBUI, EBBI, and SwiRed was found to be 96%, 89.2%, 89.1%, 85.5%, and 92.6%, respectively. Impervious areas in the heterogeneous urban environment can be monitored in a better way and within lesser time by using spectral indices generated using Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) satellite data.

AB  - In contrast to temperate systems, Arctic lagoons that span the Alaska Beaufort Sea coast face extreme seasonality. Nine months of ice cover up to similar to 1.7 m thick is followed by a spring thaw that introduces an enormous pulse of freshwater, nutrients, and organic matter into these lagoons over a relatively brief 2-3 week period. Prokaryotic communities link these subsidies to lagoon food webs through nutrient uptake, heterotrophic production, and other biogeochemical processes, but little is known about how the genomic capabilities of these communities respond to seasonal variability. Replicate water samples from two lagoons and one coastal site near Kaktovik, AK were collected in April (full ice cover), June (ice break up), and August (open water) to represent winter, spring, and summer, respectively. Samples were size fractionated to distinguish free-living and particle-attached microbial communities. Multivariate analysis of metagenomes indicated that seasonal variability in gene abundances was greater than variability between size fractions and sites, and that June differed significantly from the other months. Spring (June) gene abundances reflected the high input of watershed-sourced nutrients and organic matter via spring thaw, featuring indicator genes for denitrification possibly linked to greater organic carbon availability, and genes for processing phytoplankton-derived organic matter associated with spring blooms. Summer featured fewer indicator genes, but had increased abundances of anoxygenic photosynthesis genes, possibly associated with elevated light availability. Winter (April) gene abundances suggested low energy inputs and autotrophic bacterial metabolism, featuring indicator genes for chemoautotrophic carbon fixation, methane metabolism, and nitrification. Winter indicator genes for nitrification belonged to Thaumarchaeota and Nitrosomonadales, suggesting these organisms play an important role in oxidizing ammonium during the under-ice period. This study shows that high latitude estuarine microbial assemblages shift metabolic capabilities as they change phylogenetic composition between these extreme seasons, providing evidence that these communities may be resilient to large hydrological events in a rapidly changing Arctic.

AB  - Prosopis juliflora is a serious invader, causing great ecological and economic damage in Ethiopia. Thus, it is imperative to examine potential invasion dynamics of P. juliflora at national level under climate change scenario to better influence decision making processes on the management of this invasive species. We derived a consensus model from five modeling approaches to examine the current and future (2050 and 2070) climatic suitability for P. juliflora under two climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) in Ethiopia. Under the current climatic scenario, 94.8% of the country was non-suitable for P. juliflora establishment and invasion while 0.4% (4.56 million ha) was highly suitable. In 2050, highly suitable area for P. juliflora is expected to increase by 55.6% and 63.6%, while moderately suitable area is projected to increase by 33.3% and 42.9% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios, respectively. Compared to the current climatic condition, in 2070, highly suitable area for the species is projected to increase by 73.3% (3.43 million ha) and 80.0% (3.65 million ha) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenario, respectively. With the current cover, this invasive species had already caused significant impact on rangelands in many parts of the country. Its further expansion would worsen the problem, leading to great environmental and economic damage, thereby threatening the livelihood of the community. Negative environmental and economical impacts caused by the species will be high if preventive and effective management measures are not earnestly taken, and it becomes one of the major challenges for the 21st century pastoralism and their livelihoods. We recommend a national effort be organized towards combating P. juliflora expansion to new areas, especially in regions and protected area predicted as frontiers of potential expansion.

AB  - Objective. The article presents the results of an empirical study of the influence of the personal Internet orientation (personality changes on the Internet, typical behavior in cyberspace) on the Internet texts understanding.
   Materials & Methods. Different theoretical methods and techniques were used for this purpose: deductive and inductive methods, analysis and synthesis, generalization, systematization. Empirical methods were used for this purpose: experiment (semantic and receptive), method of semantic and pragmatic interpretations, content analysis, subjective scaling procedure. Mathematical methods were used: primary statistics, checks on the normal nature of the data distribution, statistical output, taking into account statistical indicators of fashion and the scope of variation, correlation analysis. As well as some interpretive methods that are based on specific principles of systemic, active, cognitive, psycholinguistic approaches.
   Results. The author distinguish three types of personal Internet orientation depending on the motivation and creativity of user behavior on the Internet. The basic level of personal Internet orientation includes users who access the Internet to meet the basic needs for food, physiology, safety and belonging to the community by searching for relevant information. A high level personal Internet orientation suggests that the user accesses the Internet to meet the highest needs related to respect, self-improvement and self-realization, that requires not only using, but also the creation of content. The middle level is intermediate between them.
   Conclusions. As a result of empirical research involving 716 respondents from different regions of Ukraine, it was determined that the high level of personal Internet orientation facilitates to the reception and accuracy of recipients' expectations. It is accompanied by an improvement in cyberspace orientation, adaptation to its conditions, more real forecasts of the Internet texts content, more consistent attitude to the verbal environment of the Web. However, the quality and completeness of the Internet texts interpretation improve insignificantly with the evolution of Internet orientation. And the adequacy of the mark of the Internet texts complexity even decreases.

AB  - Eelgrass is a key indicator for the water quality in Europe (WFD, European Union, 2000). However, although water quality has been improved in most Danish water bodies, the eelgrass population does not seem to be recovering. In this study, we validate and further develop a GIS tool designed by Flindt et al. (2016), to evaluate the potential of eelgrass reestablishment in Danish waters. The GIS tool was tested in two large broads of the Limfjorden, Logstor and Lovns broad (Denmark), where two scenarios are run. The first scenario was set up including modelled data, whereas the second scenario included both monitored and modelled data. All scenarios were validated with monitored data collected over a 5 years period in the two broads. The developed GIS tool highlights areas with eelgrass potential, both for vegetative growth and sexual reproduction, in accordance with those found in situ in the period 2009-2013, in the two investigated broads. A combination of modelled and monitored data Was found to be optimal to achieve accurate predictions for eelgrass development in the Limfjorden using this GIS tool. In order to implement the current model or to use this GIS tool in other locations, it is needed to have detailed knowledge of the area in focus, especially on the controlling ecosystem parameters and pressures. This eelgrass GIS tool is been proven to be especially beneficial as site selection tool for marine spatial planning e.g. in relation to the implementation of the WFD and the ICZM directives (WFD, ICZM), to help assessing anthropogenic/targeted environmental impacts e.g. assessing mussel fisheries impacts and is as well a powerful tool to optimize monitoring cost efficiency. Finally, the described GIS tool, originally set for Odense fjord (Denmark) by Flindt et al. (2016), has been validated with data from Limfjorden, corroborating the efficiency of the studied tool in Danish waters. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Salmonid populations are highly sensitive to the impacts of acidification. This has led to the loss of fish populations from heavily impacted areas. There is recent evidence of chemical recovery, but evidence of biological recovery and in particular recovery of fish populations has been rare. This has led fisheries groups to question whether acid recovery is occurring and the likely timescales for tangible improvements. To answer these questions and to provide an evidence base for the management of acidification impacts requires identification of chemical thresholds for sensitive biota. We analysed a robust and powerful chemistry and fish dataset collected from 22 sites in the United Kingdom Acid Water Monitoring Network (AWMN) over a period of 22 years. Specifically we assessed (1) whether there were significant temporal trends in the presence of brown trout across the network, consistent with acid recovery, (2) the relationships between hydrochemical determinands indicative of acidification impacts and the presence of brown trout fry and parr. The effects of chemical determinands were assessed both alone and in combination.
   Significant positive temporal trends in fish presence were observed at two of the most acidified sites on the network indicating that limited recovery is occurring where satisfactory chemical conditions have now been attained. Fry were substantially more sensitive to water quality than parr. L-Al was the best single chemical determinand for predicting the presence of fry. L-Al therefore represented the most sensitive overall indicator of acid impacts.
   It is suggested that (1) chemical thresholds should be derived from chemistry fry response relationships, (2) standards should be precautionary reflecting the uncertainty in the fry response relationships, (3) environmental standards be developed for L-Al in acidified systems, (4) monitoring of L-Al becomes standard practice in acidified areas and (5) the different methods of calculating ANC are not used Interchangeably given their substantially different fish response relationships.

AB  - This study presents the energy and environmental performance assessment of producing magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)(2)) from Mg-silicates for CO2 mineral sequestration applied to a natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plant. Mg(OH)(2) produced via a closed loop reaction of serpentinite and ammonium sulfate (AS), precipitation of Mg(OH)(2) and AS looping/recovery binds CO2 into a thermodynamically stable, environmentally benign and leak-free magnesium carbonate (MgCO3). We used results from laboratory, modeling and life cycle assessment (LCA) studies to determine the extent to which magnesium (Mg) from serpentinite rock can be converted to Mg(OH)(2), the effects of reaction parameters, scalability and the associated life cycle greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). We found that reaction temperature positively affects Mg extraction from serpentinite, reaching a maximum yield at different temperatures depending on the reaction time. Also, the reactor properties affect the extraction results as the optimal extraction yield and conditions reported for different reactors differ. While the process of producing Mg(OH)(2) is promising, it also possesses a level of energy and environmental burden that cannot be ignored when considering large scale implementation. At 100% conversion and recovery of reagent, the CO2 mineralization process has a life cycle global warming potential (GWP) of 433 kg CO2 equivalents per ton CO2 (CO(2)e/t-CO2). This value increases by 82, 7 and 0.4 kg CO(2)e/t-CO2 for every %-point efficiency loss of AS recovery, Mg(OH)(2) production and Mg(OH)(2) carbonation respectively. Mineral sequestration applied to the 555 MW NGCC plant reduces its net plant efficiency from 50.2% to 38.6%-points (an energy penalty of 30%) but avoids 51% of the GHG emissions to the atmosphere. The results from this study are timely, and could have significant implications on mineral sequestration methods that consider the exothermic nature of the overall mineral carbonation chemistry beneficial.

AB  - An understanding of the ecological systems which dictate landscape form and function must be achieved in order to objectively view development led landscape ecological change. Habitat fragmentation, loss and isolation of habitat patches and reduced connectivity are having a significant detrimental effect on the way our landscapes function. A conservation planning tool which considers these issues in tandem with planned landscape level change, whilst incorporating species and habitat specific details, is necessary if we are to ameliorate the ecological impact of built development.
   A landscape scale modelling approach was developed for a case study area in the South Midlands of the UK to investigate spatial targeting of habitat extension areas. Habitat extension opportunities currently arise as a consequence of existing planning regulations and conditions and are likely to increase as the concept of habitat "banking" is embraced. Ecological networks and ecoprofiles were employed to guide the location of these extension areas via an examination of the landscape ecology effects of area composition, size and location. The ability of extension areas to contribute to landscape functionality was determined spatially. Habitat extension areas identified by the approach increased the existing ecological network size by a factor of over 2.7:1 and were able to deliver the majority of habitat creation targets set out in regional Biodiversity Action Plans (BAPs). 100% of wetland, unimproved grassland and broadleaf and mixed woodland creation targets were met, whilst 75% of the lowland heath target could be achieved. Semi-natural habitat mosaic areas of over 3700 ha which incorporated habitat of more than one type were identified, with such areas determined to be of importance in achieving landscape improvements for a wide range of species. We conclude that rapid assessment tools such as that employed in this research will have increased utility in conservation planning as the British landscape continues to experience both sustained and elevated levels of built development pressure.

AB  - This study objective was to evaluate the effective revegetation in a Mogi Guagu River degraded floodplain area, located at Luiz Antonio municipality (21 degrees 31'S e 47 degrees 55'W), Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Two native riparian forest remnants (RIP1 and RIP2) and three 10-year-old reforested areas, planted of native species (R1, R2 and R3), were analyzed by using phytosociological describers of the arboreal stratum (trees with DBH >= 5 cm) as indicators. The arboreal stratum inventory was accomplished by 180 plots (10 x 10 m each), 60 representing every native forest and 20 for every reforested area. A total of 60 arboreal species was recorded, only six species (Cecropia hololeuca, Croton urucurana, Genipa americana, Inga striata, Nectandra megapotamica e Peltophorum dubium) occurring in all the five studied areas. Seventeen species were common to both native forests, and nine species were recorded in all the reforested areas. Sebastiania commersoniana and Guarea macrophylla were recorded in the native forests (RIP1 and RIP2), and Cecropia hololeuca, Croton urucurana and Inga striata occurring in all the reforested areas, were the species that best characterize the physiognomy of local diversity and were the most important among the studied species. The results showed that the rehabilitation of the areas made by the reforestation created conditions to implant forests with similar structures of the adjacent natural remainders. The reforestation with native species performed in the degraded floodplain of Mogi Guagu River, initially with the predomination of invasive grasses, has been effective at the first stage of the ecological restoration process. The reforestation is making possible the natural regeneration of species from the adjacent remnants, what indicates that the similarity between planted forests and the native ones are rising through the time. The phytosociology, accomplished ten years after the planting date, is adequate to evaluate the effectiveness of the reforestation during the restoration process of degradated areas in the Mogi Guagu floodplain.

AB  - Objectives: To analyse the role of total 2,5-hexanedione (2,5-HD) compared with free 2,5-HD as a biological indicator of exposure to n-hexane at work. Methods: One-hundred and thirty two workers in contact with this solvent during their occupation in the shoe industry in the province of Alicante (Spain) were studied. Environmental and biological tests were carried out analysing variations of the concentration of the metabolite in urine corresponding to different working conditions. Environmental exposure was evaluated in each work place using active personal monitors and measured by gas chromatography (GC). Dichloromethane extracts of the urine samples collected at the end of the working shifts were analysed, before (determining free 2,5-HD, the toxic metabolite) and after acid hydrolysis (pH 0.1) (yielding the total 2,5-HD) and also by GC. The concentration of conjugated metabolite 4,5-dihydroxy-2-hexanone was calculated from the difference between total and free 2,5-HD. Results: Free 2,5-HD represented an average of 14.2% of the total 2,5-HD determined in urine, and this percentage increased significantly (P < 0.01) with higher environmental levels of acetone. Other factors, such as absorption through the skin (depending on the use of gloves) and the day on which samples were taken also significantly affected the relation between the two indicators and their respective relationships with environmental concentrations of n-hexane. Conclusion: Although analyses of the relationship between the levels of atmospheric n-hexane and those of metabolites in urine show a greater correlation for total 2,5-HD than for free 2,5-HD, our results suggest that free 2,5-HD could be a better indicator in evaluating risk of exposure to n-hexane, since the concentration is directly related to the neurotoxic effect.

AB  - Six crude oil samples from six wells in Khabbaz Oil Field were analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy. One of the samples was from Lower Qamchuqa reservoir. The rest were taken from the Upper Qamchuqa reservoir. Biomarker distribution and characteristics are used to provide information on source of organic matter input, depositional conditions, maturation level, and possible source rock. The n-alkanes, terpanes, steranes, and aromatic compounds have been monitored through using specified mass/charge ratios. The crude oils from Khabbaz Oil Field are not affected by biodegradation as it is revealed from the gas chromatogram shapes of the studied samples and the high ratio of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons to the NSO components. All samples reveal the dominant of short chain n-alkanes between C-15-C-18, with isoprenoids pristane and phytane. The unimodal envelope chromatograms, maximum peak carbon n-C-15-n-C-20, and low CPI values (0.89-0.93) indicating a high contribution of aquatic algae organic matter and with minor input from terrestrial plants. The high presence of C-27 regular steranes also support this conclusion. In the studied oil samples of Khabbaz Oil Field, phytane has relatively higher concentrations than pristane with low Pr/Ph ratios in range 0.60-0.73. This indicates that these oils were derived from organic matter deposited in a marine environment under reducing conditions. In most samples, the abundance of C-32 homohopanes is moderate and the 22S/22R + 22S epimerization ratio is around 0.55 to 0.61. In addition, gammacerane is recorded in the analyzed samples and the gammacerane index (gammacerane/C-30 hopane) are indicating that the oils were generated from carbonate source rocks in anoxic and high salinity conditions. The relative C-30 hopane abundance is less than C-29 norhopane in all samples with high C-29/C-30 17 alpha (H) hopane ratios in the range 1.33-1.62 which indicates that such crude oils are derived from carbonate-rich source rock. 20S/(20S+20R) and beta beta/(beta beta+alpha alpha) C-29 sterane ratios are relatively consistent for all the analyzed samples, ranging between 0.43-0.46 and 0.58-0.63, respectively. This ratio (DBT/Phe) is also used to draw with Pr/Ph ratio as cross-plot, which is clearly indicates that the oils were generated from marine carbonate source rock. The Khabbaz crude oils have a 20S/ (20S +20R) and beta beta/(beta beta+alpha alpha) C-29 sterane ratios in the range 0.43 to 0.46 and 0.58-0.63, respectively, which indicate thermal maturity (equivalent to peak oil generation stage). The Lower Qamchuqa reservoir is higher in pressure and temperature than the Upper Qamchuqa, as a result the oil of Lower Qamchuqa has higher maturity and API gravity. The studied area is underlain by several rock units which could make potential source rocks for the Khabbaz oils. The biomarkers distribution, and the delta C-13(org) indicate that the to Chia Gara Formation considered as the main source rock of the oils within Khabbaz Oil Field.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Smallholder dairy farms are the most popular type of dairy farm in Vietnam and distribute widely from north to south in both lowland and highland regions. Currently, there are limited data on productivity and especially the welfare of cows in these systems. This study was conducted on 32 farms located across four contrasting dairy regions of Vietnam to directly estimate and compare key descriptors of productivity and welfare such as herd structure, milk yield, and responses to heat stress. Level of heat stress was determined to be the most important constraint to productivity and welfare of the cows; even in the highlands where the mildest temperatures were found. Low milk yield, body weight, and body condition were also of concern. Poor productivity and welfare were most evident in the south lowland region. However, reasonable productivity in the north lowland indicated the potential to manage high temperature and humidity to improve dairy cow welfare and productivity in Vietnam.
   Smallholder dairy farms (SDFs) are distributed widely across lowland and highland regions in Vietnam, but data on the productivity and welfare status of these cows remains limited. This cross-sectional study was conducted to describe and compare the productivity and welfare status of SDF cows across contrasting regions. It was conducted in autumn 2017 on 32 SDFs randomly selected from four typical but contrasting dairy regions (eight SDFs per region); a south lowland, a south highland, a north lowland, and a north highland region. Each farm was visited over a 24-h period (an afternoon followed by a morning milking and adjacent husbandry activities) to collect data of individual lactating cows (n = 345) and dry cows (n = 123), which included: milk yield and concentrations, body weight (BW), body condition score (BCS, 5-point scale, 5 = very fat), inseminations per conception, and level of heat stress experienced (panting score, 4.5-point scale, 0 = no stress). The high level of heat stress (96% of lactating cows were moderate to highly heat-stressed in the afternoon), low energy corrected milk yield (15.7 kg/cow/d), low percentage of lactating cows (37.3% herd), low BW (498 and 521 kg in lactating and dry cows, respectively), and low BCS of lactating cows (2.8) were the most important productivity and welfare concerns determined and these were most serious in the south lowland. By contrast, cows in the north lowland, a relatively hot but new dairying region, performed similarly to those in the south highland; a region historically considered to be one of the most suitable for dairy cows in Vietnam due to its cool environment. This indicates the potential to mitigate heat stress through new husbandry strategies. Cows in the north highland had the highest BW (535 and 569 kg in lactating and dry cows, respectively) and the highest energy corrected milk yield (19.2 kg/cow/d). Cows in all regions were heat-stressed during the daytime, although less so in the highlands compared to the lowlands. Opportunities for research into improving the productivity and welfare of Vietnamese SDF cows are discussed.

AB  - The subject of the study is a set of theoretical and methodological aspects of development strategy formed for objects (country, region, branch, enterprise) on the basis of the life cycles theory under the external environment uncertainty. The methodology of strategic planning under the external environment uncertainty with the consideration of the life cycle theory includes: the definition of key criteria for assessing the product lifecycle, the definition of the limits scope for the solvable problem, the definition of parameters of models stability, the formation of models for analysis, setting the problem under uncertainty, the mechanism of step-by-step adjustment, and effectiveness assessment of strategic decisions based on strategies, the algorithm for the integrated assessment of the strategies effectiveness taking into account the uncertainty factors. Strategic planning is not characterized by temporal intervals but by a set of strategies, each of which is determined by the ways of achieving the main object objectives. For a rapid analysis of the product life cycle, the external indicators are used, such as: the growth rate of the product market, the relative growth rate of the product (compared to the growth rate of the entire market of the region or country), the firm market share, the firm relative market share (compared to the market share of leading competitor), and internal indicators, such as: the dynamics of enterprise revenue by product, the dynamics of company profits by product, the dynamics of enterprise profitability by product, the dynamics of enterprise investment. For each indicator that describes the enterprise performance, the directions of change are taken: alpha - growth, const - constant or beta - decrease. The methodology involves a certain sequence of studying the product life cycle in retrospect and at the current moment, then the modelling and development of options for short-and long-term strategies implementation are made. Results of the survey are to substantiate the methodology of strategic planning under conditions of external environment uncertainty with the consideration of the life cycle theory. Practical implications: the possibilities of using life-cycle models allow: 1. reasonably predicting sales and plan production program; 2. determining the basic strategies at different stages of development; 3. determining the sequence of stages of enterprise development; 4. ensuring harmonious interaction of organizational characteristics with the external environment factors that influence the process of organizational development. Increasing the sustainability of the organization's development can be achieved by re-establishment of dynamic changes in the plan in terms of using effective methods for forecasting with the consideration of the life cycle theory. It is necessary to take into account the interconnection between all levels of life cycles: industry, technology, enterprises, product; ensuring the competitive advantage of the organization. Using the theory of optimal solutions making in uncertain conditions under the analysis of long-term projects allows transferring qualitative factors into quantitative indicators that can be used in the future to bring investment projects to the same kind and choose the best. In conditions of increased uncertainty of the external environment, it is necessary to develop the theory of enterprise management, taking into account its life cycle, as well as the life cycle of its separate elements and processes at all levels.
   Combination of strategic management with the life cycles theory will increase the objectivity and effectiveness of taken management decisions. The accounting of the organization life cycles in strategic planning allows choosing an effective strategy.

AB  - The response of zoobenthos and ichthyofauna to different levels of habitat degradation was estimated on a small lowland river. The level of fragmentation, the hydromorphological modifications of the watercourse bed, and the water quality of different river stretches were assessed as proxies of the degree of anthropogenic transformation of habitats. The degree of fauna similarity between the study sites, as well as the relationships between habitat quality and biotic indexes were estimated. A strong response of both assemblages to changes in environmental conditions was demonstrated, however, reaction to individual pressures differs. This confirms that these organisms are excellent, universal bioindicators and both groups should be used together. The key role of a well developed riparian zone in shaping the diversity of freshwater biota has also been demonstrated.

AB  - This paper constructs the concept system of urban entrepreneurial environment by analysing the overall entrepreneurial situation of college students and the various aspects affecting the entrepreneurial environment of college students. Combined with the advantages of big data in data processing and according to the specific conditions of entrepreneurial environment in some cities, an index system for comprehensive analysis of urban investment environment is developed, including two aspects of culture and environment, three levels of description, and a total of 23 sub-indicators. The experimental results show that this method establishes a comprehensive, systematic and multi-level index system. The system can be used for the objective evaluation of the entrepreneurial environment, and can have a comprehensive grasp of the advantages and disadvantages of the urban investment environment according to the evaluation results. The results can be used as the basis for improving the investment environment.

AB  - The degradation of recreational trails is a common problem in many protected natural areas. Information about the condition of trails in the Gorce National Park (south-central Poland) have been presented in this study. Indicators of trail degradation were recorded during detailed field surveys of 55.1 km of formal trails. A series of maps at a scale 1: 42,500 have been developed, with the main emphasis on the trail network. The maps show: (1) width of trails, (2) trail incision, (3) number of braided, informal trails, (4) number of old, abandoned sections, and (5) muddiness. Additionally, information about the amount of use and type of use has been provided. Presented data can be a helpful contribution to a more effective management of the recreational trail network where park managers can assess which trails are the most deteriorated and plan trail rehabilitation.

AB  - A spectrophotometric method is proposed for the analysis of atenolol, based on its reaction with the indicator phenol red in an acetone environment. Experimental conditions for the formation of an ion pair complex peaking at 388 nm were optimized. The method is linear in the range of 1 to 5 mg/mL with a correlation coefficient (n = 30) of 0.9968. Stoichiometry of the reaction is 1: 1. Free energy change (Delta G) for complex formation and stability constant (K-F) have been calculated. Working with placebo it was found that excipients do not interfere in the analysis. The proposed method was applied to tablets provided by the Medicinal Plant of Corrientes (Plamecor), Argentina. Recoveries from 99.67 to 100.17 were achieved. Results were compared (F test and t test) favorably with those given by official methods. (IIPLC - UV).

AB  - The environmental burden associated with some functionalization reactions of nitrogen-heteroaromatics via TiO2 (solar) photocatalysis is compared with the same reactions under thermal conditions. Two methods, LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) and EATOS (Environmental Assessment Tool for Organic Synthesis), both based on a detailed analysis of the experiments, are used for the assessment. The thermal processes are consistently evaluated to give a better environmental performance. Photocatalysis is disfavored by the required management of a large amount of excess reagent and solvent involved. Still the good yield and simplicity of the photocatalytic method are promising (and are positively evaluated by a third assessment, EcoScale). The precautions for making photocatalytic syntheses environmentally viable are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Dieldrin-resistant (Rdl/Rdl and Rdl/+) and susceptible (+/+) phenotypes of Lucilia cuprina were scored for departures from bilateral symmetry for bristle characters after development at different temperatures, larval densities or concentrations of dieldrin. The asymmetry phenotype of resistant flies was dominant and independent of developmental temperature and larval density. The asymmetry of susceptibles increased for temperatures and larval densities above and below standard rearing conditions. A positive correlation was observed between asymmetry score and dieldrin concentration for all genotypes. The susceptible phenotype did not attain the asymmetry score of resistants in any environment. Resistant phenotypes showed an antisymmetric pattern in each environment; fluctuating asymmetry was observed for susceptibles. The relevance of the results of genetic and general or specific environmental stresses to estimates of developmental perturbation is discussed.

AB  - Changes in spatial synchrony in the growing season have notable effects on species distribution, cross-trophic ecological interactions and ecosystem stability. These changes, driven by non-uniform climate change were observed on the regional scale. It is still unclear how spatial synchrony of the growing season on the climate gradient of the mid-high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and ecoregions, has changed over the past decades. Therefore, we calculated the start, end, and length of the thermal growing season (SOS, EOS, and LOS, respectively), which are indicators of the theoretical plant growth season, based on the daily-mean temperature of the Princeton Global Forcing dataset from 1948 to 2016. Spatial variations in the SOS, EOS and LOS along spatial climate gradients were analyzed using the multivariate-linear regression model. The changes of spatial synchrony in the SOS, EOS and LOS were analyzed using the segmented model. The results showed that in all ecoregions, spatially, areas with higher temperature tended to have an earlier SOS, later EOS and longer LOS. However, not all the areas with higher precipitation tended to have a later SOS, later EOS, and shorter LOS. The spatial synchrony in the SOS decreased across the entire study area, whereas the EOS showed the opposite trend. Among the seven ecoregions, spatial synchrony in the SOS in temperate broadleaf/mixed forests and temperate conifer forests changed the most noticeably, decreasing in both regions. Conversely, spatial synchrony in the EOS in the taiga, temperate grasslands/savannas/shrublands and tundra changed the most noticeably, increasing in each region. These may have important effects on the structure and function of ecosystems, especially on the changes in cross-trophic ecological interactions. Moreover, future climate change may change the spatial synchrony in the SOS and EOS further; however, the actual impact of such ongoing change is largely unknown.

AB  - Glucocorticoids (corticosterone/cortisol; cort) are frequently used in conservation as biomarkers of disturbance in wild populations. However, the context-dependent nature of cort means that it may not always accurately reflect disturbance. For example, there is growing evidence that wildlife populations can evolve or acclimate to human-induced environmental change (i.e. contaminants) by expressing higher levels of tolerance. Mechanisms that allow for populations to achieve higher contaminant tolerance can be related to cort and thereby impact the reliability of cort as an indicator of disturbance. This study asks: (1) do wildlife populations that differ in tolerance to contaminants differentially express baseline and stress-induced cort and (2) is cort a viable indicator of disturbance across populations that differ in tolerance to contaminants? Toward this goal, we identified three wood frog Rana sylvatica populations with relatively high NaCl tolerance and three populations with relatively low NaCl tolerance. Tadpoles from these populations were reared to metamorphosis in either an environmentally relevant concentration of NaCl (0.5 g L-1 NaCl) or a control (0 g L-1 NaCl). At metamorphosis we used a non-invasive waterborne assay to measure baseline and stress-induced cort release rates and measured fitness-related metrics. We found that contaminant tolerance influences cort levels. More tolerant populations had lower baseline cort and higher fitness compared to less tolerant populations. However, despite variation in cort across populations with different levels of tolerance, cort still represents a viable indicator of condition as our results show a consistent negative relationship between cort and fitness. Lastly, we found that levels of cort were consistent regardless of whether amphibians were reared in NaCl contaminated or non-contaminated environments. Overall, we emphasize the importance of recognizing population-level variation in cort due to contaminant tolerance when using cort as a biomarker for conservation purposes.

AB  - The study aims to determine whether phytoplankton diversity can be used as an indicator of water quality in large-scale sediment-laden rivers with heterogeneous environmental conditions. We hypothesized that environ -mental factors, such as sediment load, water surface slope, and precipitation, may impact the effectiveness of using phytoplankton diversity as a water quality indicator. To test this hypothesis, the Yellow River was selected for phytoplankton diversity and water quality assessments. We measured water quality parameters, calculated phytoplankton diversity indices, and collected data on geo-climatic variables at 130 sampling points in the Yel-low River mainstream over two seasons (spring and autumn) in 2019. The results of the water quality assessment based on phytoplankton diversity indices were compared with those based on water quality index (WQI). Cor -relation analysis, multiple stepwise regression, distance-based redundancy analysis, and regression modeling were used to explore the biogeographical patterns and drivers of phytoplankton diversity. According to the WQI, the water quality gradually deteriorated from the source to the estuary of the river. Three biodiversity in-dices (Margalef, Pielou, and Shannon-Wiener) indicated that the water quality varied dynamically in the middle reaches of the river. The actual relationships between the biodiversity indices and WQI did not fit well with the standard curves of water quality classification based on the respective biodiversity indices and WQI. Variation partitioning analysis indicated that water quality parameters, such as sediment and nutrient load, were the dom-inant drivers of variation in phytoplankton diversity in most cases, with the contribution ranging from 11.0% to 25.7%. Geo-climatic factors, such as water surface slope and annual mean precipitation, also affected phytoplank-ton diversity, with the contribution reaching 27.8%. Therefore, in sediment-laden rivers with a large geographical span and complex environment, phytoplankton diversity cannot be used as a suitable water quality indicator, al-beit it can reflect habitat changes to a certain extent.

AB  - Land conversion and fragmentation threaten the resilience and biodiversity of wetland ecosystems which makes the future of their services to humans uncertain. Remote sensing can provide frequent and consistent data to facilitate wetland monitoring from regional to national scales and support their conservation and adaptive management. However, unique characteristics of wetlands, particularly land cover heterogeneity and background reflectance from soil, water and dead biomass, limit the efficacy of remote-sensing based metrics developed for terrestrial ecosystems. To identify the factors impacting satellite-based measurements of wetland greenness, we tested how six spectral vegetation indices responded to the land surface characteristics and regional climatic and edaphic context of 1,138 wetlands sites surveyed by the U.S EPA's National Wetland Condition Assessment. Spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) were estimated using all cloud-free surface reflectance data captured in 2011 by Landsat 5 TM and 7 ETM +. We tested two annually aggregated metrics maximum and median greenness- for each SVI to facilitate the analysis of such a large dataset of satellite images. Using univariate and multivariate ordinary least square regression, we assessed how the annual maximum and median of each SVI responded to indicators of vegetation structure and composition, presence of dead biomass, open water, bare soil, and climatic/edaphic variables. Results show that, in the full national-scale dataset, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) were most responsive to field-based metrics of vegetation structure and composition. However, the responses of SVIs differed significantly among wetland types, suggesting that their use should be tailored to the specific characteristics of the monitored wetlands. Annually aggregated metrics showed different sensitivity in multivariate models, with median greenness being more sensitive to structure and composition, but also to confounding site variables including litter, open water, and bare soil. This study represents a first-time effort to study relationships between the on-site properties of wetlands and their spectral characteristics at a national scale.

AB  - Biodiversity conservation in transformed landscapes is becoming increasingly important. However, most assessments of the value of modified habitats rely heavily on species presence and/or abundance, masking ecological processes such as habitat selection and phenomena like ecological traps, which may render species persistence uncertain. High species richness has been documented in tropical agroforestry systems, but comparisons with native habitat remnants generally lack detailed information on species demography and habitat use. We generated a multi-species, multi-measure framework to evaluate the role of habitat selection in the adaptation of species to transformed landscapes, and demonstrate that its use could affect how we value the contribution different land uses make to biodiversity conservation. We analysed 7 years of capture-mark-recapture and observation data for twelve species of resident birds present in native forest remnants and shade coffee plantations in a mega-diverse region. We assessed whether species behaved adaptively by evaluating the correlation between measures of habitat preference (occurrence, abundance, fidelity, inter-seasonal variance and age) and performance (body condition, muscle, primary moult, breeding and juveniles) in forest and coffee, and generated hypotheses about their role in species persistence. We documented adaptive habitat selection for seven species, non-ideal selection for four and maladaptive selection for one. While many species showed equal preference and/or equal performance in many traits, in general we found more evidence for birds preferring and/or performing better in forest than coffee, although relationships between our indicators and population adaptation need to be studied further before our proposed framework can be applied to more species and landscapes. While shade coffee can act as a biodiversity-friendly matrix providing complementary or supplementary habitat to a wide range of resident bird species, protecting remnants of native vegetation is still of paramount importance for biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - The generation of bauxite residue, the by-product of alumina manufacture from bauxite ore, has increased to a global stockpile of some 3 billion tonnes. In the absence of significant reuse options, the bulk of this residue is contained within bauxite residue disposal areas (BRDAs), which can occupy a significant footprint and pose potential environmental risk. Rehabilitation (amendment and vegetation establishment) is viewed as a significant strategy for eventual closure of the BRDAs. Major limitations to plant growth in residue include high pH, salinity, and sodicity, as well as deficiencies of macro- and micronutrients and potentially elevated levels of trace elements. The physical properties are also problematic as residue mud consolidates to form a solid mass that waterlogs easily or dries to form a massive structure, whereas sand has a very low water- and nutrient-holding capacity. A variety of techniques have been trialled at the pot level and at the field scale to bring about reductions in residue alkalinity and sodicity to promote plant establishment, with gypsum amendment viewed as the most promising. Other amendment strategies include use of organic additions or fertiliser applications, and a combined approach can lead to improved residue properties and successful plant establishment. Few reports have focused on longer term plant growth, self-propagation, and residue interactions under field conditions. There is some evidence that rehabilitated residue can support vegetation growth and soil development in the short to medium term (similar to 15 years), but key issues such as nutrient availability and plant uptake require further study. Although rehabilitated residue can support diverse microbial communities and demonstrate trajectory analogous to soil, the ability of rehabilitated residue to support soil biota and key ecosystem processes warrants further study. The bioavailability of trace elements within rehabilitated sites and potential food chain transfer are relatively unexplored. These areas need careful study before definitive statements can be made regarding the sustainability of residue rehabilitation strategies.

AB  - Trophic models are key tools to go beyond the single-species approaches used in stock assessments to adopt a more holistic view and implement the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM). This study aims to: (i) analyse the trophic functioning of the Celtic Sea and the Bay of Biscay, (ii) investigate ecosystem changes over the 1980-2013 period and, (iii) explore the response to management measures at the food web scale. Ecopath models were built for each ecosystem for years 1980 and 2013, and Ecosim models were fitted to time series data of biomass and catches. EcoTroph diagnosis showed that in both ecosystems, fishing pressure focuses on high trophic levels (TLS) and, to a lesser extent, on intermediate TLs. However, the interplay between local environmental conditions, species composition and ecosystem functioning could explain the different responses to fisheries management observed between these two contiguous ecosystems. Indeed, over the study period, the ecosystem's exploitation status has improved in the Bay of Biscay but not in the Celtic Sea. This improvement does not seem to be sufficient to achieve the objectives of an EAFM, as high trophic levels were still overexploited in 2013 and simulations conducted with Ecosim in the Bay of Biscay indicate that at current fishing effort the biomass will not be rebuilt by 2030. The ecosystem's response to a reduction in fishing mortality depends on which trophic levels receive protection. Reducing fishing mortality on pelagic fish, instead of on demersal fish, appears more efficient at maximising catch and total biomass and at conserving both top-predator and intermediate Us. Such advice-oriented trophic models should be used on a regular basis to monitor the health status of marine food webs and analyse the trade-offs between multiple objectives in an ecosystem-based fisheries management context (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Various mineral processing operations to produce pure metals from mineral ores generate sludges, residues, and other unwanted by-products/wastes. As a general practice, these wastes are either stored in a reservoir or disposed in the surrounding of mining/smelting areas, which might cause adverse environmental impacts. Therefore, it is important to understand the various characteristics like heavy metal leaching features and potential toxicity of these metallurgical wastes. In this study, zinc plant leach residues (ZLRs) were collected from a currently operating Zn metallurgical industry located in Minas Gerais (Brazil) and investigated for their potential toxicity, fractionation, and leachability. Three different ZLR samples (ZLR1, ZLR2, and ZLR3) were collected, based on their age of production and deposition. They mainly consisted of Fe (6-11.5 %), Zn (2.5 to 5.0 %), and Pb (1.5 to 2.5 %) and minor concentrations of Al, Cd, Cu, and Mn, depending on the sample age. Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) results revealed that these wastes are hazardous for the environment. Accelerated Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) sequential extraction clearly showed that potentially toxic heavy metals such as Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn can be released into the environment in high quantities under mild acidic conditions. The results of the liquid-solid partitioning as a function of pH showed that pH plays an important role in the leachability of metals from these residues. At low pH (pH 2.5), high concentrations of metals can be leached: 67, 25, and 7 % of Zn can be leached from leach residues ZLR1, ZLR2, and ZLR3, respectively. The release of metals decreased with increasing pH. Geochemical modeling of the pH-dependent leaching was also performed to determine which geochemical process controls the leachability/solubility of the heavy metals. This study showed that the studied ZLRs contain significant concentrations of non-residual extractable fractions of Zn and can be seen as a potential secondary resource for Zn.

AB  - The aims of the present study were to compare the toxic effects of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and to screen for rapid and sensitive biomarkers that can be used to assess the environmental risks of BaP in earthworms in different natural soil types. The authors exposed Eisenia fetida to 2 types of soil (red soil and fluvo-aquic soil) spiked with different concentrations (0mgkg(-1), 1mgkg(-1), 10mgkg(-1), 100mgkg(-1), and 500mgkg(-1)) of BaP for 7d or 14d. Benzo[a]pyrene-induced weight variation altered the activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase [SOD]; catalase [CAT]; and guaiacol peroxidase [POD]) and changed the content of malondialdehyde (MDA). In addition, using the comet assay, the authors determined the DNA damage in earthworms. The results revealed that the comet assay was suitable for evaluating the genotoxicity of BaP in the soil, even at the lowest examined concentration. The MDA content was the least sensitive indicator of BaP toxicity. A 3-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine whether the soil type, exposure concentration, and duration affected the BaP toxicity. The antioxidant enzyme activities and the MDA content were shown to be significantly correlated with the exposure concentration. The percentage of weight variation (p<0.001), CAT activity (p<0.05), and SOD activity (p<0.01) were significantly affected by the soil type, and the POD activity (p<0.01), CAT activity (p<0.001), and SOD activity (p<0.001) were significantly affected by the exposure duration. Therefore, measuring DNA damage in earthworms is a simple and efficient means of assessing BaP genotoxicity in a terrestrial environment, and the effects of the soil type and exposure time on the other parameters that were investigated in E. fetida, which were used as responsive biomarkers, should be considered.

AB  - Cold is a major constraint for cereal cultivation under temperate climates. Winter-hardy plants interpret seasonal changes and can acquire the ability to resist sub-zero temperatures. This cold acclimation process is associated with physiological, biochemical and molecular alterations in cereals. Brachypodium distachyon is considered a powerful model system to study the response of temperate cereals to adverse environmental conditions. To date, little is known about the cold acclimation and freezing tolerance capacities of Brachypodium. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the cold hardiness of seven diploid Brachypodium accessions.
   An integrated approach, involving monitoring of phenological indicators along with expression profiling of the major vernalization regulator VRN1 orthologue, was followed. In parallel, soluble sugars and proline contents were determined along with expression profiles of two COR genes in plants exposed to low temperatures. Finally, whole-plant freezing tests were performed to evaluate the freezing tolerance capacity of Brachypodium.
   Cold treatment accelerated the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase in all diploid Brachypodium accessions tested. In addition, low temperature exposure triggered the gradual accumulation of BradiVRN1 transcripts in all accessions tested. These accessions exhibited a clear cold acclimation response by progressively accumulating proline, sugars and COR gene transcripts. However, whole-plant freezing tests revealed that these seven diploid accessions only have a limited capacity to develop freezing tolerance when compared with winter varieties of temperate cereals such as wheat and barley. Furthermore, little difference in terms of survival was observed among the accessions tested despite their previous classification as either spring or winter genotypes.
   This study is the first to characterize the freezing tolerance capacities of B. distachyon and provides strong evidence that some diploid accessions such as Bd21 have a facultative growth habit.

AB  - This paper presents a Monte Carlo uncertainty/variability analysis applied to assessment of salmonid embryo survival affected by the deposition of fine sand in the spawning gravel riverbed. For the system being modeled, the uncertainty originates from the lack of perfect knowledge about the spawning habitat, while the variability arises from the natural diversity in the amount of sand deposit. A second-order Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) procedure consisting of multiple realizations of model parameters and full-range iterations of input variable is used to separately propagate the knowledge uncertainty and natural variability of the system. Given that the three parameters of the present model are highly correlated (correlation coefficients >0.8), we use four multivariate methods (Iman-Conover method, standard normal transformation method, normal copula method, and maximum-entropy copula method) to generate correlated model parameters. The scatter plots of the correlated parameters generated with various methods demonstrate different correlation patterns. An important finding of the present uncertainty/variability analyses and risk assessments is that the outcomes resulting from the four correlated scenarios are very similar, regardless of the diverse correlation patterns. The output of the second-order MCS is a collection of cause-effect relations (spaghetti plot) that can facilitate the analyses of survival-rate uncertainty/variability. The favorable habitat conditions are also defined on the basis of the spaghetti plot. It is revealed that significant values of information are associated with the parameter correlations, especially when higher levels of embryo survival are targeted. The results further indicate that the outcomes of the independent (less realistic) scenario substantially differ from those of the correlated ones, indicating that the effect of parameter correlations should be incorporated into the MCS whenever possible. This work provides a useful paradigm for the systematic uncertainty/variability analyses in the context of ecological risk assessments. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Agricultural researchers widely recognise the importance of sustainable agricultural production systems and the need to develop appropriate methods to measure sustainability. The principal purpose of this paper is to evaluate the financial and environmental aspects of sustainability of organic, integrated and conventional farming systems (OFS, IFS and CFS, respectively) at farm level and on more detailed spatial scales. This was achieved by applying an integrated economic-environmental accounting framework to three case study farms in Tuscany (Italy) covering different farming systems (FSs) and different spatial scales. The environmental performances of the FSs were measured through the application of an environmental accounting information system (EAIS) at field, site and farm level. The EAIS indicators were then integrated with: (1) a set of financial indicators to evaluate the economic and environmental trade-offs between different FSs and (2) with information on the regional and site-specific soil and climate conditions to study the impact of different pedo-climates on the environmental performances of the FSs. The gross margins of steady-state OFSs were found to be higher than the corresponding CFS gross margins. The OFSs perform better than IFSs and CFSs with respect to nitrogen losses, pesticide risk, herbaceous plant biodiversity and most of the other environmental indicators. However, on hilly soils, erosion was found to be higher in OFSs than in CFSs. The pesticide and the nitrogen indicators in this study showed a similar environmental impact caused by integrated and conventional farming practices. Regional pedo-climatic factors were found to have a considerable impact on nutrient losses, soil erosion, pesticide risk and herbaceous plant biodiversity, site-specific: factors on nutrient losses and soil erosion. Results at field level suggest that herbaceous plant biodiversity and crop production are not always conflicting variables. Results of the case study farms are discussed and compared with environmental sustainability thresholds reported from EU Directives on nitrate and pesticides in groundwater and the literature.

TI  - A natural analogue of nuclear waste glass in compacted bentonite
T2  - APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY
LA  - English
KW  - MINERALS
AB  - A marine based argillaceous rock containing volcanic glass shards has been investigated to infer the long-term durability of vitrified nuclear waste in compacted bentonite, which is a candidate for buffer material constituting the engineered barrier system for nuclear waste disposal. Fission track ages indicate that the volcanic glass shards, andesitic scoria, have been buried in the argillaceous rock for about 1 Ma. Neither glass matrix dissolution nor precipitation on the surface was seen under an optical microscope. Little leaching of any element has been recognized by analyses using an electron microprobe analyzer. Secondary ion mass spectrometry analysis, however, indicates significant hydration which may dominantly be a permeation of molecular water.
   As an indicator of durability of glass against groundwater a normalized mass loss of Si (NLSi) has been evaluated for the volcanic glass based on free energy for hydration, The difference between estimated NLSi of the volcanic glass and that of a simulated waste glass is within one order so that the volcanic glass may be analogous to a waste glass with respect to durability to water. The argillaceous rock is analogous to the compacted bentonite with respect to physical properties such as dry-density, unconfined compression strength, porosity, and hydraulic conductivity. The ambient physical and chemical conditions surrounding the volcanic glass have been also investigated: temperature was in the range from 4 to 30 degrees C due to the burial history of the volcanic glass. Over most of the past 1 Ma the volcanic glass has been in contact with groundwater originating from seawater. Thermodynamic calculations indicate (1) pH (= 7.74 - 7.94) of the groundwater has mainly been controlled by dissolution of carbonate minerals, (2) the redox potential (Eh = -34 - -73 mV) of the groundwater has dominantly been controlled by decomposition of organic materials to produce CH4(g), and (3) activity of aqueous silica of the groundwater was in equilibrium with SiO2 amorphous. Because of the equilibrium between aqueous silica and SiO2 amorphous, the volcanic glass did not dissolve during the burial.
   Vitrified nuclear waste sealed in compacted bentonite, therefore, will not dissolve significantly if buried in an environment as mentioned above, (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Changes in radial growth of the four coniferous species growing in the French Alps near the upper treeline are investigated. Thirty-seven populations of Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karat.], European larch (Larix decidua Mill.), Swiss stone pine (Pinus cembra L.) and mountain pine (Pinus uncinata Mill. ex Mirb.) were sampled by taking 1320 cores and analysing treering widths. Sites were chosen in various climatic conditions (macroclimate and aspect) and on two kinds of bedrock in order to take into account the ecological be haviour of these species. Belledonne, Moyenne-Tarentaise: Haute-Maurienne and Brianconnais areas were sampled along increasing gradients of summer aridity and winter continentality. The calculation of time series after removing the age trend brings strong evidence for an increase in radial growth during the two last centuries, but with different stages and fluctuations for each species. This growth trend is significantly enhanced since 1860 for the spruce, and since 1920 for the two pine species. Furthermore, it also appears on Larix decidua with the same pattern despite periodical growth reduction due to attacks of the larch bud moth (Zeiraphera diniana Gn.). The analysis of ring-widths at a given cambial age reveals that this enhanced phenomenon is observed especially during the tree's early years (25-75 years). The analysis of four regional climatic series, and three longer series of temperature (in farther single sites) reveals synchronous decadal fluctuations and an evident secular increase in minimum temperatures (especially in January and from July to October), that may be involved in tree-growth enhancement. Thermic amplitudes are significantly reduced during the whole growing period, what is more pronounced in Belledonne, the most oceanic region. Long term growth changes are well described by stepwise regression models, especially for the pine species. These models involved both a linear trend (CO2 concentration or N-deposition) and low frequency of Turin monthly temperatures. However, they show different patterns than those observed from response functions at a yearly scale.

AB  - Bryophytes and lichens are two main components of the forest floor vegetation. They provide essential ecosystem services, including nutrient recycling and water regulation. Here, we contrast the species richness, cover and community composition of forest floor bryophytes and lichens in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) dominated production forests. The study sites were located in the hemiboreal zone of southern Sweden, and represented early-, mid- and late rotation stands. Our aim was to examine the potential consequences for forest floor biodiversity from the decreasing use of Scots pine production forests in this region.
   Whereas Scots pine and Norway spruce stands did not differ in bryophyte cover, we found a higher cover of lichens in Scots pine stands, and highest in the intermediate aged stands. Also the species richness of lichens was higher in the Scots pine stands, while bryophyte species richness was higher in the Norway spruce stands. Differences in canopy cover and associated light transmittance to the forest floor appears to be important drivers for distinctive different forest floor communities in the Scots pine and Norway spruce stands, as revealed by NonMetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS). Mean Ellenberg indicator values for bryophytes and lichens showed that species associated with Scots pine stands were characterized by their tolerance of brighter conditions, higher insolation, and better adaptation to a continental climate. Norway spruce stands instead had a comparably larger proportion of species tolerating lower light, but also indicators of higher available nutrient levels, humidity, and pH. The outcome of the Ellenberg indicator species analysis, as well as the larger cover of lichens,and adaptations to drought found among some mosses, revealed that forest floor communities are shaped by different environmental factors in Scots pine and Norway spruce production stands. These environmental differences, and the quantified shifts in forest floor communities identified in this study, indicate the large shifts in understory bryophyte and lichen species composition and abundance that is likely to occur if Scots pine stands are converted to Norway spruce.

AB  - Deciduous-forested streams are often fueled by terrestrial litter detritus and have some of the lowest scores for biological condition in the United States (US). Detrital endpoints may be more predictive of nutrient stress than traditional algal endpoints in these ecosystems, but no standard detrital endpoints have been adopted by US assessment and regulatory agencies. Functional relationships between detrital measures and nutrient concentrations, and their dynamics across time, are needed to help guide detrital-endpoint and nutrient-criteria development for forested detrital-based streams. We conducted a 210-d laboratory mesocosm experiment in which we exposed maple and oak leaf disks to a dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP; as Na2PO4) gradient to examine the effects of time, litter type, and P enrichment on litter decay rates, microbial respiration rates, P:carbon (C) stoichiometry, and alkaline phosphatase activity (APA). Litter P : C tended to monotonically increase and saturate over time, whereas litter microbial respiration and APA were dynamic over time. We found Michaelis-Menten (M-M) functional relationships between litter P : C, decay rates, mean microbial respiration rates, mean inverse APA, microbial respiration:APA, and DIP concentrations. We assessed the relative sensitivity of detrital response variables to nutrient enrichment by examining the nutrient effect size (M-M maximum value:mean value in ambient DIP replicates), M-M 1/2 maximum saturation constants (K-s), and the ratio of effect size:K-s. Sensitivity across response variables depended on the response and litter type and differed among sensitivity metrics, and the relative sensitivity of maple litter compared to oak litter depended on the response variable. Mean microbial respiration rate associated with decomposing litter was most sensitive to nutrient enrichment, but the requirement for multiple collection events reduces its viability as an efficient endpoint measure. Litter stoichiometry and decomposition are good candidates for detrital nutrient endpoints because they are predictable over time, sensitive to P enrichment, and have been linked to aquatic life uses.

AB  - The structure and resilience of benthic communities in coastal and estuarine ecosystems can be strongly affected by human mediated disturbances, such as nutrient enrichment, often leading to changes in a food webs function. In this study, we used the Ecopath model (EwE) to examine two case studies where deliberate management actions aimed at reducing nutrient pollution and restoring ecosystems resulted in ecological recovery. Five mass balanced models were developed to represent pre and post-management changes in the benthic food web properties of the Tamar (1990, 1992, 2005) and Eden (1999, 2015) estuarine systems (UK). The network functions of interest were measures related to the cycling of carbon, nutrients and the productivity of the systems. Specific attention was given to the trophic structure and cycling pathways within the two ecosystems. The network attribute of ascendency was also examined as a proxy for resilience and used to define safe system-level operating boundaries. The results of the resilience metrics ascendancy (A) and its derivatives capacity (C) and overhead (O) indicate that both systems were more resilient and had higher resistance to potential stressors under low nutrient conditions. The less perturbed networks also cycled material more efficiently, according to Finns cycling index (CI), and longer cycling path lengths were indications of less stressed systems. Relative Ascendency (A/C) also proved useful for comparing estuarine systems of different sizes, suggesting the Tamar and Eden systems network structures have remained within their pre-defined "safe operating zones". Overall, this analysis presents justification that efforts to reduce nutrient inputs into the Tamar and Eden estuaries have had a positive effect on the trophic networks of each system. Moreover, the consensuses of the network indicators in both systems suggest ecological network analysis (ENA) to be a suitable methodology to compare the recovery patterns of ecosystems of different sizes and complexity.

AB  - The plant Halimione portulacoides, an abundant species widely distributed in temperate salt-marshes, has been previously assessed as bioindicator and biomonitor of mercury contamination in these ecosystems. The present study aims to assess uptake and distribution of total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MMHg) within H. portulacoides, potential mercury release by volatilization through leaves, and toxicity and tolerance mechanisms by investigating plant photochemical responses. Stem cuttings of H. portulacoides were collected from a salt-marsh within the Tagus estuary natural protected area, and grown under hydroponic conditions. After root development, plants were exposed to (HgCl2)-Hg-199 and CH3201 HgCl, and sampled at specific times (0, 1, 2, 4, 24, 72, 120, 168 (7 days) and 432 h (18 days)). After exposure, roots, stems and leaves were analysed for total Hg-199 ((THg)-Hg-199) and MM201 Hg content. Photobiology parameters, namely efficiency and photoprotection capacity, were measured in leaves. Both THg and MMHg were incorporated into the plant root system, stems and leaves, with roots showingmuch higher levels of both isotope enriched spikes than the other plant tissues. Presence of both mercury isotopes in the stems and leaves and high significant correlations found between roots and stems, and stems and leaves, for both THg and MMHg concentrations, indicate Hg translocation between the roots and above- ground organs. Long- term uptake in stems and leaves, leading to higher Hg content, was more influenced by temperature and radiation than short- term uptake. However, the relatively low levels of both THg and MMHg in the aerial parts of the plant, which were influenced by temperature and radiation, support the possibility of mercury release by stems and leaves, probably via stomata aperture, as a way to eliminate toxic mercury. Regarding photochemical responses, few differences between control and exposed plants were observed, indicating high tolerance of this salt marsh plant to THg and MMHg. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Large-scale bioenergy demand has triggered new approaches to straw management in Brazilian sugarcane fields. With the progressive shift from a burned to a nonburned harvest system, most of the straw presently retained on the soil surface has become economically viable feedstock for bioenergy production. The trade-offs between the need to preserve soil quality and produce more bioenergy have been the subject of intense discussion. This study presents a synthesis of available information on the magnitude of the main impacts of straw removal from sugarcane fields for bioenergy production and therefore represents an easily available resource to guide management decisions on the recommended amount of straw to be maintained on the field to take advantage of the agronomic, environmental, and industrial benefits. Crop residues remaining on sugarcane fields provide numerous ecosystem services including nutrient recycling, soil biodiversity, water storage, carbon accumulation, control of soil erosion, and weed infestation. Furthermore, several studies reported higher sugarcane production under straw retention on the field, while few suggest that straw may jeopardize biomass production in cold regions and under some specific soil conditions. Pest control is among the parameters favored by straw removal, while N2O emissions are increased only if straw is associated with the application of N fertilizer and vinasse. An appropriate recommendation, which is clearly site specific, should be based on a minimum mass of straw on the field to provide those benefits. Overall, this review indicates that most of the agronomic and environmental benefits are achieved when at least 7 Mg ha(-1) of dry straw is maintained on the soil surface. However, modeling efforts are of paramount importance to assess the magnitude and rates of straw removal considering the several indicators involved in this complex equation, so that an accurate straw recovery rate could be provided to producers and industry toward greater sustainability.

AB  - Plants in nutrient-poor environments typically have low foliar nitrogen (N) concentrations, long-lived tissues with leaf traits designed to use nutrients efficiently, and low rates of photosynthesis. We postulated that increasing N availability due to atmospheric deposition would increase photosynthetic capacity, foliar N, and specific leaf area (SLA) of bog shrubs. We measured photosynthesis, foliar chemistry and leaf morphology in three ericaceous shrubs (Vaccinium myrtilloides, Ledum groenlandicum and Chamaedaphne calyculata) in a long-term fertilization experiment at Mer Bleue bog, Ontario, Canada, with a background deposition of 0.8 g N m(-2) a(-1). While biomass and chlorophyll concentrations increased in the highest nutrient treatment for C. calyculata, we found no change in the rates of light-saturated photosynthesis (A(max)), carboxylation (V-cmax), or SLA with nutrient (N with and without PK) addition, with the exception of a weak positive correlation between foliar N and A(max) for C. calyculata, and higher V-cmax in L. groenlandicum with low nutrient addition. We found negative correlations between photosynthetic N use efficiency (PNUE) and foliar N, accompanied by a species-specific increase in one or more amino acids, which may be a sign of excess N availability and/or a mechanism to reduce ammonium (NH4) toxicity. We also observed a decrease in foliar soluble Ca and Mg concentrations, essential minerals for plant growth, but no change in polyamines, indicators of physiological stress under conditions of high N accumulation. These results suggest that plants adapted to low-nutrient environments do not shift their resource allocation to photosynthetic processes, even after reaching N sufficiency, but instead store the excess N in organic compounds for future use. In the long term, bog species may not be able to take advantage of elevated nutrients, resulting in them being replaced by species that are better adapted to a higher nutrient environment.

AB  - Establishing the habitat preferences of early hominin taxa is a necessary, though difficult, requirement for understanding the interaction between environmental change and hominin evolution. The environments typically associated with Australopithecus robustus have been reconstructed as predominantly open grasslands situated within a habitat mosaic that included a more wooded component with a nearby perennial water source. Most studies have concluded that the open grassland component represents the habitat preference of the hominins. In this study we investigate indicators of habitat association of A. robustus that are preserved in the animal paleocommunities represented in a series of fossil cave infills in the Bloubank Valley of South Africa, including Swartkrans, Sterkfontem, Kromdraai, and Coopers. Testing for conditions of isotaphonomy reveals a potential bias relating to depositional matrix and perhaps accumulating agent, though such a bias has not unduly influenced the taxonomic composition the assemblages. Correspondence analysis of census data from modern African nature reserves demonstrates that carnivore predation patterns are indicative of animal communities, which in turn are representative of habitats. As a result. modern census data are used to document patterns of habitat preference of large herbivores, thus allowing assignment of fossil taxa to a series of broadly defined habitat categories. Correspondence analysis of fossil assemblages reveals that the abundance profile of A. robustus is most similar to that of woodland-adapted taxa. In addition, fluctuations in the relative abundance of taxa assigned to the broad habitat categories reveal a significant negative correlation between A. robustus and open grassland-adapted taxa, indicating that the more grassland-adapted taxa there are in a given assemblage, the fewer hominins there tend to be. Thus, it appears that the open grasslands that comprise the majority of the paleoenvironments associated with A. robustus do not necessarily indicate the habitat preference of the hominins. Rather, it would appear that in addition to being dietary generalists, A. robustus were also likely to have been habitat generalists. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - 1. There is growing concern about declining species diversity in agro-ecosystems caused by agricultural intensification at the field and landscape scales. Species diversity of arable weeds is classically related to local abiotic factors and resource conditions. It is believed to be enhanced by organic farming but the surrounding landscape may also be important.
   2. This study assessed the ruderal vegetation, seed bank and seed rain in 24 winter wheat fields to examine the relative importance of organic vs. conventional farming and landscape complexity for weed species diversity. Diversity was partitioned into its additive components: alpha, beta and gamma diversity. Percentage arable land in a circular landscape sector of 1-km radius around each study site was used as an indicator of landscape complexity.
   3. Weed species diversity in the vegetation, seed rain and seed bank was higher in organic than in conventional fields. Increasing landscape complexity enhanced species diversity more strongly in the vegetation of conventional than organic fields, to the extent that diversity was similar in both farming systems when the landscape was complex. Species diversity of the seed bank was increased by landscape complexity irrespective of farming system.
   4. Overall diversity was largely determined by the high heterogeneity between and within the fields (beta diversity). Only in very few cases could higher weed species diversity in complex landscapes and/or organic farming be related to species dependence on landscape or farming system.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Local weed species diversity was influenced by both landscape complexity and farming system. Species diversity under organic farming systems was clearly higher in simple landscapes. Conventional vegetation reached similar diversity levels when the surrounding landscape was complex through the presence of refugia for weed populations. Consequently, agri-environment schemes designed to preserve and enhance biodiversity should not only consider the management of single fields but also of the surrounding landscape.

AB  - Since phytoecological and biodiversity studies deepen our understanding on ecosystem functioning and habitat health status of rangelands, this study analyzed the composition and plant taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of semi-arid steppe vegetation communities in rangelands of northeastern Algeria. Based on 80 floristic samples, vegetation was analyzed using various species diversity parameters (incidence- and abundance-based diversity and similarity indices, rarefaction and extrapolation estimations). Sampling totaled 75,197 plant individuals that were classified into 63 species, 55 genera and 21 families, with predominance of Asteraceae (33.3%) and Fabaceae (14.3%) species. Rarefaction and extrapolation curves applied for the whole steppe vegetation showed that the expected species richness was stable and no rare species could be found when increasing the sample size. Generalized linear models showed that the variation of plant diversity parameters (alpha-biodiversity) was significant among the phytoecological groups individualized. The multiple factor analysis demonstrated that inter-relationships between the phytoecological groups result from characteristics of soil surface, vegetation indicators, and dominant plant species that influenced plant diversity indices. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of similarity (beta-biodiversity) revealed high resemblances (>50%) between these groups, indicating a spatial homogenization of plant communities, which are dominated by annual species. The variation of phylogenetic diversity, estimated using taxonomic structures (i.e. genus/species and family/species ratios) was related to local environmental conditions. Phylogenetic diversity increased with the increase in total vegetation cover and the average height of Halfa grass (Stipa tenacissima), but it was negatively correlated with land degradation indicators such as sand deposit sheets, bedrock outcrop, coarse-grained materials, and plant necromass or vegetation litter). This study demonstrated that despite the recorded plant diversity, the quality of rangelands in the study area was of a therophytic character (substantial level of annuals), indicating a state of land and vegetation degradation in rangelands of northeastern Algeria.

AB  - Ground water is a precious natural resource in every aspect of human life from natural to artificial environment. Ground water is an indicator of regional development by improving the economic domain through intensive agricultural practices, and aesthetic value through sufficient ground water supply as drinking water, fertile soil, and healthy vegetation. However, ground water availability and associated human perceptions were the main themes of the present study. In this study, both primary and secondary data were incorporated to understand the human adaptation behaviour in drought-prone areas of the fringe of Chhotanagpur plateau region (Bankura-I and II blocks) to ground water storage. GWPZ mapping is a very important exposure to knowing the ground reality. So, the MCDM-AHP method has been developed based on the eight dominant conditioning factors viz. geomorphology, lithology, lineament density, soil, drainage density, LULC, average slope, and slope aspect using GIS analytics with field expertise. The output result was validated with comparing 105 inventory stations where 0.850 AUC value was good for accepting the GWPZ model. As a result, a major portion of the study area is dominated by poor to moderate possibilities of ground water level (ground water level drops 1-2 m during the pre-monsoon) due to Proterozoic granite gneiss formation over the study area. With comparing demographic status, it was not favourable for a healthy lifestyle. Agriculture dominated rural environment of Bankura-I and II blocks is far away from the modern digital environment that is why ground water has played a very crucial role in the field of development. Moreover, to build up a good level of ground water recharge zone through rainfall harvesting, and sustainable land use planning will be the best management practices. So, availability of ground water should be a positive sign of development in the field of the economic sector and sustainable human society.

AB  - Aim Impacts of longitudinal gradients on species distributions have received less attention than latitudinal gradients. In Canada, precipitation varies longitudinally, with direct effects on plant growth and fire regimes. Despite the geographical extent of Canadian boreal forests, vascular plant diversity is relatively limited, with just under 300 species. Understorey communities comprise most of this diversity and play key roles in forests, affecting succession, nutrient cycling and wildlife habitat. Our objective was to evaluate the relative impacts of local and regional environmental conditions on vascular plant community composition and diversity in the boreal forest. Location Sampling took place in 33 trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) stands along a transcontinental gradient in precipitation and fire regimes in boreal Canada. Methods We measured community composition and vegetation diversity indices of the vascular understorey in 400-m(2) plots and measured environmental variables at the local (drainage, nutrient and light availability, site heterogeneity) and regional (annual temperature and precipitation, fire weather index, landscape heterogeneity) scales. Multivariate analyses and hierarchical model selection were used to analyze patterns. Results Species composition varied longitudinally, with western and eastern species pools. Western indicator species tended to be fire-adapted pioneer species, while indicator species at eastern sites were fire avoiders and late-successional species. Species richness and intra-site beta diversity seemed primarily driven by local variables and did not vary across the country. Species evenness, however, was slightly higher in the western region and decreased under higher precipitation, colder temperatures, and higher landscape-level heterogeneity. Conclusion Our results suggested that even for similar canopy composition environmental variables play a key role in the establishment of plant communities and structure local plant assemblages by selecting or eliminating species from the regional pool, which was also controlled by fire regimes.

AB  - Although palms are recognized as a plant group of tropical and sub-tropical ecosystems, in South America they can also be found in temperate savannas under certain conditions. Therefore, since these plants have been widely used as palaeoindicators in warm and humid climates, it is important to know what phytolith contribution these plants have made in temperate environments. El Palmar National Park (Argentina) protects the largest remnant of savanna palm, Butia yatay (Mart) Becc., one of the southernmost palm communities in the continent. This modern analogue study assessed the variability of silica phytoliths in 15 selected species of plants, 20 mulch samples (organic horizon) and 60 soil samples that were collected in all the plant communities selected for this study: dense palm trees (DPT), shrubbery with isolated tall palms (SIP), psammophile steppe (PS) and humid psammophile steppe (HPS). Our results show that grasses exhibit the most diverse forms. Palms, sedges and dicots can be distinguished by the different proportions of several diagnostic morphotypes. Palm tree communities can be characterized based on a presence a high proportion of globular echinate and trapeziform sinuate/oblong phytoliths. Psammophile steppes have a high proportion of bilobate, polylobate and cross phytoliths and a low presence of globular echinate. Humid psammophile steppes show a high presence of bilobate, cross and dicot phytoliths with a low proportion of trapeziform sinuate/oblong phytoliths and an absence of globular echinate morphotypes. The ratio of palm to grass phytoliths allowed us to obtain differences between the palm groves, psammophile steppe and humid psammophile steppe ecosystems. These analyses can then be used to determine this type of ecosystem in temperate humid savannas. Phytolith assemblages provide an important record for the characterization of the plant-soil system and production-incorporation system in mixed communities as a tool in the construction of palm trees paleoenvironments.

AB  - The article presents the early results of research of sediments from a palaeolake in the Kleszczow Graben, central Poland. A total of 190 samples were collected and then ca 10-30 samples were botanically (diatoms, pollen and woody macrofossils), zoologically (Cladocera, Mollusca and Ostracoda) and geochemically (elemental content, carbon and nitrogen isotopes) tested. The results of muliproxy analysis of the Eemian (Aleksandrow Formation) and Vistulian (Weichselian; Piaski Formation) deposits helped to reconstruct the environmental changes occurring in the studied palaeolake. Palynological diagram of individual spectra "Parchliny 2014" was divided into five zones that represent local sets of pollen zones (E3-E7; PA-1-PA-5). This diagram, although incomplete, reveals the distinct Eemian features.
   Lithological, Cladocera and diatom analysis supported by geochemical studies indicate the existence of at least three main stages of the lake developed in the part of the basin. The lake originated from a post-Saalian melt-out kettle hole where the deposition of peats and organic, and mineral silts of different thicknesses to 10-12 m occurred (the first stage). In the second stage, initially existed a closed fairly deep Eemian lake under relatively warm conditions. The lower part of the section records an event of water body shallowing, consisting in its eutrophication, from oligotrophic to a lake of higher trophic status. Subsequently, in a cooler climate of Early Vistulian (Weichselian), the lake became shallower, and then open, flow and better oxygenated (flow-trough). Low frequency of ostracods and the absence of molluscs indicate slightly alkaline pH in the lower part of the water body, and neutral or slightly acidic pH in its upper part. At the bottom, the dominant organisms were diatoms, whereas toward the top, phytoplankton disappears and benthic taxa become predominant. Finally, in the third stage, in Plenivistulian, it was completely covered by mineral-organic and mineral sediments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB  - Overall abundance and species composition of radiolarian faunas were analyzed in surface sediment samples from representative areas of South China Sea, East China Sea, Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, Bering Sea, Philippine Sea, and the western boundary current regions of the North Pacific, in order to understand the biogeographic distribution of radiolarians in the Northwest Pacific and explore its relationship with the main environmental factors and the North Pacific circulation. The results showed that radiolarians in the Northwest Pacific surface sediments can be divided into two large biogeographic provinces-cluster A and cluster B. Cluster A is characterized by the dominance of warm-water species and distributed primarily in tropical and subtropical seas with high radiolarian abundance and diversity; whereas cluster B is predominated by cold water species and distributed mainly in the Arctic and subarctic seas with comparably low abundance and diversity. Cluster A is further divided into five subclusters, A1 to A5, which correspond to East China Sea, Philippine Sea, South China Sea, Sea of Japan, and Kuroshio Current, respectively; cluster B is divided into three subclusters, B1 to B3, which correspond to Sea of Okhotsk, Bering Sea, and subarctic gyre area, respectively. Based on the relationships between radiolarian faunas and major environment parameters in different biogeographic provinces, we suggest that the sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface salinity (SSS) are primary factors that influence productivity, composition, and distribution pattern of the radiolarian fauna in the Northwest Pacific regions, while water depth is likely responsible for regional differences in the radiolarian fauna in each marginal sea. In addition, according to the distribution and abundance patterns of common radiolarian species in different areas, we identified five special radiolarian assemblages, which may be used as indicators for main Kuroshio Current, Kuroshio-East China Sea Branch, Kuroshio-South China Sea Branch, Tsushima Current, and Oyashio Current water masses.

AB  - Emission inventories defining regional and global biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOC) emission strengths are needed to determine the impact of VOC on atmospheric chemistry (oxidative capacity) and physics (secondary organic aerosol formation and effects). The aim of this work was to contribute with measurements of tree species from the poorly described tropical vegetation in direct comparison with the quite well-investigated, highly heterogeneous emissions from Mediterranean vegetation. VOC emission from sixteen plant species from the Mediterranean area were compared with twelve plant species from different environments of the Amazon basin by an emission screening at leaf level using branch enclosures. Analysis of the volatile organics was performed online by a proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) and offline by collection on adsorbent tubes and subsequent gas chromatographic analysis. Isoprene was the most dominant compound emitted followed by monoterpenes, methanol and acetone. The average loss rates of VOC carbon in relation to the net CO2 assimilation were found below 4% and indicating normal unstressed plant behavior. Most of the Mediterranean species emitted a large variety of monoterpenes, whereas only five tropical species were identified as monoterpene emitters exhibiting a quite conservative emission pattern (alpha-pinene < limonene < sabinene < beta-pinene). Mediterranean plants showed additional emissions of sesquiterpenes. In the case of Amazonian plants no sesquiterpenes were detected. However, missing of sesquiterpenes may also be due to a lack of sensitivity of the measuring systems. Furthermore, our screening activities cover only 1% of tree species of such tropical areas as estimated based on recent biodiversity reports. Methanol emissions, an indicator of growth, were found to be common in most of the tropical and Mediterranean species. A few species from both ecosystems showed acetone emissions. The observed heterogeneous emissions, including reactive VOC species which are not easily detected by flux measurements, give reason to perform more screening at leaf level and, whenever possible, within the forests under ambient conditions.

AB  - In areas of intensive agriculture continuous applications of mineral and organic fertilizers can lead to an accumulation of phosphorus (P) in the soils and progressive saturation of their sorption capacities, increasing the risk of P losses to aquatic ecosystems. The long-term evolution (44 years) of soil P forms has been studied in a factorial experiment combining three soils (sandy, clay and a peaty) with three types of fertilization (no fertilizer, farmyard manure and mineral fertilizer). The P distribution in the calcium P (P-Ca), iron P (P-Fe), iron + aluminium P(PFe+Al) forms, and the effect of treatments on P availability (oxalate extractable-P, Mehlich-3-P, Olsen-P, water extractable-P) were determined. Two sorption P indices and the degree of soil saturation were also calculated.
   Soil P forms were affected by both quantity and quality of P inputs. Farmyard manure caused a more consistent increase in soil P content, affecting the water soluble and labile P forms (Mehlich-3-P and Olsen-P) in particular. Readily assimilable and potentially mobile P forms were positively correlated with the amount of high molecular weight humic fractions, thus stressing the importance of the type of incorporated materials and their evolution in determining soil P behaviour. Soils treated with farmyard manure, and to a lesser extent with mineral fertilizer, exceeded the threshold values of 20 mg kg(-1) for Olsen-P and 150 mg kg(-1) for Mehlich-3-P, thus evidencing a potential risk of P loss to water bodies. While in absolute terms the more consistent accumulations were observed in clay and peaty soils, the P content of sandy soils is of particular concern, given their lower P sorption capacity and higher degree of saturation. Among the soil P tests, Mehlich-3-P proved to be the best indicator to assess Italian soil conditions for both agronomic and environmental purposes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The energy efficiency of different biogas systems, including single and co-digestion of multiple feedstock, different biogas utilization pathways, and waste-stream management strategies was evaluated. The input data were derived from assessment of existing biogas systems, present knowledge on anaerobic digestion process management and technologies for biogas system operating conditions in Germany. The energy balance was evaluated as Primary Energy Input to Output (PEIO) ratio, to assess the process energy efficiency, hence, the potential sustainability. Results indicate that the PEIO correspond to 10.5-64.0% and 34.1-55.0% for single feedstock digestion and feedstock co-digestion, respectively. Energy balance was assessed to be negative for feedstock transportation distances in excess of 22 km and 425 km for cattle manure and for Municipal Solid Waste, respectively, which defines the operational limits for respective feedstock transportation. Energy input was highly influenced by the characteristics of feedstock used. For example, agricultural waste, in most part, did not require pre-treatment. Energy crop feedstock required the respect cultivation energy inputs, and processing of industrial waste streams included energy-demanding pre-treatment processes to meet stipulated hygiene standards. Energy balance depended on biogas yield, the utilization efficiency, and energy value of intended fossil fuel substitution. For example, obtained results suggests that, whereas the upgrading of biogas to biomethane for injection into natural gas network potentially increased the primary energy input for biogas utilization by up to 100%; the energy efficiency of the biogas system improved by up to 65% when natural gas was substituted instead of electricity. It was also found that, system energy efficiency could be further enhanced by 5.1-6.1% through recovery of residual biogas from enclosed digestate storage units. Overall, this study provides bases for more detailed assessment of environmental compatibility of energy efficiency pathways in biogas production and utilization, including management of spent digestate.

AB  - This article reports on an analysis of technical efficiency and environment-technology gaps in wheat farming in Iran. A random sample of 676 farmers was selected from the province of Kerman in 2004. In this study, Kerman is divided into five regions based on climatic and geographical conditions. The province is situated in the south-eastern part of Iran and contains substantial variations in climate.
   The technical efficiency indices are computed using three approaches. First, a standard stochastic production frontier was employed using pooled cross-sectional data. Secondly, regional stochastic frontier production functions were estimated. Lastly, the metafrontier approach was used because production environments and technologies are expected to differ between the five regions. Use of this method enabled technical efficiency scores to be corrected by the coefficient of the environment-technology gap ratio (ETGR). Estimates of the frontier were obtained assuming a translog functional form.
   Results indicate that farms differ in technical efficiencies, ETGRs and the use they make of inputs. Mean ETGRs vary substantially between farms and across regions whereas mean technical efficiencies are reasonably similar across regions but differ in the extent of variation among farms within each region. A low ETGR for the north-western region is attributable to a lack of water resources, restricting the ability of farmers to benefit from improved varieties, and small-sized farms, which militate against mechanization embodying labor-saving technologies.
   The results do not lead to definitive policy prescriptions. But they do provide indicators of where farm-level research is likely to be most effective in closing the environment-technology gap, for example by enabling farmers to take greater advantage of the productivity-enhancing effects of improved technologies embodied in cropping machinery and irrigation facilities. The ability of farmers to alleviate the environmental constraints on wheat production is likely to vary across regions, and will depend on the nature of these constraints and the ability of researchers to design technologies suited to each region that will overcome them.

AB  - Woodland dominated by Taxus baccata is one of the rarest of European woodland types and has priority habitat status under Annex I of the EU Habitats Directive, yet little is known about its stand dynamics or the effects of long-term grazing. The abundance of naturally regenerating seedlings and saplings was monitored over a 32-year period in exclosures in a yew-wood and a neighbouring oakwood in the Killarney National Park, southwest Ireland. Both woods are heavily grazed by introduced sika deer (Cervus nippon). Mortality, recruitment and growth of adult trees were monitored over a 20-year period. Comparison was made with unfenced plots adjacent to each of the exclosures. Regeneration in the yew-wood exclosures was chiefly by Ilex aquifolium, Sorbus aucuparia and Fraxinus excelsior. No Taxus baccata saplings were recorded and seedlings of this species were very rare throughout the duration of the experiment. Taxus baccata trees which died during the 20-year monitoring period were significantly smaller than those which survived, indicating that self-thinning is occurring and the wood in its present form may be of relatively recent origins. Changes in adult tree species composition suggest that yew woodland in Ireland may develop from a yew-hazel scrub woodland sere. A variety of species regenerated in the oakwood exclosures, including Taxus baccata, and dense holly thickets formed in several areas. Quercus petraea failed to regenerate beneath the oak canopy. We conclude that chronic heavy grazing in the Killarney woodlands strongly influences the natural regeneration of several tree species. Research into the scientific manipulation of grazing levels in temperate woodlands is required. However, grazing intensity is not the only factor affecting regeneration, canopy conditions in particular are also likely to be of high significance, and this should be reflected in management plans.

AB  - Shallow, anaerobic groundwater near a former manufactured-gas plant (MGP) in Charleston, South Carolina, USA, contains mono- and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs and PAHs, respectively). Between 1994 and 1997, a combination of field, laboratory, and numerical-flow and transport-model investigations were made to assess natural attenuation processes affecting MAH and PAH distributions. This assessment included determination of adsorption coefficients (K-ad) and first-order biodegradation rate constants (K-bio) using aquifer material from the MGP site and adjacent properties. Naphthalene adsorption (K-ad = 1.35 x 10(-7) m(3)/mg) to aquifer sediments was higher than toluene adsorption (K-ad = 9 34 x 10(-10) m(3)/mg), suggesting preferential toluene transport relative to naphthalene. However, toluene and benzene distributions measured in January 1994 were smaller than the naphthalene distribution. This scenario can be explained, in part, by the differences between biodegradation rates of the compounds. Aerobic first-order rate constants of C-14-toluene, C-14-benzene, and C-14-naphthalene degradation were similar (-0.84, -0.03, and 0.88 day(-1), respectively), but anaerobic rate constants were higher for toluene and benzene (-0.002 and -0.00014 day(-1), respectively) than for naphthalene (-0.000046 day(-1)). Both areal and cross-sectional numerical simulations were used to test the hypothesis suggested by these rate differences that MAH compounds will be contained relative to PAHs. Predictive simulations indicated that the distributions of toluene and benzene reach steady-state conditions before groundwater flow lines discharge to an adjacent surface-water body, but do discharge low concentrations of naphthalene. Numerical predictions were "audited" by measuring concentrations of naphthalene, toluene, and benzene at the site in early 1997. Measured naphthalene and toluene conentrations were substantially reduced and the areal extent of contamination smaller than was both observed in January 1994 and predicted for 1997. Measured 1997 benzene concentrations and distribution were shown to be relatively unchanged f rom those measured in 1994, and similar to predictions for 1997.

AB  - Stable isotopic data from marine limestones and their constituent fossils and marine cements can provide quantitative evidence for changes in global climate and ocean circulation. Oxygen isotopic data can indicate changes in temperature and ocean composition whereas stratigraphic variation in carbon isotope ratios may reflect changes in the carbon cycle that can be linked to changes in oceanic productivity and atmospheric greenhouse gases. Terrestrial carbonates - meteoric cements, calcretes and speleothems - similarly offer significant potential for understanding the evolution of terrestrial climates by providing evidence for the composition of rainwater and the nature of vegetative cover.
   Primary environmental isotopic signals may be obscured by the effects of post-depositional diagenetic alteration. Cementation and replacement reactions can take place in a wide range of diagenetic environments; the diagenetic history of an individual limestone is determined by a combination of its mineralogical diagenetic potential and depositional setting, together with subsequent changes in relative sea-level and burial history. Carbon isotopic values are less prone to alteration during diagenesis than oxygen values but shifts can be significant where organogenic carbon is incorporated. Linear covariation of carbon and oxygen values is not a reliable indicator of diagenetic alteration: water-rock interaction and fluid mixing may produce non-linear distributions.
   Attempts to determine long-term changes in climatic and oceanographic conditions through isotope stratigraphy of shallow-water limestones must include an assessment of the diagenetic history of the materials analysed. Petrographic examination using conventional microscopy backed up, where appropriate, by cathodoluminescence and scanning electron microscopy together with elemental and strontium isotopic analysis can help to identify the effects of diagenetic alteration. Where material with a range of different degrees of alteration is preserved in the same sediment it may be possible to compare patterns of isotopic and elemental variation and to attempt to unravel the effects of diagenesis in order to determine primary, environmental, isotopic signals. Recent research has shown that these techniques can be successfully employed in both Phanerozoic and Precambrian sediments.

AB  - The chemical oxygen demand (COD) of water bodies is an essential indicator of organic contaminants. The majority of current testing methods have the drawbacks of requiring multiple processes, being time-consuming, and requiring the use of harmful and hazardous reagents. In this work, a low-cost copper wire (Cu-wire) electrode was designed and fabricated to be used as a sensing electrode for the detection of chemical oxygen demand in water. The sensing features were developed by electrodeposition of copper nanoparticles (nano-Cu) that were prepared by fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) deposition at the optimum preparation conditions. For improving the adherence and stability of the deposited nano-Cu thin layer, the Cu-wire electrode was scratched to increase the surface roughness. The surface morphology of the prepared nano-Cu/Cu-wire electrode was investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) was used for elemental analysis characterization. The non-modified and the nano-copper modified electrode were utilized and optimized for electrochemical assay of COD using glycine as a standard in 0.075 M NaOH as an electrolyte solution. The calibration curves (COD, mg L(-1)vs. I, mA) were plotted from linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometry (I-t) curves for a wide range of COD under the optimized conditions. It shows that the electroanalytical features of the proposed nano-Cu-based COD sensor exhibit a linear range from 2 to 595 mg L-1 and a lower limit of detection (LOD) of 2.6 mg L-1 (S/N = 3). The established electrochemical method demonstrated a high tolerance level to Cl- ions where 1.0 M Cl- exhibited a negligible influence. The sensor was employed for detecting the COD in diverse real water samples and the attained results were validated using the standard dichromate method. The obtained results could open the window toward using simple and cost effective tools in order to monitor the water quality.

AB  - Modern microfossil distributions reflect site-specific habitats and provide an opportunity to assess sediment transport pathways in the nearshore environment. When applied to overwash deposits in the geological record, they provide insight into sediment provenance and transport, factors important for understanding patterns of frequency and intensity of past storms and tsunamis. Modern distribution studies are rare and often the first established ones occur immediately after an overwash event as part of a post-event field survey. This is problematic because it is unclear what effect overwash events have on nearshore microfossil assemblages and what time interval is necessary for them to return to pre-event conditions. This study documents the impacts of Hurricane Irma on nearshore sediments off the coast of Anegada, British Virgin Islands, using distributions of Homotrema rubrum, an encrusting foraminifer with a defined provenance in coral reefs. At four sampling intervals spanning two years, from six months pre-Hurricane Irma to eighteen months after, surface sediment was collected from three transects on the northern and southern shores of the island. Partitioning Around Medoids cluster analysis revealed that Hurricane Irma introduced an influx of well-preserved fragments into the reef flat and made the sediments more uniform, limiting the foraminifer's utility as a known sediment transport indicator. The mixing of sediments along the two northern transects (reef proximal) persisted for seven to eighteen months before returning to near pre-hurricane conditions. However, the southern transect (absence of reef), where Homotrema rubrum concentrations are significantly less, failed to recover within the time period assessed by this study, indicating a variable recovery period between Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea facing shorelines. Results from this study suggest that a waiting period of at least eighteen months after a major storm is recommended before collecting surface sediment from the nearshore environments of reef-dominated coastlines.

AB  - Patterns of soil properties in highland environments remain poorly understood and limited knowledge exists on soil quality with respect to land use systems and topographic configurations. In this study, patterns of 12 surface soil physicochemical properties were assessed over a period of three years with respect to land use systems and toposequence positions in the Rwizi catchment of the Lake Victoria Basin. Four land use systems constituting mulched banana, unmulched banana, grassland and tree plantation, and three toposequence positions stratified as footslope, midslope and summit were considered and three replications were applied resulting in a total of 36 sites for soil properties measurements over a three-year period. Topographic attributes (elevation, slope gradient, slope aspect, and location) were collected at each site and correlated with surface soil properties. With the exception of pH and Ca, surface soil physicochemical properties are revealed to be optimal in the catchment. Greater spatial variation was found with soil chemical properties (8-57%) compared to physical properties (7-19%). Land use system registered significant effects (p < 0.05) for all soil chemical properties, as well as bulk density. Toposequence position is shown to have significant (p < 0.05) effects on soil pH, Soil Organic Matter, available P, N and soil texture. The effect of toposequence position revealed better soil quality along the catenary sequence summit > footslope > midslope. Strong and significant regression coefficients (r(2) > 0.6, p < 0.05) for topographic attributes were found with soil pH, available P, K, Ca, Mg and sand. Overall, the land use system effect supersedes toposequence position in accounting for variations in surface soil physicochemical properties. Although environments of the Lake Victoria Basin are subject to intense agricultural activity and are usually assumed to be degraded, surface soil physicochemical properties in this part of the catchment reflect relatively healthy soil quality conditions.

AB  - In recent years, the requirements for the level of the life quality have increased significantly; an integral part of it is the sexual harmony, which in men largely depends on sexual desire and erectile function. According to the results of modern scientific studies, there is no doubt that erectile dysfunction in men is closely connected with the cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes mellitus and other comorbidities. This problem can also be caused by systematic psycho-emotional overload, deterioration of the environmental conditions, harmful factors of production, uncontrolled use of medicines, inflammatory processes in the genital organs, the growth of somatic diseases. The vast majority of works concerning "male menopause" is reduced to the effectiveness of hormone-replacement therapy in erectile dysfunction, while only few research works are devoted to the study of the connection between somatic pathology and androgen deficiency. There is a negative correlation between total testosterone level and systolic blood pressure. According to the research results of some scientists, it was found that 38% of patients with arterial hypertension had androgen deficiency, confirmed in the laboratory, which is significantly higher than in patients of the same age category with normal blood pressure. These dominant factors exert and increase the influence on each other, which must be taken into account in modern therapeutic practice. The study of the formation of comorbid conditions in men with low levels of androgens is of particular importance, as the knowledge of pathophysiological mechanisms can prevent their development and progression. The aim of this investigation was to study the state of penile vascular blood flow in men with arterial hypertension with erectile dysfunction, using color Doppler imaging with pharmacological induction of erection. The indicators of daily monitoring of arterial pressure and arterial stiffness in men with arterial hypertension of the II degree against the background of androgen deficiency or at normal testosterone levels and ways of correction of erectile dysfunction in these patients were also evaluated.

AB  - Question Fens have a well-developed bryophyte layer covering most of the ground. Non-sphagnaceous bryophytes, especially the group of so-called brown mosses, prevail over sphagna under alkaline conditions. In sub-alkaline conditions, rich fens allow the co-occurrence of both these functional groups, but sphagna are competitively superior over non-sphagnaceous bryophytes and seedlings of vascular plants, and they are currently expanding in some regions. We test whether the ratio between the two major bryophyte functional groups (bryo-ratio) accounts for the species composition of vascular plants in fens. Location Central and Eastern Europe. Methods Analysis of two existing regional- and continental-scale data sets of the vegetation- plot records and measured local factors by Canonical Correspondence Analysis with variation partitioning (community-level analysis) and Structural Equation Modelling (species-level analysis). Results At the community level, the bryo-ratio accounted significantly for species composition of fen-specialized vascular plants, more obviously in the regional-scale data set. At the species level, more fen species (50-67% according to the data set) were significantly directly affected (adjusted p < 0.05) by the bryo-ratio than by water pH (14-17%) and by measured water table depth (WTD) in the regional data set (12.5%). In the continental data set, the comparable proportions of species were directly affected by the bryo-ratio and WTD inferred by soil moisture indicator values (50% vs 58%). Most of the species affected significantly by the bryo-ratio preferred the fens rich in non-sphagnaceous bryophytes. They were largely those with a low capability of vegetative reproduction. Conclusions The group of species preferring brown moss patches includes mostly rare and endangered species with a great need for generative reproduction (e.g., Primula farinosa, Triglochin palustris, Pedicularis palustris, Saxifraga hirculus). Our findings demonstrate the important role of the bryophyte layer in the structuring of vascular plant communities in fens and highlight urgent conservation needs for brown moss patches.

AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has long been used in archaeology since the earliest space radar missions in the 1980s. In the current scenario of SAR missions, the Italian Space Agency (ASI)'s COnstellation of small Satellites for Mediterranean basin Observation (COSMO-SkyMed) has peculiar properties that make this mission of potential use by archaeologists and heritage practitioners: high to very high spatial resolution, site revisit of up to one day, and conspicuous image archives over cultural heritage sites across the globe. While recent literature and the number of research projects using COSMO-SkyMed data for science and applied research suggest a growing interest in these data, it is felt that COSMO-SkyMed still needs to be further disseminated across the archaeological remote sensing community. This paper therefore offers a portfolio of use-cases that were developed in the last two years in the Scientific Research Unit of ASI, where COSMO-SkyMed data were analysed to study and monitor cultural landscapes and heritage sites. SAR-based applications in archaeological and cultural heritage sites in Peru, Syria, Italy, and Iraq, provide evidence on how subsurface and buried features can be detected by interpreting SAR backscatter, its spatial and temporal changes, and interferometric coherence, and how SAR-derived digital elevation models (DEM) can be used to survey surface archaeological features. The use-cases also showcase how high temporal revisit SAR time series can support environmental monitoring of land surface processes, and condition assessment of archaeological heritage and landscape disturbance due to anthropogenic impact (e.g., agriculture, mining, looting). For the first time, this paper provides an overview of the capabilities of COSMO-SkyMed imagery in StripMap Himage and Spotlight-2 mode to support archaeological studies, with the aim to encourage remote sensing scientists and archaeologists to search for and exploit these data for their investigations and research activities. Furthermore, some considerations are made with regard to the perspectives opened by the upcoming launch of ASI's COSMO-SkyMed Second Generation constellation.

AB  - The nutritional and technological value of grains is determined mostly by genetic traits of crops, and also by environmental conditions, such as the weather, soil conditions and applied crop production technology. The aim of the study was to assess the effects of nitrogen fertilisation on the yield components, the yield of grains, grain mineral content and technological indicators, including fatty acid profiles, in grains of winter wheat. A field experiment was carried out in north-eastern Poland (53 degrees 72 N: 20 degrees 42 E), in 2013-2016. The aim was to examine the following two factors: I - two doses of nitrogen fertilisation (150 and 200 kg ha(-1)); II - four wheat varieties (Bogatka, KWS Ozon, Sailor. and Smuga). The yield of grains of the tested winter wheat varieties ranged from 6.64 to 8.35 t he. A significant effect of the varieties on the yield of grains was noted, with the emphasis on the better yield of Bogatka and KWS Ozon varieties. Generally, a higher nitrogen dose resulted in an increase in the Fe content (by 10.0%) owing to its higher content in grains of the varieties Bogatka (by 27.3%), Sailor (by 16.7%), and Smuga (by 8.9%). Linoleic acid (57.9%), palmitic acid (23.0%), oleic acid and octadecanoic acid (12.1%), linolenic acid (4.0%) and stearic acid (1.2%) were quantitatively dominant in the fatty acid profile of the oil. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) accounted for an over 60% share in the total fatty acid content. No significant average effect of the increase in nitrogen fertilisation on changes to the fatty acid content in wheat grains was demonstrated, which suggests that the percentage of fatty acids in lipids is dependent on the genetic factor rather than on fertilisation. High correlation was found between the monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) content and the amounts of Cu (r = 0.815) and Fe (r = 0.616). Adequate quality of wheat grains can be guaranteed by proper selection of a variety.

AB  - Repetitive heat and drought stress conditions have a significant impact on quantity and quality of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) production in most regions of the world. Objective of this study was to determine the relationships between photosynthetic performance index (PIABS), water use (WU), grain yield-based water use efficiency (WUEG), and grain yield per pot (GYP) of winter barley cultivars grown in a pot trial under short-term drought stress conditions and grain yield and its stability from the multi-environmental field trials. Ten winter barley cultivars were examined in two water treatments. One treatment was well watered, while the second treatment was subjected to short-term stress caused by deficiency of water in the stages of full tillering, beginning of heading, and grain filling. PIABS was measured at full tillering stage while WU, WUEG, and GYP of barley cultivars were estimated after the whole vegetative cycle. Also, multi-environmental field trials with the same winter barley cultivars were carried out during 4 yr (2004-2007) and 3 yr (2009-2011) with two sowing densities (300 and 450 seeds m(-2)) on multiple locations in the lowland part of the Republic of Croatia. ANOVA showed highly significant (P <= 0.001) cultivar effect for all of the examined traits in the pot trial. PIABS of cultivars in both treatments was in a negative nonsignificant correlation with grain yield and grain yield stability (ecovalence) of the same cultivars in multi-environmental field trials. Winter barley cultivars with higher WU and WUEG also had higher values of grain yield, and harvest index observed on the basis of the pot trial. WU, WUEG, and GYP of 10 barley cultivars in pot trial showed highly positive phenotypic correlation with grain yield of all eight and 10 barley cultivars in the multi-environmental field trials. These results suggests that WU and WUEG could be good indicators for preliminary selection of modern, high yielding, and stable winter barley genotypes which have better water management capabilities.

AB  - Fluctuations of the water level at the edges of temporary water bodies provide favourable living conditions for annual plant communities of the phytosociological class Isoeto-Nanojuncetea. Such communities of periodically flooded ponds within the agricultural landscape of NE Germany are particularly rich in rare plant species of that class. During the past decades drainage, fertilisation and herbicides in the surrounding arable fields have led to a severe decline in diversity of these species. To develop efficient conservation strategies it is essential to understand the factors driving the species composition. Therefore, we studied how varying water regimes, soil properties and agricultural practices affect the diversity and species composition of these temporary ponds.
   The study was carried out in seven ponds on a conventionally managed farm in NE Brandenburg. At each of these wetlands mixed soil samples were taken to determine the pH, total nitrogen and phosphorus concentration. The plant species were recorded in 177 plots, each covering 1 x 1 m(2). For each plot, the water level was recorded in April, July and August 2013, respectively, resulting in five 'water level regimes'. Total species number and percentages of Isoeto-Nanojuncetea species were determined per plot, to evaluate water level effects on the vegetation. In addition, mean Ellenberg indicator values for light, moisture and nutrients were calculated to assess the environmental conditions.
   Kruskal-Wallis tests with subsequent multiple comparisons showed significant differences between water regimes in both total species richness and percentage of Isoeto-Nanojuncetea species. Isoeto-Nanojuncetea species established best at sites with fluctuating water levels. Fitting environmental variables to NMDS ordination axes indicated that the water regime was the most significant factor for floristic variation. In plots with a more uniform water regime the species composition was explained mainly by the soil fertility. Farming practices showed less pronounced effects on species composition.
   Our results suggest that maintaining water regimes with fluctuating water levels and keeping nutrient content low are crucial for the successful conservation of Isoeto-Nanojuncetea communities in arable landscapes.

AB  - Zoological remains were examined from the sediments of the Pingualuit Crater Lake, Nunavik, Canada. Our objective was to describe past climate events in the area of delayed deglaciation in northernmost Ungava Peninsula. Our record covers 3 separate sections of deglacial and postglacial invertebrate dynamics interrupted by laminated proglacial sediments and a basin-scale erosive slumping event. The abundance of animal remains in the ultra-oligotrophic and extremely deep arctic lake was low, but distinct faunal assemblages were found among the intervals, results implying that they were environmentally heterogeneous. The lowermost fine-grained interval (before 6850 calibrated years before present [cal BP]), revealed that Cladocera Chydorus sphaericus-type and Bosmina (Eubosmina) longispina-type were common in the lake, whereas Chironomidae were relatively rare. The dominance of B. longispina-type showed that planktonic communities were successful at the time, probably indicating more favorable climatic conditions than today soon after the last deglaciation (similar to 7000 cal BP). In the middle interval (between similar to 6850 and 5750 cal BP), chironomids became more common and were dominated by Heterotrissocladius subpilosus-type and Protanypus, taxa that are characteristic of oligotrophic lakes. The extirpation of B. longispina-type suggests that planktonic invertebrate communities were not successful, probably because of predation by Arctic char. The presence of the chironomid Oliveridia tricornis-type during the late Holocene (between similar to 4200 and 600 cal BP) suggested general climate cooling. Our paleoclimatic conclusions on the regional environmental history suggest a stationary ice front in the initial stages of the Holocene, favorable climatic conditions in the mid-Holocene and a general late-Holocene cooling. Our records also indicate a subtle increase in nutrient availability throughout the Holocene. The paleoecological record from Pingualuit Crater Lake is valuable in describing the faunal history and biotic resilience in this environmentally extreme lake, which presently contains one of the world's softest and most transparent waters.

AB  - The origin of the organic matter (OM) and the characteristics of the paleoenvironment of Serbian brown coals covering a time-span from the Lower to the Upper Miocene were evaluated and compared based on comprehensive petrological and biomarker analyses. Investigated coals are typical humic coals. Peat-forming vegetation is characterized by abundant decay resistant gymnosperm (coniferous) plants, followed by variable amount of angiosperms. Coal forming plants belonged to the gymnosperm families Taxodiaceae, Podocarpaceae, Cupressaceae, Araucariaceae, Phyllocladaceae and Pinaceae. Peatification proceeded in fresh water environment under variable Eh settings, from anoxic to slightly oxic condition. Upper Miocene lignites were formed in neutral to slightly acidic environment, whereas Lower and Middle Miocene coals were deposited under neutral to slightly alkaline, and more reductive conditions, which is the result of calcium-rich surface waters derived from the surrounding Jurassic to Cretaceous calcareous country rock and higher water column level. Diagenetic changes of the OM were governed by bacterial activity, rather than thermal alteration. Biomarker pattern does not significantly differ in Serbian coals of different ages. The main differences between Upper, Middle and Lower Miocene coals are expressed by higher Gelification Index (GI), proxy ratio (P-aq), n-C-23/(n-C-27 + n-C-31) and pimarane/16 alpha(H)-phyllodadane ratio, as well as lower relative abundance of C-31 alpha beta(R)-hopane of the latter one. OM of Lower Miocene coals is more mature, corresponding to immature/early mature stage (huminite/vitrinite reflectance similar to 0.45), whereas OM of Upper Miocene lignites is in immature diagenetic phase (huminite reflectance similar to 0.3). Consequently, higher gelification of Lower Miocene coals is probably an effect of higher rank, however high humidity/wet climate and low acidity within the mire could not be excluded. A good correlation between biomarker parameters and paleoclimate data is observed, indicating that biomarker patterns represent a valuable tool that reflect even slight paleoclimate changes in Serbia during Miocene.

AB  - In this study, we examined the stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.) (Diptera: Muscidae), larval developmental habitat within the round hay bale feeding sites on cattle pastures, and we identified three zones with distinct characteristics around two types of hay feeders (ring and cone). The parameters monitored in each zone included stable fly emergence, substrate temperature, moisture, pH, thickness of hay-manure layer, and concentration of fecal coliform bacteria (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella oxytoca) as indicators of fecal material. All measurements were conducted during the period of high stable fly prevalence (HSF) in May-June and low stable fly prevalence (LSF) in July-August to better understand the environmental factors influencing stable fly seasonality. Substrate temperature and fecal coliform concentration were the only two significantly different factors between HSF and LSF. Temperatures ranged from 21 to 25 degrees C during HSF versus 25-30 degrees C in LSF but all were within the range for successful stable fly development. Fecal coliform concentrations ranged from 4.2 x 10(3) to 4.1. x 10(4) colony-forming units (CFU)/g of the substrate during HSF and from undetectable (<10) to 100 CFU/g during LSF. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of different hay:manure ratios (0:1, 1:1, 2:1, and 5:1) on stable fly development (egg to adult). Temperature was significantly higher and stable fly developmental time significantly shorter in all Substrates containing hay when compared with that of manure alone, but no significant differences were detected in stable fly emergence among the substrates. These results strongly indicate that the fecal microbial community plays air important role in stable fly larval development in hay feeding sites and that it is the main factor behind stable fly developmental seasonality on pastures. Our results also demonstrate that animal manure mixed with hay provides conditions or faster stable fly development than manure alone; however, hay does not significantly affect overall stable fly emergence.

The time of the postembryonic development was significantly shorter (p < 0.05) for C picanus than for P persimilis when they were fed with eggs, larvae and deutonymophs of T. cinnabarinus. When fed with eggs and a combination of different stages off cinnabarinus, The intrinsic rate of growth (r(m)) wits significantly higher (p < 0.05) for C picanus (0.289 and 0.307, respectively) than for P persimilis (0.019 and 0.025, respectively). The values of the finite rate of growth (lambda) were also significantly (1) < 0.05) higher for C. picanus (1.34 and 1.36) than for P. persimilis (1.02 and 1.03) when they were nourished with eggs and a mixed diet, respectively. The high values of r(m) and lambda found for C. picanus in the experimental conditions are indicators of the possible control that this phytoseiid mite, its a predator of T cinnabarinus, would potentially offer under the conditions of lower relative humidity encountered in the and zone of the desert of Chile.

AB  - center dot Background and Aims Polyploidy is viewed as an important mechanism of sympatric speciation, but only a few studies have documented patterns of distribution and ecology of different cytotypes in their contact zone. Aster amellus agg. (Asteraceae) is one of the species with documented multiple ploidy levels. The aim of this study was to determine spatial distribution and ecology of two cytotypes, diploid (2n = 18) and hexaploid (2n = 54), of Aster amellus agg. at their contact zone in the Czech Republic.
   center dot Methods Root-tip squashes and flow cytometry were used to determine the ploidy of 2175 individuals from 87 populations. To test whether some differences in ecology between the two ploidy levels exist, in each locality releves were recorded and abiotic conditions of the sites were studied by estimating potential direct solar radiation, Ellenberg indicator values and above-ground biomass.
   center dot Key Results Together with diploid and hexaploids, minorite cytotypes (triploid, pentaploid and nonaploid) were found. No significant ecological differences between diploid and hexaploid cytotypes were found. In spite of this, no population consisting of both of the two basic cytotypes was found.
   center dot Conclusions The results of this study show that the contact zone of diploid and hexaploid cytotypes in the Czech Republic is much more diffuse than indicated in previous records. Although populations of both cytotypes occur in close proximity (the closest populations of different cytotypes were 500 m apart), each individual population consists of only one basic ploidy level. This was unexpected since there are no clear differences in abiotic conditions between populations. Taken together with the absence of an intermediate tetraploid cytotype and with reference to published world distributional patterns of different ploidy levels, this suggests a secondary contact zone. Detailed genetic study is, however, necessary to confirm this.

AB  - The Sr-87/Sr-86 isotope ratio in subfossil carbonate mollusc shells from raised-beach sediments is used as a palaeosalinity indicator for the Baltic Sea. The main purpose is to demonstrate the applicability of the method in a formerly glaciated area, using Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios found in modem shells (Mytilus edulis, Macoma baltica, and Radix balthica) to elucidate the parameters and conditions to be used for palaeosalinity determinations based on subfossil shells. Proxy salinity data are calculated assuming that the Sr concentration in Baltic Sea water is controlled by a two-component, conservative mixing between seawater and river water. Based on replicate determinations of the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio in modem shells, proxy salinity data can be quantified with a relative precision of better than 5% for salinities up to similar to 10 parts per thousand. Comparison with measured, present-day salinities indicates that the accuracy is generally better than 5% for the proxy data. With this precision and accuracy, the present-day salinity differences between the major Baltic sub-basins (Bothnian Bay, Bothnian Sea, and Baltic Proper) can be detected.
   Palaeosalinities were determined using subfossil shells (M. edulis and M baltica) with calibrated C-14 ages of 6770-3070 cal BP. The shell deposits occur from 65m a.s.l. down to the present-day sea level. The palaeosalinities determined for the Bothnian Bay (4.8-10.3 parts per thousand) and the Bothnian Sea (7.3-10.3 parts per thousand) are in good agreement with earlier estimates of the maximum Littorina Sea stage palaeosalinity in these sub-basins (8-10 parts per thousand). At one locality, two different shell species from the same shell deposit were dated (M. edulis and M baltica). The shells differed in age by 460 +/- 70 C-14 years, a possible indication that the ecological conditions at a locality may have been favourable to different faunas at different times.

AB  - Carbon isotope composition, photosynthetic gas exchange, and nitrogen content were measured in leaves of three varieties of Metrosideros polymorpha growing in sites presenting a variety of precipitation, temperature and edaphic regimes. The eight populations studied could be divided into two groups on the basis of their mean foliar delta-C-13 values, one group consisting of three populations with mean delta-C-13 values ca. -26 parts per thousand and another group with delta-C-13 values ca. -28 parts per thousand. Less negative delta-C-13 values appeared to be associated with reduced physiological availability of soil moisture resulting from hypoxic conditions at a poorly drained high elevation bog site and from low precipitation at a well-drained, low elevation leeward site. Gas exchange measurements indicated that foliar delta-C-13 and intrinsic water-use efficiency were positively correlated. Maximum photosynthetic rates were nearly constant while maximum stomatal conductance varied substantially in individuals with foliar delta-C-13 ranging from -29 to -24 parts per thousand. In contrast with the patterns of delta-C-13 observed, leaf nitrogen content appeared to be genetically determined and independent of site characteristics. Photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency was nearly constant over the range of delta-C-13 observed, suggesting that a compromise between intrinsic water- and N-use efficiency did not occur. In one population variations in foliar delta-C-13 and gas exchange with leaf cohort age, caused the ratio of intercellular to atmospheric partial pressure of CO2 predicted from gas exchange and that calculated from delta-C-13 to be in close agreement only in the two youngest cohorts of fully expanded leaves. The results indicated that with suitable precautions concerning measurement protocol, foliar delta-C-13 and gas exchange measurements were reliable indicators of potential resource use efficiency by M. polymorpha along environmental gradients.

AB  - In order to investigate the pollution characteristics of size-segregated particles and metal elements (MEs) after the Chinese Air Pollution Prevention Action Plan was released in 2013, an intensive field campaign was conducted in the suburban area of Chaoyang District, Beijing in winter 2016. The size distributions of particle mass concentrations were bimodal, with the first peak in the fine fraction (0.4-2.1 mu m) and the second peak in the coarse fraction (3.3-5.8 mu m). Moreover, the proportion of fine particles increased and the proportion of coarse particles decreased as the pollution level was more elevated. It was found that the composition of coarse particles is as important as that of fine particles when pollution of aerosol metals in the atmosphere in 2016 were compared to 2013. In addition, according to the size distribution characteristics, 23 MEs were divided into three groups: (a) Fe, Co, Sr, Al, Ti, Ba, and U, which concentrated in coarse mode; (b) Zn, As, Cd, Tl, and Pb, which concentrated in fine mode; and (c) Na, K, Be, V, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Mo, Ag, and Sn, showing bimodal distribution. Under clean air, slight pollution and moderate pollution conditions, most elements maintained their original size distributions, while under severe pollution, the unimodal distributions of most MEs became bimodal distributions. The factors analysis combined with size distributions indicated that Na, Zn, Mo, Ag, Cd, and Tl, showing the moderate to severe contamination on environment, were significantly influenced by diffuse regional emissions or anthropogenic source emissions (vehicle exhaust emissions and combustion process). The environmental risk assessment revealed that the heavy metal loading in the atmospheric particles collected had a high potential for ecological risk to the environment during sampling period because of the high contribution of Cd, Tl, Zn and Pb.

AB  - Softwood lumber is widely used for the manufacture of load-bearing structures. However, the quality of round timber for lumber manufacturing has been deteriorating recently. The average diameter of round timber entering sawmills is constantly decreasing, and heart rot is common in large-diameter round timber. This is due to the fact that more and more conifers in the forest are being affected by heart rot. The rot infestation is related to the deterioration of the ecological situation caused by environmental pollution. As a rule, the removal of rot occurs at the stage of round timber harvesting. Therefore, during harvesting, most of the wood with heart rot continues to remain in the forest. In addition to littering the area, it continues to infect sound wood. At the same time, together with the wood affected by rot, the sound sapwood, which has good strength characteristics, is also removed. A method for processing round timber with heart rot into elements of load-bearing structures is proposed. In particular, a technological scheme for manufacturing I-beams from such timber has been developed for low-rise house construction. Corner elements are produced as a result of cutting round timber and removing heart rot by milling. The corner elements are dried in clamped state using special devices. Then they are glued together to obtain beams with a cross-section in the form of an I-beam. A set of equipment for the processing round timber with heart rot was selected. The paper presents the results of calculating the costs for organizing the production. The effectiveness of the technological project is evaluated using the method of discounted cashflows by the following indicators: net present value, profitability index, and discounted payback period. The assessment results confirm the effectiveness of the production organization of load-bearing structures made of round timber affected by heart rot. The processing of wood that remains in the forest into elements of building structures not only increases the wood reserves for construction, but also creates conditions for improving the ecological situation in forest areas.

AB  - Land produces a range of benefits, from ecosystem services, but markets only incentivise the production of a small proportion of them. The Ecosystem Approach develops plans for moving towards a more optimal mix. This requires stakeholders to understand the value of ecosystem services and how these values change with land-use and management. We investigate whether process-based modelling and economic valuation can help stakeholders to do this. We do this by applying these tools to a plan to improve ecosystem services delivery in a catchment. To be used in decision-support, analytical approaches need to be relatively inexpensive and rapid, and our analysis was deliberately constrained in this way. Two 25-year future scenarios were developed and compared against a baseline scenario. The first Designated Site scenario was based on enhancing the condition of nationally important nature conservation sites. The second, Ecosystem Services scenario, represented implementing the ecosystem services delivery plan. We modelled the change between the scenarios with an internationally recognised process based ecosystem services toolkit (the Land Use Capability Indicator, LUCI tool) and used the model outputs to inform economic valuation methods. Our selection of which ecosystem services to model and value were initially identified through a participatory approach. However those we could quantify was limited by evidence and data availability. We assessed changes in water quality (phosphorus load), sediment generation, carbon storage and flood regulation. We were able to put economic values on only carbon sequestration and flood regulation. Both the modelling results and the experience of applying the linked modelling-valuation approach are examined in the discussion to consider the limitations to the current usefulness of linking process based modelling to economic valuation for informing land management policy. We explore the origin and nature of these limitations and the key bottlenecks that need to be overcome, applicable to its use in other sites, regions and countries. This includes the availability of suitable coefficients and/or underlying data/evidence to parameterise the model, and the compatibility of model outputs with available economic valuation evidence (for value transfer).

AB  - The genetically modified common bean (Pbaseolus vulgaris L.) cv. Flor de Mayo Anita, with the Arabidopsis thaliana defensin gel (pdf1.2) was characterized by its biological effectiveness and agronomic advantage under confined conditions. Releasing this technology into the environment requires an Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) in order to identify the possible adverse effects that the suggested use of the recombinant technology may have on the environment when evaluating the probability of risk, its severity, and the biosafety measures recommended to reduce possible risks. The problem formulation was established in the earlier manuscript and it gave rise to three operative protection goals related to the adverse effects on pathogenic organisms and non-target organisms, the increase in the competitive capacity of the common bean-pdf1.2, and the gene flow to conventional bean crops and wild relatives. The final evaluation points were defined, and from there, nine risk hypotheses were outlined. The ERA dismissed the possibility of occurrence of any damages caused by the expression of the defensin or neomycin phosphotransferase II proteins on the non-target microorganisms and the development of resistance on target organisms. Likewise, the possibility of an increase in the competitive capacity of the common bean-pdf1.2 was discarded, since it is a highly dependent agricultural system, and finally, the possibility of an introgression of recombinant sequences into conventional crops or wild relatives was defined as all unlikely risk, due to the absence of coincidences in its phenological stages during its environmental release, along with the genetic barriers among wild relatives. The biosafety measures recommended to minimize the possibility of damage consisted in establishing live bean and maize barriers, the phenological lag between the common bean-pdf1.2 and conventional bean; follow-up studies during release such as the characterization of soil microorganisms before, during and after environmental release, as well as the identification of voluntary plants after the harvest.

AB  - Small-scale fisheries (SSFs) are large contributors to worldwide catches and local economies; however, SSFs have been historically under-attended in national and international policies. This work presents a standardization of catch-per-unit-of-effort data obtained from onboard observers for twenty commercial coastal species caught by the SSFs off the Galician coast from 2000 to 2016 using generalized linear mixed models. Operational, environmental, temporal and spatial data were included in the models as explanatory variables. The relative index of abundance for most species varied from year-to-year over the study period and between geographical areas (ICES 9.a and 8.c). Seasonal patterns, likely related to annual biological cycles, were found. Vessel size showed restricted significant effects in abundance estimates, and soak time of fishing operations revealed nonlinear responses of catch rates. Fishing at night or during daylight hours also have significant differences in catch rates that varied among species pointing to behavioural effects on catchability. Catch rates were often negatively related with depth as expected for species with a coastal distribution. Furthermore, seafloor type indicated species-specific habitat preferences, and sea surface temperature played a limited role in abundance estimations. The most common trend of species' abundance indices showed opposite patterns among geographical areas, suggesting that local conditions may have a significant influence on fluctuations not only at the species level, but also at the community level. This study revealed a generalized lack of correlation between landings and abundance indices, thus landing data was considered, in general, a poor indicator of population status. The data presented increase the fishery knowledge of one of the most important European SSF fleets that ultimately would allow implementing future assessment strategies. It also underpins the fact that fine scale spatial, and temporal observer data, together with environmental and operational information, are critical to infer suitable and unbiased abundance indices within a complex SSF context.

AB  - The postrift stage in the pericratonic Kachchh Rift Basin of western India is represented by a thick sequence of a diachronous megadelta system. The deposition of this deltaic sequence was initiated during the midKimmeridgian and ended in the Albian. The sedimentation was interrupted by two transgressive events demarcating three subcycles within the megadelta system. The present study addresses the older midKimmeridgian to Tithonian "Jhuran Delta". An attempt is made here to delineate the nature of the Jhuran Delta using the ichnological and sedimentological parameters. The Jhuran Delta, which consists of 14 lithofacies, is grouped into seven lithofacies associations corresponding to the prodelta, subaqueous gravity flow, delta front, distributary channel, distributary mouth bar, and shoreface depositional environments along with a transgressive unit overlapping the lower delta of the megadelta system. Three distinct stages of deltaic evolution are delineated along with the fourth stage of transgression and delta destruction. The prodelta environment of Stage I is characterized by moderate ichnodiversity represented by nine recurring ichnotaxa, suggesting alternating brackish and fully saline water conditions, which indicate river-dominated deltaic sedimentation. Stage II shows a marked increase in the influence of river (fresh water) water, as indicated by a submarine mass failure that includes debris flow, chaotic and contorted structures, sediment gravity-failure and water-escape structures and suggesting a higher rate of sedimentation. Ichnologically, this phase indicates low ichnodiversity with sporadic occurrences of Ophiommpha and Palaeophycus. Stage III indicates the mixed dominance of river and wave processes. Sediments deposited in the delta front environment show moderate ichnodiversity with nine ichnotaxa. The distributary mouth bar environment comprises 6 recurring ichnotaxa including the ichnoassemblages of both river and marine wave environments. Integrated ichnological data suggest deposition in a mixed environment. The Jhuran Delta stage ended with a marine transgressive event and reworking of the deltaic sands, which were overlain by a thick shoreface deposit. Thus, the Upper Jurassic Jhuran Delta represents a river-dominated, wave-influenced delta.

AB  - The loss of wetland habitats and their often-unique biological communities is a major environmental concern. We examined vegetation data obtained from 380 wetlands sampled in a statistical survey of wetlands in the USA. Our goal was to identify which surrounding land cover types best predict two indices of vegetation quality in wetlands at the regional scale. We considered palustrine wetlands in four regions (Coastal Plains, North Central East, Interior Plains, and West) in which the dominant vegetation was emergent, forested, or scrub-shrub. For each wetland, we calculated weighted proportions of eight land cover types surrounding the area in which vegetation was assessed, in four zones radiating from the edge of the assessment area to 2 km. Using Akaike's Information Criterion, we determined the best 1-, 2-and 3-predictor models of the two indices, using the weighted proportions of the land cover types as potential predictors. Mean values of the two indices were generally higher in the North Central East and Coastal Plains than the other regions for forested and emergent wetlands. In nearly all cases, the best predictors of the indices were not the dominant surrounding land cover types. Overall, proportions of forest (positive effect) and agriculture (negative effect) surrounding the assessment area were the best predictors of the two indices. One or both of these variables were included as predictors in 65 of the 72 models supported by the data. Wetlands surrounding the assessment area had a positive effect on the indices, and ranked third (33%) among the predictors included in supported models. Development had a negative effect on the indices and was included in only 28% of supported models. These results can be used to develop regional management plans for wetlands, such as creating forest buffers around wetlands, or to conserve zones between wetlands to increase habitat connectivity.

AB  - AimTo assess vegetation changes in montane fens and wet meadows and their causes over 38years.
   LocationWetlands, Jura Mountains (Switzerland and France).
   MethodsPlots were inventoried in 1974 and re-located in 2012 (quasi-permanent plots) on the basis of sketches to assess changes in plant communities. The 110 plots belonged to five phytosociological alliances, two in oligotrophic fens (Caricion davallianae, Caricion fuscae) and three in wet meadows (Calthion, Molinion, Filipendulion). Changes between surveys were assessed with NMDS, and changes in species richness, Simpson diversity, species cover and frequency and the causes of these changes were evaluated by comparing ecological indicator values.
   ResultsChanges in species composition varied between alliances, with a general trend towards more nutrient-rich flora with less light at ground level. Species diversity declined, with a marked decreasing trend for the typical species of each alliance. These species were partly replaced by species belonging to nitrophilous and mesophilous grasslands. However, no trend towards drier conditions was detected in these wetlands. The largest changes, with an important colonization by nitrophilous species, occurred in the Swiss sites, where grazing was banned 25years ago. As a result of floral shifts, many plots previously belonging to fens or wet mesotrophic meadows shifted to an alliance of the wet meadows, generally Filipendulion. Moreover, communities showed a slight trend towards more thermophilous flora.
   ConclusionsThe investigated wetlands in the Jura Mountains have suffered mainly from eutrophication due to land-use abandonment and N deposition, with a loss of typical species. Areas with constant land use (grazing or mowing) showed less marked changes in species composition. The most important action to conserve these wetlands is to maintain or reintroduce the traditional practices of extensive mowing and livestock grazing in the wetlands, especially in areas where they were abandoned 25years ago. This previous land-use change was intended to improve fen conservation, but it was obviously the wrong measure for conservation purposes.

AB  - How climate change will affect the community dynamics and functionality of lake ecosystems during winter is still little understood. This is also true for phytoplankton in seasonally ice-covered temperate lakes which are particularly vulnerable to the presence or absence of ice. We examined changes in pelagic phytoplankton winter community structure in a north temperate lake (Muggelsee, Germany), covering 18 winters between 1995 and 2013. We tested how phytoplankton taxa composition varied along a winter-severity gradient and to what extent winter severity shaped the functional trait composition of overwintering phytoplankton communities using multivariate statistical analyses and a functional trait-based approach. We hypothesized that overwintering phytoplankton communities are dominated by taxa with trait combinations corresponding to the prevailing winter water column conditions, using ice thickness measurements as a winter-severity indicator. Winter severity had little effect on univariate diversity indicators (taxon richness and evenness), but a strong relationship was found between the phytoplankton community structure and winter severity when taxon trait identity was taken into account. Species responses to winter severity were mediated by the key functional traits: motility, nutritional mode, and the ability to form resting stages. Accordingly, one or the other of two functional groups dominated the phytoplankton biomass during mild winters (i.e., thin or no ice cover; phototrophic taxa) or severe winters (i.e., thick ice cover; exclusively motile taxa). Based on predicted milder winters for temperate regions and a reduction in ice-cover durations, phytoplankton communities during winter can be expected to comprise taxa that have a relative advantage when the water column is well mixed (i.e., need not be motile) and light is less limiting (i.e., need not be mixotrophic). A potential implication of this result is that winter severity promotes different communities at the vernal equinox, which may have different nutritional quality for the next trophic level and ecosystem-scale effects.

AB  - Fumonisins are secondary, carcinogenic metabolites produced primarily by Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium proliferatum on maize worldwide. The natural occurrence of fumonisin-producing Fusarium spp. and fumonisin contamination of maize grain were quantified in selected maize cultivars from principal production areas of South Africa. Grain colonization by Fusarium spp. was determined using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and contamination with fumonisins using HPLC analysis. Kernels from the 2007 samples were also plated onto Fusarium selective medium and subsequently, split plates containing PDA & CLA. The number of fumonisin producing Fusarium spp. were quantified and microscopically identified after 14 days. Simple linear regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between target DNA, fumonisins and the number of fumonisin producing Fusarium spp. using the plating out method. Results indicated high natural infection by fumonisin-producing Fusarium spp. and fumonisin concentrations in warmer production areas such as Northern Cape, North West and Free State Provinces. Spearman Ranking Correlations indicated that the responses of cultivars to colonization of grain by fumonisin producing Fusarium spp. varied over localities/seasons (r(s) = 0.42 to 0.64) suggesting that cultivars reacted differently to different environmental/inoculum conditions (disease potentials). Cultivars CRN3505 and DKC80-12B showed a degree of resistance to fungal infection. As with fungal colonization, Spearman Rank Correlations indicated the response of cultivars to fumonisin contamination to vary over localities/seasons (r(s) = 0.29 to 0.70). Cultivars DKC80-12B and LS8521B showed a degree of resistance to fumonisin contamination. Regression analysis yielded a significant relationship between HPLC data and qPCR, but not with the plating out of grain data suggesting the former to be a better indicator of potential fumonisin contamination. Site-specific, daily maximum temperature and rainfall data were provided by the ARC-Institute for Soil Water and Climate's meteorology office. No significant relationship between these weather parameters and colonization of grain by fumonisin producing Fusarium spp. was recorded, although a tendency was observed between fumonisin contamination and mean maximum temperature.

AB  - We present a new indicator taxa approach to the prediction of climate change effects on biodiversity at the national level in Switzerland. As indicators, we select a set of the most widely distributed species that account for 95% of geographical variation in sampled species richness of birds, butterflies, and vascular plants. Species data come from a national program designed to monitor spatial and temporal trends in species richness. We examine some opportunities and limitations in using these data. We develop ecological niche models for the species as functions of both climate and land cover variables. We project these models to the future using climate predictions that correspond to two IPCC 3rd assessment scenarios for the development of 'greenhouse' gas emissions. We find that models that are calibrated with Swiss national monitoring data perform well in 10-fold cross-validation, but can fail to capture the hot-dry end of environmental gradients that constrain some species distributions. Models for indicator species in all three higher taxa predict that climate change will result in turnover in species composition even where there is little net change in predicted species richness. Indicator species from high elevations lose most areas of suitable climate even under the relatively mild B2 scenario. We project some areas to increase in the number of species for which climate conditions are suitable early in the current century, but these areas become less suitable for a majority of species by the end of the century. Selection of indicator species based on rank prevalence results in a set of models that predict observed species richness better than a similar set of species selected based on high rank of model AUC values. An indicator species approach based on selected species that are relatively common may facilitate the use of national monitoring data for predicting climate change effects on the distribution of biodiversity.

AB  - Palsa peats are unique northern ecosystems formed under an arctic climate and characterized by a high biodiversity and sensitive ecology. The stability of the palsas are seriously threatened by climate warming which will change the permafrost dynamic and induce a degradation of the mires.
   We used stable carbon isotope depth profiles in two palsa mires of Northern Sweden to track environmental change during the formation of the mires. Soils dominated by aerobic degradation can be expected to have a clear increase of carbon isotopes (delta C-13) with depth, due to preferential release of C-12 during aerobic mineralization. In soils with suppressed degradation due to anoxic conditions, stable carbon isotope depth profiles are either more or less uniform indicating no or very low degradation or depth profiles turn to lighter values due to an enrichment of recalcitrant organic substances during anaerobic mineralisation which are depleted in C-13.
   The isotope depth profile of the peat in the water saturated depressions (hollows) at the yet undisturbed mire Storflaket indicated very low to no degradation but increased rates of anaerobic degradation at the Stordalen site. The latter might be induced by degradation of the permafrost cores in the uplifted areas (hummocks) and subsequent breaking and submerging of the hummock peat into the hollows due to climate warming. Carbon isotope depth profiles of hummocks indicated a turn from aerobic mineralisation to anaerobic degradation at a peat depth between 4 and 25 cm. The age of these turning points was C-14 dated between 150 and 670 yr and could thus not be caused by anthropogenically induced climate change. We found the uplifting of the hummocks due to permafrost heave the most likely explanation for our findings. We thus concluded that differences in carbon isotope profiles of the hollows might point to the disturbance of the mires due to climate warming or due to differences in hydrology. The characteristic profiles of the hummocks are indicators for micro-geomorphic change during permafrost up heaving.

AB  - Reproductive strategy is the set of adaptations that promote the most efficient way that the species will survive under the particular conditions of a determined environment. Understanding these adaptations is important and can help pinpoint populations indicator of environmental changes. Spermatogenesis is a measurable biological process of these adaptations in spatial and temporal scales. We analyzed the morphology of the testes and oviducts of the lizard species that comprise the genus Tropidurus, taking into account the geographical distribution and sympatric relations. For the analysis and the testes were removed from the middle part of the oviducts from Tropidurus etheridge, T oreadicus, T itambere, T spinulosus and T Guarani species, collected in different places in the Mato Grosso state, Brazil. The reproductive period is synchronous for males and females and occurs in September, October and November. Reproductive males were characterized. In the testes are seminiferous tubules with germ cells at different stages of spermatogenesis, with a high epithelium, at present light, free spermatozoa in the lumen and reduction of interstitial tissue. For females, the reproduction peak occurs when the oviduct epithelium is high with secretions and basal nucleus. These months are characterized in the sampled areas over a period of heavy rain and high temperatures. The decline of reproductive period was observed in both sexes, between April and August. Low reproduction in males is characterized by ample light, absence of sperm, only germ cells in the early stages of spermatogenesis are observed (a few spermatogonia and spermatocytes) and interstitial tissue wide. In females, the period of reproductive decline is marked by the absence of unicellular glands in the oviduct epithelium, with higher affinity with the dye. This period corresponds to low rainfall periods and lower temperatures. We propose an analysis of zoological samples; this is a proposal to facilitate the work of many researchers through access to the species, especially rare species.

AB  - Experimental and field studies were carried out to quantify the hydrodynamic mobility under swells of a circalittoral epifauna species. The spatial distribution and structure of one population (NW Mediterranean) of the serpulid polychaete Ditrupa arietina was assessed before and after a moderate swell event in late winter 2006 with the two readings separated by a seven-week interval. The overall density in the bay did not change significantly. However, in certain locations, significant but heterogeneous changes occurred: at some stations. D. arietina disappeared, at others it appeared with high densities while at others, densities remained fairly constant, although in this third case, the population size structure was different. In addition, no trend was observed along a cross-shore gradient. Experimental studies were conducted to determine bed friction velocity thresholds for incipient motion, bed load transport and suspension transport for different sizes of D. arietina. The minimum friction velocity required to transport D. arietina as bed load over a smooth rigid bed ranged from 1.5 to 2.5 cm s(-1) for tube lengths ranging from 6 to 25 mm. Thus, calcified worms (more than 6 mm long) cannot be destabilized by ordinary currents. Conversely, during the moderate swell event, the maximum bed friction was large enough to mobilize D. arietina, making probably all sizes available for bed load transport, while only worms with a tube length of less than 12 mm were transported in suspension at 27 m water depth. Wave statistics in Banyuls Bay indicate that D. arietina transport under moderate swell events should not be a rare phenomenon (28 days per year at 20 m water depth). Thus, the spatial scale for population dynamics studies should account for the extent of D. arietina spatial redistribution by the hydrodynamics. It is also recommended D. arietina be discarded from biotic quality index computations as this species is sensitive to natural hydrodynamic conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite the availability of numerous 'sustainability indicators' ( as defined by researchers and resource-management agency staff), many farmers do not routinely use these indicators for monitoring and measurement of their everyday farm management. Farmers' past experiences with such indicators have often been through their use by researchers ( trying to evaluate effects of management or quantify resource condition changes) or other external bodies ( usually regulatory agencies endeavouring to regulate environmental impacts). Such experiences have added little or nothing to on-farm management. Rather, farmers often rely on a diverse range of personally relevant indicators to assess the performance of their farm business. Such indicators may not be recognised by others as indicative of sustainability.
   The process used in environmental management systems ( EMS) implementation is predicated on the need for information to flow back to the manager to assist their management choices. In this way, the indicators of most use are those that the manager can determine and utilise. This paper describes the connection between environmental management systems, monitoring and indicators, and the importance of these linkages to the efficient and sustainable management of natural resources. It discusses a collaborative project between in New South Wales and Queensland grain farmers, and NSW Agriculture, to develop generic EMS guidelines based on the international standard for EMS, ISO 14001. While there are numerous recommended sustainability indicators, research with these farmers has found that it is more critical to determine which issues are of importance to the farmers and identify potential indicators they will utilise, rather than to recommend a prescribed suite of indicators. In some cases, these indicators may be of a larger-scale than just their property.
   Different users of resource-management information will require different indicators. The use of the EMS process provides structure and guidance in determining which of the plethora of indicators might be applicable, while allowing farmers to maximise benefits in the market place or the community. Resource-management agencies and customers may require a different suite of indicators. The use of EMS assists in streamlining all these demands, while keeping the focus on the management approaches required to achieve the greatest benefit for the manager.

AB  - An effective approach to increase forest health is to identify and validate a suite of indicators for monitoring forest conditions. We sought indicators of impacts due to deer browsing, prescribed burn, visitor use, and trails on understory plants beside trails in an oak-pine savanna in Finery Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada. Six commonly used ecological indicators were studied in 216 I-m x I-m quadrats located 0, 3, and 15 m from nine trails: plant species richness, stem density, species cover, proportion of native species, median height of selected tree seedlings, and proportion of foliar damage (insect herbivory) on leaves of neighboring trees. Three levels of visiter use, two of deer densities, and two of prescribed burns were used in analysis. Plant stem density and cover per quadrat were sensitive to the effects of deer density, prescribed burn, and visitor use. The proportion of native species per quadrat was affected by prescribed burn, distance from trail edge, and visitor use. The number of nonnative species increased along trail edges, but numbers of native species were similar throughout. Plant species richness, median seedling height, and proportion of foliar herbivory per quadrat were only sensitive to deer density. Higher deer densities led to significant declines in species richness, stem density, cover, and median seedling height. Prescribed burns proved to be beneficial to the forest, with stem density and cover increasing in burned areas, although the proportion of exotic species also increased in burned areas. Surprisingly, high visitor use had a moderately positive impact on the forest, with density and cover increasing on trails with high visitor use, and proportion of native species highest on trails with moderate visitor use. Of the indicators studied in the park, stem density, cover, and the proportion of native species responded strongly to browsing, fire, visitor use, and trail impacts. Similar studies at other parks would help managers to focus long-term monitoring efforts on the most sensitive site-specific indicators.

AB  - Forest ecosystems in the watersheds of the Yangtze river regulate water flow in the rivers. The value of water flow regulation by ecosystems is usually not realized in situ but may transfer spatially through rivers to another spot out of watersheds where conditions are suitable to realize it. To take into account the transfer of value of biological resources spatially, we developed a process-based simulation model to estimate the capacity of water flow regulation by terrestrial ecosystems, taking into account such major processes as canopy interception, litter absorption, and soil/ground water conservation. In this study we combined models and a GIS-embodied spatial database to assess the capacity and benefits of water flow regulation by ecosystems in Xingshan County, Hubei Province, China. The capacity of water flow regulation differs substantially among the 90 types of vegetation-soil-slope complexes in the watersheds. The simulation model estimates that in a wet season the watershed can retain similar to 868.07 X 10(6) m(3) water, which may result in a decrease of water flow by similar to 111.63 m(3)/s in the Yangtze River. The model also estimates that in a dry season the watershed can discharge similar to 80.74 X 10(6) m(3) water, resulting in an increase of water flow by similar to 10.38 m(3)/s. As the result of water flow regulation, the Gezhouba hydroelectric power plant increases its electricity production by up to 40.37 X 10(6) kWh in a year and generates an additional economic value of similar to 5.05 x 10(6) RMB/yr (1 US$ = 8.3 RMB, Chinese currency). This value is 0.42 times the annual income from forestry in the county in 1994 and may reach 2.2 times the annual income from forestry when Three Gorges Hydroelectric Power Plant runs. We also proposed a model of economic compensation for the region.

AB  - The invert sugar content of sugar beets is an important indicator of their quality owing to the fact that its acidic degradation products (lactic, acetic, formic, and other organic acids), formed during juice purification, reduce the natural alkalinity reserves of the beets. This has adverse consequences for sugar manufacture, which makes it highly desirable to be able to predict the alkalinity of technical juices. To this end, two independent proposals have recently appeared in the literature, which include, besides other characteristics, the invert sugar content of the beets as a variable in the estimate of their alkalinity reserves. However, the inclusion of invert sugar in the quality assessment of sugar beets presupposes the existence of a serial analytical method which meets the practical requirements of automated beet laboratories.
   The fluorimetric determination of reducing sugars in beets (or in beet brei degirates clarified with aluminium sulfate) with benzamidine, according to Kai et al. (1985), constitutes a method which, besides satisfying other conditions, is sufficiently simple and cost-effective to be introduced as a serial method into routine beet analysis. The method is selective and sensitive enough to register reducing carbohydrates, which in sugar beets are represented almost exclusively by glucose and fructose in an average ratio of 1:0.4 (described as ''invert sugar)'' Interference in the fluorescence reaction by unidentified constituents of the beet matrix can be overcome by the addition of EDTA.
   In principle, fluorescence measurements can be carried out with the fluorimeters developed for beet laboratories. These must be constructed as two-beam devices and also be equipped with a reaction chamber (oven unit) and a flow cuvette maintained at reaction temperature (90-degrees-C).
   Comparison with the Berlin Institute method (ICUMSA standard) shows that the benzamidine method registers reducing sugars in sugar beets with comparable accurarcy and reproducibility. With that, the most important preconditions for the incorporation and routine application of this fluorimetric analytical method in the various automated beet laboratory systems are satisfied.

AB  - This study presents a Lagrangian description of advection dominated field-scale transport of inert solutes, namely, the statistics of advective solute travel time and trajectory, in nonstationary random groundwater flow fields. The vertical flow field is generated by the effects of changes in total stress applied in fluid-saturated heterogeneous deformable porous media. The Lagrangian statistics are developed directly from the velocity statistics based on the application of stochastic methodology such as the representation theorem and Fourier-Stieltjes integral representation. The focus of our numerical evaluation is placed on the influence of the soil compressibility on the Lagrangian statistics. The prediction on the statistics of solute travel time and trajectory may serve as the basic input to the environmental risk assessment.

A semiconductor sensor based on indium antimonide (InSb) and classical ion-selective electrodes were used to analyze soil extracts. Comparative results of determinations of pH, HCO3 (-) Cl-, and SO4 (2-) in soil samples with a semiconductor InSb-electrode and with glass, chloride-selective, and copper-selective electrodes are presented. The use of a single semiconductor sensor for the determination of four components in a soil extract allowed us to reduce the duration of analysis and to unify the determination. Based on the results obtained, the salt composition of soils from the studied field was estimated.

AB  - New Zealand is a food producer and exporter that combines neoliberal policy with performance-based environmental management, using soft' governance and actions where possible. Voluntary environmental farm awards are analysed to identify the landscape management activities recognised as best practice by peers at a farm level. Results highlight the importance of whole farm system management. However, the efficacy of reliance upon voluntary mechanisms is coming under increasingly critical scrutiny, as environmental conditions in intensive agricultural landscapes continue to decline. The research question this poses is whether whole farm plans can be practically and formally connected in three concurrent ways - to supply chain management, and to statutory planning frameworks and environmental regulations and to local landscape co-management - while still maintaining flexibility of action for the farmer.

AB  - Such a diverse and sensitive eco-region as Karst needs to be managed with special attention and consideration of its natural and cultural resources. Land cover is an important indicator, which enables the analysis of their condition and development monitoring. Advanced satellite images classification represents an accurate and cost-effective alternative to the classical techniques of land cover mapping. The methods used to produce a reliable land cover map are presented in this paper. The complexity of the area requires a combination of various data such as Landsat satellite images, digital elevation model, digital orthophotos as well as existing topographic and thematic maps. The maximum likelihood algorithm was used as the main classifier and the accuracy of results was further improved by fuzzy classification, altitude and inclination filtering and auxiliary data integration.

AB  - In this paper we analyze the effects of certain sociocultural and environmental factors (migration, insufficiency of resources, social conflict) on the health, morbidity, growth, and adaptation of a human population from Northern Spain.  Our study was centered on a 9th-century medieval population in the Basque Country, Los Castros de Lastra (henceforth ''Los Castros'').  The area in which this population settled suffered intense social conflict during the Muslim occupation of the Iberian Peninsula.  The dental pathologies encountered, along with stress indicators (enamel hypoplasia, cribra orbitalia, growth of the long bones) show frequencies in Los Castros different from those of other populations.  This skeletal evidence can be directly related to environmental factors.  Particularly important among such conditions are scarcity of resources in a desolate land, the fact that the population had been recently settled, and the persistent sociopolitical conflict.

AB  - The exploitation of peatlands in Estonia, which began in the 17th century, has degraded them to a great extent. Consequently, cutover and drained peatlands have become the sources of CO2. Global warming has led to a need for policies focusing on the protection and restoration of drained and degraded peatlands. Hence, to compare the effect/progress of restoration with the past pristine ecosystem baseline before the peatland was destroyed by cutting, we examined a peat core from North Estonia using chronology based on 14C by analyzing several proxies in high resolution including testate amoebae, plant macrofossils, pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, and diatoms. The results revealed a striking ecological contrast between the pristine (ca. 2 kyrs) and restored state (currently) of the peatland. The pristine state was characterized by a domination of Sphagnum fuscum/rubellum and Archerella flavum, suggesting that extraction area of Hara peatland was a wet and stable ombrotrophic bog. As a result of peat exploitation, deposits comprising the last ca. 2 kyrs were cut. In turn an important feature of the restored section of the peat core was the domination of a green algae (Chlorophyta) and Eriophorum vaginatum as well as testate amoebae species Arcella discoides, which is considered an indicator of hydrological instability. The main difference between the predisturbed and restored parts of the peat core section was that a minor cover of peatforming Sphagnum and mixotrophic testate amoebae was present in the top inundated part. We state that a healthy raised bog-the target of restoration-should consist abundant mixotrophic testate amoebae such as Archerella flavum and Hyalosphenia papilio which are good indicators of a well-functioning Sphagnum bog ecosystem even if the Sphagnum species differ from the reconstructed ecological baseline conditions. Our study highlights the extensive damage caused to the peat-forming ombrotrophic peatland by extraction and how difficult, challenging, and time-consuming is the process of ecological restoration.

AB  - The aim of the manuscript was to present the collective results of research on the profitability of using various renewable sources in Poland with the greatest development potential. In the paper, the economic parameters of various investment projects were determined and calculated, i.e., Net Capital Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and the Period of Return on Invested Capital (PBT). The economic assessment of the use of RES technologies was supplemented with the assessment of environmental benefits. The ecological criterion adopted in the study was the assessment of the potential and costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions as a result of replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy technologies. On the basis of the constructed economic model to assess the profitability of investments, it has been shown that the analyzed projects will start to bring, depending on their type and technical specification, measurable economic benefits in the form of a reduction in the amount of energy purchased on an annual basis and environmental benefits in the form of reduction of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere. Moreover, the calculations show a high potential for the use of certain renewable sources in Poland, which contributes to the fulfillment of energy and emission obligations towards the EU. The analyzes and research of the Polish energy market with the use of the presented models have shown that the project is fully economically justified and will allow investors to make a rational decision on the appropriate selection of a specific renewable energy source for their investment. The presented economic models to assess the profitability of investments in renewable energy sources can be successfully used in other countries and can also be a starting point for a discussion about the direction of energy development. Due to the lack of collective, original and up-to-date research on the domestic market, the manuscript provides the reader with the necessary knowledge regarding the legitimacy of using renewable energy sources, investment and environmental profitability.

AB  - Determination of bacteriological diversity in marine ecosystems is of great importance in terms of understanding the functioning of the marine ecosystem, as well as being an indicator of alarm for pollution and sudden changes in marine environments. In this study, we aimed to investigate the composition and metabolic characteristics, relative to variable environmental parameters in the sediment sampling points, of cultivable heterotrophic bacteria taken seasonally from the coastal areas of Gokceada Island, Turkey between February and November of 2015. The counts of the total cultivable heterotrophic aerobic bacteria (HAB) were tested by using the spread plate technique with Marine agar. The living and dead bacteria counts (TB) were tested with an epifluorescent microscope by means of the DAPI-CTC staining method. The enzyme activation and metabolic responses of the bacterial isolates were screened against certain substrates by using the VITEK 2 Compact 30 automated micro-identification system. Variable environmental parameters were recorded in-situ in the seawater samples surrounding the sediment samples with multiparameter instrument. The spatial variability of trophic parameter values was tested by spectrophotometric methods. The mean HAB and TB counts of sediment samples were recorded as 35x10(9)+/- 0.5 and 79x10(10)+/- 0.9 CFU g(-1), respectively. During the study period, sixteen bacteria species belonging to six classes. Bacilli (6.0%), Gammaproteobacteria (71.1%), Betaproteobacteria (3.6%), Actinobacteria (1.2%), Cocci (1.2%), and Alphaproteobacteria (16.9 %) were recorded. Arylamidase was determined to be the highest enzyme activity. These results showed that nitrogen mineralization occurs at a high rate in the sediment samples of Gokceada Island. Temporal and spatial variations in total and heterotrophic bacteria levels between seasons were significant (p<0.05) in the study area. There were no significant station variations between TB and HAB levels (p>0.05). It was determined that trophic parameters related to primary environmental conditions affect bacterial composition, frequency, and metabolites in coastal areas. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The survival of aquatic biota in different life history stages depends on food availability, water quantity and specific hydrological conditions, and is particularly susceptible in degraded rivers due to the development of hydropower or are sensitive to climate change. Habitats with limited food availability and restricted feeding opportunities can strongly affect the habitat carrying capacity and fish growth with consequences for spawning. Few environmental flow regime frameworks are available that closely link bait and feeding opportunities to fish foraging habitat In addition, river restoration has been widely implemented to resolve the conflict between ecological demand and power generation benefits. Nevertheless, whether in-stream structures are still suitable for the joint operation of foraging and spawning habitats remains undear. In this study, a framework to integrate the requirements of both spawning and foraging habitats into environmental flow regime assessments was proposed by coupling the bait supply, fish spawning and fish feeding opportunities. Here, we used the Batang Reservoir, located in the Tibetan Plateau, as an example to determine the environmental flow regimes. The environmental flow regimes during Periods I, II and III for the conservation of the life history stages of Schizothorax dolichonem were determined, which provided high-quality food and was beneficial for increasing the probability of restoration success. After the implementation of measures, the ecological base flow rate decreased from 171.80 m(3)/s, 206.00 m(3)/s and 257.70 m(3)/s to 138.00 m(3)/s, 206.00 m(3)/s and 206.00 m(3)/s in Periods I, II and III, respectively. We concluded that traditional river restoration with the use of in-stream structures is still suitable for the joint operation of spawning and foraging habitats, but the design selection and placement of instream structures should be preoptimized. The framework proposed will help managers evaluate habitat conservation to protect degraded rivers or help develop strategies to build resilience to climate change. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, experiments were performed to assess the significance of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on the leachability of four common EDCs, i.e., bisphenol A (BPA), 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), progesterone (PGT) and testosterone (TST), in municipal sewage sludge (MSS) under landfill conditions. The DOM was derived from two sources: MSS (MDOM), and natural soil represented by organic matter obtained from the Suwannee River (NDOM). Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix quenching combined with parallel factor analysis was adopted to characterize the interaction properties between the EDCs and DOM. The accumulative leachability of the target EDCs ranged from 0.09% (PGT) to 3.8% (TST). In particular, the leaching of BPA, EE2 and TST followed S-shaped curves, while PGT exhibited continuous leaching potential in untreated MSS. With the introduction of DOM, (i) the leachability of BPA and EE2 increased to 13A% and 61.6%, respectively, whereas those of PGT and 1ST declined by 61.3% and 45.8%, respectively, and (ii) BPA, EE2 and PGT no longer reached leaching equilibrium but the S-shaped leaching property of TST persisted. The differential effects of MDOM and NDOM at identical concentrations on the EDCs leachability increased with curing time. BPA, EE2 and PGT quenched the MDOM fluorophores attributed to aromatic protein-like components. The fluorescence quenching of NDOM by BPA. EE2 and PGT was centered on soluble microbial by-product-like and humic-like substances. Compared with PGT, EE2 and BPA had greater capability for binding with DOM components largely via hydrophobic interactions, whereas PGT preferentially interacted with the DOM hydrophilic functionalities through specific interactions. TST had no binding capability but displayed potentials competing for sorption sites with DOM moieties. Our findings suggested that the management of MSS increased the risk of environmental contamination by EDCs for a long duration and that DOM was a useful indicator to predict the migration and transport properties of EDCs.

AB  - Dissolved Ni concentrations inhibiting the growth of juvenile great pond snails (Lymnaea stagnalis) have been documented to vary from about 1 to 200 mu g L-1Ni. This variability makesL. stagnaliseither a moderately sensitive or the most sensitive freshwater species to chronic Ni exposure tested to date. Given the role of sensitive species in environmental risk assessment frameworks, it is particularly important to understand this variability, i.e., to characterize the factors that modulate Ni toxicity and that may confound toxicity test outcomes when uncontrolled. In the present study, we tested if this variability was due to analytical (growth calculation: biomass versus growth rate), environmental (water quality), lab-specific practices, and/or snail population differences among earlier studies. Specifically, we reanalyzed previously published Ni toxicity data and conducted additional measurements of Ni aqueous speciation, short-term Ni uptake, and chronic Ni toxicity with test waters and snail cultures used in previous studies. Corrections for Ni bioavailability and growth calculations explained a large degree of variability in the published literature. However, a residual 16-fold difference remained puzzling between 2 studies: Niyogi et al. (2014) (low ECxs) and Cremazy et al. (2018) (high ECxs). Indeed, differences in metal bioavailability due to water chemistry, lab-specific practices, and snail population sensitivity could not explain the large variation in Ni toxicity in these 2 very similar studies. Other potentially important toxicity-modifying factors were not directly evaluated in the present work: test duration, diet, snail holding conditions, and snail age at onset of testing. The present analysis highlights the need for further studies to elucidate 1) the mechanisms of growth inhibition in Ni-exposedL. stagnalisand 2) the important abiotic and biotic factors affecting this biological response. Until these processes are understood, substantial uncertainties will remain about inclusion of this species in Ni environmental risk assessment.Integr Environ Assess Manag2020;00:1-15. (c) 2020 SETAC

AB  - Copepods are excellent bioindicators of climate change and ecosystem pollution in anthropized coastal waters. This work reviewed the results of previous studies examining changes in egg production rate (EPR), hatching success (HS), and nauplius survival rate (NSR) in natural conditions and in the presence of pollutants, including heavy metals and organic contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and persistent organic pollutants (POPs). At high concentrations, cadmium and silver induce an increase in EPR in the copepods Acartia tonsa and Acartia hudsonica, while exposure to mercury decreases EPR in adults by 50%. All three metals affect HS, with mercury inducing a stronger effect than cadmium and silver. Cadmium affects reproductive traits in Centropages ponticus, decreasing EPR and particularly HS. Furthermore, copper and chromium at high concentrations induce significant decreases in eggs per female in Notodiaptomus conifer. In terms of organic contaminant and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), Eurytemora affinis is reported to be affected by naphthalene, 2-methylnaphthalene, 2,6-dimethylnaphthalene, and 2,3,5-trimethylnaphthalene and can thus be used in ecotoxicity studies, but only if the exposure time is high. Acartia tonsa shows significant reductions in EPR and HS at high concentrations of fluoranthene, phenanthrene, and pyrene. However, the response to Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) such as pentachlorophenol (PCP) and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) differs. In E. affinis, EPR increases with DCB, but HS falls to <1%. EPR increases when the species is exposed overnight, but HS remains low in the presence of DCB. Based on these results, we developed a novel copepod reproductive trait index (CRT-Index) for use in marine ecotoxicology surveys and tested in some simple cases. We show that copepods are good candidates as models for ecotoxicology studies, in particular using reproductive traits (EPR, HS and NSR) because of their sensitivity to a wide range or pollutants.

AB  - As a result of their location at the boundary between marine and continental domains, marine caves are affected by wide spatial and seasonal environmental changes. Only recently have benthic foraminifera been recognized as reliable indicators for the ecological zonation of these environments. The present study is focused on two marine caves of the Orosei Gulf, Sardinia, Italy: Bue Marino and Bel Torrente. It investigates the spatial and seasonal variability of benthic foraminiferal assemblages relative to sediment grain size and water parameters (temperature, salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen) collected during two campaigns in August 2014 and April 2015. The results from 2014 have been partially published. Based on a comparison of the results of the two campaigns, the considerable reduction of foraminiferal abundance in Bel Torrente was deduced to occur because of the strong freshwater flows occurring during the rainy season; in Bue Marino, the less severe water flow allowed the identification of both living and dead foraminifera, although strongly reduced in number. These identifications allowed benthic foraminifera to be used to define the ecological zonation. Entrance, confluence, and transitional ecozones were identified in Bue Marino cave on the basis of species abundance. The second ecozone, not recognized in 2014, was correlated with plant debris at the confluence of the two cave branches. The other two ecozones, which are characterized by the faunal shift from hyaline- to agglutinated-prevalent assemblages, were attributed to the gradient of abiotic parameters detected from the outer to the inner portions of the cave. In both campaigns the same ecozones were recognized in terms of species composition, with exceptions being found to different extents as a result of seasonal variability. As the distribution of foraminiferal ecozones is conditioned by a decreasing gradient of marine influence, long-term monitoring may be regarded as a promising tool for future studies on sea-level change.

AB  - The nutritional status is one of the main factors determining health and preservation of the nation's gene pool. Experts consider 76% of people's deaths to be caused by noncommunicable diseases namely cardiac diseases (56,7%), different types of tumors (14,4%), lung diseases (3,7%) and diabetes (1,5%). Great part of the abovenamed diseases are associated with a deficiency or excess of certain components in the daily diet of a person. About half of the people deaths under the age of 70 linked to inadequate nutrition. One of the main prerequisites for the human health is its optimal diet, which should contain essential amino and fatty acids, vitamins and various trace elements. It is upon achievement of the optimal nutrition structure that high performance capabilities and primary prophylaxis of many diseases are ensured, immunoresistance is increased and organism defense against an impact of unfavorable environmental factors is strengthened. A solution to the problem of proper nutrition that corresponds to the requirements and possibilities of the human organism and is balanced by all indicators of nutritional and biological value is linked with the development and processing of big data and knowledge bases. They contain information that reflects the choice of individual (or personalized) diets and nutrition regimes with consideration for age factors, physiological status, medico-biological requirements, regional conditions, peculiarities in food consumption as well as for sources of disorders of the immune status. Difficulties in optimal decision-making solution is linked with many different factors. Firstly, with the probabilistic dispersion of characteristics and properties of biological raw material. Secondly, with individuality of the physiological peculiarities of the organism requiring in each case individual selection and correction of ration models taking into account structural relationships and restrictions at the component, elemental and monostructural levels. The paper shows the use of the information technologies realized by the methods of multi-criteria optimization and mathematical programming, which allow structuring the obtained set of alternatives, correct and/or construct an optimal diet.

AB  - Biogeochemical maps of coastal regions can be used to identify important influences and inputs that define nearshore environments and biota. Biogeochemical tracers can also track animal movement and their diet, monitor human coastal development, and evaluate the condition of habitats and species. However, the beneficial applications of spatial biogeochemical analysis are hindered by a limited understanding of how tracer distribution is affected by different land and ocean-based influences. To help address these knowledge gaps, we determined the spatial trends of three stable isotopes (delta C-13-carbon, delta N-15-nitrogen, delta S-34-sulfur) and 13 major and trace elements in an urbanized coastal embayment (Moreton Bay, Australia), as incorporated into the muscle tissue of a marine consumer, the eastern king prawn Melicertus plebejus. Results were used to identify unique biochemical regions within the bay and to discuss how spatial patterns in tracers could be used to indicate the relative importance of catchment, urban and offshore drivers in coastal bays. Discriminant analysis identified seven biogeochemical regions that were likely distinguished by variation in catchment, urban, and offshore input, and habitat type. delta C-13 and delta N-15 patterns suggested nearshore areas could be distinguished by increased sediment resuspension and higher wastewater inputs from catchments. High inshore lead (Pb) and copper (Cu) concentrations were likely the result of urban input. Arsenic (As) and cadmium (Cd) increased further from shore. This trend implied oceanic influences were a significant control over As and Cd bio-availability. Cobalt (Co) and rare earths were also used to differentiate some nearshore areas, but incongruent distribution patterns in Co suggested it may be less reliable. Overall, results indicated that delta N-15, delta C-13, Cd, Cu, Pb and rare earth elements were the most reliable tracers to differentiate nearshore and offshore environments, and catchment-based effects. We encourage future studies to consider using a similar multivariate approach in coastal spatial analysis, and to include unrelated tracers that reflect distinct coastal influences.

AB  - AimMacroecological scales of species compositional trends are well documented for a variety of plant and animal groups, but remain sparse for fungi, despite their ecological importance in carbon and nutrient cycling. It is, thus, essential to understand the composition of fungal assemblages across broad geographical scales and the underlying drivers. Our overall aim was to describe these patterns for fungi across two nutritional modes (saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal). Furthermore, we aimed to elucidate the temporal component of fruiting patterns and to relate these to soil carbon and nitrogen deposition.
   LocationCentral and Northern Europe.
   MethodsA total of 4.9million fungal fruit body observations throughout Europe, collected between 1970 and 2010, were analysed to determine the two main environmental and geographical gradients structuring fungal assemblages for two main nutritional modes, saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi.
   ResultsTwo main gradients explaining the geography of compositional patterns were identified, for each nutritional mode. Mean annual temperature (and related collinear, seasonal measures) correlated most strongly with the first gradient for both nutritional modes. Soil organic carbon was the highest correlate of the second compositional gradient for ectomycorrhizal fungi, suspected as an indicator of vegetation- and pH-related covariates. In contrast, nitrogen deposition constituted a second gradient for saprotrophic fungi, likely a proxy for anthropogenic pollution. Compositional gradients and environmental conditions correlated similarly when thedata were divided into two time intervals of 1970-1990 and 1991-2010. Evidence of compositional temporal change was highest with increasing elevation and latitude.
   Main conclusionsFungal assemblage patterns demonstrate clear biogeographical patterns that relate the nutritional modes to their main environmental correlates of temperature, soil organic carbon and nitrogen deposition. With respect to global change impacts, the highest rates of compositional change by time suggest targeting higher latitudes and elevations for a better understanding of fungal dynamics. We, finally, suggest further examination of the ranges and dispersal abilities of fungi to better assess responses to global change.

AB  - Understanding and quantification of phosphorus (P) fluxes are key requirements for predictions of future forest ecosystems changes as well as for transferring lessons learned from natural ecosystems to croplands and plantations. This review summarizes and evaluates the recent knowledge on mechanisms, magnitude, and relevance by which dissolved and colloidal inorganic and organic P forms can be translocated within or exported from forest ecosystems. Attention is paid to hydrological pathways of P losses at the soil profile and landscape scales, and the subsequent influence of P on aquatic ecosystems. New (unpublished) data from the German Priority Program 1685 Ecosystem Nutrition: Forest Strategies for limited Phosphorus Resources were added to provide up-to-date flux-based information. Nitrogen (N) additions increase the release of water-transportable P forms. Most P found in percolates and pore waters belongs to the so-called dissolved organic P (DOP) fractions, rich in orthophosphate-monoesters and also containing some orthophosphate-diesters. Total solution P concentrations range from ca. 1 to 400 mu g P L-1, with large variations among forest stands. Recent sophisticated analyses revealed that large portions of the DOP in forest stream water can comprise natural nanoparticles and fine colloids which under extreme conditions may account for 40-100% of the P losses. Their translocation within preferential flow passes may be rapid, mediated by storm events. The potential total P loss through leaching into subsoils and with streams was found to be less than 50 mg P m(-2) a(-1), suggesting effects on ecosystems at centennial to millennium scale. All current data are based on selected snapshots only. Quantitative measurements of P fluxes in temperate forest systems are nearly absent in the literature, probably due to main research focus on the C and N cycles. Therefore, we lack complete ecosystem-based assessments of dissolved and colloidal P fluxes within and from temperate forest systems.

AB  - The study contributes remote sensing data to the discussion about effects of post-fire wood management strategies on forest regeneration. Land surface temperature (LST) and Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI), estimated from Landsat-8 images are used as indicators of Pinus halepensis ecosystem recovery after 2008 fire in areas of three post-fire treatments: (1) salvage logging with wood extraction from the site on skidders in suspended position (SL); (2) snag shredding in situ leaving wood debris in place (SS) performed two years after the event; and (3) non-intervention control areas (CL) where all snags were left standing. Six years after the fire NDVI values similar to 0.5 estimated from satellite images and field radiometry indicate considerable vegetation recovery due to efficient regeneration traits developed by the dominant plant species. However, two years after management activities in part of the burnt area, the effect of SL and SS on ecosystem recovery is observed in terms of both LST and NDVI. Statistically significant differences are detected between the intervened areas (SL and SS) and control areas of nonintervention (CL); no difference is registered between zones of different intervention types (SL and SS). CL areas are on average 1 degrees C cooler and 10% greener than those corresponding to either SL or SS, because of the beneficial effects of burnt wood residuals, which favor forest recovery through (i) enhanced nutrient cycling in soils, (ii) avoidance of soil surface disturbance and mechanical damage of seedlings typical to the managed areas, and (iii) ameliorated microclimate. The results of the study show that in fire-resilient ecosystems, such as P. halepensis forests, NDVI is higher and LST is lower in areas with no management intervention, being an indication of more favorable conditions for vegetation regeneration.

AB  - Reversible cysteine modifications play important physiological roles such as modulating enzymatic catalysis, maintaining redox homeostasis and conducting cellular signaling. These roles can be critical in the context of disease. Oxidative modifications such as S-nitrosylation (SNO) are signatures of neurodestruction in conditions of oxidative stress however are also indicators of neuroprotection and normal signaling in cellular environments with low concentrations of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. SNO is a dynamic and low abundance modification and requires sensitive and selective analytical methods for its detection in biological tissues. Here we present an enhanced multiplexing strategy to study SNO in complex mixtures arising from tissues. This method, termed oxidized cysteine-selective cPILOT (OxcyscPILOT), allows simultaneous analysis of SNO-modified peptides in 12 samples. OxcyscPILOT has three primary steps: (1) blocking of free thiols by a cysteine-reactive reagent, (2) enrichment of peptides containing SNO on a solid phase resin, and (3) isotopic labeling and isobaric tagging of enriched peptides on the solid phase resin. This approach offers the advantage of allowing total protein abundance levels to be measured simultaneously with endogenous SNO levels and measurement of SNO levels across four biological replicates in a single analysis. Furthermore, the relative amount of SNO on a specific cysteine site can also be determined. A well-known model of Alzheimer's disease, the APP/PS-1 transgenic mouse model, was selected for demonstration of the method as several SNO-modified proteins have previously been reported in brain and synaptosomes from AD subjects. OxcyscPILOT analysis resulted in identification of 138 SNO-modified cysteines in brain homogenates that correspond to 135 proteins. Many of these SNO-modified proteins were only present in wild-type or AD mice, whereas 93 proteins had SNO signals in both WT and AD. Pathway analysis links SNO-modified proteins to various biological pathways especially metabolism and signal transduction, consistent with previous reports in the literature. The OxcyscPILOT strategy provides enhanced multiplexing capability to current redox proteomics methods to study oxidative modifications of cysteine.

AB  - Present climate warming strongly affects limnological and ecological properties of lakes and may cause regime shifts that alter structure and function in the water bodies. Such effects are especially pronounced in climatologically extreme areas, e.g. at high altitudes. We examined a sediment core from Lake Oberer Landschitzsee, Austrian Alps, which spans the period from the Little Ice Age (LIA) to present. We investigated whether post-LIA climate warming altered aquatic invertebrate communities and limnological status in this sensitive high Alpine lake. Fossil Cladocera (Crustacea) and Chironomidae (Diptera) and organic matter in the core were analyzed. Chironomids were used to assess the lake's benthic quality (i.e. oxygen availability). An instrumental Alpine temperature record was used to assess whether changes in the biotic assemblages correspond to post-LIA temperature trends. The planktonic and macro- and microbenthic invertebrate communities exhibit almost complete and simultaneous species turnover after the LIA, from about AD 1850 onward, when Sergentia coracina-type replaced oxyphilous Micropsectra contracta-type as the dominant macrobenthic taxon, and phytophilous Acroperus harpae outcompeted Alona affinis and Alona quadrangularis in the microbenthos. These directional community shifts corresponded with a period of reduced benthic quality, higher sediment organic content, and progressive climate warming, superimposed on Alpine land-use changes, until the early twentieth century. Detected changes suggest increased productivity and lower benthic oxygen availability. Faunal shifts were even more pronounced during the late twentieth century, simultaneous with enhanced warming. A new planktonic Cladocera species, Bosmina longirostris, typically absent from high Alpine lakes, colonized the lake and gradually became dominant toward the core top. Results show that post-LIA climate warming, coupled with increasing benthic and planktonic production, substantially altered the limnological and ecological status of this remote Alpine lake. Observed faunal turnovers provide evidence that temperature-driven ecological thresholds, whether associated directly or indirectly with greater human activity, have been crossed. Species abundances and distributions have changed in response to post-LIA and late twentieth century climate warming.

AB  - Despite the availability of many culture-based antibiotic screening methods, the lack of sensitive automated methods to identify functional molecules directly from microbial cells still limits the search for new biologically active compounds. The effectiveness of antibiotic detection is influenced by the solubility of the assayed compounds, indicator strain sensitivity, culture media and assay configuration. We describe a qualitative high throughput screening system for detecting cell-perturbing molecules from bacterial colonies employing two opposed agar layers sequentially formed in prototype Society for Biomolecular Screening (SBS) plates, named Janus plates. Direct assay of microbial colonies against target organisms in opposed agar layers overcomes some of the limitations of agar overlay methods. The system enables the rapid detection of extracellular cell-perturbing molecules, e.g., antibiotics, excreted directly from environmental isolates. The source bacterial colonies remain separate from the target organism. The growth layer is prepared and grown independently, so environmental strains can be grown for longer intervals, at temperatures and in media that favor their growth and metabolite expression, while the assay layer with pathogens, usually requiring nutrient-rich medium and elevated temperatures, are added later. Colonies to be tested can be precisely arrayed on the first agar surface, thus avoiding dispersion and disturbance of potential antibiotic-producing colonies by overlaying agar with the target strain. The rectangular SBS configuration facilitates factorial replication of dense microbial colony arrays for testing with multiple assays and assay conditions employing robotic colony pickers and pin tools. Opposed agar layers only slightly reduced the effectiveness for detecting growth inhibition from pure antibiotics compared to single-layer agar diffusion assays. The Janus plate enabled an automation-assisted workflow where a lone operator can effectively identify and accumulate bioactive soil bacterial strains within a few weeks. We also envisage the method's utility for functional prescreening colonies of clones from genomic and metagenomic libraries or improved strains originating from mutagenized cells.

AB  - The Himalaya in India is one of the world's biodiversity hotspots. Various scientific studies have reported and proven that many factors are responsible for the tremendous decline of the Himalayan forests. Extraction of wood biomass from the forests for fuel is one of the factors, as rural households rely entirely on this for their domestic energy. Efforts continue for both conservation and development of the Himalayan forests and landscape. It has been reported that people are still looking for more viable solutions that could help them to improve their lifestyle as well as facilitate ecosystem conservation and preservation of existing biodiversity. In this direction, we have documented the potential of the introduction of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), which is one of the solutions that have been offered to the local people as a substitute for woodfuel to help meet their domestic energy demand. The results of the current study found dramatic change in per capita woodfuel consumption in the last two decades in the villages where people are using LPG. The outcome showed that woodfuel consumption had been about 475 kg per capita per year in the region, but after introduction of LPG. this was reduced to 285 kg per capita per year in 1990-1995, and was further reduced to 46 kg per capita per year in 2000-2005. Besides improving the living conditions of the local people, this transformation has had great environmental consequences. Empirical evidence shows that this new paradigm shift is having positive external effects on the surrounding forests. Consequently, we have observed a high density of tree saplings and seedlings in adjacent forests, which serves as an assessment indicator of forest health. With the help of the current study, we propose that when thinking about a top-down approach to conservation, better solutions, which are often ignored, should be offered to local people.

AB  - Care giving behaviour was investigated in pigs as a form of maternal behaviour and its effects on the youngs. The objective of observation was to compare the identified phenomena in their biological, social and experience variables of the behaviour of the investigated animals. The observations included 40 sows and 280 youngs of the Landrace x Large White breed, of the female sex. They took place in semi-natural conditions while the standard criteria of management were maintained. Two categories of sows and their youngs were investigated. The first group included 20 sows (first-litter gilts) and their youngs: A (1 - 20). A study unit comprised one sow and seven youngs. The other category, B (1 - 20), had analogical numbers of individuals but the sows were after their third parturitions.
   As an indicator of maternal behaviour the average index of sociability (IS) had the value xBAR = 1.7 for the first category and the value xBAR = 2.0 for the second category. Evaluation of these differences enables to determine a significant difference between the average IS for both groups (Fig. 1). This fact, which spoke in favour of B (1 - 20) group, made us follow the different litters. That means we wanted to know how the maternal behaviour determined piglet sociogenesis. IS was calculated from the average valueS of IS determined in both categories within their adequate litters. The value xABAR (a - g) = 1.8 was determined for the first category (Tab. II) while for the second category B (1 - 20) the value xBBAR (a - g) made 2.0 (Tab. III).
   Evaluation of the t-test also revealed a statistically significant difference in favour of xBBAR (a - g) group (Fig. 2). A comparative analysis performed within the overall evaluation revealed a positive correlation in favour of the social adaptation of animals after the third parturition, in comparison with the individuals of the first group. These conclusions point to the risk of negative experiences in this stage of ontogeny, and also to general reproductive predictions.

AB  - Detailed palynological and organic geochemical analysis of middle Eocene marlstones from the Siju Formation, Garo Hills of Meghalaya, were undertaken. All marl samples contained abundant organic wall dinoflagellate cysts and a few number of spores-pollen grains, foraminiferal linings and calcareous foraminifera. The palynological assemblage consists of 21 genera and 35 species with fungal remains. The occurrence of palynofloral assemblage indicates the prevalence of tropical-subtropical with humid climatic conditions. The deposition environment of the Siju Formation has been interpreted as the neritic setting. Organic matter is thermally immature representing type III-type IV kerogen with low total organic carbon (<0.72%). The biomarkers suggest microbial degradation of both reworked and terrestrial organic matter. Occurrence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons indicate charred biomass transported from the land.

AB  - Considering the importance of technical accessibility parameters to the adequacy of urban areas for all people, this study aimed to develop a quantification method of pedestrian accessibility based on the technical standardization. The Accessibility of Walkable Spaces index (AWS) is composed of seven measurable indicators according to standards of accessibility, ranging from 0 (Inaccessibility) to 1 (Accessibility). After an audit of 570 sidewalk stretches in Sao Tome, State of Parana, Brazil, the Inaccessible situation was verified as the most recurrent (60.3% of the sidewalk stretches). The best conditions were found in the more consolidated urban central area, as demonstrated by the Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests (p < 0.05). The method showed adequate applicability. So, municipalities can use AWS index as a useful planning tool to prioritize interventions and provide inclusive and more sustainable environments to its citizens.

AB  - Geometric morphometrics is a tool capable of measuring the response of organisms to different environmental pressures. We tested the hypothesis that E. cordata wing morphometry, as an indicator of response to environmental pressure, it would vary depending on habitat changes, in the Atlantic Forest, Savanna and dry forest (Caatinga). For analysis of wing shape and size, 18 landmarks were digitized at the intersections of the wing veins 348 individuals. Except for the two populations sampled in Chapada Diamantina, the wing shape had significant statistical variations among the populations (p < 0.05). The wing size variation was also statistically significant among populations (p < 0.05). Although E. cordata is a species tolerant to different environments, the observed morphometric variability may be related to population adaptations to the conditions of each phytophysiognomy.

AB  - We investigated surface sediment assemblages of invertebrates from nine shallow lakes in southern Finland and assessed the relationship between invertebrate assemblages and fish status at local scale for the purpose of paleolimnological food-web studies. Invertebrate-based cluster analysis separated the fish-free lakes into their own group and the results also showed a strong and statistically significant relationship between fish status and faunal sedimentary assemblages. The present results from the local data set indicate good potential for developing quantitative invertebrate-based paleolimnological fish status models in the future. However, for the implementation of the models substantially more lakes with different fish status need to be examined that the effect of fish predation on invertebrate communities can be separated from other limnological forcing mechanisms.

AB  - The bryophytes collected in the years 1885, 1926-1935, 1972-1975 and 2006-2007 in Vertizarana Valley (Navarra, North Spain) have been studied, identifying or compiling 253 species. Fertility and Ellenberg's indicator values for light, temperature, substrate pH and nitrogen have been analysed. Results indicate that there have been small variations in Ellenberg's indicator values along the time span studied: the tendencies point at a decrease in light and increase in temperature and nitrogen, while substrate pH does not show a clear tendency. Regarding fertility, the overall number of species with sporophytes or sexual organs has decreased and several species seem to have lost fertility. All this suggests that changes in ecological conditions and air quality may have taken place in the Vertizarana Valley.

AB  - Condensation and evaporation of a low temperature nano-sized argon particle moving in a gas/vapor environment were analyzed using the molecular dynamics simulation. First evaporation temperature for various heating rates was found and successfully compared with the analytic result. Condensation and evaporation rates observed through simulation depended on particle velocity and thermodynamic properties of the gas, and the radial distribution of particle temperature was found to be a good indicator to characterize the process. Characteristics of condensation and evaporation for four different particle velocities and various environmental conditions were discussed in detail. In low gas density environments all the gas atoms got condensed on the particle, and in high gas density environment condensation/evaporation characteristics became much different depending on particle velocity.

AB  - In many ways Cuba and the USA state of Florida are similar; both comprise similar areas and sized populations, and until 45 years ago they were economically linked. Now, despite being physically close, in economic and political terms Cuba and Florida are worlds apart. Overall, while Florida has grown economically stronger over time, economic growth in Cuba has been far more constrained due to external pressures-most notably the economic blockade by the US and the collapse of the Soviet Block. This paper devises a range of indicators for both territories to explore how mobility, energy use and emissions might be influenced by socioeconomic conditions. Specifically, it compares and contrasts how transport policies have developed in an environment with virtually no economic constraints, and a situation where strong constraints were in place.

AB  - The main objective of the paper is the characterization of the aquatic ecosystems of the Danube Delta based on the temporal and spatial dynamics of the physico-chemical parameters. There were drawn momentary samples from the two stock compartments - water and sediment - from the sampling sites Murighiol and Uzlina in every month in drawing campaigns period (April - September 2003). The results of the analysis for the indicator and chemical parameters determined from Uzlina and Murighiol locations demonstrated the following aspects:
   - the oxygen regime is not conform with the favourable conditions for the aquatic life development;
   - high heavy metals (iron, manganese and copper) content in water and sediment;
   - exceeding concentrations of phenol compounds, mineral oil and Lindan, over the critical limits will have a potential negative impact upon aquatic organisms.

AB  - Current soils can have attributes inherited from land management systems in the past or previous environmental conditions. An important archaeological question is the extent to which the record of old agricultural practices can be retained in soils. This paper reports the results from examining soil thin sections collected from a range of old cultivated sites in the upper Bowmont valley, south east Scotland. The cultivated horizon was sampled from rigs and cultivation terraces dating from prehistoric to late medieval times. The main finding from microscopic analysis was the considerable impact of bioturbation as expressed in excremental pedofeatures. Results from point counting of these pedofeatures from 10 slides collected from an experimental site at Sourhope provided quantitative evidence on the extent to which bioturbation had occurred over the last 200 years. The rapidity by which micromorphological indicators of previous cultivation can be lost is thus demonstrated.

AB  - Objective. The article presents the results of the empirical study of the impact of the Internet using experience on the process of the Internet texts understanding.
   Materials & Methods. Different theoretical methods and techniques were used for this purpose: deductive and inductive methods, analysis and synthesis, generalization, systematization. Empirical methods were used for this purpose: experiment (semantic and receptive), method of semantic and pragmatic interpretations, content analysis, subjective scaling procedure. Mathematical methods were used: primary statistics, checks on the normal nature of the data distribution, statistical output, taking into account statistical indicators of fashion and the scope of variation. As well as some interpretive methods that are based on specific principles of systemic, activity, cognitive and organizational approaches.
   Results. The author notes that Internet texts understanding is significantly different from the understanding of oral or written texts, since the Internet text is a pragmatically integral electronic document that constructing of conditionally completed text blocks in the form of "windows", that are opened in separate tabs of the browser, the order that depends on hyperlinks and user behavior. The peculiarities of the Internet texts include enhanced dialogue, divisibility, external informativity, reduced connectivity and comprehension, pragmatic and mostly formal integrity, conditional completeness, complicated structural, as well as hybrid and high degree of permeability, multimedia, presentation, inclination to speech game and collective authorship, saturation with neologisms, emoticons and abbreviations, fragmentation, non-compliance with linguistic norms, and the functioning of a special language etiquette.
   Conclusions. As a result of empirical research involving 716 respondents from different regions of Ukraine, it was determined that experience has the most significant effect on the understanding process at the reception stage, guiding users' activity and the accuracy of their expectations. Experience contributes to the accuracy of predicting the content of Internet texts by 15,0%. At the stage of interpretation, the adequacy and completeness of Internet texts interpretation with the accumulation of experience is improved by almost 10,0%. However, even experienced users were able to correctly interpret only a quarter of the dominant, while random - only a sixth part. Even less important is the experience and Internet activity at the stage of emotional identification, nor the assessment of comprehension, nor the coherence of emotional attitude is almost independent of the Internet using experience. With the accumulation of experience, users evaluate Internet texts more homogeneously, they are easier to realize their own attitude to the Internet texts, it becomes more consistent, however, they underestimate the complexity of Internet texts more than half of the cases, they are also inclined to share texts on the approval and critical like inexperienced readers.

AB  - The Dranic plantation is one of the youngest in Dolj county and was founded in 2010 through the process of reconversion and restructuring of the wine sector in our country. Under the favorable ecologically conditions for viticulture in the Oltenia area, the varieties for red wines besides the superior potential of glucidic accumulation, have a remarkable ability for biosynthesis of anthocyanins. The chromatic structures of the anthocyanin extracts represented by the yellow, red and blue pigments are balanced, attractive and fully in line with current requirements. They are dimensioned by colour intensity values, but especially by the qualitative chromatic indicators: the colour tone and the proportions of the flavylium cations. This study may be the start for the suitability of this area for obtaining high-quality red wines.

AB  - Angico is a species found in several environments in Brazil, with several applications. It is used in the timber industry and mainly in folk medicine. In order to verify a variation in the biometric characteristics and the quality of seeds from different mother-plants in different harvesting years, the following variables were studied: moisture content, diameter, density, electrical conductivity, fresh and dry matter of seedlings, germination percentage and kinetics, in a completely randomized design with a 2x3 factorial arrangement (lots x size). The obtained results showed that angico seeds from different lots showed different physiological quality, possibly due to the climate variations to which mother-plants were submitted in the different years. Seed size directly interferes with seedling growth under both controlled and greenhouse conditions, and it can be used as a vigor indicator for angico seeds.

The population density and abundance of a number of background species was ascertained to decrease from the subalpine belt towards the forest and alpine belt. The bird population density in all the considered aquatic and semiaquatic habitats was revealed to change in a rather narrow range of values: the maximal population density indicator in aquatic and semiaquatic habitats is only 1.9 times higher than the minimal indicator. In the mountainous Subarctic region with a radial macrosymmetry, the spatial dynamics of abundance has a concentrically centrifugal nature in many aquatic and semiaquatic bird species.

AB  - Ammolagena clavata (Jones et Parker) - a cosmopolitan agglutinated foraminifera - is present as an accessory taxon in assemblages of the Outer Carpathians. This species has been found in deep water settings, exclusively in rich and diversified assemblages, among taxa representing various strategies of life from epifauna to deep infauna. Ammolagena clavata is one of the most common of attached forms in flysch foraminiferal assemblages and inhabits as a substrate other agglutinated foraminiferal tests. In the Outer Carpathian basins this species was more abundant in middle Eocene successions above the carbonate compensation depth (CCD), dominated by mudstones deposited under reduced clastic supply conditions. Ammolagena clavata can be regarded as an indicator of an environment with a low supply of clastic material.

Eight dyads of mothers in adolescence and their firstborns were interviewed when their children were less than five months old; three and a half years old and ten years old. The instruments used in their daily environment were free speech interviews and observation submitted to scales for screening the competence and psychological conditions of the children. The results are presented in thematic axis, indicating valorization of maternity, distance from violent scenarios and instability in residence associated to school/professional damages and, children who do not present developmental problems. Maternity in adolescence may represent protection for the mothers concerning environmental risks associated to violence and drugs.

AB  - Based on a photoelectron transfer (PET) mechanism, vicinal diaminobenzoacridine (VDABA), a fluorescent probe for the determination of trace amounts of nitric oxide radical in biological sample, was synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, IR, H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR spectrum. Combining a flow injection with spectrofluorimetry, a high-throughput method for detecting NO was obtained, which was successfully applied to the determination of NO in the human serum. The proposed method was simple, rapid, precise and automatic. Under optimum conditions, the linear calibration range was from 1.1 x 10(-7) to 5.0 x 10(-6) M and the detection limit was 3.1 x 10(-8) M. Furthermore, the probe could make cell-derived NO "visible" by using confocal laser scanning microscope. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The carbon isotopic compositions of six stalagmites from five caves in the Ozark Highlands of central and southern Missouri and northern Arkansas provide a detailed record of early and late Holocene vegetation dynamics. A rapid decrease in speleothem partial derivative(13)C values between similar to 9500 and similar to 8200 yr BP indicates a period of increased C3 vegetation, suggesting cool and/or moist conditions relative to the earliest Holocene and the prairie-dominated middle Holocene. A second negative partial derivative(13)C excursion from similar to 4500 to similar to 3000 yr BP interrupts a predominantly C4-rich middle Holocene prairie environment that became established at similar to 7500 yr BP. Speleothem mineralogical indicators of cave aridity do not support previous inferences of increased regional dryness between 3800 and 3100 yr BP. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA.

AB  - This article proposes a set of non-monetary indicators of material and social resources characterizing the childrearing environments of families in South African black urban townships. The selected indicators include adequacy of food, quality of housing, financial assets, consumer goods and social resources. The study reported in the article was carried out between 1990 and 1996. Through factor analyses two dimensions of social and economic status (SES) - consumption and social/financial capital - were identified. High, moderate and low SES groups were formed based on the families' combined score on the two factors. SES was significantly predictive of a family's ability to meet basic needs and in its experience of material hardship. The results of the study are reported.

AB  - The great diversity of terrestrial arthropods in the Arctic suggests that these organisms are especially useful to monitor environmental change there, where warming as a result of climatic change is expected to be especially pronounced and where current conditions are limiting for many organisms, Based on existing information about arctic faunas and how they differ from temperate ones, this paper suggests several elements. including ratios and other quantitative indexes, that can be used for long-term evaluations of change. These elements include composition indexes, range limits. marker species, interspecific ratios, relationship shifts, phenological and physiological indicators. and key sites. Using such elements in a planned way would exploit the diversity of arctic insects and emphasize their importance in arctic systems.

AB  - Drinking water treatment sludge (DWTS) is the main waste produced in drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs). Its valorisation as substrate for constructed wetlands (CWs) aimed at upgrading treated urban wastewater is presented. Keeping a holistic approach in mind, this study looks for nutrient and organic matter removal but also contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) and pathogens. Three pilot subsurface flow CWs (1 m2) were installed under outdoor conditions in real WWTPs. Different operation modes (sequential: S-CW and continuous saturated flow: C-CW, CC-CW), different nutrient influent concentrations (SCW and C-CW: 0.6 mg TP/l, 12.7 mg TN/l; CC-CW: 6.5 mg TP/l, 48 mg TN/l) and high hydraulic loading rates (HLRs, 0.9-5.1 m3/m2/d) were tested. C-CW presented higher removal efficiencies than S-CW for TP (C-CW: 56-86%; S-CW: 32-66%), total nitrogen (C-CW: 23-38%; S-CW: -3 to 6%) and E. coli (C-CW: 94%; S-CW: 84%), while S-CW performed better for ammonium (C-CW: 29-45%; S-CW: 72-86%) and CECs removal. Among fifteen CECs monitored, most pharmaceuticals, four were significantly reduced in C-CW and nine in S-CW, which had more aerobic conditions. CC-CW reduced nutrients and organic matter by 62% (TP), 8% (TN), 23% and 40% (chemical and biochemical oxygen demands, respectively). The potential release of aluminium was negligible. Novel values for the first-order reaction coefficient of P-k-C* model are provided for the TP removal process using DWTS (0.6-1.0 h-1). The main conclusion is that DWTS is a suitable substrate to significantly upgrade WWTP effluents, even at high HLRs. A hybrid system combining sequential and continuous flow modes could optimize the upgrading treatment. A proposal for the full valorisation of the sludge produced in one DWTP is presented.

AB  - Background Information concerning clinical presentation, conditions associated with immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA) and thrombocytopenia (IMTP) and outcome in equids is lacking. Previous case reports suggest that immune-mediated disease and neoplasia are associated.
   Objectives Characterise the clinical presentation, clinicopathologic data, underlying conditions, treatment and outcome of IMHA and IMTP cases in equids. We hypothesise that IMHA with concurrent thrombocytopenia occurs more often than IMHA or IMTP alone, and that neoplasia is commonly associated with these immune diseases and cases frequently have a poor prognosis.
   Study design Retrospective case-control study.
   Methods Medical records were reviewed from 1997 to 2016. Twenty-five equids were diagnosed with IMHA, IMTP or IMHA with thrombocytopenia by Coombs test or flow cytometry. Controls were equids presented for nonimmune-mediated disease immediately prior to and after study animals. Fisher's exact test was used to compare between groups for categorical variables (P < .05). Results reported as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Unpaired t test and Mann-Whitney test were used to compare between groups for continuous variables (P < .05).
   Results Neoplasia incidence was significantly higher in the study population (28%) versus controls (8%) (P = .04). Equids with primary disease were more likely to survive to discharge than equids with secondary disease (8/9 vs 7/16; P = .03; OR = 13.3; 95% CI: 1.3-134.7). Survivors had a significantly lower blood urea nitrogen (BUN) than those that died or were subjected to euthanasia (survivors, 6.1 +/- 2.5 mmol/L vs nonsurvivors, 9.9 +/- 3.1 mmol/L P = .003). The odds of short-term mortality were higher in horses presenting with increased BUN (OR = 19.5; 95% CI, 1.8-214.1; P = .009).
   Main limitations Retrospective nature of the study, small case numbers and limited long-term follow-up.
   Conclusions Primary IMHA/IMTP cases have a reasonable prognosis and warrant treatment. Secondary cases have a poor prognosis, and are frequently associated with cancer. BUN may have utility as a prognostic indicator for IMHA/IMTP cases.

AB  - In this study, local measurement and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) were employed to evaluate the thermal comfort in a residential environment where desiccant cooling is performed in an outdoor air condition, which is the typical summer weather in Korea. The desiccant cooling system in the present study has been developed for multi-room control with a hybrid air distribution, whereby mixing and displacement ventilation occur simultaneously. Due to this distribution of air flow, the thermal comfort was changed, and the thermal comfort indicators conflicted. The evaluation indicators included the ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers) comfort zone, predicted mean vote (PMV), and effective draft temperature (EDT). The dry-bulb temperature displayed a distribution of 26.2-26.8 degrees C in the cooling spaces, i.e., living room, kitchen, and dining room. When determined based on the standard ASHRAE comfort zone, the space where desiccant cooling takes place entered the comfort zone for summer. Due to the influence of solar radiation, the globe temperature was more than 2 degrees C higher than the dry-bulb temperature at the window. A difference of up to 6% in humidity was observed locally in the cooling space. In the dining room located along the outlet of the desiccant cooling device, the PMV entered the comfort zone, but was slightly above 1 in the rest of the space. Conversely, as for the EDT, its value was lower than -1.7 in the dining room, but was included in the comfort zone in the rest of the space. By adjusting the discharge angle upward, the PMV and EDT were expected to be more uniform in the cooling space. In particular, the optimum discharge angle obtained was 40 degrees upward from the discharge surface.

AB  - Winter is an understudied but key period for the socioecological systems of northeastern North American forests. A growing awareness of the importance of the winter season to forest ecosystems and surrounding communities has inspired several decades of research, both across the northern forest and at other mid- and high-latitude ecosystems around the globe. Despite these efforts, we lack a synthetic understanding of how winter climate change may impact hydrological and biogeochemical processes and the social and economic activities they support. Here, we take advantage of 100 years of meteorological observations across the northern forest region of the northeastern United States and eastern Canada to develop a suite of indicators that enable a cross-cutting understanding of (1) how winter temperatures and snow cover have been changing and (2) how these shifts may impact both ecosystems and surrounding human communities. We show that cold and snow covered conditions have generally decreased over the past 100 years. These trends suggest positive outcomes for tree health as related to reduced fine root mortality and nutrient loss associated with winter frost but negative outcomes as related to the northward advancement and proliferation of forest insect pests. In addition to effects on vegetation, reductions in cold temperatures and snow cover are likely to have negative impacts on the ecology of the northern forest through impacts on water, soils, and wildlife. The overall loss of coldness and snow cover may also have negative consequences for logging and forest products, vector-borne diseases, and human health, recreation, and tourism, and cultural practices, which together represent important social and economic dimensions for the northern forest region. These findings advance our understanding of how our changing winters may transform the socioecological system of a region that has been defined by the contrasting rhythm of the seasons. Our research also identifies a trajectory of change that informs our expectations for the future as the climate continues to warm.

AB  - In cow-calf operations the moment the heifer achieves her first pregnancy set up her future productivity. Although puberty itself is a yes-or-no condition, time to the event has a quantitative genetic basis and thus is suitable for genetic selection. However, the trait is difficult to measure directly and proxies such as age at first calving (AFC), or scrotal circumference (SC), are typically used. In genetic evaluations, the age at which SC is measured usually corresponds to last part of pubertal development phase. But given that initiation of puberty in both sexes is controlled by the same neuroendocrine mechanisms, we argue that an earlier measurement, taken instead at the start of the pubertal development phase, is probably a better indicator of female precocity. To support the hypothesis, we fitted a multiple-trait animal model on AFC records and SC measurements taken at 300, 400, and 630 days of age and estimated heritabilities and genetic correlations by REML. Importantly, usually AFC data is afflicted by the problem that when breeding season starts most heifers are already cycling (which is, of course, the desired condition) and thus the record poorly reflects precocity. To avoid the problem, in this study we used records collected from an Angus herd in which heifers receive an early natural first service at 375 days of age. Genetic correlation between AFC and SC300 was twice as large as the one corresponding to SC400 (-0.478 +/- 0.13 vs -0.244 +/- 0.11) and three times larger than to SC630 (-0.478 +/- 0.13 vs -0.152 +/- 0.12), a result that supports our hypothesis. Heritabilities for SC300, SC400 and SC630 were 0.429 +/- 0.07, 0.704 +/- 0.07 and 0.576 +/- 0.08, respectively, and 0.371 +/- 0.05 for AFC. Our results have an important implication in the age at which SC, as an indirect trait for improving precocity, is typically measured in beef cattle breeding programs. Indeed, they indicate that measurements should be taken earlier.

AB  - Real time, accurate and reliable estimation of maize yield is valuable to policy makers in decision making. The current study was planned for yield estimation of spring maize using remote sensing and crop modeling. In crop modeling, the CERES-Maize model was calibrated and evaluated with the field experiment data and after calibration and evaluation, this model was used to forecast maize yield. A Field survey of 64 farm was also conducted in Faisalabad to collect data on initial field conditions and crop management data. These data were used to forecast maize yield using crop model at farmers' field. While in remote sensing, peak season Landsat 8 images were classified for landcover classification using machine learning algorithm. After classification, time series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) of the surveyed 64 farms were calculated. Principle component analysis were run to correlate the indicators with maize yield. The selected LSTs and NDVIs were used to develop yield forecasting equations using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Calibrated and evaluated results of CERES-Maize showed the mean absolute % error (MAPE) of 0.35-6.71% for all recorded variables. In remote sensing all machine learning algorithms showed the accuracy greater the 90%, however support vector machine (SVM-radial basis) showed the higher accuracy of 97%, that was used for classification of maize area. The accuracy of area estimated through SVM-radial basis was 91%, when validated with crop reporting service. Yield forecasting results of crop model were precise with RMSE of 255 kg ha(-1), while remote sensing showed the RMSE of 397 kg ha(-1). Overall strength of relationship between estimated and actual grain yields were good with R-2 of 0.94 in both techniques. For regional yield forecasting remote sensing could be used due greater advantages of less input dataset and if focus is to assess specific stress, and interaction of plant genetics to soil and environmental conditions than crop model is very useful tool.

AB  - Urban environmental pollution results in contamination of the tissues of synanthropic organisms by toxic trace elements with potential impacts on human health. Passerine birds may serve as convenient indicators of such contamination. In this study we investigated the effect of blood and plumage contamination with heavy metals (lead Pb, cadmium Cd, copper Cu, chromium Cr) and arsenic metalloid (As) on condition, health and ornamental colour in free-living great tit (Parus major) males from 13 cities across the Czech Republic (EU), mist netted during the early breading season (April-May). Our results showed a significant association of heavy metal tissue contamination with immune function, namely leukocyte composition in the avian blood circulation. High heavy metal contamination in bird feathers was linked to a high heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio, indicating long-term stress in individuals inhabiting heavily polluted environments. In contrast, males with higher concentrations of heavy metals in blood had a lower H/L ratio, assumingly due to the direct toxicity of heavy metals in certain cell types. This is also supported by traits indicative of anaemia-like haemolytic conditions (decreased absolute erythrocyte count) and increased haematopoiesis (a tendency for increased frequencies of immature erythrocytes). We did not find any association of heavy metal contamination with the bacteriolytic activity of plasma complement, feather growth or ornamentation (black breast stripe area and yellow colouration). There was no significant relationship between heavy metal contamination in blood or feathers and PM10 pollution at the study sites. Our correlational study is the first to show on a large geographic scale that despite strict European air pollution regulations and regular monitoring that have allowed general improvements in atmospheric contamination, non-degradable heavy metals persistently contaminate animal blood and feathers in anthropogenic environments at levels thatmay have subclinical yet physiological effects with varied influence on health.

AB  - Encapsulation of pesticide active ingredients in polymers has been widely employed to control the release of poorly water-soluble active ingredients. Given the high dispersibility of these encapsulated pesticides in water, they are expected to behave differently compared to their active ingredients: however, our current understanding of the fate and effects of encapsulated pesticides is still limited. In this study, we employed a central composite design (CCD) to investigate how pH and ionic strength (IS) affect the hydrodynamic diameter (HDD) and zeta potential of encapsulated lambda-cyhalothrin and how those changes affect the exposure and toxicity to Daphnia magna. R-2 values greater than 0.82 and 0.84 for HDD and zeta potential, respectively, irrespective of incubation time suggest those changes could be predicted as a function of pH and IS. For HDD, the linear factor of pH and quadratic factor of pH x pH were found to be the most significant factors affecting the change of HDD at the beginning of incubation, whereas the effects of IS and IS x IS became significant as incubation time increased. For zeta potential, the linear factor of IS and quadratic factor of IS x IS were found to be the most dominant factors affecting the change of zeta potential of encapsulated lambda-cyhalothrin, irrespective of incubation time. The toxicity tests with D. magna under exposure conditions in which HDD or zeta potential of encapsulated lambda-cyhalothrin was maximized or minimized in the overlying water also clearly showed the worst-case exposure condition to D. magna was when the encapsulated lambda-cyhalothrin is either stable or small in the overlying water. Our results show that water quality could modify the fate and toxicity of encapsulated lambda-cyhalothrin in aquatic environments, suggesting understanding their aquatic interactions are critical in environmental risk assessment. Herein, we discuss the implications of our findings for risk assessment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effects of different transport times on broilers during summer on stress, meat quality, and early postmortem muscle metabolites. Arbor Acres broiler chickens (n = 105) were randomly categorized into 5 treatments: unstressed control, 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h transport. Each treatment consisted of 3 replicates with 7 birds each. All birds (except the control group) were transported according to a designed protocol. With the extension of transport time, the activities of plasma creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) gradually increased. The content of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) did not change significantly during 0.5 h transport compared to the control group, but was significantly higher (P < 0.05) at 1 h or more of transport time. Also, transport times of 2 h or more resulted in a death rate of 20%-33% of broilers. We found that the breast meat in the 0.5 h transport group had significantly (P < 0.05) higher L* values, drip loss, cooking loss, AMP/ATP ratio, and phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK). In addition, pH(24h) was lower compared to the control group, increasing the likelihood of pale, soft, and exudative (PSE)-like meat. However, no significant variations were found in meat color, drip loss, or cooking loss in other transport groups compared to the control group under the condition of this study. Muscle glycogen content decreased with time of transportation. There were significant correlations among p-AMPK and meat quality (P < 0.05). These results indicate that preslaughter transport during summer may cause severe physiological and biochemical changes of broilers. Further investigations studying the deeper relationship between biological indicators and meat quality according to the similar transport conditions would provide a better understanding of the effect of transport duration on meat quality.

AB  - Despite long-standing interest in the forms and mechanisms of density dependence, these are still imperfectly understood. However, in a constant environment an increase in density must reduce per capita resource availability, which in turn leads to reduced survival, fecundity and somatic growth rate. Here we report two population experiments examining the density dependent responses under controlled conditions of an important indicator species, Chironomus riparius.
   The first experiment was run for 35 weeks and was started at low density with replicate populations being fed three different rations. Increased ration reduced generation time and increased population growth rate (pgr) but had no effect on survival, fecundity and female body weight in the first generation. In the second generation there was a six-fold increase in generation time, presumably due to the greatly reduced per capita resource availability as the estimated initial densities of the second generation were 300 times greater than the first. Juvenile survival to emergence, fecundity, adult body weight and pgr declined by 90%, 75%, 35% and 99%, respectively. These large between-generation effects may have obscured the effects of the threefold variation in ration, as only survival to emergence significantly increased with ration in the second generation.
   These results suggest that some chironomid larvae survive a reduction in resource availability by growing more slowly. In the ephemeral habitats sometimes occupied by C. riparius, the effects of population density may depend crucially on the longevity of the environment. A second experiment was therefore performed to measure pgr from six different starting densities over an eight-week period. The relationship between pgr and density was concave, viewed from above. At densities above 16 larvae per cm(2), less than 1% of the population emerged and no offspring were produced. Under the conditions of experiment 2 - an 8-week habitat lifespan carrying capacity was estimated as 8 larvae per cm(2).

AB  - Although vision is the dominating sensory system in sports, many situations require multisensory integration. Faster processing of auditory information in the brain may facilitate time-critical abilities such as reaction speed however previous research was limited by generic auditory and visual stimuli that did not consider audio-visual characteristics in ecologically valid environments. This study investigated the reaction speed in response to sport-specific monosensory (visual and auditory) and multisensory (audio-visual) stimulation. Neurophysiological analyses identified the neural processes contributing to differences in reaction speed. Nineteen elite badminton players participated in this study. In a first recording phase, the sound profile and shuttle speed of smash and drop strokes were identified on a badminton court using high-speed video cameras and binaural recordings. The speed and sound characteristics were transferred into auditory and visual stimuli and presented in a lab-based experiment, where participants reacted in response to sport-specific monosensory or multisensory stimulation. Auditory signal presentation was delayed by 26 ms to account for realistic audio-visual signal interaction on the court. N1 and N2 event-related potentials as indicators of auditory and visual information perception/processing, respectively were identified using a 64-channel EEG. Despite the 26 ms delay, auditory reactions were significantly faster than visual reactions (236.6 ms vs. 287.7 ms, p < 0.001) but still slower when compared to multisensory stimulation (224.4 ms, p = 0.002). Across conditions response times to smashes were faster when compared to drops (233.2 ms, 265.9 ms, p < 0.001). Faster reactions were paralleled by a lower latency and higher amplitude of the auditory N1 and visual N2 potentials. The results emphasize the potential of auditory information to accelerate the reaction time in sport-specific multisensory situations. This highlights auditory processes as a promising target for training interventions in racquet sports.

AB  - Excessive ammonia-nitrogen (N) in aquifers has caused groundwater pollution on the Dongting Plain (DTP), which seriously threatens the safety of drinking water. It is urgent and necessary to determine the sources and enrichment mechanisms of ammonia-N in groundwater. Carrying out water and soil collaborative research on a three-dimensional scale can more comprehensively analyze the sources of N, including natural and anthropogenic sources. In this study, surface and groundwater quality characteristics were examined from a total of 77 sites on the DTP. Two subsequent boreholes were drilled in the high ammonia concentration area and normal groundwater area, respectively, to compare the effects of anthropogenic activities. Indicators from hydrogeochemical and pedogeochemical analyses, as well as various isotopes, including delta N-15-NH4+, delta N-15-TON, delta(NNO3-)-N-15, delta O-18-NO3-, delta O-18-H2O, delta D-H2O, and delta C-13-TOC were used to identify ammonium sources and transformation mechanisms in the strata. We found that the sediments were contaminated by manure and sewage in the aquifers, and part of the shallow groundwater was additionally contaminated by nitrogen fertilizers. Excessive ammonium-N was also detected in the deep aquitards and sediments, which were mainly dominated by mineralization. Ammonia oxidation (with weak hydroxylamine oxidation) is an important biogeochemical process in which ammonia and nitrate do not accumulate in oxidizing groundwater environments. However, heterotrophic nitrification (HN) and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANAMMOX) are the release mechanisms for excessive ammonium-N under reducing conditions. In addition, organic matter (OM) on the DTP had a wide range of biogeochemical proxies generated by phytoplankton within a lake, and the comparatively resilient terrestrial organic residues washed in from the surrounding terrestrial area. This study breaks through the conventional mechanisms for the release of excessive ammonium from sediments to aquifers, which provides new ideas for research on ammonium in sediments and ammonia in groundwater.

AB  - Conventional photosystem II (PSII) herbicides applied in agriculture can pose significant environmental risks to aquatic environments. In response to the frequent detection of these herbicides in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) catchment area, transitions towards 'alternative' herbicides are now widely supported. However, water quality guideline values (WQGVs) for alternative herbicides are lacking and their potential ecological impacts on tropical marine species are generally unknown. To improve our understanding of the risks posed by some of these alternative herbicides on marine species under tropical conditions, we tested the effects of four herbicides on the widely distributed diatom Chaetoceros muelleri. The PSII herbicides diuron, propazine, and tebuthiuron induced substantial reductions in both 24 h effective quantum yields (Delta F/F-m ') and 3-day specific growth rates (SGR). The effect concentrations, which reduced Delta F/F-m ' by 50% (EC50), ranged from 4.25 mu g L-1 diuron to 48.6 mu g L-1 propazine, while the EC(50)s for SGR were on average threefold higher, ranging from 12.4 mu g L-1 diuron to 187 mu g L-1 tebuthiuron. Our results clearly demonstrated that inhibition of Delta F/F-m ' in PSII is directly linked to reduced growth (R-2=0.95) in this species, further supporting application of Delta F/F-m ' inhibition as a valid bioindicator of ecological relevance for PSII herbicides that could contribute to deriving future WQGVs. In contrast, SGR and Delta F/F-m ' of C. muelleri were nonresponsive to the non-PSII herbicide haloxyfop at the highest concentration tested (4570 mu g L-1), suggesting haloxyfop does not pose a risk to C. muelleri. The toxicity thresholds (e.g. no effect concentrations; NECs) identified in this study will contribute to the derivation of high-reliability marine WQGVs for some alternative herbicides detected in GBR waters and support future assessments of the cumulative risks of complex herbicide mixtures commonly detected in coastal waters.

AB  - The presence of anthropic activity in the coastal or riverine environment modifies the wave as well as the water and sediment current regime. In particular, the body of water around ports is an area where intense currents and sediment transport rates are usually present and can be affected by low water velocities that take place close to the entrance and inside the port basin. Consequently, sediment can be entrained and accumulated in such areas, creating problems to navigation. Ports and moorings are filled with fine sediments due to deposition resulting from solid transport. In particular, silt particles settle because of the weak vertical and lateral shearing of the velocity field. The result is that harbours frequently require ordinary maintenance dredging.
   The dredging process involves the removal of sediment in its natural deposited condition by using either mechanical or hydraulic equipment. Dredging is a consolidated and proven technology, but involves considerable drawbacks. In particular, dredging has a notable environmental impact on marine flora and fauna, contributes to the mobility and diffusion of contaminants and pollutants already present in the silted sediments, obstructs navigation and is characterized by relatively high and low predictable costs.
   This paper aims to provide an original structured overview of technologies alternative to dredging that have been tested in the past 50 years. More than 150 articles have been analysed to compare standard dredging technologies with market-ready competitors from techno-economic and environmental perspectives. In particular, the paper focuses on anti-sedimentation infrastructures and on innovative plant solutions characterized by low maintenance costs and by a very limited environmental impact. The final aim of the paper is to describe the currently available technologies that prevent port inlet and channel siltation and to classify them through a techno-economic and environmental impact assessment. The comparison shows that dredging has both the higher costs and environmental impact, while fixed sand by-passing plants are characterized by the lowest environmental impact and operation costs that are competitive with dredging.

AB  - Shale gas is a kind of unconventional natural gas stored in shale formation. Compared with traditional fossil fuels, it is more efficient and environmentally friendly. It can help to reduces a country's over-dependence on high-energy and high-pollution resources. The sustainable development of the shale gas industry is a prerequisite for achieving an efficient, green, and long-term use of shale gas resources. In order to evaluate the sustainability of the shale gas industry correctly and scientifically, the driving force-pressure-state-impact-response-management (DPSIRM) model, the real-coded accelerated genetic algorithm (RAGA), and projection pursuit (PP) were combined to develop an assessment model for the sustainability of the shale gas industry (the DPSIRM-RAGA-PP model). The proposed model was then applied for an empirical analysis of the sustainable development of the shale gas industry of Chongqing and Sichuan, which currently produce over 90% of the Chinese shale gas. The obtained results show that (1) water shortage, water pollution and pipe network density are the major influencing factors for the sustainable development of the shale gas industry in the 15 indicators selected by DPSIRM model. (2) Compared to other factors, geological conditions, market risks and core technology exert less impact on the sustainable development of the shale gas industry in Chongqing and Sichuan. This may be related to the current stage of the shale gas development in Chongqing and Sichuan and the available statistical data. (3) The projection eigenvalues of the Chongqing and Sichuan samples are 3.1184 and 1.6826, respectively. It indicates that the sustainability of shale gas industry in Chongqing is better than that in Sichuan. Moreover, the proposed DPSIRM-RAGA-PP model can effectively utilize the high-dimensional, non-normal, and nonlinear complex data, and provides a practical method for the quantitative analysis and evaluation of the sustainable development of the fuel industry in general.

AB  - BackgroundThe level of groundwater resources is changing rapidly and this requires the discovery of newer groundwater resources. Drought is one of the most significant natural phenomena affecting different aspects of human life and environment. During the last decades, the application of artificial intelligent techniques has been recognized as effective approaches to forecast an annual precipitation rate.MethodIn this study, the association analysis of climate drought and a decline in groundwater level is addressed using Gaussian process classification (GPC) and backpropagation (BP) artificial neural network (ANN). This methodology is proposed to create a framework for decision making and reduce uncertainty in water resource management calculations, and in particular to optimize the management of groundwater drinking water sources.ResultsUnderground water levels in 609 study plains in Iran were used to predict drought over the test period, extending from 2017 to 2021. The artificial intelligence methods were implemented in the Python programming environment to achieve an annual precipitation rate. A statistical summary of the Rasterized Cells of the zoning maps was used to validate the prediction results. Considering the relationship between water quality reductions and drought in Iranian aquifers due to the occurrence of groundwater drought periods, the results were validated by analysis of the effect of climate drought using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) on the occurrence of observed droughts with the Groundwater Resources Index (GRI). The results are well-illustrated by the observation of the predicted digits in the third dimension of the Gaussian distribution.ConclusionAccording to the SPI indicator, the southern regions of the country, and especially the central parts of the plain, can be considered the most affected areas by the most severe future droughts. The prediction results indicate a decrease in drought severity as part of a two-year sequence involving a recurrence of drought exacerbation and relative decline, as well as a failed state after the critical condition of aquifers.

AB  - After their first use in electric vehicles (EVs), the residual capacity of traction batteries can make them valuable in other applications. Although reusing EV batteries remains an undeveloped market, second-use applications of EV batteries are in line with circular economy principles and the waste management hierarchy. Although substantial environmental benefits are expected from reusing traction batteries, further efforts are needed in data collection, modelling the life-cycle stages and calculating impact indicators to propose a harmonized and adapted life-cycle assessment (LCA) method.
   To properly assess the environmental benefits and drawbacks of using repurposed EV batteries in second-use applications, in this article an adapted LCA is proposed based on the comparison of different scenarios from a life-cycle perspective. The key issues for the selected life-cycle stages and the aspects and parameters to be assessed in the analysis are identified and discussed for each stage, including manufacturing, repurposing, reusing and recycling.
   The proposed method is applied to a specific case study concerning the use of repurposed batteries to increase photovoltaic (PV) self-consumption in a given dwelling. Primary data on the dwelling's energy requirements and PV production were used to properly assess the energy flows in this specific repurposed scenario: both the literature search performed and the results obtained highlighted the relevance of modelling the system energy using real data, combining the characteristics of both the battery and its application. The LCA results confirmed that the environmental benefits of adopting repurposed batteries to increase PV self-consumption in a house occur under specific conditions and that the benefits are more or less considerable depending on the impact category assessed. Higher environmental benefits refer to impact categories dominated by the manufacturing and repurposing stages. Some of the most relevant parameters (e.g. residual capacity and allocation factor) were tested in a sensitivity analysis. The method can be used in other repurposing application cases if parameters for these cases can be determined by experimental tests, modelling or extracting data from the literature.

AB  - Reducing crop losses due to abiotic stresses is a major target of agricultural biotechnology that will increase with climate change and global population growth. Concerns, however, have been raised about potential ecological impacts if transgenes become established in wild populations and cause increased competitiveness of weedy or invasive species. Potential risks will be a function of transgene movement, population sizes, and fitness effects on the recipient population. While key components influencing gene flow have been extensively investigated, there have been few studies on factors subsequent to transgene movement that can influence persistence and competitiveness. Here, we performed multiyear, multigenerational, assessment to examine fitness effects and persistence of three mechanistically different abiotic stress tolerance genes: C-repeat binding factor 3/drought responsive element binding factor 1a (CBF3/DREB1a); Salt overly sensitive 1 (SOS1); and Mannose-6-phosphate reductase (M6PR). Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana overexpressing these genes were grown in pure populations and in competition with wild-type (WT) parents for six generations spanning a range of field environment conditions. Growth, development, biomass, seed production, and transgene frequency were measured at each generation. Seed planted for each generation was obtained from the previous generation as would occur during establishment of a new genotype in the environment. The three transgenes exhibited different fitness effects and followed different establishment trajectories. In comparison with pure populations, CBF3 lines exhibited reduced dry weight, seed yield, and viable seed yield, relative to WT background. In contrast, overexpression of SOS1 and M6PR did not significantly impact productivity measures in pure populations. In competition with WT, negative fitness effects were magnified. Transgene frequencies were significantly reduced for CBF3 and SOS1 while frequencies of M6PR appeared to be subject to genetic drift. These studies demonstrate the importance of fitness effects and intergenotype competition in influencing persistence of transgenes conferring complex traits.

AB  - We studied the foraminiferal distribution in two naturally grown salt marshes from the southern North Sea with respect to the tidal frame, salinity, grain size and pH. The salt marshes are situated on the landward sides of the islands of Sylt (Rantum, Germany) and Fano (Sonderho, Denmark). In both study areas, foraminifera have a vertical distribution with respect to water level, but also show inter-site variability, which can be related to environmental differences (e.g., in salinity and pH) and different flooding dynamics of the coastal salt marsh (Rantum) and the tidal-creek salt marsh (Sonderho). We developed different transfer functions, based on the widely applied standardized water level index (SWLI) approach and on three flooding parameters (duration of submergence (DoS), mean submergence time (MST), and flooding frequency (FF)), in order to assess their predictive ability for relative sea-level estimates for the southern North Sea coastal region. The water-level data used for these approaches are determined based on local water-level conditions, corrected for tidal distortions using water-level measurements for the Sonderho salt marsh and the Rantum tide gauge. The SWLI approach shows a precision (root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.23 m), which is around 15% of the tidal range. All three flooding approaches show comparable results at around mean tide level to mean high water, while at higher elevations, foraminiferal distribution becomes non-linearly correlated to flooding parameters resulting in lower precision of > 1.0 m. Our results suggest that the SWLI approach performs well and that the flooding approaches offer a suitable addition for assessing relative sea-level estimates in the North Sea region. We enhanced the knowledge on changing precision for tide level reconstructions along the elevational gradient in a storm dominated tidal area where elevation and flooding parameters are non-linear correlated.

AB  - Co-occurrence patterns (studied by C-score, number of checkerboard units, number of species combinations, and V-ratio, and by an empirical Bayes approach developed by Gotelli and Ulrich, 2010) are crucial elements in order to understand assembly rules in ecological communities at both local and spatial scales. In order to explore general assembly rules and the effects of biome and spatial scale on such rules, here we studied a group of beetles (Coleoptera, Meloidae), using Namibia as a case of study. Data were gathered from 186 sampling sites, which allowed collection of 74 different species. We analyzed data at the level of (i) all sampled sites, (ii) all sites stratified by biome (Savannah, Succulent Karoo, Nama Karoo, Desert), and (iii) three randomly selected nested areas with three spatial scales each. Three competing algorithms were used for all analyses: (i) Fixed-Equiprobable, (ii) Fixed-Fixed, and (iii) Fixed-Proportional. In most of the null models we created, co-occurrence indicators revealed a non-random structure in meloid beetle assemblages at the global scale and at the scale of biomes, with species aggregation being much more important than species segregation in determining this non randomness. At the level of biome, the same non-random organization was uncovered in assemblages from Savannah (where the aggregation pattern was particularly strong) and Succulent Karoo, but not in Desert and Nama Karoo. We conclude that species facilitation and similar niche in endemic species pairs may be particularly important as community drivers in our case of study. This pattern is also consistent with the evidence of a higher species diversity (normalized according to biome surface area) in the two former biomes. Historical patterns were perhaps also important for Succulent Karoo assemblages. Spatial scale had a reduced effect on patterning our data. This is consistent with the general homogeneity of environmental conditions over wide areas in Namibia. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - How should the somewhat vague term of restoration success be measured? This is a critical question rooted in European law, where in fact the creation of proper replacement habitats is a prerequisite for permitting projects that trigger a loss of species or habitats. Previous studies have used indices that relied on a comparison to reference sites, for example the number of a predefined pool of target species or compositional similarity. However, since restoration sites have rarely the same biotic and abiotic conditions as reference sites, plant communities in restored sites will not perfectly match the reference sites. Furthermore, such indices fail when reference sites are lacking or degraded. Hence, there is a need for an alternative approach that evaluates the conservation value of a restored site independently from reference sites. We propose that naturalness indicator values can be an option to measure restoration success. The approach of using naturalness indicator values makes use of the fact that plants are able to indicate environmental parameters, including degradation and regeneration. We compared and measured the restoration success of three well-established methods for grassland restoration (sod transplantation, hay transfer, seeding) with three commonly used indices (diversity, number of target species, similarity to reference sites). The results verified earlier studies and showed that sod transplantation led to the highest restoration success followed by hay transfer and seeding of site-specific seed mixtures. Further, we used those well-established indices for an evaluation of novel, naturalness-based indices (unweighted and cover-weighted mean naturalness indicator values, the sum of naturalness indicator values). While calculating the means of naturalness indicator values failed to offer conclusive information on restoration success, we could show that the sum of naturalness indicator values was highly correlated with the number of target species and compositional similarity to reference sites. Thus, our case study demonstrated that naturalness indices can be an excellent option to estimate success in grassland restoration.

AB  - The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) aims to achieve "Good Environmental Status" (GES) in EU marine waters by 2020. This initiative started its first phase of implementation in 2012, when each member state defined the GES and environmental targets in relation to 11 descriptors and related indicators for 2020. In 2013, the EU Commission launched the reformed Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), which aims to achieve biomass levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield (MSY) for all commercial stocks exploited in EU waters by 2020, as well as contribute to the achievement of GES. These two pieces of legislation are aligned since according to Descriptor 3 (commercial fish and shellfish), the MSFD requires reaching a healthy stock status with fishing mortality (F) and spawning stock biomass (SSB) compatible with the respective MSY reference limits for all commercial species by 2020. We investigated whether the two policies are effectively aligned in the Mediterranean Sea, an ecosystem where the vast majority of stocks show unsustainable exploitation. For this purpose, we assessed and compared the number and typology of stocks considered by the member states when assessing GES in relation to data on stocks potentially available according to the EU Data Collection Framework (DCF) and the proportion of landings they represented. The number of stocks considered by the member states per assessment area was uneven, ranging between 7 and 43, while the share of landings corresponding to the selected stocks ranged from 23 to 95%. A lack of coherence between GES definitions among the member states was also revealed, and environmental targets were less ambitious than MSFD and CFP requirements. This could possibly reduce the likelihood of achieving fishery sustainability in the Mediterranean by 2020. These conditions limited the envisaged synergies between the two policies and are discussed in consideration of the recent Commission Decision on criteria and methodological standards for GES.

AB  - Environmental impact assessments require pre-impact data to discriminate between natural and anthropogenic sources of community shifts. True pre-impact data, however, are rarely available because the onset of ocean biomonitoring in the 20th century frequently postdates the timing of such shifts. Death assemblages (DAs) sampled on a sea-floor capture previous community states and represent archives of past preimpact conditions. This is because they change more slowly (10-10,000 years) than the corresponding living assemblage (LA) (yearly scales of turnover). Strong and rapid directional changes such as those due to human activities are therefore not immediately captured by DAs, leading to a greater live-dead (LD) mismatch than under natural processes alone. We used this approach to infer disturbance of benthic habitats around platforms in two major oilfields in the Persian (Arabian) Gulf: Umm Al Dalkh (UA) and Zakum (ZK). We found that, first, LD metrics showed no correlation with contamination levels or distance from the platform. Second, although LAs and DAs significantly differed in species composition and did not overlap in multivariate space, the difference was generated by a single species, the semelid deposit-feeding bivalve Ervilia purpurea. This bivalve was not found alive, but constituted 30-50% of the DAs at the field scale and up to 92% at some stations. Radiocarbon-calibrated amino acid racemization dating of valves of this species showed considerable spatial and temporal heterogeneity in production over the last decades and centuries, implying a boom-and-bust population dynamics; its absence in LAs is thus likely unrelated to the onset of oil platform production in the 20th century. The remaining LD differences probably reflect within- and multiple-habitat temporal or spatial averaging, and taxonomic similarity and rank-order agreement in species abundance at the field scale are comparable with values recorded in pristine areas. Therefore, we found no evidence of major community shifts in this oilfield area. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Teaching students to develop data-driven models is a challenging task as a good balance has to be found between the theoretical background of the models, the ecological relevance of the knowledge rules inferred and their socio-economic applicability. In this context it is unclear which aspects of the modeling process are easily understood by students, and in particular, how theoretical issues interfere with practical boundary conditions and socio-economic relevance (ecosystem protection, water management, policy development, ecological engineering). In order to fill this knowledge gap, students developed static data-driven models and tutors assessed students' performances. Criteria such as the theoretical, ecological and socio-economic relevance of the derived knowledge rules were used to select the most optimal models.
   We noticed an inverse relationship between the complexity of the subtasks and the number of students that succeeded. Students evaluated their models with respect to the theoretical reliability, but were not likely to consider the other two criteria. Half of the students succeeded in assessing the models based on their ecological relevance and only 17% of the students checked the socio-economic relevance of the knowledge rules. Four groups out of seven assessed their models merely based on the predictive power of the models. Only one group integrated the theoretical, ecological and socio-economic relevance to assess the models.
   The key findings of our research can be used to optimize the efficiency of data mining courses. We reveal which aspects of the modeling process students seem to overemphasize and give recommendations about the topics trainers should emphasize in the future to ensure that students develop advanced skills. Based on our results the theory-practice dichotomy in higher education can be further reduced. Our learning-by-doing approach showed students how to solve common problems in ecological data sets (e.g. missing data, outliers, collinearity, non-normal distribution, parameterization, uncertainty, etc.), which are often only briefly discussed in basic statistical courses.

AB  - Spring habitats are highly diverse and have a mosaic microhabitat structure. They are endangered by diffuse exploitation as drinking-water resources, an impact likely to increase with climate change. Diatoms were sampled from stones and bryophytes in 110 nonthermal, near-natural springs in the southeastern Alps (Trentino) and 16 carbonate springs in the Dolomiti Bellunesi National Park. Fuzzy clustering identified 6 assemblages in the main types of springs. Carbonate rheocrenes hosted Achnanthidium spp., Gomphonema elegantissimum, and Nitzschia fonticola. Several of these species are rheophilic. This group was divided into 4 subassemblages defined by decreasing A. lineare and increasing A. pyrenaicum with increasing flow. Carbonate rheocrenes with shading or moderate NO3- enrichment contained a majority of sciaphilic and NO3-tolerant taxa: Cocconeis taxa, Amphora spp., Caloneis fontinalis, Reimeria spp., and Eunotia arcubus. Well-buffered siliceous rheocrenes supported Diatoma spp., Eunotia minor, Encyonema minutum, Navicula exilis, and Planothidium lanceolatum. Many of these species are heliophilic and rheophilic. Carbonate rheocrenes with lower conductivities or seasonal desiccation contained typical taxa of unstable environments: Diadesmis spp., Planothidium frequentissimum, Meridion circulare, and Achnanthidium dolomiticum. Carbonate rock-face seepages and some tufa springs supported xerotolerant diatom species with a preference for higher conductivities: Encyonopsis spp., Delicata spp., Gomphonema lateripunctatum, Denticula spp., and Cymbopleura spp. Siliceous seepages and pool springs, some very-low alkalinity rheocrenes, and 1 iron spring were characterized by acidophilous mire taxa, such as Eunotia spp., Frustulia crassinervia, and Tabellaria flocculosa, and very-low-alkalinity indicators, such as Psammothidium acidoclinatum. The other iron springs harbored species-poor assemblages with low numbers of cells. Many diatom species showed a significant preference for stones or bryophytes. Epibryon had higher richness and diversity than epilithon, and mean diversity did not differ among the most frequent bryophyte species. Bryophytes are quick and easy to sample and are proposed as the target substratum for diatom-based assessments of springs.

AB  - Effects of agricultural intensification (AI) on biodiversity are often assessed on the plot scale, although processes determining diversity also operate on larger spatial scales. Here, we analyzed the diversity of vascular plants, carabid beetles, and birds in agricultural landscapes in cereal crop fields at the field (n = 1350), farm (n = 270), and European-region (n = 9) scale. We partitioned diversity into its additive components alpha, beta, and gamma, and assessed the relative contribution of beta diversity to total species richness at each spatial scale. AI was determined using pesticide and fertilizer inputs, as well as tillage operations and categorized into low, medium, and high levels. As AI was not significantly related to landscape complexity, we could disentangle potential AI effects on local vs. landscape community homogenization. AI negatively affected the species richness of plants and birds, but not carabid beetles, at all spatial scales. Hence, local AI was closely correlated to beta diversity on larger scales up to the farm and region level, and thereby was an indicator of farm-and region-wide biodiversity losses. At the scale of farms (12.83-20.52%) and regions (68.34-80.18%), beta diversity accounted for the major part of the total species richness for all three taxa, indicating great dissimilarity in environmental conditions on larger spatial scales. For plants, relative importance of alpha diversity decreased with AI, while relative importance of beta diversity on the farm scale increased with AI for carabids and birds. Hence, and in contrast to our expectations, AI does not necessarily homogenize local communities, presumably due to the heterogeneity of farming practices. In conclusion, a more detailed understanding of AI effects on diversity patterns of various taxa and at multiple spatial scales would contribute to more efficient agri-environmental schemes in agroecosystems.

AB  - Nitrogen emissions have grown in Spain during the last 15 years. As precipitation scavenges gases and aerosols from the atmosphere, an effect on rainwater concentrations can be expected. However, time-series studies on wet N concentrations in the Iberian Peninsula are very scarce. This paper aims to fill this gap by analysing weekly rainfall N concentrations at a set of rural sites in Catalonia (NE Spain) from 1995/1996 to 2007 and a forest site monitored from 1983 to 2007. The sites encompass a range of rural environments and climate conditions, from the inland pre-Pyrenees (Sort) to the Mediterranean coast (Begur) and from north (Sort and Begur) to central (Palautordera and La Castanya) and south Catalonia (La Senia). We found a 1-year cycle for concentrations of NH (4) (+) and NO (3) (-) whereby higher values were reached at the end of spring-early summer, except at the easternmost coastal site of Begur. Weekly NH (4) (+) concentrations decreased with time at all sites (except at La Senia) whilst NO (3) (-) concentrations increased at all sites during the same period. Rainfall SO (4) (2-) concentrations decreased with time at all sites. The opposite trends in NO (3) (-) and SO (4) (2-) concentrations determined a shift in the relative acid contribution of those anions during the 12-13-year period. To interpret the increasing trend, mean annual NO (3) (-) concentrations were regressed against NO2 Spanish emissions and to some indicators of local anthropogenic activity. The increase at Sort and Palautordera showed good correlation with local anthropogenic indicators. Wet inorganic N deposition ranged between 4.2 and 6.7 kg ha(-1) year(-1). When including estimates of dry deposition, total annual deposition rose up to 10-20 kg ha(-1) year(-1), values that have been found to initiate adverse effects on Mediterranean-type forest ecosystems.

AB  - A total of 87 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) (36 Lactobacillus sakei, 22 Enterococcus faecium, 16 Lactococcus garvieae, 11 Vagococcus carniphilus and 2 Enterococcus sp.) isolated from a small-scale facility producing traditional dry sausages were screened for antagonistic activity against other LAB and some spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms, also isolated from the same processing facility, except Listeria innocua (in lieu of Listeria monocytogenes) and Escherichia coli. The final goal was to investigate LAB antibacterial activity within the facility microbial ecosystem and to select interesting strains for the role of bio-preservatives.
   Twenty-one Ec. faecium, 6 Vc. carniphilus, 4 Lc. garvieae, 3 Lb. sakei and 2 Enterococcus sp. were shown to inhibit the growth of some indicator microorganisms in an agar well diffusion assay. Except 2 Lb. sakei and an Enterococcus sp., all these isolates exhibited antibacterial activity against L. innocua, but only 3 Ec. faecium, 5 Vc. carniphilus and 3 Lc. garvieae displayed also antagonistic activity against Staphylococcus aureus. The 5 Vc. carniphilus isolates were also found to be inhibitory for the Gram-negative bacterium Hafnia alvei.
   Isolates displaying antibacterial activity against L. innocua and/or Sc. aureus were investigated for the nature of antibacterial compounds synthesized against these indicator microorganisms. Bacteriocin-like production could be detected only on agar plated in overlay assays, and was unsuccessfully researched in cell-free culture supernatant fluids under conditions that eliminate acid and hydrogen peroxide inhibition. Results also showed that a Lb. sakei isolate displayed an additional inhibitory effect by H2O2 against L. innocua. These isolates will be investigated for their ability to repress the growth of undesirable bacteria in biofilms, i.e., the real mode of bacterial attachment.
   This is the first report on bacteriocin-like from Vc. carniphilus and on bacteriocin-like from Lc. garvieae active against both L. innocua and Sc. aureus species. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Interspecific competition has long been implicated as a force structuring the distribution of organisms along environmental gradients. The research presented here uses a survey, foraging observations, and a manipulative field experiment that test the included-niche competition hypothesis as a mechanism structuring the distribution of a generalist grasshopper, Melanoplus femurrubrum, along a food-resource gradient. A field survey of 10 old fields revealed a step-like reduction in M. femurrubrum abundance as the proportion of grass cover in the fields exceeded 60%. Furthermore, M. femurrubrum abundance and the abundance of a potential competitor, the grass specialist Chorthippus curtipennis, were negatively correlated among the fields. Experimental foraging observations showed that M. femurrubrum was a polyphagous feeder that preferred grass and consumed less grass in the presence of C. curtipennis. The pattern of grasshopper distribution and foraging data support an included-niche competition hypothesis. However, in a field experiment that manipulated C. curtipennis presence and absence and the composition of vegetation in which competition might occur, growth and mortality rates in M. femurrubrum did not respond to C. curtipennis competition. Performance was predicted to be lowest in grass-dominated conditions, those corresponding to the locations when M. femurrubrum does not exist. Instead, growth rates were highest and mortality rates were lowest in grass-only treatments. While the survey and foraging observations support the included-niche hypothesis, the experiments suggest that interspecific competition in adult grasshoppers is not the cause of the grasshopper distribution pattern. Similar experiments in western North American prairies indicate that interspecific competition can be important and that foraging ecology can be a good indicator of the interaction. This study contributes to the increasing body of knowledge about interspecific competition's role in organism distributions. It demonstrates that geographic similarity in natural history need not lead to a similar importance of limiting factors.

AB  - Alpine meadows on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau are sensitive to climate change. The precipitation regime in this region has undergone major changes, "repackaging" precipitation from more frequent, smaller events to less frequent, larger events. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important indicator of responses to global change in alpine meadow ecosystems. However, little information is available describing the mechanisms driving the response of N2O emissions to changes in the precipitation regime. In this study, a manipulative field experiment was conducted to investigate N2O flux, soil properties, enzyme activity, and gene abundance in response to severe and moderate changes in precipitation regime over two years. Severe changes in precipitation regime led to a 12.6-fold increase in N2O fluxes (0.0068 +/- 0.0018 mg m(-2) h(-1)) from Zoige alpine meadows relative to natural conditions (0.0005 +/- 0.0029 mg m(-2) h(-1)). In addition, severe changes in precipitation regime significantly suppressed the activities of leucine amino peptidase (LAP) and peroxidase (PEO), affected ecoenzymatic stoichiometry, and increased the abundances of gdhA, narI and nirK genes, which significantly promoted organic nitrogen (N) decomposition, denitrification, and anammox processes. The increase in abundance of these genes could be ascribed to changes in the abundance of several dominant bacterial taxa (i.e., Actinobacteria and Pmteobacteria) as a result of the altered precipitation regime. Decreases in nitrate and soil moisture caused by severe changes in precipitation may exacerbate N limitation and water deficit, lead to a suppression of soil enzyme activity, and change the structure of microorganism community. The N cycle of the alpine meadow ecosystem may accelerate by increasing the abundance of key N functional genes. This would, in turn, lead to increased N2O emission. This study provided insights into how precipitation regimes changes affect N cycling, and may also improve prediction of N2O fluxes in response to changes in precipitation regime.

AB  - Water clarity is a comprehensive indicator of the water environment status. Studies have shown that in recent years the clarity of inland and ocean water has decreased in many parts of the world owing to the influence of climate change and human activities. However, changes in inland water clarity exclusively resulting from climate change are largely ignored because most inland water is being utilized by human beings for applications such as waterworks or aquaculture. Therefore, understanding the trends and reasons of inland water clarity under natural conditions is important to recognize the inland water environment shifts under the global changes. Because of the harsh environment, the lakes on the Tibetan Plateau are less disturbed by human activities and are ideal objects for studying water clarity variations attributed to climatic changes. Here, we describe water clarity changes as measured using the Secchi Depth (SD) in 152 big lakes with an area greater than 50 km(2) based on in-situ investigations and the retrieval results from a high accuracy retrieval model (r = 0.94, P < 0.01). Most of the lakes had an SD of 3-10 m, although there was marked spatial variation and a significant positive correlation with lake area (P < 0.01). The mean SD of all 152 lakes significantly increased at a rate of 0.033 m/year (95% CI, 0.021-0.045; P < 0.01) between 2000 and 2019. Variations in lake SD were linked with temporal changes in precipitation, and related to spatial changes of water optical components including suspended matter (0.13 < R-2 < 0.40, P < 0.01 or P < 0.05), fDOM (R-2 = 0.24, P < 0.01) and chlorophyll-a concentration (R-2 = 0.12, P < 0.01). The reconstructed lake water clarity in our study will improve the understanding of inland water clarity changes and provide basic data to study the heat exchanges between lake water and atmosphere.

AB  - Background. The Mediterranean subpopulation of fin whale Balaenoptera physalus (Linnaeus, 1758) has recently been listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of threatened species. The species is also listed as species in need of strict protection under the Habitat Directive and is one of the indicators for the assessment of Good Environmental Status under the MSFD. Reference values on population abundance and trends are needed in order to set the threshold values and to assess the conservation status of the population.
   Methods. Yearly summer monitoring using ferries as platform of opportunity was performed since 2008 within the framework of the FLT Med Network. Data were collected along several fixed transects crossing the Western Mediterranean basin and the Adriatic and Ionian region. Species presence, expressed by density recorded along the sampled transects, was inspected for assessing interannual variability together with group size. Generalized Additive Models were used to describe density trends over a 11 years' period (2008-2018). A spatial multi-scale approach was used to highlight infra-basin differences in species presence and distribution during the years.
   Results. Summer presence of fin whales in the western Mediterranean area showed a strong interannual variability, characterized by the alternance of rich and poor years. Small and large groups of fin whales were sighted only during rich years, confirming the favorable feeding condition influencing species presence. Trends highlighted by the GAM can be summarized as positive from 2008 to 2013, and slightly negative from 2014 to 2018. The sub-areas analysis showed a similar pattern, but with a more stable trend during the second period in the Pelagos Sanctuary sub-area, and a negative one in the other two sub-areas. Our findings further confirm the need for an integrated approach foreseeing both, large scale surveys and yearly monitoring at different spatial scales to correct and interpret the basin wide abundance estimates, and to correlate spatial and temporal trends with the ecological and anthropogenic drivers.

AB  - Edge drilling by the muricid gastropods Chicoreus dilectus and Phyllonotus pomum has been observed in the laboratory under conditions simulating an enemy-rich environment, and evidence for it is found in Florida's Pliocene fossil record. However, this behaviour has never been observed in the wild and was presumed to be ecologically extinct for the last two million years. This study documents for the first time expression of enemy-induced edge-drilling behaviour in the wild by C. dilectus and P. pomum. These observations are based on a multi-year survey between 2002 and 2015 in St Joseph Bay, Florida, a coastal lagoon in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. Edge drilling was not recorded in 2002 in St Joseph Bay, but expression of edge-drilling behaviour was confirmed by direct observation for both species and two stations in the bay between 2007 and 2011. Edge-drilling predation traces produced by C. dilectus and P. pomum accounted for more than half of all their drilling attacks in bulk samples collected in 2007, with the frequency of occurrence in bulk samples declining at both stations over time. Intensive sampling along the west Florida shelf over the same time interval failed to find any other unambiguous evidence for expression of edge drilling by these species. St Joseph Bay has the highest densities of predators and lowest prey survival rates in the region and also highest secondary productivity in any seagrass habitat globally, confirming the use of edge drilling by C. dilectus and P. pomum as an indicator of Florida's 'enemy hotspots' and their fates in modern times and in the fossil record. The re-emergence of enemy-induced edge drilling by C. dilectus and P. pomum in Florida after two million years, but only in St Joseph Bay, suggests the present-day ecology of the bay is unique on geological time scales.

AB  - Somatic growth is an integrated, individual-based response to environmental conditions, especially in ectotherms. Growth dynamics of large, mobile animals are particularly useful as bio-indicators of environmental change at regional scales. We assembled growth rate data from throughout the West Atlantic for green turtles, Chelonia mydas, which are long-lived, highly migratory, primarily herbivorous mega-consumers that may migrate over hundreds to thousands of kilometers. Our dataset, the largest ever compiled for sea turtles, has 9690 growth increments from 30 sites from Bermuda to Uruguay from 1973 to 2015. Using generalized additive mixed models, we evaluated covariates that could affect growth rates; body size, diet, and year have significant effects on growth. Growth increases in early years until 1999, then declines by 26% to 2015. The temporal (year) effect is of particular interest because two carnivorous species of sea turtles-hawksbills, Eretmochelys imbricata, and loggerheads, Caretta caretta-exhibited similar significant declines in growth rates starting in 1997 in the West Atlantic, based on previous studies. These synchronous declines in productivity among three sea turtle species across a trophic spectrum provide strong evidence that an ecological regime shift (ERS) in the Atlantic is driving growth dynamics. The ERS resulted from a synergy of the 1997/1998 El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-the strongest on record-combined with an unprecedented warming rate over the last two to three decades. Further support is provided by the strong correlations between annualized mean growth rates of green turtles and both sea surface temperatures (SST) in the West Atlantic for years of declining growth rates (r = -.94) and the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) for all years (r = .74). Granger-causality analysis also supports the latter finding. We discuss multiple stressors that could reinforce and prolong the effect of the ERS. This study demonstrates the importance of region-wide collaborations.

AB  - As an internationally important wetland for migratory waterbirds, China's Poyang Lake region has experienced substantial changes in land use during the past two decades owing to climate change and anthropogenic disturbances. Recent dam constructions on the Yangtze River and its tributaries for agriculture and hydroelectric power exert strong effects on the hydrological regimes of this lake. However, few studies have investigated how the land-use changes through time affect the habitat suitability for wintering Anseriformes-the largest community in this region. Thus, it is necessary to timely monitor changes in the habitat quality and understand the potential factors that alter it. In this study, three periods (1995, 2005 and 2014) of typical environmental indicators that have direct impacts on foraging and resting for the Anserformes, including proximity to water (density of lakes, rivers and ponds), human disturbances (density of residences and various road networks), preferred land cover types and food availability (NDVI), are integrated to develop a habitat suitability index model for habitat mapping. The results indicate that long-term lake shrinkage in low-water periods led to greatly expanded wetlands in these years, which provided more suitable habitat for migratory waterfowl. The amount of highly suitable habitat in 2014 was nearly twice as much as in 1995. Recent survey data from 1997 to 2013 also revealed an increase in the population size, and confirmed the improvement of habitat suitability in the Poyang Lake region. Spatial analysis revealed that land use changes contributed most to the improved habitat coverage between 1995 and 2014. However, the relative significances of these transformations for highly suitable and moderately suitable habitats are strikingly different. Increases in wetland and paddy field area are the main reasons for explaining these improvements, respectively. The framework model proposed in this study will help governments to evaluate habitat conservation and restoration for protecting waterbirds in a spatially explicit way. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Invasion by non-native tree species is a major driver of reduction and fragmentation of forest ecosystems, also altering biodiversity components. However, the effects of this process on the phylogenetic structure and diversity of Mediterranean woodlands are still unknown. Accordingly, we used cork oak (Quercus suber) stands invaded by self-sowing populations of maritime pine locally introduced ca. 70 years ago as a model system to assess the impact on the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of the native seed plant community. We performed vegetation sampling of the two forest types in sites of central Italy with similar conditions. Taxonomic diversity was negatively affected by the pine at three levels (gamma, alpha, beta). Indicator species were significantly less numerous than in cork oak stands, and did not include two growth-forms such as herbs and vines. Phylogenetic diversity metrics were inferred from an evolutionary tree of seed plants based on a ITS-5.8S nuclear DNA dataset including original sequences from local plant material. Phylogenetic diversity (PD) was positively related to species and genus richness, showing a marked decrease in the pine stands. Seven major clades (orders) of angiosperm dicots were only represented in the cork oak community. Both the NRI and NTI indices showed a significant reduction of phylogenetic evenness in the pine forest. Here, the proportional increase of related taxa with acid-tolerance specialization suggests that soil acidification is a major driver for a "habitat filtering" effect causing the exclusion of several understorey species and genera of cork oak forests. Progressive thinning of the pine stands is advocated to avoid further acidification and promote the re-conversion to oak woodlands by natural regeneration. This will ultimately favor the recovery of the associated plant diversity and the restoration of a vanishing forest ecosystem of the ancient Mediterranean landscape. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The importance of low intensity farming for the conservation of biodiversity throughout Europe was acknowledged early in the 1990s when the concept of 'High Nature Value farmlands' (HNVf) was devised. HNVf has subsequently been given high priority within the EU Rural Development Programme. This puts a requirement on each EU Member State not only to identify the extent and condition of HNVf within their borders but also to track trends in HNVf over time. However, the diversity of rural landscapes across the EU, the scarcity of (adequate) datasets on biodiversity, land cover and land use, and the lack of a common methodology for HNVf mapping currently represent obstacles to the implementation of the HNVf concept across Europe. This manuscript provides an overview of the characteristics of HNVf across Europe together with a description of the development of the HNVf concept. Current methodological approaches for the identification and mapping of HNVf across EU-27 and Switzerland are then reviewed, the main limitations of these approaches highlighted and recommendations made as to how the identification, mapping and reporting of HNVf state and trends across Europe can potentially be improved and harmonised. In particular, we propose a new framework that is built on the need for strategic HNVf monitoring based on a hierarchical, bottom-up structure of assessment units, coincident with the EU levels of political decision and devised indicators, and which is linked strongly to a collaborative European network that can provide the integration and exchange of data from different sources and scales under common standards. Such an approach is essential if the scale of the issues facing HNVf landscapes are to be identified and monitored properly at the European level. This would then allow relevant agri-environmental measures to be developed, implemented and evaluated at the scale(s) required to maintain the habitats and species of high nature conservation value that are intimately associated with those landscapes.

AB  - Monocotyledonous (C-4) plants, such as maize and sugarcane, have a central role in the economy and ecology of our planet. In many regions, the main food sources are based on C-4 crops. These crops are also major suppliers of raw materials used in the production of biofuel. Due to their increasing global demand, it becomes essential not only to monitor and analyse the effects of abiotic stress factors, such as limited water and nutrient supplies, on their productivity, but also to determine their ecological impact (e. g. related to their irrigation needs). Computer simulations, or in silico experiments, are being routinely employed in remote-sensing investigations aimed at these goals. Besides these applications, in silico experiments paired with measured data can also contribute to expand the existing knowledge about the biophysical mechanisms responsible for the remarkable tolerance of C-4 plants to adverse environmental conditions. In this article, we evaluate the applicability of a computer model (ABM-U) to the assessment of biophysical responses of C-4 plants in the visible (photosynthetic) domain when subjected to abiotic stress factors. Initially, we verify the accuracy of model readings obtained in this spectral domain. This verification is performed through quantitative and qualitative comparisons of modelled results with measured data. We then proceed to investigate apparently conflicting reflectance profiles resulting from experiments involving maize specimens under moderate water stress, which is usually associated with unfavourable climate changes. The results of our simulations indicate that ABM-U can reliably predict spectral signature variations caused by abiotic stress factors affecting the photosynthetic apparatus of these plants, which, in turn, have a direct impact on their agricultural yield. Furthermore, our in silico experiments suggest that the decrease in the amount of light reflected by (in vivo) water-stressed specimens may result from changes in the internal arrangement of the main components of their photosynthetic apparatus, namely the chloroplasts. We close the article with a discussion of putative physiological processes responsible for such changes.

AB  - Pollutant load reductions are often required to restore aquatic ecosystems experiencing eutrophication. Loads can be estimated using watershed models or data from monitoring stations, however data availability can limit the timeliness or comprehensiveness of the load estimates. We developed an approach to address this challenge that used watershed model results to estimate the proportion of annual nonpoint source nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and sediment (Sed) loads derived from unmonitored catchments. This proportion was multiplied by the nonpoint portion of United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimated annual river loads to account for annual variation in hydrologic conditions. Total loads were calculated as the sum of measured river loads, reported point sources from unmonitored areas and the estimated nonpoint source loads from unmonitored catchments. We applied this approach to the Chesapeake Bay because of its socio-economic and ecological importance. Median watershed loads for N, P and Sed were 140, 6.4 and 3030 Mg year(-1), respectively (1990-2004). Nonpoint source loads from the monitored areas constituted the greatest source of N, P and Sed (55, 47 and 74% respectively) to the Bay. The high N, P and Sed yield rates (7.3, 0.38 and 99 kg ha(-1) year(-1), respectively) from nonpoint loads originating from unmonitored areas near the Bay resulted in 25, 32 and 26% (N, P and Sed, respectively) of the Bay's total loads (excluding direct atmospheric deposition, shoreline erosion and oceanic inputs). Disproportionately high loads of P and Seds were associated with years that experienced elevated discharge whereas N loads were directly related to discharge. Error estimates indicated that our methods were most reliable for N (+/- 6%) but reasonable for P (+/- 22%) and provide an effective technique for the timely estimation of pollutant loads from watersheds with unmonitored catchments. Management strategies that decrease N deposition and reduce runoff to control P and Sed transport will effectively reduce pollutant loads. Published in 2010 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The Mar Menor is the largest coastal lagoon in the Western Mediterranean and it is an important site for wintering and breeding waterfowl. During recent decades several hydrological and land-use changes in the watershed have increasingly threatened the conservation of the lagoon due to the development of urban areas, tourism and agriculture. A dynamic system model has been developed at the watershed scale to estimate the annual load of nutrients reaching the Mar Menor-associated wetlands. At present, mean annual loadings of approximately 2000 tonnes of nitrogen and 60 tonnes of phosphorus are delivered to the lagoon. The simulation results emphasize the role of heavy rainfall events and floods in the formation of the total nutrient load. The composition of aquatic bird communities has been used to assess the nutrient impact on the lagoon food-web. The Great Crested Grebe is apparently the species most closely dependant on local trophic conditions. The related Black-necked Grebe, that dominates the waterbird plays a similar role, but its more opportunistic response to changes in food community of the lagoon resources, reduces its indicator value. The abundance of the two species of grebes seems to closely track the nitrogen load curve, especially during the first phase of enrichment, suggesting the existence of a direct trophic relationship. In the following phase, jellyfish blooms coincide with the bird decline. Jellyfishes seem to have a buffering effect towards nutrients, determining a bottom up limitation to other trophic compartments. In recent years, this buffering capacity has probably been overloaded, favouring the growth of new food resources available to the grebes. Unlike grebes, Mergus serrator, a typical piscivorous bird, does not seem to be affected positively by eutrophication since it shows a long-term stability in numbers or even a slight decline. Since this suspected decline would parallel a Iona-term reduction of fish catches, the species could be regarded as a potential indicator of habitat deterioration.

AB  - The integration of innovative equipment technologies in production processes offers efficiency potentials with regards to energy and resource demand as well as investment and operating costs. For the estimation of these potentials, a sufficiently detailed database is necessary as well as the possibility to consider particular boundary conditions of the production process, infrastructure of the production site, and the overall plant design. A structured concept for the selection of suitable equipment technologies and sizing rules for the design of the equipment for a desired process task are presented in this review. The combination with an appropriate modeling approach allows a holistic assessment of technically feasible solutions to quantify economic and ecological efficiency potentials of the equipment technologies. The application of this concept is demonstrated on the task of a typical heat transfer problem in the special chemicals sector.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the use of far infrared (FIR) heating for the surface decontamination of raw peanuts. We evaluated the reduction of natural microflora in terms of total mesophilic aerobic bacteria (TMAB) count which is an indicator of food hygiene. Depending on the treatment conditions, we obtained microbiologically sterile peanuts. We also analyzed the effects on the quality of various parameters (moisture content, colour, texture, peroxide value) of the FIR process. FIR heating not only significantly reduced the number of microorganisms, but also substantially protected the quality of the attributes. Our experimental study results suggest that continuous-system far infrared surface pasteurization equipment could be used commercially to reduce the microbial load of peanut samples immediately after harvest and to minimize the risk of post-harvest microbial growth during storage.

AB  - The aim of the work was the surface and the layers of corrosion products investigation in terms of structure and chemical composition of the amorphous magnesium alloys according to immersion time in chloride environment at 37 degrees C. The structure of the samples was analyzed by X-ray examinations. The study simulated conditions corresponding to human blood. During the tests the amount of evolved hydrogen was measured as an indicator describing the kinetics of the process. Testing solution and temperature (37 degrees C) were selected due to the possibility of use Mg-based bulk metallic glasses for resorbable medical implants. It was found that the concentration of zinc in Mg68Zn28Ca4 and Mg64Zn32Ca4 alloys has very important influence on the corrosion process, structure and chemical composition of the corrosion products in chloride environment.

AB  - Palynology (including mycology) is widely used in palaeoecological and bioarchaeological studies. Lake and mire sediments, soils, and the deposits accumulating in archaeological features, invariably contain plant and fungal remains, particularly pollen and spores. These serve as proxy indicators of ancient environmental conditions and events. Forensic palynology has been successfully employed in criminal investigations for more than two decades. In recent years, it has included fungal palynomorphs in profiling samples from crime scenes, and from exhibits obtained from suspects and victims. This contribution outlines the main features of palynology, and gives examples of case studies where fungal spores, pollen, and plant spores, have enhanced the interpretation of ancient landscapes and land-use, and provided pivotal intelligence, and probative evidence, in criminal investigations.

AB  - We report the electro deposition of In2S3 buffer layers for CuInS2 solar cells. All materials and deposition conditions were selected taking into account environmental, economic and technological aspects of a potential transfer to large volume industrial production. Different bath compositions and electro deposition parameters were studied. The obtained films exhibited complete substrate coverage, confirmed by SEM and XPS. In/S ratio close to 2/3 was obtained. XPS measurements detected the presence of indium hydroxide, transforming into oxide upon anneal at 200 degrees C. Maximum photoelectric conversion efficiency of 7.1% was obtained, limited mainly by a low fill factor (51%). Further process optimization is expected to lead to efficiencies comparable to US buffers. So far, open-circuit voltages as high as 660 mV were demonstrated. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to ask what role robustness plays in current medicine and in how far medical practices influence human robustness and thus the ability to be adapted and survive under changing conditions.
   Design/methodology/approach - In order to do this Bateson's concepts of learning and network pathologies are applied to the medical topic of immune reaction.
   Findings - Cur-rent medical research does not take sufficiently into account that natural stimuli and therapeutic interventions might lead to a large-scale of changes. This is mainly due to the lack of related epistemological tools.
   Practical implications - This lack leads to a restricted validity of many medical findings. There is even some evidence that the cur-rent therapeutic approach might lead to a decline of human robustness.
   Originality/value - This paper shows how systemic concepts can contribute to a deeper understanding of the therapeutic processes.

AB  - The authors propose new procedures for evaluating direct, indirect, and total effects in multilevel models when all relevant variables are measured at Level 1 and all effects are random. Formulas are provided for the mean and variance of the indirect and total effects and for the sampling variances of the average indirect and total effects. Simulations show that the estimates are unbiased under most conditions. Confidence intervals based on a normal approximation or a simulated sampling distribution perform well when the random effects are normally distributed but less so when they are nonnormally distributed. These methods are further developed to address hypotheses of moderated mediation in the multilevel context. An example demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of the proposed methods.

AB  - The current study was undertaken to consider predictive methods for describing the vigor of Reticuliterines flavipes (Kollar) termites stored in a laboratory under conditions similar to control groups in bioassay. These novel methods were based on measurements for levels of biological molecules (uric acid, soluble proteins, lipid, and glycogen), percent water content, live weight, and running speed. Also considered were two established, non-predictive methods for determining vigor, survivorship and consumption rate. Of the novel measures tested, lipid and body water percentage show promise in distinguishing weak from vigorous groups of termites, with body water percentage a more practical means of measurement. Low body water percentage was concluded to be an indicator of weak groups of termites. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The green chemistry revolution provides an enormous number of oppourtunities to discover and apply new synthetic approaches using alternative feedstocks; ecofriendly reaction conditions, energy minimizations and the design of less toxic and inherently safer chemicals. The origin and basis of green chemistry chart for achieving environmental and economic prosperity inherent in a sustainable world. One important element of sustainable chemistry is commonly defined as the chemical research aiming at the optimization of chemical processes and products with respect to energy and material consumption, inherent safety, toxicity, environmental degradability, and so on. While considerable progress has been made in environmental chemistry, green chemistry, and the environmental assessment of chemical products but the societal aspect of sustainable chemistry remains to be recognized fully in all branches of chemical research, one prerequisite for this is the inclusion of sustainable chemistry into chemical education from the very beginning.

AB  - The Serra do Tabuleiro, Santa Catarina, South Brazil, is one of the least disturbed areas of the southern Atlantic rainforest. The Serra do Tabuleiro is the third largest remnant left in pristine conditions of the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest. During the last years, rare and endangered species such as the Harpy Eagle (Harpya harpyja), the Ornate Hawk Eagle (Spizaetus ornatus), and the Black Hawk Eagle (Spizaetus tyrannus) were recorded in the region. Harpy Eagles have been recorded since 1962, including records in 1980 and 1989, which suggest that there may still exist a population in the slopes and gorges covered with Montane Atlantic Rain Forest and probably in other coastal mountains of Santa Catarina. Information on additional poorly known raptors is also given. The recent presence of Harpy Eagle urgently calls for an effective conservation action in the Serra do Tabuleiro region. Harpy Eagle is an indicator of a still intact ecosystem.

AB  - An environmental risk assessment for birds and mammals is an important part of any application package for potential registration of pesticides in Europe. A realistic estimation of the exposure of a certain species to the pesticide under field conditions is a refinement factor in long-term higher-tier risk assessments. Although guidance on how to collect specific exposure data is provided, there is not yet a harmonized view on how to use and assess existing and newly recorded field data. Exposure is defined as the portion of diet taken from a pesticide-treated crop field over time (the PT factor), and it is set equal to the time a (tracked) individual is active (= foraging) in the crop of concern at the crop growth stage relevant to the pesticide application being assessed. While the PT factor is set to 1 in a first tier, it can be refined in higher tiers. Differences in the methodologies influencing the robustness of a data set and intraindividual variance in PT data are currently not considered. Our study, based on data recording in accordance with the European Food Safety Authority's recommendations, shows this variance for different species in different crops for both breeding and nonbreeding periods, with tracking sessions showing both interindividual as well as intraindividual variation across several days. We discuss PT data quality and how it can be used, considering intraindividual variance in a manner that is protective and conforms to current European guidance. The present study intends to support the planned revision of the current European guidance on how to conduct environmental bird and mammal risk assessments, and its further purpose is to open constructive discussions about how and which kind of PT data can be used.

AB  - Synchrony defines an organism's overlap with potential resources and mates, essential for survival and reproduction. Flowering synchrony influences gene flow within species and patterns of interaction among plants and with other trophic levels, including pollinators. Climate-change driven shifts in plant phenology may disrupt plant-plant and plant-pollinator interactions, resulting in reshuffling of communities and altered ecosystem processes. We present a unique long-term metacommunity-wide study relating changes in flowering synchrony within and among species along an elevational gradient to changes in local climatic conditions. We apply a circular statistical method that estimates flowering phenology overlap between entire flowering distributions, overcoming limitations and biases of single indicators such as first and last flowering dates. We analyzed more than 300 000 flowering overlap estimates between 217 species in five plant communities across a 1267 m gradient over four decades (1984-2019) in the southwestern USA. We show that co-flowering synchrony significantly decreased in all plant communities, with a maximum of 28.1% of synchrony lost at the lowest elevations. Decreased synchrony was significantly negatively correlated with increasing temperatures recorded across the gradient. Reduced precipitation had locally-dependent effects and, in combination with warmer temperatures, accelerated the decrease in synchrony, especially at the lowest elevations. Flowering synchrony within plant species occurring in multiple communities increased between most community pairs, with a maximum increase of 30.5%, and at accelerated rates in recent years. The exception, likely associated with differences in topography, was a 5.6% decrease in synchrony between the two highest-elevation communities. Overall, increased synchrony within species occurring at multiple elevations indicates homogenization of flowering phenology across the gradient. These results show significant reshaping of flowering synchrony within and between plant communities in response to changing climate. Because plant phenology influences many ecological processes, such fundamental changes may have far-reaching and negative effects on ecosystem stability.

AB  - The increasing use of chemicals in the European Union (EU) has resulted in environmental emissions and wildlife exposures. For approving a chemical within the EU, producers need to conduct an environmental risk assessment, which typically relies on data generated under laboratory conditions without considering the ecological and landscape context. To address this gap and add information on emerging contaminants and chemical mixtures, we analysed 30 livers of white-tailed sea eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla) from northern Germany with high resolution-mass spectrometry coupled to liquid and gas chromatography for the identification of >2400 contaminants. We then modelled the influence of trophic position (delta N-15), habitat (delta N-13) and landscape on chemical residues and screened for persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) properties using an in silico model to unravel mismatches between predicted PBT properties and observed exposures. Despite having generally low PBT scores, most detected contaminants were medicinal products with oxfendazole and salicylamide being most frequent. Chemicals of the Stockholm Convention such as 4,4'-DDE and PCBs were present in all samples below toxicity thresholds. Among PFAS, especially PFOS showed elevated concentrations compared to other studies. In contrast, PFCA levels were low and increased with delta N-15, which indicated an increase with preying on piscivorous species. Among plant protection products, spiroxamine and simazine were frequently detected with increasing concentrations in agricultural landscapes. The in silico model has proven to be reliable for predicting PBT properties for most chemicals. However, chemical exposures in apex predators are complex and do not solely rely on intrinsic chemical properties but also on other factors such as ecology and landscape. We therefore recommend that ecological contexts, mixture toxicities, and chemical monitoring data should be more frequently considered in regulatory risk assessments, e.g. in a weight of evidence approach, to trigger risk management measures before adverse effects in individuals or populations start to manifest.

AB  - Is the system of norms comprising traditional, natural marriage-featuring formally enacted, irrevocable, exclusive man/woman sexual union preceded by chastity-essential for children's development and well-being, as Catholic teaching asserts? Review of an extensive body of diverse research finds that, compared to children continuously living with two parents, married parents, or their own biological parents, children in other family arrangements consistently experience lower emotional well-being, physical health, and academic achievement. Competing research has variously attributed this difference to a lack of married parents, two parents, complementary man/woman parents, or family stability, but these possibilities have not previously been studied in combination. To address this question, family structure differences and determinants of child well-being (reverse coded to show child distress) were examined using the 2008-2018 National Health Interview Surveys (n = 82,635). Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) for child emotional problems were higher with less than two parents (AOR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.27-1.56), unmarried parents (1.46, 95% CI 1.31-1.61), unstable parents (1.55, 95% CI 1.27-1.76), or less than two biological parents (AOR = 1.70, 95% CI 1.55-2.87 for one biological parent; 4.77, 95% CI 3.95-5.77 for no biological parents). When combined in the same model, only the lack of joint biological parentage accounted for higher distress, with outcomes significantly worse without the biological father than without the biological mother (interaction AOR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.04-1.71). This evidence strongly supports the claim that maximum child development occurs only in the persistent care of both of the child's own biological parents. Marriage benefits children primarily by ensuring such care. Implications are discussed.
   Summary: Children raised apart from the care of both natural parents consistently experience lower developmental outcomes. Traditional, religious marriage norms-a lifelong, exclusive sexual union between man and woman-benefit children by establishing strong conditions that promote such care. More than any other family arrangement, marriage assures to children the care of their own mom and dad.

AB  - Mass occurrence of green algae of the genus Ulva in the form of algal blooms (known as "green tides") is often associated with high concentrations of biogens in the water. Therefore, Ulva species are most often used in monitoring seawater trophy and far less frequently freshwater trophy. In Europe, the biomonitoring of river ecosystems is based on aquatic plants. According to the River Macrophyte Index (RMI), river populations of Ulva macroalgae (only tubular Enteromorpha-like Ulva) are considered good indicators for eutrophic waters. This paper analyses the legitimacy of using U. pilifera as a trophy indicator in the case of ponds. It has been noted that freshwater populations of U. pilifera are much more common in lakes, dammed reservoirs, or ponds than in rivers. In this study, analysed populations of U. pilifera originated from 14 ponds located in central Poland. Data analysis relied on the Carlson Trophic State Index (CTSI), which was compared with other known trophic indices. According to CTSI values, U. pilifera was most common in eutrophic ponds, where the mean concentrations of ammonium nitrogen, nitrates, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll a reached 581, 241, 212, and 20 mu g.L-1, respectively. The results indicate that U. pilifera can be considered a bioindicator for eutrophic waters (50-70 of CTSI). It would therefore be appropriate to introduce U. pilifera as part of biomonitoring conducted in small bodies of water. Major arguments in favour of practical application of U. pilifera are: (i) it is a large macroalga, the thalli of which can reach a length of > 1.0 m, (ii) it is an easy-to-identify species; even by non-experts (it is characterized by a distinctive tubular shape of the thallus), and (iii) it occurs in bulk in conditions of eutrophy, creating an easily observable bloom.

AB  - Paedomorphosis, a developmental heterochrony involving the retention of larval traits at the adult stage, is considered a major evolutionary process because it can generate phenotypic variation without requiring genetic modifications. Two main processes underlie paedomorphosis: neoteny, a slowdown of somatic development, and progenesis, a precocious maturation associated with body size reduction. Being essentially a truncation of ontogeny, progenesis has often been deemed an evolutionary dead end with advantages attributed to precocious reproduction or small body size required in specific environmental contexts (e.g. parasitism, interstitial life), but there is a lack of studies on the immediate ecological consequences of progenesis.
   Because body size is a key factor determining trophic ecology in animals, we hypothesized that progenesis might intrinsically promote ecological opportunity via body size reduction (i.e. 'the trophic advantage of progenesis' hypothesis). We tested this hypothesis in facultatively progenetic palmate newts Lissotriton helveticus using stable isotope niche modelling and diet reconstruction in conjunction with traditional stomach content analyses and body condition (BC) assessment.
   We show that not only did progenetic individuals occupy a different trophic niche than metamorphic individuals in all populations, but the smaller they were compared to metamorphs due to progenesis, the more different they were in terms of trophic ecology, with no negative effect on their BC.
   Altogether, the results suggest that via body size reduction, progenesis may generally act as an intrinsic factor of ecological opportunity, allowing the use of existing but previously unavailable resources, even in habitats where seemingly little opportunity exists. We argue that beyond the classically recognized fitness advantages of progenetic development, this process may also generally bring an immediate trophic advantage via body size reduction, which would have important implications to understand the evolution and adaptiveness of this process in many different taxa, from marine meiofauna to primates.

AB  - Management of public health in close correlation with food safety is a challenge nowadays, when human society is continually developing. Synthetic food additives are a compromise to natural food, having high toxicity on all viable organisms. Through their technology of synthesis, manufacturing and then discharging into the environment emerged imbalances in human health for short term, but at the same time, have resulted some serious environmental problems in the medium and long term. This requires careful management of these synthesis products. The aim of the present study was to determine toxic influence of two of the most commonly synthetic food dyes used in the food industry, tartrazine (E102) and carmoisine (E122), in some alive tissues from plants and filamentous fungi. This procedure can be used as a primary test method before testing on animals or humans organism. Thus, knowing how it reacts with the various biotic and abiotic structures in the environment, it creates an operational framework for the degradation of these compounds. At laboratory conditions, the test organisms species were Lepidium sativum, fast-growing plant and bio-indicator and Penicillium notatum fungus endowed with a complex enzyme capacity. Substance doses for toxicity testing were diluted by successive halving starting at 100% initial concentration and decreasing to 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, and 0% (distilled water), for each type of aqueous dye solutions, respectively. Quantification of toxic response was taking into account specific inhibition rate (I%) following the interaction between test substances and organisms. To determine specific inhibition (I%) the toxic response was transposed through some morpho-physiological parameters such as: germination rate (%), root length (mm), stem length (mm), vigor index for plants, and the inhibition zone on the fungal colonies (mm) in Petri dishes. The concentration-dependent inhibition on the organisms viability was noted at 24, 48 and 72 h of the exposure. In both cases, the results suggest that an inhibition of the optimum physiological parameters of living organisms was induced as the concentrations of the tested substances increase.

AB  - The biological control of fungal diseases through the use of genetically modified (GM) plants could decrease the input of chemical pesticides. To overcome possible losses in potato (Solanum tuberosum) yield because of susceptibility to soil fungal pathogens, researchers have developed potato transgenic lines expressing antifungal proteins. However, all GM crops must be monitored in their potentially detrimental effects on non-target soil microorganisms. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are good candidates for this type of analysis, as good indicators of a normal rhizosphere structure and functionality. In this work, we have monitored potato lines with over-expression of genes encoding peptides with antifungal properties on their effects on the soil-borne fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia solani and AM fungi.
   The six GM potato lines (AG-1, AG-3, RC-1, RC-5, AGRC-8 and AGRC-12) evaluated showed higher reduction in infection indexes in comparison to untransformed plants when challenged with a highly virulent strain of R. solani. The growth of RC-1, RC-5 and AGRC-12 lines remained almost unaltered by the pathogen; which evidenced the maximum inhibition of R. solani infection. The level of root colonization by the AM fungus Rizophagus intraradices (pure in vitro isolated) did not significantly differ between transgenic and wild potato lines under in vitro and microcosm conditions. An increase in mycorrhization was evident with the addition of potato biomass residues of these GM lines in comparison to the addition of residues of the wild type potato line.
   In addition to the R. intraradices assays, we performed microcosm assays with soil samples from sites with at least100-year history of potato crop as inoculum source.The roots of AGRC-12 GM line showed significant higher levels of native mycorrhization and arbuscules development. In general, the potato lines apparently were less receptive to R. intraradices pure inoculum than to AM species from the natural inoculum. In this work, the selected GM potato lines did not have evident adverse effects on AM fungal colonization.

AB  - Using metacommunity theory to understand the mechanisms shaping community structure is a promising framework that has been widely applied to ecological research. In lakes, the spatial pattern of phytoplankton assemblages depends on the relative importance of environmental conditions, spatial processes, and biotic interactions (e.g., grazing pressure), but the inclusion of the latter two factors was often overlooked. We tested how these three factors contributed to phytoplankton community composition in a shallow lake by separating the responses of taxonomic and trait compositions (i.e., nine species traits groups) of phytoplankton in Lake Changhu, China. Our results indicated that the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton assemblages in Lake Changhu are mainly determined by environmental factors (7.6 +/- 1.3%), followed by spatial processes (4.7 +/- 1.0%) and grazing pressure (2.9 +/- 0.5%). However, for the nine species traits groups, relative influences of environmental, spatial and grazing factors were trait specific, suggesting that different mechanisms were responsible for community composition supporting the potential advantages of using traits in water quality assessment. More specifically, some traits (e.g., large cell size and filamentous) may be excellent candidates for biomonitoring in lakes as they are predominantly driven by environmental factors (12.4% and 17.2% for large cell size and filamentous respectively), while other traits (e.g., unicellular and non-motile) are controlled largely by spatial processes or grazing and may not be suitable as bio-indicators. We also advocate inclusion of biotic factors (e.g., grazing pressure) in community studies, since we have found relatively weak but unneglectable effects of grazing on structuring phytoplankton community (2.9 +/- 0.5% for taxonomic composition while 3.1 +/- 4.1% for trait composition). In general, our findings suggest that a combination of metacommunity theory and the use of traits provide a useful framework for assessing driving factors structuring phytoplankton community in lakes, and such framework can be very useful for future lake bioassessment and management efforts.

AB  - Questions Has plant species richness in semi-natural grasslands changed over recent decades? Do the temporal trends of habitat specialists differ from those of habitat generalists? Has there been a homogenization of the grassland vegetation? Location Different regions in Germany and the UK. Methods We conducted a formal meta-analysis of re-survey vegetation studies of semi-natural grasslands. In total, 23 data sets were compiled, spanning up to 75 years between the surveys, including 13 data sets from wet grasslands, six from dry grasslands and four from other grassland types. Edaphic conditions were assessed using mean Ellenberg indicator values for soil moisture, nitrogen and pH. Changes in species richness and environmental variables were evaluated using response ratios. Results In most wet grasslands, total species richness declined over time, while habitat specialists almost completely vanished. The number of species losses increased with increasing time between the surveys and were associated with a strong decrease in soil moisture and higher soil nutrient contents. Wet grasslands in nature reserves showed no such changes or even opposite trends. In dry grasslands and other grassland types, total species richness did not consistently change, but the number or proportions of habitat specialists declined. There were also considerable changes in species composition, especially in wet grasslands that often have been converted into intensively managed, highly productive meadows or pastures. We did not find a general homogenization of the vegetation in any of the grassland types. Conclusions The results document the widespread deterioration of semi-natural grasslands, especially of those types that can easily be transformed to high production grasslands. The main causes for the loss of grassland specialists are changed management in combination with increased fertilization and nitrogen deposition. Dry grasslands are most resistant to change, but also show a long-term trend towards an increase in more mesotrophic species.

AB  - The secondary raw materials have been studied as sources of pectic substances necessary for the endo-ecological protection of the organism in the globally deteriorating living conditions of modern humans. The article reveals the significance and long-term benefits of such sources of pectic substances as fruit and seed coats, which are obtained in considerable quantities as a secondary raw material during the implementation of the technological process, and often do not find rational use. Research has been carried out on new prospective sources of pectin substances - secondary resources of processing soybean Glycine max (L.) Merrill, sainfoin Onobrychis arenaria, rapeseed Brassica napus L. oleifera, Sarepta mustard Brassica juncea (L.) Czern, and black mustard Brassica nigra (L.) W.D.J. Koch, castor bean Ricinus communis L., sunflower Helianthus annuus L. Fruit and seed coats of these plant species have been studied. The prospects of their secondary resources for pectin production have been shown. The assessment of the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the pectic substances of the objects under study, as well as their fractional composition and analytical indicators, make it possible to characterize the potential functional, technological and therapeutic properties of pectin preparations. It has been indicated that in the polyuronid component (fraction of galacturonic acid), all the studied samples of surface tissues of soybean, mustard, sainfoin, sunflower, one rape variety meet international requirements for food pectin (52.87-73.22%), and one of them, the pectin from seed coat of the Valenta variety, meets the requirements for pectins for medical purposes (75.83%). Pectic substances of soybean, mustard, castor bean varieties are characterized by a high degree of esterification (62.37-76.88%) in contrast to the varieties of sainfoin and sunflower (45.29-55.15%). According to the degree of esterification, rape varieties are close to low-esterified pecti. substances - 59.34-61.48%. The prospects of using seed and fruit membranes as an unconventional secondary plant raw material to improve the environmental performance of production and to obtain a valuable therapeutic-and-prophylactic food ingredient have been substantiated.

AB  - The novel eco-friendly algaecidal naphthoquinone derivate was used to control harmful algal bloom causing species Stephanodiscus and, its effect was assessed on other undesired and non-targeted microbial communities. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to investigate the effects of this novel algaecide on native microbial communities rearing in water collected from Nakdonggang River. Upon treatment of the mesocosm with the naphthoquinone derivate the concentration of Chl-a decreased from 20.4 mu g L-1 to 9.5 mu g L-1 after 2 days. The turbidity has also shown decrement (exhibited 15.5 NTU on the 7th day). The concentrations of DOC and phosphate in the treatment were slightly higher than those in the control due to the decomposition of dead Stephanodiscus, whereas the DO and pH in the treated condition were slightly lower than those in the control; which was due to increment of organic acids and higher degradation activity. Results showed that bacterial abundance were not significantly different but community composition were slightly different as revealed by NGS (Next generation sequencing). The variation in HNF (Heterotrophic nanoflagellates) revealed that the bacterial community composition changed following the change in bacterial abundance. During the treatment, the abundance of Stephanodiscus was significantly reduced by more than 80% after 6 days, and the abundance of ciliates and the dominant species, Halteria grandinella, had shown marked decline. The abundance of zooplankton sharply decreased to 5 ind. L-1 on the 8th day but increased again by the end of the study period. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index of phytoplankton, ciliates and zooplankton in the treated mesocosm increased significantly after 4, 7 and 8 days, respectively. The marked changes in the ecosystem structure were observed in treatment compare to control. However, the beneficial microalgal populations were not affected which indicated possibility of restoration of treated ecosystem and regain of healthy community structure after certain period.

AB  - Question: How does a management change from sheep grazing by traditional pastoral herding plus occasional mowing to free-ranging grazing in temporarily fenced areas affect vegetation in dry and wet semi-natural grassland communities?
   Location: Kosterbeck Nature Reserve, NE Germany.
   Methods: We analysed the change in floristic and functional diversity and composition based on a resurvey of a 23-yr-old phytosociological data set. At 10 yrs after the original survey, the grazing regime had changed as described above. Since the exact locations of plots of the original survey could not be reconstructed, we placed the resurvey plots stratified randomly within the respective community types. Functional composition in relation to the environment was analysed with the RLQ approach using community means of Ellenberg species indicator values as proxies for environmental conditions.
   Results: Although the grazing regime changed in the same direction in the whole area, the wet and dry grasslands responded differently: when the changes are analysed for the whole data set, they are hidden behind the differences between vegetation types, and neither plant species alpha-and gamma-diversity, nor species composition changes are apparent. However, when analysed separately, diversity changes were negligible for the wet meadow communities, whereas both alpha-and gamma-diversity increased in the drier sites, leaving beta-diversity unchanged. Despite the minor changes in species diversity in the wet grassland, functional composition changed considerably towards graminoid species. In the dry communities, an increase in species richness was accompanied by an increase in functional richness, and a trend towards competitive strategist species.
   Conclusion: Even minor changes in grazing regime can significantly affect grassland communities, while the effects may vary strongly between vegetation types and incoherently across different measures of change. This suggests that thorough analysis of vegetation developments after management changes should be carried out on different levels of data set integration and should include severalmeasures of change.

AB  - Semiarid regions are especially vulnerable to climate change and human-induced land-use changes and are of major importance in the context of necessary carbon sequestration and ongoing land degradation. Topsoil properties, such as soil carbon content, provide valuable indicators to these processes, and can be mapped using imaging spectroscopy (IS). In semiarid regions, this poses difficulties because models are needed that can cope with varying land surface and soil conditions, consider a partial vegetation coverage, and deal with usually low soil organic carbon (SOC) contents. We present an approach that aims at addressing these difficulties by using a combination of field and IS to map SOC in an extensively used semiarid ecosystem. In hyperspectral imagery of the HyMap sensor, the influence of nonsoil materials, i.e., vegetation, on the spectral signature of soil dominated image pixels was reduced and a residual soil signature was calculated. The proposed approach allowed this procedure up to a vegetation coverage of 40% clearly extending the mapping capability. SOC quantities are predicted by applying a spectral feature-based SOC prediction model to image data of residual soil spectra. With this approach, we could significantly increase the spatial extent for which SOC could be predicted with a minimal influence of a vegetation signal compared to previous approaches where the considered area was limited to a maximum of, e.g., 10% vegetation coverage. As a regional example, the approach was applied to a 320 km(2) area in the Albany Thicket Biome, South Africa, where land cover and land-use changes have occurred due to decades of unsustainable land management. In the generated maps, spatial SOC patterns were interpreted and linked to geomorphic features and land surface processes, i.e., areas of soil erosion. It was found that the chosen approach supported the extraction of soil-related spectral image information in the semiarid region with highly varying land cover. However, the quantitative prediction of SOC contents revealed a lack in absolute accuracy.

AB  - Southern forests are at the highest ozone (O-3) risk in Europe where ground-level O-3 is a pressing sanitary problem for ecosystem health. Exposure-based standards for protecting vegetation are not representative of actual field conditions. A biologically sound stomatal flux based standard has been proposed, although critical levels for protection still need to be validated. This innovative epidemiological assessment of forest responses to O-3 was carried out in 54 plots in Southeastern France and Northwestern Italy in 2012 and 2013. Three O-3 indices, namely the accumulated exposure AOT40, and the accumulated stomatal flux with and without an hourly threshold of uptake (POD1 and POD0) were compared. Stomatal O-3 fluxes were modeled (DO3SE) and correlated to measured forest response indicators, Le. crown defoliation, crown discoloration and visible foliar O-3 injury. Soil water content, a key variable affecting the severity of visible foliar O-3 injury, was included in DO3SE. Based on flux-effect relationships, we developed species-specific flux based critical levels (CLef) for forest protection against visible O-3 injury. For O-3 sensitive conifers, CLef of 19 mmol m(-2) for Pinus cembra (high O-3 sensitivity) and 32 mmol m(-2) Pious halepensis (moderate O-3 sensitivity) were calculated. For broadleaved species, we obtained a CLef 01 25 mmol m(-2) Fagus sylvatica (moderate O-3 sensitivity) and of 19 mmol m for Fraxinas excelsior (high 03 sensitivity). We showed that an assessment based on PODY and on real plant symptoms is more appropriated than the concentration-based method. Indeed, POD0 was better correlated with visible foliar 03 injury than AOT40, whereas AOT40 was better correlated with crown discoloration and defoliation (aspecific indicators). To avoid an underestimation of the real 03 uptake, we recommend the use of POD0 calculated for hours with a non-null global radiation over the 24-h O-3 accumulation window. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Conventional evolutionary and behavioral reasoning expects foragers to show strong spatial preferences in environments with heterogeneous resource distribution. Moreover, consumers should benefit from exploiting the information embedded in environmental features that indicate resource abundance. In desert soils seed abundance associates strong and reliably with vegetation and litter cover at small spatial scales. However, other spatially correlated factors (substrate complexity, temperature, predation risk) may affect foraging costs, benefits and decisions by ground-feeding granivores. We used a sequence of three semi-controlled field experiments of binary spatial choice within a portable aviary to identify the main cause of foraging microhabitat selection by the most abundant postdispersal granivorous bird in the central Monte desert (Argentina). In the first experiment we placed the aviary at field to offer pairs of adjacent microhabitats of unmodified, naturally-contrasting substrates and environmental conditions to single, untrained rufous-collared sparrows Zonotrichia capensis. Birds selected covered microhabitats in winter and summer, ruling out substrate complexity or thermoregulation as main single causes of patch selection. The other two experiments dissociated seed abundance, tree cover and litter to reveal their effects on patch selection. The results indicate that 1) sparrows do not restrict microhabitat exploration relying on environmental indicators, 2) distance to tree cover influences the order of patch exploration, probably in association with apprehension or risk-assessment behavior, and 3) patch exploitation is determined by short-term local estimation of seed abundance. The integration of these with previous results obtained under variable degrees of realism and experimental control allows for a better explanation of the spatial component of postdispersal granivory and its consequences on plants. The unconstrained selective foraging strategy of these sparrows would allow them to detect sporadic or ephemeral rich patches with structural characteristics indicating low-quality', should promote the spatial homogenization of the palatable seed bank, and would favor indirect interactions between plants.

AB  - Our knowledge on tree responses to drought is mainly based on short-term manipulation experiments which do not capture any possible long-term adjustments in this response. Therefore, historical water channels in inner-Alpine dry valleys were used as century-long irrigation experiments to investigate adjustments in tree growth to contrasting water supply. This involved quantifying the tree-ring growth of irrigated and non-irrigated (control) Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in Valais (Switzerland), as well as European larch (Larix decidua Mill.) and black pine (Pinus nigra Arnold) in Vinschgau (Italy). Furthermore, the adjustments in radial growth of Scots pine and European larch to an abrupt stop in irrigation were analyzed.
   Irrigation promoted the radial growth of all tree species investigated compared to the control: (1) directly through increased soil water availability, and (2) indirectly through increased soil nutrients and humus contents in the irrigated plots. Irrigation led to a full elimination of growth responses to climate for European larch and black pine, but not for Scots pine, which might become more sensitive to drought with increasing tree size in Valais. For the control trees, the response of the latewood increment to water availability in July/August has decreased in recent decades for all species, but increased in May for Scots pine only. The sudden irrigation stop caused a drop in radial growth to a lower level for Scots pine or similar level for larch compared to the control for up to ten years. However, both tree species were then able to adjust to the new conditions and subsequently grew with similar (Scots pine) or even higher growth rates(larch) than the control.
   To estimate the impact of climate change on future forest development, the duration of manipulation experiments should be on longer time scales in order to capture adjustment processes and feedback mechanisms of forest ecosystems. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Four trophic-level (TL)-based metrics-landings trophic spectra (LTS), landings proportions of TL categories (LP), landings mean TL (MTL), and fishing-in-balance index (FiB)-are used to describe Florida's coast-specific and statewide commercial, recreational, and combined marine fisheries and to examine whether "fishing down the marine food web'' (FDMFW) occurred during 1950-2007. Effects of environment-dependent species, large pelagic species, market and exploitation pressures, and revenue on these metrics are also examined. For the commercial and combined landings, analyses indicate (1) significant shifts of LTS from lower to higher TLs; (2) significant declines of LP for lower-TL species (2.0 <= TL < 3.0) and increases of LP for intermediate-TL animals (3.0 <= TL < 4.2; Gulf of Mexico coast and whole state) and top predators (TL >= 4.2; Atlantic coast and whole state); (3) significant increase of MTL; and (4) increase of FiB during the 1960s-1980s (expanding fisheries) and significant declines thereafter (fisheries contractions). Such metrics for the recreational landings vary without trends, and the commercial metrics drive the combined ones. Commercial and combined FiBs highlight the late 1970s-mid-1980s as a backward-bending period characterized by declines of commercial and combined landings along with increasing MTL. Base MTLs derived for all species (groups) do not reveal any FDMFW symptoms, and use of a cutoff TL of 3.25 and exclusion of large pelagic species do not alter combined FiB. The former process maintains the increasing trend of combined MTL on the Atlantic coast and leads to stability of Gulf coast and statewide combined MTL. The evolution of economic and regulatory conditions emerges as a key factor that influenced the changes in landings trophic structure. The fisheries contractions accompanied by the reduction in landings are incompatible with an increase in exvessel price rate and revenue. Contractions in the fisheries were likely due to reduction of fishing pressure, unaccounted discards, and closed areas and seasons, which themselves were rooted in management regulations.

AB  - On large, intensively engineered rivers like the Lower Missouri, the template of the physical habitat is determined by the nearly independent interaction of channel form and flow regime. We evaluated the interaction between flow and form by modeling four combinations of modem and historical channel form and modem and historical flow regimes. The analysis used shallow, slow water (shallow-water habitat, SWH, defined as depths between 0 and 1.5 in, and current velocities between 0 and 0.75 m/s) as an indicator of habitat that has been lost on many intensively engineered rivers and one that is thought to be especially important in rearing of young fishes. Two-dimensional hydrodynamic models for modem and historical channels of the Lower Missouri River at Hermann, Missouri, indicate substantial differences between the two channels in total availability and spatial characteristics of SWH. In the modem channel, SWH is maximized at extremely low flows and in overbank flows, whereas the historical channel had substantially more SWH at all discharges and SWH increased with increasing discharge. The historical channel form produced 3-7 times the SWH area of the modem channel regardless of flow regime. The effect of flow regime is evident in increased within-year SWH variability with the natural flow regime, including significant seasonal peaks of SWH associated with spring flooding. Comparison with other reaches along the Lower Missouri River indicates that a) channel form is the dominant control of the availability of habitat even in reaches where the hydrograph is more intensively altered, and b) rehabilitation projects that move toward the historical condition can be successful in increasing topographic diversity and thereby decreasing sensitivity of the availability of habitat to flow regime. The relative efficacy of managing flow and form in creating SWH is useful information toward achieving socially acceptable rehabilitation of the ecosystem in large river systems.

AB  - This study examined the environmental impact of different nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates in winter wheat production by using a new life cycle assessment (LCA) method, which was specifically tailored to crop production. The wheat production system studied was designed according to,"good agricultural practice". Information on crop yield response to different N rates was taken from a long-term field trial in the UK (Broadbalk Experiment, Rothamsted). The analysis considered the entire system, which was required to produce 1 ton of wheat grain. It included the extraction of raw materials (e.g. fossil fuels, minerals), the production and transportation of farming inputs (e.g. fertilizers) and all agricultural operations in the field (e.g. tillage, harvest). In a first step, all emissions and the consumption of resources connected to the different processes were listed in a Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) and related to a common unit, which is 1 ton of grain. Next a Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) was done, in which the inventory data are aggregated into indicators for environmental effects, which included resource depletion, land use, climate change, toxicity, acidification, and eutrophication. After normalization and weighting of the indicator values it was possible to calculate summarizing indicators for resource depletion and environmental impacts (EcoX). At N rates of 48, 96, 144 or 192 kg N/ha the environmental indicator "EcoX" showed similar values per ton,of grain (0.16-0.22 Ecox/ton of grain). At N rates of zero, 240 and 288 kg N/ha the EcoX values were 100-232% higher compared with the lowest figure at an N rate of 96 kg N/ha. At very low N rates, 'land use' was the key-environmental-factor, whereas at high N rates 'eutrophication' was the major problem. The results revealed that agronomical optimal arable farming does not necessarily come into conflict with economic and environmental boundary conditions. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved..

AB  - The quality and the quantity of organic carbon preserved in modem and ancient terrestrial sediments is the result of a complex interactions of sedimentological factors, such as in-situ productivity, allochtonous supply of organic matter, oxidation processes, biodegradation and sediment accumulation rates. The study aims at utilizing multidisciplinary information in order to characterize the palaeoenvironment in Westphalian fluvio-lacustrine deposits of the Lorraine Coal Basin (NE France). In this basin, the lack of outcrops is the major difficulty. To compensate for this problem, sedimentology, and molecular geochemistry are combined in order to significantly improve the palaeoenvironmental assessment of the area.
   Geochemical analyses and sedimentology have been carried out on several core samples of the Sauley drill hole to evaluate local palaeoenvironmental variability. The lithofacies associations in the Upper Carboniferous of the Lorraine basin suggest an alluvial plain environment without marine incursions. Sedimentological interpretations of the core, as well as comparison with sedimentological models, suggests the recognition of different depositional environments from braided and/or meandering rivers to swamp and lakes. The organic geochemistry is focussed on the recognition of aliphatic hydrocarbons and especially on molecular biomarkers, which provide valuable information about the original organic matter and the transformations that took place during sedimentation and diagenesis. In the Lorraine basin, the botanical variability is high and clearly related to the position of the vegetation communities in the fluvial system. The biomarkers. (e.g., diterpanes, steranes) show variations, which can be related to the diversity of this ecosystem. In this study, a reinterpretation of the environmental zonation in the sterane ternary diagram adapted to a fluvio-lacustrine sedimentology is proposed. The correlation between sedimentological and geochemical interpretation permits characterization of various depositional environments. A palacoenvironment model, relating sediment deposition conditions and organic matter characteristics is proposed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reichardt's E-T(30) as well as Kamlet-Taft's alpha (hydrogen-bond-donor acidity) and pi* (dipolarity/polarizability) values of various solid acids, e.g., silicas, aluminas, alumosilicates, titanium dioxides, and alumina-functionalized silica particles, are presented. The E-T(30) values of the solid acids were directly measured by UV/vis spectroscopy using 2,6-diphenyl-4-(2,4,6-triphenyl-1-pyridinio)phenolate (1a) and an eicosafluorine-. substituted derivative of 1a (1b) as surface polarity indicators. Kamlet-Taft's alpha and pi* parameters for the various solid acids are analyzed by means of Fe(phen)(2)(CN)(2) [cis-dicyano-bis(1,10-phenanthroline)iron(II)] (2) and Michler's ketone [4,4'-bis(N,N-dimethylamino)benzophenone (3) as solvatochromic surface polarity indicators. The chemical interpretation of the alpha and pi* parameters and the nature of the surface sites which they reflect are discussed. The correspondence of-the UV/vis spectroscopic results to those of the IR-sensitive probe benzophenone and the fluorescence probe pyrene (literature data) is also discussed. It is evident that the solid surface environments observed by the various indicators are moderately strong dipolar/polarizable (pi* = 0.38 to 1.04) and are fairly strong hydrogen-bond donors (alpha = 1.00 to 1.99). Theoretical E-T(30) values of solid acids are calculated by applying linear solvation energy (LSE) relationships using the independently measured alpha and pi* values of the solid acids according to E-T(30) = [E-T(30)](o) + a alpha + s pi*. The respective dependence of the alpha and pi* terms, expressed by the coefficients a and s, upon the measured ET(30) value for solid acids is discussed in comparison to related multiple LSE correlations known for well-behaved regular solvents and functionalized silicas. The results show in general that values of polarity parameters of strong HBD and dipolar surfaces are strongly influenced by the experimental conditions applied.

AB  - Aim Natural disturbances influence forest structure, successional dynamics and consequently, the distribution of species through time and space. We quantified the long-term impacts of natural disturbances on lichen species richness and composition in primary mountain forests, with a particular focus on the occurrence of endangered species. Location Ten primary mountain spruce forest stands across five mountain chains of the Western Carpathians, a European hotspot of biodiversity. Methods Living trees, snags and downed logs were surveyed for epiphytic and epixylic lichens in 57 plots. Using reconstructed disturbance history, we tested how lichen species richness and composition was affected by the current forest structure and disturbance regimes in the past 250 years. We also examined differences in community composition among discrete microhabitats. Results Dead standing trees as biological legacies of natural disturbances promoted lichen species richness and the occurrence of threatened species at the plot scale, suggesting improved growing conditions for rare and common lichens during the early stages of recovery post disturbance. However, high-severity disturbances compromised plot-scale species richness. Both species richness and the number of old-growth specialists increased with time since disturbance (i.e., long-term uninterrupted succession). No lichen species was strictly dependent on live trees as a habitat, but numerous species showed specificity to logs, standing objects or an admixture of tree species. Conclusions Lichen species richness was lower in regenerating, young and uniform plots compared with overmature and recently disturbed areas. Natural forest dynamics and its legacies are critical to the diversity and species composition of lichens. Spatio-temporal consequences of natural dynamics require a sufficient area of protected forests for provisioning continual habitat variability at the landscape scale. Ongoing climatic changes may further accentuate this necessity. Hence, we highlighted the need to protect the last remaining primary forests to ensure the survival of regionally unique species pools of lichens.

AB  - Environmental pollution is the unfavorable alteration of our environment, wholly or mainly as a by-product of human actions, by the direct or indirect effects of changes in energy patterns, radiation levels, the chemical and physical constitution, and the abundance of the organisms. Thus, the environment's pollution is one of the most severe problems humanity and other forms of life face today on our planet, and this population makes severe disruption. The xenobiotic substances responsible for this pollution are numerous and diverse due to multiple human activities that can be the source. However, attention mainly focuses on fertilizers, pesticides, heavy metals, and certain petrochemicals of significant consumption, such as solvents. The purpose of this study is to highlight the reprotoxic and hepatotoxic effects of Ethylene Glycol Monoethyl Ether (EGME) on male Wistar rats. Male Wistar rats were exposed to Ethylene Glycol Monomethyl Ether alone (EGME) (500 mg/kg), combined with the aqueous extract of the pollen grains of Sinapis arvensis (P-EGME) (300 mg/kg), in addition to the control (T) and positive control (P) groups for a period of 4 weeks by gavage, to estimate the protective role of this plant against the intoxication of EGME. The results show that EGME can induce reprotoxic effects revealed by a reduction in testes and epididymis mass accompanied by decreased male fertility indicators (sperm concentration). The results also show that treatment with EGME caused a reduction in the red blood cell number, hemoglobin and hematocrit rate, white blood cells in the treated groups compared to the control groups. The present study revealed that treatment with Ethylene Glycol Monoethyl Ether (EGME) under the same experimental conditions could affect several biological markers, especially male fertility. Besides, the protective activity of the wild mustard (Sinapis arvensis) pollen in the face of cellular oxidative damage induced by EGME. So, it is suggested that this pollen could be used as a cell protector.

AB  - In the context of climate change, Nature-Based Solutions (NBSs), a recently developed concept, are increasingly considered as part of the adaptation strategies of the cities. Studies using expert models and methods (EMM) receive a great deal of scientific attention. Considering EMM increasing use, this study aims to perform an analysis of the reported evaluation results, reflecting the capability of the EMM to accurately tackle urban challenges identified within the EU Nature4Cities project. Then, we propose a set of indicators and recommendations about sixteen EMM to be used by funders, researchers and practitioners when evaluating the performance of NBSs. The coupling of the different components (climate, water and soil) is not a simple matter. The analysis relies on the definition of the range of the reported metrics and on the investigation of the relationship between the various indices, applied for the EMM evaluation. Secondly, the study assesses the existing EMM, indicating the potential of NBSs: (i) to reduce urban heat island, (ii) to limit surface warming, (iii) to increase the thermal comfort of people, (iv) to limit the overheating and runoff of surfaces due to impervious areas, (v) to increase water retention during stormy episodes, (vi) to improve storm water quality at the outlet of the sustainable urban drainage systems, (vii) to promote the filtration and epuration of storm water runoff in soil and (viii) to be a support for vegetation. The analysis reveals that EMM can be considered as helpful tools for urban microclimate, urban soil and water management analysis, provided their limitations and characteristics are taken into account by the user when choosing tools and interpreting results (e.g. application scale). With regard to the performance of NBSs, the most commonly used indicators clearly depend on the scale of the project.

AB  - The environmental profile of electricity is changing rapidly, motivating a need for provider- and time-specific estimates for accurate environmental assessment. This work shows that defensible, provider- and time-specific emissions projections can be derived from two major factors: committed emissions from existing power plants and policy restrictions on future system characteristics. This letter introduces a bottom-up, power plant-based model that projects utility-specific annual average greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity of electricity in the U.S. state of California for 2018-2050, believed to be the first openly available GHG emissions model with utility-specific projections. California is a useful case study for testing in part because of its strict regulatory GHG targets and the complexity of its electricity system, including limited asset ownership by utilities and substantial reliance on imported electricity. This plant-based approach to emissions projections bounds uncertainty in a way that less infrastructurally grounded approaches cannot. For example, emissions from unspecified sources of power can be estimated based on available plants. Based on historical power plant lifetimes, existing policy, and default model assumptions, the CO(2)intensity of Californian electricity is projected to drop from 175 kg CO2/MWh (sales + losses, 2020) to 95 kg CO2/MWh by 2030, operationally decarbonizing by 2047. Upstream methane leakage increases GHG intensity of natural gas-fired power plants by about 30%, assuming a 100 year time horizon and national average estimates for leakage (which likely underestimate leakage for California). Although drivers like market conditions also affect future outcomes, California's current policy targets do not appear to require early retirement for utility generation assets, though up to about two gigawatts of extant in-state merchant capacity might be affected. Under current policy, new generating assets must either comply with the 100% clean electricity standard by 2045 or stop selling in California before the end of their expected useful life.

AB  - Global warming represents one of the most important threats to biodiversity. Because the functional traits of plants influence the performance of individuals under different environmental conditions, we aimed to describe the functional traits of the most frequent tree species found in the Brazilian Mixed Subtropical Forest. We also aimed to test whether functional traits could be used to predict the impact of climate change on the future distribution of tree species. For selected species, certain functional traits were described, namely, wood density, leaf size, specific leaf area, leaf renovation regime, dispersal syndrome, maximum potential height, fruit type, presence of seed dormancy, and the desiccation tolerance of seeds. The geographical distributions of the selected species were modeled using the Maximum Entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) as a function of climatic variation. To predict the impact of climatic changes by 2070 relative to current climate, the best and worst scenarios in relation to the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHG) were used. While the best scenario assumes a strong reduction in GHG anthropogenic emissions, turning negative by 2070, the worst scenario assumes a continuous increase in GHG anthropogenic emissions over time. The functional traits were ordinated by Principal Components Analysis to identify the ecological strategies of each species. The relationship between functional traits and changes to the area of climatic suitability of each species was evaluated using regression trees. Functional traits predicted changes to suitable climatic areas in the worst-case scenario only. The suitable climatic area of more leathery leaf species was predicted to decline by 41.0% on average, whereas that of more membranous leaf species was predicted to decline by 14.0%. In particular, Araucaria angustifolia, which is considered the most representative species of the Mixed Subtropical Forest of Brazil, had the highest sensitivity to climate change. Consequently, our results suggest that this important forest formation will be strongly impacted by climate and will be under severe risk in the future.

AB  - Aims This study aims to investigate the presence and spatial-seasonal variability of human and fish viruses in coastal marine systems using Ravenna's harbour area (Adriatic Sea, Italy) as a model. Methods and Results Human viruses (noroviruses and hepatitis A virus) and one of the most threatening finfish pathogens, the nervous necrosis virus (NNV), were investigated in mussels living inside and offshore Ravenna's harbour. Thirty-three and 36 center dot 7% of tested mussel samples resulted contaminated by human and fish viruses respectively. A different spatial-seasonal distribution was observed. Human viruses were detected mainly in inner port sites during colder months, while NNV was detected in both inside and offshore of Ravenna's harbour, mainly during warmer months. Conclusions The presence of human viruses in the inner port close to the city centre could be attributed to wastewaters carrying pathogens in the port environment and this arises public health concerns, however, the presence of these viruses limited to the canal port during the winter can greatly reduce the risk to human health. Regarding NNV, the accumulation and release of viable virus by mussels, could represent a viral source for susceptible finfish. These findings reflect the different epidemiological features of these infections and indicate the importance to choose the correct indicator to monitor viral contaminations. Significance and Impact of the Study The high frequency of viral contamination pointed out in the study stresses the imperative to monitor the viral presence in all coastal habitats where the high natural value meets several recreational and commercial activities such as the Ravenna's harbour area. Particularly, this study could represent a novel starting point for the development of a more structured bio-monitoring program, in order to ensure improved environmental management and safety of coastal areas.

AB  - Tetrazoles have wide industrial applications, notably in the pharmaceutical industry. Tetrazole derivatives such as bis(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)amine (H(2)BTA) have recently been considered by the defense industry as high nitrogen composite propellants. Photodegradation studies under solar simulating conditions showed that H(2)BTA was partially degraded in water, while it was completely degraded under UV light at 254 nm. When H(2)BTA (0.35 mM) was irradiated with simulated sunlight at pH 3.65, there was a 1-day lag phase before the chemical started to degrade, reaching 43.5% degradation after 7 d. However, when pH increased to 5.76, it degraded without lag phase, suggesting that an HBTA(-) anion was involved in the initial degradation of the chemical. 5-Aminotetrazole (5-AT) was identified as a final degradation product and N-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)formamide(T(5 yl)FA) and 1H-tetrazol-5-ylcarbamic acid (T(5 yl)CA) as intermediate products. At lambda = 254 nm, H(2)BTA disappeared rapidly, resulting in the loss of 94% after 65 min. 5-AT was detected together with several transient products including N-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)carbamohydrazonic acid (T(5 yl)CHA) and T(5 yl)FA. Kinetic studies and products analysis revealed that H2BTA photodegraded via two initial routes. One route (a) marked by the initial loss of HN3 and another (b) marked by the initial loss of N-2. Route a) was characteristics for irradiation with simulated sunlight; however, routes a) and b) proceeded simultaneously under UV light. 5-AT eventually degraded to presumably give N-2 and/or HN3 under UV light. Understanding the photodegradation pathway of H(2)BTA under simulated sunlight can help in providing the basis for natural attenuation assessment of the chemical in contaminated aquatic environments.

AB  - Seagrasses are marine angiosperms that form extensive submarine meadows in the photic zone where carbonate producing biota dwell as epiphytes on the leaves or as infaunal forms, and act as prolific carbonate sediment factories. Because seagrasses have a low preservation potential and records of exceptionally well-preserved and plant material from marine settings are rare, these palaeoenvironments are difficult to identify in the rock record. Consequently, sedimentological and palaeontological proxies are the main indicators of the presence of seagrass-dominated ecosystems. This work investigates the skeletal assemblage of Modern (Maldivian and western Mediterranean) and fossil (Eocene; Apula and Oman carbonate platforms and Oligocene; Malta platform) seagrass examples to characterize the skeletal assemblage of modern and fossil seagrasses. Two main types of grains, calcareous algae and foraminifera, constitute around 50% of the bioclastic sediment in both tropical Maldivian and temperate Mediterranean scenarios. However, in the tropical setting they are represented by green algae (Halimeda), while in the Mediterranean they are represented by corallinacean red algae. In contrast, in the Eocene examples, the foraminifera are the most conspicuous group and the green algae are also abundant. The opposite occurs in the Maltese Chattian, which is dominated by coralline algae (mean 42%), although the foraminifera are still abundant. It is suggested to use the term foralgal to identify the seagrass skeletal assemblage. To discriminate between red algae and green algae dominance, the introduction of the prefixes 'GA' (green algae) and 'RA' (red algae) is proposed. The investigated examples provide evidence that the green algae-foralgal assemblage is typical of tropical, not excessively dense seagrass meadows, characterized by a well-illuminated substrate to support the development and calcification of the Halimeda thallus. Contrarily, the red algae-foralgal assemblage is typical of high density tropical to subtropical seagrass meadows which create very dense oligophotic conditions on the sea floor or in temperate settings where Halimeda cannot calcify.

AB  - The invasive emerald ash borer beetle (Agrilus planipennis, EAB) has caused significant ash tree (Fraxinus spp.) mortality and cascading forest changes in the United States. We quantitatively estimated the viability of a local green ash tree (F. pennsylvanica) population to evaluate the magnitude of change caused by EAB. We developed historic and worst case stochastic stage based population scenarios to model changes in viability for a natural stand of green ash trees. Historic parameters were based on the literature, and worst case parameters were based on field data and the literature during dates that reflect time periods before and after EAB impacted the focal population in Northwest Ohio. The worst case scenario assumed that parameters remained the same as the initial LAB attack, when many of the adult trees died after a few years. The ash annual population growth rates were estimated as 0.99 and0.76, respectively, in historic versus worst case scenarios. The historic scenario had a population trajectory that dipped slightly at first and then reduced slowly over time. This was not unexpected since we included stochasticity in plant survival and reproduction, but it showed that the model may not account for ecological variation that stabilizes ash tree populations in forests under favorable conditions. In the worst case scenario ash populations became locally extinct within 34 years, and changes in the population growth rate were more sensitive to changes in the survival of the < 1 cm diameter at breast height stage class. Caution is warranted given the high variability and stochasticity within the system, and the trajectory can change if post-LAB population dynamics differ from initial EAB invasion dynamics or if human intervention occurs. The use of PVA allows us to quickly identify factors that influence the population viability of species, allowing for the development of strategies that prevent further species endangerment.

AB  - Background: Pediatric hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) has generally been found to be associated with climate. However, knowledge about how this association varies spatiotemporally is very limited, especially when considering the influence of local socioeconomic conditions. This study aims to identify multi-sourced HFMD environmental factors and further quantify the spatiotemporal nonstationary effects of various climate factors on HFMD occurrence.
   Methods: We propose an innovative method, named spatiotemporally varying coefficients (STVC) model, under the Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework, for exploring both spatial and temporal nonstationary effects in climate covariates, after controlling for socioeconomic effects. We use data of monthly county-level HFMD occurrence and data of related climate and socioeconomic variables in Sichuan. China from 2009 to 2011 for our experiments.
   Results: Cross-validation experiments showed that the STVC model achieved the best average prediction accuracy (81.98%), compared with ordinary (6827%), temporal (72.34%), spatial (75.99%) and spatiotemporal (77.60%) ecological models. The STVC model also outperformed these models in the Bayesian model evaluation. In this study, the STVC model was able to spatialize the risk indicator odds ratio (OR) into local ORs to represent spatial and temporal varying disease-climate relationships. We detected local temporal nonlinear seasonal trends and spatial hot spots for both disease occurrence and disease-climate associations over 36 months in Sichuan. China. Among the six representative climate variables, temperature (OR = 259), relative humidity (OR = 1.35), and wind speed (OR = 0.65) were not only overall related to the increase of HFMD occurrence, but also demonstrated spatiotemporal variations in their local associations with HFMD.
   Conclusion: Our findings show that county-level HFMD interventions may need to consider varying local-scale spatial and temporal disease-climate relationships. Our proposed Bayesian STVC model can capture spatiotemporal nonstationary exposure-response relationships for detailed exposure assessments and advanced risk mapping, and offers new insights to broader environmental science and spatial statistics.

AB  - Stable carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13) in tree rings have been increasingly used as indicators of climatic and ecological processes. However, compared to inter-annual delta C-13 variability, the factors related to inter-tree and -site variability (i.e., dendroclimatic noise) have attracted less attention. Here we present a statistical study quantifying the inter-tree and -site variability in a tree-ring delta C-13 dataset in the context of biogeographical, climatic, and forestry variables. This dataset originates from sixty-seven Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees growing in seven sites in the north boreal forests and near the subarctic timberline in Finnish Lapland. Using estimates from a linear mixed model, we identified a set of three constraints, possibly behind the inter-tree and -site delta C-13 variations. First, a latitudinal constraint was found with more negative delta C-13 values in colder (timberline) conditions, in comparison to trees in south of timberline. Second, a longitudinal constraint appeared to result in more negative delta C-13 levels in the eastern sites. Third, an altitudinal constraint led to less negative delta C-13 levels at higher altitudes. Additional source of inter-tree and -site delta C-13 variations attributable to tree size variables resulted in less negative delta C-13 values in taller trees with larger crowns. As the tree size and age are closely connected in our data, these results supported earlier findings that Pinus delta C-13 data may exhibit age-related changes. These results were consistent with mechanistic links between environmental drivers and carbon isotope fractionation. The extent of inter-tree and -site variability affected the length of confidence intervals around the mean delta C-13 value. The use of statistical power analyses was highlighted for assessing the required sample size to estimate the mean value.

AB  - Lake ecosystems, on the one hand, are affected by tourism, and on the other by development for tourism. Lake ecosystem services include: water with its self-cleaning processes, air with climate control processes, as well as flora and fauna. Utilisation of services leads to interventions in the structure of ecosystems and their processes. Only to a certain extent, this is specific to each type of environmental interference, remains within the limits of ecosystem resilience and does not lead to its degradation. One of the threats is bacteriological contamination, for which the most reliable sanitation indicator is Escherichia coli. In lake water quality studies it is assumed that the lakeshore cannot be a source of bacteria. It has been hypothesised that the problem of bacterial contamination can be serious for the places that do not have any infrastructure, especially sanitation. Consequently, the purpose of the study was to determine the extent to which lakeshore sanitation, in particular the level of bacteriological contamination, has an impact on the value of services provided by the selected lake ecosystems (Lake Trzesiecko and Lake Wielimie - Szczecinek Lake District). Five selected services related to lake ecosystems are: water, control over the spread of contagious diseases, aesthetic values, tourism and recreation, as well as the hydrological cycle with its self-cleaning function. Services, as well as the criteria adopted for evaluation, allow us to conclude that the services provided by the lake ecosystems are suitable to fulfill a recreation function. However, the inclusion of quality criteria for sanitary status has shown that the value of system services has dropped by as much as 50%. Value changes are visible primarily for water and aesthetic qualities. Such a significant decrease in the value of services clearly indicates the importance of the sanitary conditions of lakes and their appropriate infrastructure. In view of the valuation proposals, there is a problem of uncertainty of valuation of ecosystem services.

AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) blowout from a wellbore is regarded as a potential environment risk of a CO2 capture and storage (CCS) project. In this paper, an assumed blowout of a wellbore was examined for China's Shenhua CCS demonstration project. The significant factors that influenced the diffusion of CO2 were identified by using a response surface method with the Box-Behnken experiment design. The numerical simulations showed that the mass emission rate of CO2 from the source and the ambient wind speed have significant influence on the area of interest (the area of high CO2 concentration above 30,000 ppm). There is a strong positive correlation between the mass emission rate and the area of interest, but there is a strong negative correlation between the ambient wind speed and the area of interest. Several other variables have very little influence on the area of interest, e.g., the temperature of CO2, ambient temperature, relative humidity, and stability class values. Due to the weather conditions at the Shenhua CCS demonstration site at the time of the modeled CO2 blowout, the largest diffusion distance of CO2 in the downwind direction did not exceed 200 m along the centerline. When the ambient wind speed is in the range of 0.12.0 m/s and the mass emission rate is in the range of 60120 kg/s, the range of the diffusion of CO2 is at the most dangerous level (i.e., almost all Grade Four marks in the risk matrix). Therefore, if the injection of CO2 takes place in a region that has relatively low perennial wind speed, special attention should be paid to the formulation of pre-planned, emergency measures in case there is a leakage accident. The proposed risk matrix that classifies and grades blowout risks can be used as a reference for the development of appropriate regulations. This work may offer some indicators in developing risk profiles and emergency responses for CO2 blowouts.

AB  - Sulphate-rich wastewaters can be generated due to (i) use of saline water as secondary-quality water for sanitation in urban environments (e.g. toilet flushing), (ii) discharge of industrial effluents, (iii) sea and brackish water infiltration into the sewage and (iv) use of chemicals, which contain sulphate, in drinking water production. In the presence of an electron donor and absence of oxygen or nitrate, sulphate can be reduced to sulphide. Sulphide can inhibit microbial processes in biological wastewater treatment systems. The objective of the present study was to assess the effects of sulphide concentration on the anaerobic and aerobic physiology of polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs). For this purpose, a PAO culture, dominated by Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis clade I (PAO I), was enriched in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) fed with acetate and propionate. To assess the direct inhibition effects and their reversibility, a series of batch activity tests were conducted during and after the exposure of a PAO I culture to different sulphide concentrations. Sulphide affected each physiological process of PAO I in a different manner. At 189 mg TS-S/L, volatile fatty acid uptake was 55% slower and the phosphate release due to anaerobic maintenance increased from 8 to 18 mg PO4-P/g VSS/h. Up to 8 mg H2S-S/L, the decrease in aerobic phosphorus uptake rate was reversible (Ic(60)). At higher concentrations of sulphide, potassium (> 16 mg H2S-S/L) and phosphate (> 36 mg H2S-S/L) were released under aerobic conditions. Ammonia uptake, an indicator of microbial growth, was not observed at any sulphide concentration. This study provides new insights into the potential failure of enhanced biological phosphorus removal sewage plants receiving sulphate- or sulphide-rich wastewaters when sulphide concentrations exceed 8 mg H2S-S/L, as PAO I could be potentially inhibited.

AB  - Soil arthropods are an important component of agroecosystems, contributing significantly to their biodiversity and functioning. However, seasonal patterns, population dynamics, and significant roles of these soil arthropods in improvement of soil structures and functions are influenced by many factors. The objective of the current study was to investigate soil arthropod abundance in relation to a blend of meteorological and edaphic factors and to find out the difference in abundance among various crops (sugarcane, cotton, wheat, alfalfa fodder, and citrus orchards). The arthropod sampling was done by pitfall traps and Tullgren extractions on fortnightly intervals. Soil temperature and relative humidity were noted on the field sites while analysis for soil pH, organic matter, and soil moisture contents were done in the laboratory. The rainfall data was obtained from an observatory. Results showed that significant differences were found in soil arthropod abundance across different sampling months and crops. Out of total 13,673 soil arthropods sampled, 38 % belonged to Collembola, followed by 15 % Hymenoptera, 15 % Acarina, 11 % Myriapods, 6 % Coleoptera, 5 % Orthoptera, and 5 % Araneae. Mean abundance per sample was highest in summer months as compared to winter. Overall abundance per sample was significantly different between all crops (p<0.05). Cluster analysis revealed four categories of soil arthropods according to abundance, i.e., highly abundant (Collembola, Acarina, Myripoda, Hymenoptera), moderately abundant (Orthoptera, Aranae, Coleoptera), least abundant (Dermaptera, Hemiptera, Diptera), and rare (Blattaria, Isoptera, Diplura, Lepidoptera). Soil temperature and soil organic matter showed significant positive correlation with abundance, while relative humidity was significantly negatively correlated. Soil moisture and soil pH showed no significant correlations while no correlation was found with total rainfall. PCA analysis revealed that soil surface arthropods were the major contributors of variation in overall abundance in extreme temperature months while microarthropods in low-temperature months. CCA analysis revealed the occurrence of different arthropod groups in correspondence with different abiotic variables. Results are discussed in view of position of these arthropods as useful indicators under changing environmental conditions impacting agroecosystems in the study area.

AB  - The aim of this research was to define the effect of the construction and renovation of a highway bypass around the town of Skepe on the environment and assemblages of carabid beetles. This four-year study was based on catching samples of beetles using pitfall traps. The traps were set first in 2008 and later from 2010 to 2012, after the renovation of the road, along roadside verges adjacent to two ca. 100-year-old pine forest stands, wet habitats and fallows of arable fields and inside these habitats about 25 m from the road (control plots). The carabids collected were identified to species and numbers of individuals and dominance values of each of the species were calculated for each study plot and each year. Furthermore, the dominance of the different species of plants was assessed. Numbers of species, numbers of individuals, percentage share of forest species and individuals, and Shannon diversity values of the carabid assemblages were analyzed. Multivariate statistical analyses (ordinations) were carried out using the dominance of the different species of carabids and using the ecological indicator values of plants as environmental factors. The construction of the bypass in 1987 resulted in more diversified carabid assemblages along the roadsides. Carabid fauna along the roadsides differed from that in the control plots in forests and in terms of some parameters from the control plots in wet habitats, but not statistical from the control plots in the fallow areas of arable fields. The renovation of the road 22 years after construction did not result in any significant changes in the characteristic parameters of the carabid assemblages along the roadsides, but gradient analysis indicated that it did have an effect. In terms of the environmental conditions of the habitats based on the plant associations occurring there the roadside habitats differed from the control plots in forests and wetlands. Since the number of sites studied is rather low, the results of this study have to be considered to be preliminary, but may provide research hypotheses for further research on highway roadsides.

AB  - Plant-soil feedbacks are important to productivity and plant community dynamics in both natural and managed ecosystems. Among soil bacteria, the Streptomyces possess particularly strong antagonistic activities and inhibit diverse plant pathogens, offering a clear pathway to involvement in plant-soil feedbacks. We hypothesized that feedback effects and the ability of individual host plant species to foster antagonistic Streptomyces populations may be modified by the richness of the surrounding plant community. To test this, we collected soil associated with four different plant species (two C4 grasses: Andropogon gerardii, Schizachyrium scoparium; and two legumes: Lespedeza capitata, Lupinus perennis), grown in communities that spanned a gradient of plant species richness (1, 4, 8, 16, or 32 species). For each of these soils, we characterized the potential of soil Streptomyces to antagonize plant pathogens, using an in vitro plate assay with indicator strains to reveal inhibition. We cultivated each plant species in each conditioned soil to assess feedback effects on subsequent plant growth performance. Surrounding plant richness modified the impacts of particular plant species on Streptomyces antagonistic activity; A. gerardii supported a higher proportion of antagonistic Streptomyces when grown in monoculture than when grown in 32-spp plant communities, and L. capitata supported more strongly antagonistic Streptomyces when grown in 4- or 32-spp plant communities than in 8-spp plant communities. Similarly, the feedback effects of particular plant species sometimes varied with surrounding plant richness; aboveground biomass production varied with plant species richness for A. gerardii in L. perennis-trained soil, for L. capitata in A. gerardii-trained soil, and for L. perennis in L. capitata-trained soil. Streptomyces antagonist density increased with overall Streptomyces density under low but not under high plant richness, suggesting that plant diversity modifies selection for antagonistic phenotypes among soil Streptomyces. This work highlights the complexity of feedback dynamics among plant species, and of plant-microbiome interactions in soil. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Numerous investigations on the quaternary depositions of natural calcareous sediments and their use for soil conditioning have been carried-out in the Baltic region. Locally sourced freshwater limestone were formerly introduced (1950s) for soil liming, due to the absence or limited availability of appropriate industrial materials. Nowadays, with a greater awareness and understanding of the CO2 issues surrounding the production of industrial lime (intensively heated during manufacture), together with increasing costs of its production and transport, attention has returned to previous approaches. The main aim of this study was the identification of geological distribution peculiarities of freshwater limestone depositions, spatial and vertical geochemical variation and modelling of their previous agricultural use in acid soils regions. Geochemical composition data of local lake limestone has been lacking in Lithuania. Studies reveal that the quality parameters of sediments mostly align with the minimum for standard lime requirements (EN ISO 12945:2008), but materials are geochemically diverse even between layers of the same deposit. Tests show calcareous materials are especially rich in total manganese (3500 ppm) and slightly lower was total barium concentrations (490 ppm). Just a few mg kg(-1) less were total concentrations of silver, boron, cobalt, chromium, copper, gallium, nickel, lead and vanadium. Former use of these sediments for liming purposes with regard to the national hygiene norm (HN 60:2004) controlled elements disclaim direct risks of soil pollution by higher heavy metals and rare elements accumulation. Previous liming studies indicate natural limes offer slow acting degradability compared to industrial products (dust limestone) and longer lasting liming effect. However, heavy metals and rare elements applied to soils are locked in topsoil (diffusion is mainly limited to depth of soil tillage). Unfortunately, cessation of liming and accelerated soil acidification promotes increased element mobility, which raises the risk of higher accumulations in crops, and their transfer to the food chain and/or their transport to groundwater.

AB  - The spatial and temporal distribution and diversity of sediment-dwelling foraminifera are reasonably well known, but encrusting (hard-substrate dwelling) foraminifera are little studied. Encrusting foraminifera are common in the world's oceans, attached to floating debris or marine animals in the water column to living on rocks, sand grains and organisms in benthic environments from shallow to deep marine regions. With projected ocean acidification and warming conditions, these important calcifying protists that comprise beaches, buffer sediments, and contribute to complex food webs are potentially in peril.
   Results indicate that calcifying foraminifera were the first to colonize experimental molluscan substrates within the first year in shallow habitats, with colonization offshore in subsequent years. Agglutinated foraminifera become more common after one year. Species richness (alpha diversity) remained relatively similar throughout the study, but species turnover (beta diversity) was greatest within the first year and between the shelf/slope break and deeper water, following the thermocline and photic zone regions. The equivalent of the Shannon Entropy Index provided important information on beta diversity and community structure.
   Paleobathymetric distributions can be resolved after six years into four distinct foraminiferal distributional zones: shallow shelf (15 m), outer shelf (33 m), shelf/slope break (73-88 m), and slope depths (>213 m to 267 m). Some encrusting foraminifera are invasive, settling in high numbers within the first year, and increasing their abundance through the duration of the experiment. A foraminiferan, Discorbis bentheloti, was discovered to bioerode carbonate, and is a potentially excellent paleobathymetric indicator for 15-33 m depths. Results differ from previously reported pioneer and climax foraminiferal communities documented for Caribbean coral reefs, because long-term experiments reveal the spatial and temporal development and distribution of carbonate-producing encrusting foraminifera in these climatically-sensitive regions.

AB  - Flood-pulsing is a key environmental factor that structures biotic communities in large-order river systems, but we focused our study on the effects of flood-pulsing in headwater systems. We used 10 mesocosm wetlands (10 m X 20 m) to test 2 treatments: a flood-pulse regimen in which natural flood events caused water levels to fluctuate and a static regimen in which water levels remained artificially stable. Abiotic characteristics, plants, and aquatic invertebrate communities were monitored from 2002 through 2005 in permanent pools, nonflooded banks in static wetlands, and intermittently flooded banks in flood-pulse wetlands. The flood-pulse treatment had minimal effects on environmental conditions of permanent pools, and submersed plant and aquatic invertebrate communities in permanent pools were similar in both treatments. This result suggested that resource subsidies from the floodplain to the pools were minimal. However, flood-pulsing caused observable changes to plant communities in the intermittently flooded zone (IFZ) above the permanently flooded pool. Overall plant diversity was higher in static wetlands, and % bare ground was higher in flood-pulse wetlands, results suggesting that the short, stochastic floods were a strong environmental stressor. In flood-pulse wetlands, the fluctuating water levels may have reduced the proportion of introduced, weedy, and upland plant taxa. Flood-pulse and static wetlands had distinctly different plant assemblage compositions, indicating that the abiotic stressors caused pronounced changes in the floodplain community. An indicator species analysis showed that taxa classified as obligate wetland plants were indicators in flood-pulse wetlands (e.g., Juncus canadensis, Ludwigia palustris, Dulichium arundinaceum, Eleocharis obtusa, Carex crinita, Carex lupulina, Carex vulpinoidea), but taxa classified as facultative wetland or upland plants were indicators of static wetlands (Cirsium arvense, Eupatoriadelphus maculatus, Plantago lanceolata, Bidens frondosus, Melilotus officinalis, Mentha arvensis, Daucus carota, Poa palustris). Many functional categories of plant species that were common in flood-pulse wetlands (e.g., obligate wetland plants, perennial, native and nonweedy species) are considered beneficial from a management perspective.

AB  - The widespread use of ecological network models (e.g., Ecopath, Econetwrk, and related energy budget models) has been laudable for several reasons, chief of which is providing an easy-to-use set of modeling tools that can present an ecosystem context for improved understanding and management of living marine resources (LMR). Yet the ease-of-use of these models has led to two challenges. First, the veritable explosion of the use and application of these network models has resulted in recognition that the content and use of such models has spanned a range of quality. Second, as these models and their application have become more widespread, they are increasingly being used in a LMR management context. Thus review panels and other evaluators of these models would benefit from a set of rigorous and standard criteria from which the basis for all network models and related applications for any given system (i.e., the initial, static energy budget) can be evaluated. To this end, as one suggestion for improving network models in general, here I propose a series of pre-balance (PREBAL) diagnostics. These PREBAL diagnostics can be done, now, in simple spreadsheets before any balancing or tuning is executed. Examples of these PREBAL diagnostics include biomasses, biomass ratios, vital rates, vital rate ratios, total production, and total removals (and slopes thereof) across the taxa and trophic levels in any given energy budget. I assert that there are some general ecological and fishery principles that can be used in conjunction with PREBAL diagnostics to identify issues of model structure and data quality before balancing and dynamic applications are executed. I humbly present this PREBAL information as a simple yet general approach that could be easily implemented, could be considered for further incorporation into these model packages, and as such would ultimately result in a straightforward way to evaluate (and perhaps identify areas for improving) initial conditions in food web modeling efforts.

AB  - The optimal acceptance threshold model predicts that kin/nestmate discrimination is context dependent and that, in a fluctuating environment, the action component of nestmate discrimination is plastic, rather than static. We examined changes in intraspecific aggression among colonies of Argentine ants, Linepithema humile, in various discrimination contexts, and found that aggression occurred at higher rates when either nestmates or familiar territory indicated nest proximity, but not when social context was absent, thereby providing additional support for the optimal acceptance threshold model. Context-dependent aggression in the Argentine ant appears to result from a shift in acceptance threshold in response to fitness costs associated with accepting nonkin. The change in the action component of Argentine ant nestmate discrimination was explained to some degree by the hypothesis that the presence of nestmates indicates nest proximity and denotes a fitness payoff for active defence (nest indicator hypothesis) and by the hypothesis that nestmates share the cost of nest defence in groups, but not singly (cost minimizer hypothesis). Isolated nest referents (familiar territory, conspecific brood, or single familiar nestmates), however, had no effect on aggression thresholds. We provide mixed support for the hypothesis that workers from genetically less diverse colonies attack workers from more diverse colonies. We found that, in the context of nest defence, genetically more diverse colonies initiated attacks on colonies with lower genetic diversity. Therefore, the role of asymmetrical aggression in reducing genetic diversity within introduced populations of L. humile remains unknown and other extrinsic factors such as nest status and/or colony size may affect the outcome of aggressive interactions in the field. Finally, our finding that colonies reared under uniform conditions showed diminished intraspecific aggression only when assayed in a social and/or ecological context underscores the importance of using appropriate aggression assays for testing patterns of intercolony aggression in L. humile, and that the use of different rearing regimes, source colonies and collection times may produce contradictory results.

AB  - Changes in environmental conditions within a river basin in South Central Sweden (1400 km(2)) and impacts on riverine nitrogen (N) transport were evaluated. A historical database was compiled and the process-based HBV-N model used to estimate flow normalised N loads in 1885, 1905, 1927, 1956, 1976, and 1994, using a standard climatological record (1985-1994). The study shows the value of process-based modelling in environmental impact assessment, by making it possible to assess and integrate the effect of a number of factors, both with regard to human impact and natural climatic variability. Factors taken into account include: the effects of land use, agricultural practices, atmospheric deposition, human dietary intake, use of flush toilets, lowering of lakes, building of dams, and climatic variability. For all years studied, agriculture was the overriding source of N, and changes in riverine N over time mainly reflected changes in land use and agricultural practices. In spite of decreasing N-leaching from agriculture, the net load remained fairly constant between 1885 and 1927, due to reduced N retention. Drainage of agricultural land had a dominating impact on reducing N retention, which increased the N loads, while the effects of the lowering of lake levels and dam building were less pronounced. Household N emission per capita was higher in 1994 than in 1927, as the increased consumption of meat and dairy products alone resulted in a higher increase of the emission than was compensated for with wastewater treatment improvement. In addition, introduction of flush toilets increased the emission from households. In total, the net load in 1976 was twofold higher than that in 1885, 1905 and 1927, due to increased leaching from agriculture, wastewater emission, and atmospheric deposition on lake surfaces. Finally, the impact of climatological variability was assessed, using a 110-yr climatological record. The choice of 10-yr period of climatological data was the factor that had the largest impact on calculated N load.

AB  - A field study, organised, coordinated and conducted under the responsibility of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), took place in Kosovo in November 2000 to evaluate the level of depleted uranium (DU) released into the environment by the use of DU ammunition during the 1999 conflict, Representatives of six different scientific organisations took part in the mission and a total of approximately 350 samples were collected. During this field mission, the Italian National Environmental Protection Agency (ANPA) collected water, soil, lichen and tree bark samples from different sites. The samples were analysed by a-spectroscopy and in some cases by inductively coupled plasma-source mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The U-234/U-238 and U-235/U-238 activity concentration ratios were used to distinguish natural from anthropogenic uranium. This paper reports the results obtained on these samples. All water samples had very low concentrations of uranium (much below the average concentration of drinking water in Europe). The surface soil samples showed a very large variability in uranium activity concentration, namely from similar to 20 Bq kg(-1) (environmental natural uranium) similar to 2.3 X 10(5) Bq kg(-1) (similar to 18 000 mg kg(-1) of depleted uranium), with concentrations above environmental levels always due to DU. The uranium isotope measurements refer to soil samples collected at places where DU ammunition had been fired; this variability indicates that the impact of DU ammunitions is very site-specific, reflecting both the physical conditions at the time of the impact of the DU ammunition and any physical and chemical alteration which occurred since then, The results on tree barks and lichens indicated the presence of DU in all cases, showing their usefulness as sensitive qualitative bio-indicators for the presence of DU dusts or aerosols formed at the time the DU ammunition had hit a hard target. This result is contamination could be detected. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Plants that are damaged by herbivorous arthropods provide carnivorous enemies of the herbivores with important information. They emit an induced volatile blend that is highly detectable to the carnivores from a distance. Such detectable signals that indicate herbivore presence are important for the carnivores because herbivores themselves are under strong selection not to expose themselves. In addition, carnivores would benefit from a specificity of the induced plant volatiles. Whether herbivore-induced plant volatiles are reliable indicators of herbivore identity, however, has not been resolved unambiguously. Some studies support the reliability of herbivore-induced plant volatiles, while others do not. Different approaches have been used such as chemical analysis, behavioural analysis or a combination of the two. Based on the total of chemical studies one might conclude that in most cases herbivore-induced plant volatiles are not very specific for the herbivore that damages the plant. However, arthropod chemosensors are much more sensitive than the detectors of analytical instruments. Therefore, chemical analyses are not suitable to demonstrate whether or not herbivore-induced plant volatiles are reliable indicators of herbivore identity to carnivores. Behavioural studies should provide this information. In analysing carnivore behaviour it should be realised, however, that arthropod behaviour can be highly variable. Arthropod foraging decisions are affected by external and internal factors such as (a) abiotic environmental factors, (b) presence of competitors or enemies, (c) deprivation of food or oviposition sites, (d) specific deprivation of certain nutrients or (e) learning. In this paper their effect on discrimination of carnivores between volatile blends emitted by plants infested by different herbivores is reviewed. This provides testable hypotheses of why discrimination was not found in some studies. The ability of carnivores to discriminate is likely to be more common than is clear to date, which should invoke functional studies of the conditions that influence the occurrence of this discrimination.

AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the third contributor to cumulative carbon emission reductions required by the second half of this century. Although this is a promising technology for reducing atmospheric CO2, it is only affordable if the confinement of the gas is guaranteed for hundreds of years. Hence, it is of paramount importance to figure out and predict the chemical and biological effects associated with potential CO2 leakage, to provide decision makers with a good basis for choosing technology and potential storage sites. To this end, a titanium reactor (1.4 m(3)) was used to study CO2 seepage under realistic sub-seabed conditions (30 bar pressure and 7 degrees C). The injection of CO2 was calibrated to decrease the pH value from 8.1 to 7.3, which may be the pH found near a leakage point. This pH value also coincides with predictions for near-future ocean pH under current CO2 emissions worldwide. The results from this study demonstrate that there are some elements, i.e., Fe, Co, Pb, Ce, Zn and Cu, present in deep marine sediments, that are strongly affected by the reduced pH levels related to CO2 addition. The dissolved concentrations of Fe, Pb and, to a lesser extent, Cr increased, due probably to weakening of the Fe/Mn shuttle by increased dissolved concentrations of CO2. Desorption processes from oxyhydroxide surfaces due to acidification may explain the release of Co, Ni and Ce observed during the experiment. The increased CO2 concentration also led to increased metal bioavailability, suggested by higher values for labile metal species. Conversely, Cd mobility seems not to be affected by CO2-associated acidification. It is concluded that the determination of those elements most affected by CO2-related acidification in a sub-seabed CO2 storage perimeter (i.e., sediment, sediment-water interface and water column) would be a simple and effective technique to verify suspected leakage.

AB  - To control the soil seed bank of invasive plants with microwaves represents an alternative method to chemical treatments, but it could alter soil quality. Microwave effects were investigated on 17 soil physicochemical and biological properties. Four 915-MHz microwave treatments combining power and duration of exposure were applied on alluvial soil from a grassland using Festuca seeds as an internal standard to evaluate the efficiency of sterilization. Two treatments, 2 kW-8 and 4 kW-4 min, completely inhibited Festuca seed germination and caused the soil temperature to reach at least 80 degrees C. Conversely, the other treatments, 2 kW-4 and 4 kW-2 min, failed to affect seed germination while raising the temperature to 50-60 degrees C. Microbial biomass, the density of culturable heterotrophic bacteria and fluorescent Pseudomonads as well as fluorescein di-acetate hydrolysis decreased significantly by 2.7-, 1.1-, 1.4- and 5.1-fold compared with the control, respectively, following the 2 kW-8 and 4 kW-4 min treatments. These treatments also increased dissolved organic carbon and inorganic phosphorus contents by 1.6- and 1.2-fold, respectively. In contrast, nitrate increased only (about 140%) in the soils under the 2 kW-4 and 4 kW-2 min conditions. Furthermore, the growth of Medicago truncatula Gaertn. seedlings transplanted in microwave-treated soils under the 2 kW-8 and 4 kW-4 min conditions was not impaired despite the reduction in total nitrogen and the microbial population and smaller numbers of nodules. These results suggest that soil seed bank sterilization by microwaves that is 100% effective alters soil microbial indicators more strongly than chemical treatments without compromising the early growth stages of transplanted Medicago plants. Highlights
   Effects of microwave seed sterilization on soil physicochemical and biological properties. Microbial properties were more sensitive than chemical ones. Microbial biomass, bacterial density, hydrolase activity and root nodulation were reduced. Soluble carbon, nitrate and phosphorus increased depending on treatment effectiveness.

AB  - Natural gas is an abundant resource across the United States, of which methane (CH4) is the main component. About 2% of extracted CH4 is lost through leaks. The Remote Methane Leak Detector (RMLD)-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system was developed to investigate natural gas fugitive leaks in this study. The system is composed of three major technologies: miniaturized RMLD (mini-RMLD) based on Backscatter Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS), an autonomous quadrotor UAV and simplified quantification and localization algorithms. With a miniaturized, downward-facing RMLD on a small UAV, the system measures the column-integrated CH4 mixing ratio and can semi-autonomously monitor CH4 leakage from sites associated with natural gas production, providing an advanced capability in detecting leaks at hard-to-access sites compared to traditional manual methods. Automated leak characterization algorithms combined with a wireless data link implement real-time leak quantification and reporting. This study placed particular emphasis on the RMLD-UAV system description and the quantification algorithm development based on a mass balance approach. Early data were gathered to test the prototype system and to evaluate the algorithm performance. The quantification algorithm derived in this study tended to underestimate the gas leak rates and yielded unreliable estimations in detecting leaks under 7 m(3)/s (1 Standard Cubic Feet per Hour (SCFH)). Zero-leak cases can be ascertained via a skewness indicator, which is unique and promising. The influence of the systematic error was investigated by introducing simulated noises, of which Global Positioning System (GPS) noise presented the greatest impact on leak rate errors. The correlation between estimated leak rates and wind conditions were investigated, and steady winds with higher wind speeds were preferred to get better leak rate estimations, which was accurate to approximately 50% during several field trials. High precision coordinate information from the GPS, accurate wind measurements and preferred wind conditions, appropriate flight strategy and the relative steady survey height of the system are the crucial factors to optimize the leak rate estimations.

AB  - Arctic vegetation phenology is a sensitive indicator of a changing climate, and rapid assessment of vegetation status is necessary to more comprehensively understand the impacts on foliar condition and photosynthetic activity. Airborne and space-borne optical remote sensing has been successfully used to monitor vegetation phenology in Arctic ecosystems by exploiting the biophysical and biochemical changes associated with vegetation growth and senescence. However, persistent cloud cover and low sun angles in the region make the acquisition of high-quality temporal optical data within one growing season challenging. In the following study, we examine the capability of "near-field" remote sensing technologies, in this case digital, true-color cameras to produce surrogate in situ spectral data to characterize changes in vegetation driven by seasonal pigment dynamics. Simple linear regression was used to investigate relationships between common pigment-driven spectral indices calculated from field-based spectrometry and red, green, and blue (RGB) indices from corresponding digital photographs in three dominant vegetation communities across three major seasons at Toolik Lake, North Slope, Alaska. We chose the strongest and most consistent RGB index across all communities to represent each spectral index. Next, linear regressions were used to relate RGB indices and extracted leaf-level pigment content with a simple additive error propagation of the root mean square error. Results indicate that the green-based RGB indices had the strongest relationship with chlorophyll a and total chlorophyll, while a red-based RGB index showed moderate relationships with the chlorophyll to carotenoid ratio. The results suggest that vegetation color contributes strongly to the response of pigment-driven spectral indices and RGB data can act as a surrogate to track seasonal vegetation change associated with pigment development and degradation. Overall, we find that low-cost, easy-to-use digital cameras can monitor vegetation status and changes related to seasonal foliar condition and photosynthetic activity in three dominant, low-Arctic vegetation communities.

AB  - Eighteen lakes studied near Sudbury and across Northeastern Ontario (Canada) over a five-year period provided a wide contamination gradient of cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu) and other metals such as nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn). All were inhabited by yellow perch (Perca flavescens), which was sometimes the only species present. Liver Cd and Cu concentrations were monitored in these lakes, in some cases for several consecutive years and for multiple seasons, This data suggests that yellow perch from clean to mildly-contaminated environments loosely control their hepatic Cu concentrations between 7 and 50 mug g dry weight(-1), and a threshold of 50 mug g dry weight(-1) is suggested as the normal range of homeostatic control. Similar data collected by others support this value. Liver Cd concentrations appeared more variable among lake samples, but consistently remained below 10 mug g dry weight(-1) in clean to mildly-contaminated lakes, also supported by data collected elsewhere. Condition factors allowed the discrimination between clean and polluted yellow perch, a conclusion consistent with data for the same species collected in the Rouyn-Noranda area (Quebec. Canada). Values of weight-to-length scaling coefficient lower than 3.0 also discriminated between clean and metal-polluted yellow perch. Finally, three studies indicated that chronic metal exposure can lead to an impairment of aerobic capacities in wild yellow Perch, as indicated by lower muscle activity of citrate synthase (CS), aerobic swim performance and respiration rate. We propose that the combination of liver metal concentrations, scaling coefficient. condition factor and an indicator of physiological impairment such as muscle CS activity can provide a suitable range of parameters to adequately assess the effects of metal contamination on the health of yellow Perch. Although yellow perch are ubiquitous in North America, this approach can potentially be applied to other small fish species more suitable to other study areas.

AB  - We develop a dynamic model of public debt under the assumption that it is problematic for governments to implement fast increases of tax revenues, as new taxes require costly infrastructure and expertise that can be built only over time. In this environment, the standard condition requiring economic growth greater than interest costs is not sufficient to guarantee financial stability. Debt might become unstable if the gap between these two indicators falls below a given threshold. Our empirical analysis based on historical public finance data for the US provides strong support for the model. This study conveys a cautionary warning, because the debt of relatively safe borrowers may suddenly become unstable for instance because of a substantial deceleration in the growth of nominal income. These issues can be particularly relevant for those countries that do not have a modern and efficient tax collection system.

AB  - In the current conditions of economy there is an increasing number of companies that are facing economic and financial difficulties which may, in some cases, lead to bankruptcy. This research is motivated by the inadequacies of traditional forecasting models. The Partial Least Squares Logistic Regression (PLS-LR) allows integrating a large number of ratios in the model; in addition, it solves the problem of correlation, and taking into account the missing data in the matrix. Indeed, the results obtained are very satisfactory and confirm the superiority of this method compared to conventional methods. The proposed model gives the opportunity to consider all the indicators in predicting financial distress, the reduction of the environment's uncertainty, the control's improvement and the coordination between the different company stakeholders.

AB  - Morphological trait variation in populations of rhizomatous (Cypripedium calceolus, Listera ovata) and root-tuber orchid species (Platanthera bifolia, Gymnadenia conopsea) has been studied along a latitudinal gradient in Europe. It has been shown that the structure of shoots changes with transition from the center to the northern or southern periphery of the species range. The reduction in the number of metameres at the range periphery is more distinct in orchids with multimetameric shoots, compared to those with oligometameric shoots. The plasticity of shoot structure observed along the geographic gradient is contingent on climatic factors and can be manifested regionally in cases of long-term temperature deviations. Other morphological parameters, such as shoot height and the sizes of leaves and flowers, can serve as indicators of ecological conditions in habitats.

However, the analysis and environmental management of such spaces is usually done by various institutional sectors without consideration of array in terms of its contribution to urban sustainability. The aim of the following paper is to develop a model for evaluating big urban parks sustainability, as a starting point for its analysis and integrated environmental management. A conceptual and analytic structure is defined, which is made up of three principles and nine indicators. The model is showed as a conceptual and methodological contribution; and as a management tool, from an opened model, flexible, that accepts the changing of indicators or the adding of others, according to the specific conditions.

AB  - Policy makers in Canada have suggested that the scientific community should develop an indicator of biodiversity change that can be implemented quite quickly without a major new investment in monitoring systems. We propose that such an indicator can be developed from the theory of species gradients in community ecology. The term;species gradients' refers to the increasing diversity of species through time under stable conditions, and the increasing diversity of species with the increased use of available resources. This theory is reviewed under four different headings: evolutionary ecology, the energy theory, the resource productivity theory and the thermodynamic mechanism. The theoretical arguments provide a basis to propose detection of the 'leaky ecosystem' as an indicator of biodiversity. We propose that it is possible to detect the leaky energetics of ecosystems by means of routinely available observations of outgoing longwave radiation.

T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Since the 12th century AD land reclamation is carried out in The Netherlands. Numerous shallow, salt or freshwater lakes were pumped dry, changing the lakes into polders. These persistent pumping activities have caused substantial land subsidence in the areas surrounding these polders. In order to assess the impact of pumping water out of a planned new polder (Markerwaard) on the adjacent land areas, a large multidisciplinary study has been performed. In this paper the geological, geotechnical, geohydrological, environmental and constructional aspects of this planned land reclamation project will be discussed. Furthermore, attention will be paid to potential measures for mitigating the harmful effects of land reclamation. It will be demonstrated that it was impossible to make reliable cost calculations of the potential damage to housing, infrastructure, crops and environment due to the construction of the polder, without proper knowledge of the geological conditions of the area and its wide surroundings.

As bioluminescent bacteria have the simplest structure to epitomize the biosphere, their bioluminescence can also act as an indicator of the conditions, therefore assay systems based on luminous bacteria can be used to monitor environmental radiotoxicity. The present investigation explored the measurement of bacterial luminescence, which can be easily computed. Bioluminescent bacterial strains were used to evaluate the effect of ultraviolet (UV) and gamma irradiation. A random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) assay was carried out to observe alterations under exposure. Using a phylogenetic tree, a comparative study of the effect of UV and gamma rays was carried out. The isolated strains showed marked sensitivity towards radiation exposure present in the environment and therefore they could be used as potential biosensing elements for developing an on-site pollution monitoring biosensor.

AB  - This work discusses methods for calculating the CO2 avoidance cost for Carbon Capture and Storage from the non-power generation industry. Unlike the power generation sector, three calculation methods are often used to evaluate the CO2 avoidance cost in the case of CCS from industrial sources. However, each of these methods relies on different assumptions of which potential users are not always aware. The links between these three methods are here presented and verified over an illustrative case to highlight the conditions that are required to ensure their reliable use, as well as their associated shortcomings. Finally, the basis to ensure the selection of the CO2 avoidance cost calculation method that is both valid and most efficient for cases considered by potential users are presented.

AB  - An econometric model based on a natural experiment and the difference-in-differences method is introduced to empirically investigate the impact of split share structure reform on capital structures. A total of 1026 listed companies in Chinese A-share during 2001-2011 are used as the sample for the research and interest-bearing debt ratios (BDRs) are taken as a representative indicator for capital structures. The theoretical and empirical analysis indicates that both market expansion effect and corporate governance effect caused by the split share structure reform are associated with an increase in BDR. As far as the timeliness is concerned, the effects of split share structure reform on capital structures will last 3-4years.

AB  - Microgastropod-dominated shell beds formed during the aftermath of the end-Permian mass extinction comprise a characteristic Early Triassic biofacies. The identification of this biofacies is significant: (1) no other episode in the geologic record is characterized by the lack of larger gastropods and abundant, conspicuous microgastropod-dominated shell beds: (2) its distribution indicates that the recovery front the end-Permian mass extinction was regionally variable and began sooner than previously interpreted. Occurrence of this biofacies supports the contention that chemically and/or physiologically harsh environmental conditions related to the cause of the end-Permian mass extinction were prolonged through much of the Early Triassic.

LA  - German
AB  - Due to the natural conditions and future economic framework for agriculture in the new Lander, it seems questionable whether farming in the traditional manner can be maintained everywhere. The actual locations of marginal land where land hitherto used for farming may fall idle in the future depend upon numerous factors and cannot easily be predicted. Land rents may give an answer to this question as an indicator which takes into account a whole range of influencing factors. However, considering the uncertainties concerning the fixed-cost structure of agricultural enterprises in Eastern Germany, only gross margins computed for arable farming along with a few other indicators can be used for the assessment of marginal locations. It is not possible to exactly determine the borderline between regions of profitable and of unprofitable amble farming. A comparison of various maps, however, gives a rough overview of the quality of agricultural locations in the administrative districts of the new Lander.

AB  - Microbial contamination of the environment in bullock calf houses with the animals being housed on slatted litterfree floors corresponded to the range of tolerance proposed for conventional large-scale calf houses when assessing air contamination. In the house for milk-fed calves the air contamination was lowest when evaluating the total number of microbes (t.n.m.) growing on MPA with lactose, while the highest values were found for L+ microbes growing on Endo agar. Considering a zero detection of L+ microbes in the air of the houses, it can be assumed that the house air quality changes with the health condition of the excretors, i.e. the housed bullock-calves.
   L+ microbe contamination of indicator site surface areas points out the need for a greater care of drinkers and feed bowls or troughs.

AB  - Process-orientated, unmanaged forest remnants are not sufficient for halting the loss of forest biodiversity. Thus, integrated biodiversity-promoting management for forest inhabitants is needed. Microhabitats, such as tree cavities or bark pockets, are essential for the preservation of saproxylic species and of critical importance for endangered ones. This study investigates (1) which factors trigger the formation of microhabitats at both the individual tree and aggregated plot level, and (2) whether the co-occurrence of microhabitats differs between managed (=logged) and unmanaged forests. Relationships between the occurrence of 17 microhabitat types and individual tree features (e.g. light availability, and tree vitality) and plot characteristics (e.g. stand density index and stand age) in 398 plots dominated by Fagus sylvatica or Pseudotsuga menziesii in Germany and the USA were studied using random-effects logistic and normal regression modelling. Separate analyses were performed for German beech forests, German Douglas-fir forests, and the US Douglas-fir forests. Our results show that (1) tree diameter in breast height (DBH), tree vitality and branchiness or epicormic branches are highly related with the occurrence of one or more microhabitats on individual trees in managed and unmanaged beech and US Douglas-fir forests. In managed German Douglas-fir forests, vitality is not a predictor for the occurrence of microhabitats on a tree, but tree density and the maximum age of trees in a stand in addition to DBH and branchiness have an effect. Time since last management is not a statistically significant predictor for the presence of microhabitats at the tree level, but it is for German beech at the plot level. In Douglas-fir-dominated forests both in Germany and in the USA, the stand density index was the only common predictor at the plot level. (2) Unmanaged German beech and Douglas-fir forests exhibit more statistically significant and positive correlations with microhabitat groups than managed stands, implying that the presence of one microhabitat group on a tree is associated with the presence of other microhabitat groups. We finally conclude that measures for supporting microhabitat inhabitants in managed forests are scale and species dependent (tree versus plot level; beech versus Douglas-fir-dominated forests). Trees that carry microhabitats seem to have similar features independently of forest management. At the plot level, density management may trigger the accumulation of microhabitats. Our results indicate that in forest management, it is possible to consider the factors influencing the formation of microhabitats and implement adequate forest practices to advance their formation.

AB  - We describe the spatial and temporal distribution of rotifer communities in Foum El Gherza dam and the environmental factors that most affect their composition. At six sites surveyed monthly between 2007 and 2009, we report 15 species in the dam lake, dominated by Keratella tropica, K quadrata, and to a lesser extent by Brachionus calyciflorus. Rotifer community composition changed seasonally. Summer communities were characterized by a proliferation of K tropica (92.5%), a species that, like B. calycirlorus (5.54%), tolerates high temperatures, anoxic conditions and high salinities. When water temperature dropped, K. quadrata was the most abundant species in the lake (94.6%). On the basis of faunal composition we describe this dam lake as eutrophic. The physicochemical composition of its water fluctuated.

AB  - To determine the effects of the tsunami generated by the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 on the environment of aquaculture farming grounds, we investigated environmental conditions of the sediment in nine bays along the Pacific Coast of northern Japan. Comparisons were made before and after the Earthquake and tsunami for the following variables: mud content (MC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and acid volatile sulfides (AVS). The spatial and temporal distributions of MC, COD, and AVS varied with differences in geographic characteristics of the bay. The amount of open water in the bay decreased but the breakwater in the bay increased after the tsunami. Changes in MC, COD, and AVS were supported by the results of numerical simulations, and our results indicated that all three variables are good indicators for managing the environment of aquaculture farming grounds.

AB  - Zelinka and Marvan system was used as a methodological basis for developing a method for measuring thermoindicator properties of zooplankton species, including the determination of thermal valence and indicator weight. A list of indicator species for thermal conditions in the water body was compiled, and the species, in accordance with the water temperature they prefer, were grouped into cryobionts, cryophiles, thermophiles, and thermobionts. A thermal index was proposed to assess its thermal preference; this index allows seasonal variations in the community, associated with cooling or warming of the water body, to be characterized. The knowledge of the dynamics of the thermal index can largely help one to monitor changes in zooplankton community under thermal impact on aquatic ecosystems. Thermal indication system can be of use in the analysis of the effect of global warming on the biota of water bodies and in the prediction of its future transformation.

AB  - Large mammals, especially Hippopotamus amphibius, have created a distinctive set of traces in a spring-fed freshwater wetland on the margin of the saline-alkaline Crater lake in the Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania. It is comprised of a similar to30 m diameter zone of deep (<2m) bioturbation due to hippo wallowing, surrounded by dendritic to radial hippo trails 1-5 m wide and <0.5 m deep, infilled with organic-rich mud. These trails narrow and thin as they grade into trackways on the lake flat. Tracks and trackways of more terrestrial mammals, such as bovids and equids, are found in the lake flat muds surrounding the hippo-dominated area. Associations of sedimentary structures such as these are important indicators of paleoenvironmental conditions where they are preserved in the sedimentary record, due to the strong affinity of Hippopotamidae for freshwater environments.

AB  - A new approach to fruit drying with the application of ultrasound to enhance convective and combined convective microwave drying is presented. High-power ultrasound was used in the experimental studies, in which the acoustic energy significantly affected the drying of sensitive biological material like raspberries. The raspberries were first subjected to pure convective drying as a reference process and then to hybrid drying as a combination of convective, microwave and ultrasound drying methods. The combined hybrid processes significantly improved the drying kinetics as well as the energy utilization, however, not in each case given the acceptable product quality in comparison with the pure convective drying. The global model of drying was used to compare the theoretical drying kinetics with the experimental one. Moreover, the effectiveness of ultrasound-assisted convective drying was evaluated in terms of drying rate and such ultrasound phenomena as "heating effect", "vibration effect" and "synergistic effect" were analyzed.
   Industrial relevance: 1. Research objectives
   Product quality is a very important indicator that enables to assess the effectiveness of the drying process. For biological materials such as vegetables and fruits, that are characterized by instability and a delicate and sensitive internal structure to temperature, quality is a priority because it determines the functional value of these products. The traditional drying techniques, eg. convective drying, affect negatively on the final quality of dried biomaterials. Due to long exposure to a relatively high temperature and a high content of harmful oxygen in the drying agent, there is a change in the internal structure, deterioration of the sensory properties (color, aroma, texture) and changes in chemical composition (loss of bioactive components). One of the recommended modes to minimize these adverse changes is to carry out the drying process in non-stationary conditions. This method is based on the periodical changes in the process parameters such as temperature, humidity or flow rate. As a result, product quality is definitely better, at approximately the same drying time. Alternatively, drying may be carried out by hybrid method, providing the energy by a combination of several mechanisms, such as convection with microwave radiation, or with ultrasounds, which also leads to a significant improvement in quality of dried fruits and vegetables.
   The purpose of this article is a deep analysis of the effect of variable hybrid drying conditions, ie. cyclic supply of microwave and ultrasound energy during convective drying on a variety of properties of dried biomaterials. The research assumes that if drying results in changes of the biological material properties, a modification of the process parameters should minimize its negative effects and gain better quality products. The authors believe that a proper and skillful combination of different drying techniques will develop an optimal and effective drying method of thermo-labile materials, which retains their high quality, with reduced time and lower power consumption. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the convective drying with microwave and ultrasound enhancement, in order to select the best process parameters for the established objective functions.
   2. Research project impact
   The experimental results will contribute to the development of modern drying technologies of biological materials, characterized by, eg.:
   much better and more controlled product quality (low level of processing),
   much shorter process time resulting from the intensification of heat and mass processes due to additional sources of energy (microwaves and ultrasounds),
   lower energy consumption resulting from the possibility of carrying out the drying process at much lower temperatures of the drying agent.
   The expected results of the drying tests relate to the development of research activities in this field and to link a cooperation between science and industry.
   The effective transfer of new solutions in the field of chemical engineering and technology between science and industry is a hope of improving the quality of dried products, as well as the rational use of raw biomaterials (to prevent their losses from reaching about 50% of produced foods). The proposed drying method will also have a positive value for consumers and contribute to the reduction in influence of that branch of industry on the environment. In the consideration of the increasing demands of product quality, the need for better control of unit processes and minimization of its energy intensity, this new technique would be extremely competitive with currently used, expensive and environmentally damaging drying methods.

AB  - Primary producer-based and detrital-based energy pathways in streams are intertwined. Interactions between algae and heterotrophic microorganisms may accelerate or inhibit recalcitrant organic detritus decomposition depending on the environmental conditions. The magnitude and direction of this priming effect have been attributed to nutrient availability, but the influence of nutrients can be difficult to disentangle. To date, no studies have examined priming across a single-nutrient gradient where every other variable is tightly controlled. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of algal priming on decomposition of standardized cellulose substrates across an extensive phosphorus (P) gradient in laboratory mesocosms. We placed unbleached cotton strips into 11 recirculating mesocosms, each divided into a light section and a dark section. Each mesocosm was subjected to a different P concentration ranging from 1 to 1024 mu g P/L, with all other nutrients maintained at saturating concentrations. P stimulated algal biomass in the light, but fungal biomass responded more to P in the dark. Decomposition, measured as loss of tensile strength (an indicator of cellulose catabolism), and extracellular cellulase enzyme activities were lower in the light treatment than the dark treatment above similar to 16 mu g P/L, indicating a suppression of decomposition by algae. This negative priming was likely due to preferential use of algal exudates by fungi in the light treatments under P-replete conditions, which may be caused by maximum algal accrual and possibly bulk labile organic matter exudation above these concentrations. A lack of positive priming in this study may have been due to negligible nutrient concentrations in the cotton and saturating nitrogen (N) concentrations in the water, suggesting that positive priming is primarily associated with N mining and, to a lesser extent, P mining. This study highlights how complex interactions between algae and microbial heterotrophs coupled with altered light and nutrient regimes may have consequences for stream food webs.

AB  - Sagebrush communities, covering millions of hectares in the western United States, are among our most imperiled ecosystems. They are challenged by various anthropogenic stressors, including invasion by nonnative grasses that degrade habitat quality and alter ecosystem function. Sagebrush restoration efforts are underway to improve habitat conditions to benefit a wide range of sagebrush-dependent species. Because birds are good indicators of habitat quality, monitoring avian metrics is an effective way to measure progress of sagebrush restoration. We compared avian community composition and individual species abundance among three sagebrush-steppe habitat types with varying degrees of invasion by nonnative crested wheatgrass Agropyron cristatum at the Camas National Wildlife Refuge in southeastern Idaho, USA. Sagebrush-obligate birds, such as sage thrasher Oreoscoptes montanus and sagebrush sparrow Artemisiospiza nevadensis, were most abundant in sagebrush habitats with an understory of native grass. Community composition was similar between sagebrush habitats with native and nonnative grasses, but quite different from bird communities occupying crested wheatgrass. The Habitats and Populations Strategies database, a conservation planning tool, predicts that restoration of crested wheatgrass sites to sagebrush in poor or fair condition will increase the density of sagebrush-obligate bird species. Taken together, these results suggest that restoration of crested wheatgrass near-monocultures back to sagebrush will improve habitat value for much of the bird community whether or not the understory can be converted to primarily native grasses, or a mix of natives and nonnatives. Of the sagebrush bird species of concern, Brewer's sparrow Spizella breweri occupied sagebrush habitats with native vs. nonnative understory at similar abundances, and this species could serve as a metric of intermediate restoration success. However, sagebrush sparrow and sage thrasher, which were significant indicators of sagebrush with native grasses, will likely benefit most from full restoration of a native herbaceous understory. Grassland-obligate birds such as horned lark Eremophila alpestris and grasshopper sparrow Ammodramus savannarum were most abundant at crested wheatgrass-dominated sites and may not benefit from restoration back to shrubland; managers should understand potential trade-offs.

AB  - The major weakness of the current in vitro genotoxicity test systems is the inability of the indicator cells to express metabolic enzymes needed for the activation and detoxification of genotoxic compounds, which consequently can lead to misleading results. Thus, there is a significant emphasis on developing hepatic cell models, including advanced in vitro three-dimensional (3D) cell-based systems, which better imitate in vivo cell behaviour and offer more accurate and predictive data for human exposures. In this study, we developed an approach for genotoxicity testing with 21-day old spheroids formed from human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2/C3A) using the dynamic clinostat bioreactor system (CelVivo BAM/bioreactor) under controlled conditions. The spheroids were exposed to indirect-acting genotoxic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon [PAH; benzo (a) pyrene B(a)P], and heterocyclic aromatic amine [PhIP]) at non-cytotoxic concentrations for 24 and 96 h. The results showed that both environmental pollutants B(a)P and PhIP significantly increased the level of DNA strand breaks assessed by the comet assay. Further, the mRNA level of selected genes encoding metabolic enzymes from phase I and II, and DNA damage responsive genes was determined (qPCR). The 21-day old spheroids showed higher basal expression of genes encoding metabolic enzymes compared to monolayer culture. In spheroids, B(a)P or PhIP induced compound-specific up-regulation of genes implicated in their metabolism, and deregulation of genes implicated in DNA damage and immediate-early response. The study demonstrated that this model utilizing HepG2/C3A spheroids grown under dynamic clinostat conditions represents a very sensitive and promising in vitro model for genotoxicity and environmental studies and can thus significantly contribute to a more reliable assessment of genotoxic activities of pure chemicals, and complex environmental samples even at very low for environmental exposure relevant concentrations.

AB  - Introduction. The purpose of research is to establish patterns for removal of macromolecular and color compounds, using different methods of purification sugar sorghum juice to obtain food syrup.
   Materials and methods. Sugar sorghum hybrid 'Mamont' was used as a feedstock for food syrup. Native sorghum juice was subjected to enzymatic treatment to hydrolyze starch. For extraction of sugar-soluble non-sugars from sorghum juice, including macromolecular substances (MMS) and dyes, the cationic flocculant polyhexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride (PGMG GC) and natural mineral sorbent zeolite were used. Membrane filtration methods and ion exchange purification were used to intensify the purification process.
   Results and discussion. Due to the use of zeolite at an optimal cost of 0.8-1.0% by weight of the juice, the discoloration effect is achieved at the level of 41-46%, and the effect of removal of the MMS by 20-22%.
   The use of zeolite for purification of sorghum juice in combination with membrane filtration methods, such as mechanical filtration and ultrafiltration leads to improved technological performance of sorghum juice. Under these purification conditions, sugar sorghum juice with a purity of 90.72% and a colour of 245.8 ICUMSA units was obtained, and the efficiency of purification, removal MMS and proteins substances was 46.1, 82.3 and 69.5%, respectively.
   Under the conditions of supplementing the above-method with ion exchange purification, we obtained an increase in the efficiency of purification, removal of the MMS and proteins in accordance with the values of 51.9, 98.5 and 89.2%.
   Proposed methods of purification of sugar sorghum juice are effective in removing MMS, proteins and colored compounds and provide food syrups in which the optimal ratio of carbohydrates sucrose and glucose and fructose (65:35) % by weight of total sugar.
   Conclusions. The best quality indicators were syrups obtained by purification methods, which included the use of adsorption purification with zeolite, membrane filtration and ion exchange purification.

AB  - The evolution of ornaments as sexually selected signals is well understood in males, but female ornamentation remains understudied. Fairy wrens offer an excellent model system, given their complex social structure and mating systems, and the diversity of female ornamentation. We investigated whether early molt into ornamental breeding plumage plays an adaptive role in females of the monogamous purple-crowned fairy wren Malurus coronatus, the only fairy wren known to have female seasonal plumage. Using 6 years of monitoring, we found that the timing of female molt was similar to males, but there was no evidence for assortative mating. Like males (previous study), older and dominant individuals acquired their breeding plumage earlier; however, in contrast to males, early molt did not seem to be costly since unfavorable environmental conditions or previous reproductive effort did not delay molt. Early female molt was not associated with any indicator of reproductive quality nor did it attract additional offspring care by their partners. We also found no association between early molt and the likelihood of acquiring a dominant (breeding) position or with the presence or proximity to same-sex rivals. Our study results, which are similar to previous findings in conspecific males, suggest that directional selection for early molt might be relaxed in this species, in contrast to other genetically polygamous fairy wrens in which early molt predicts extrapair mating success in males. However, the finding that molt timing is status dependent raises the possibility that other attributes of the ornament may fulfill an adaptive function in females.
   Lay Summary: Early molt into seasonal ornamental plumage in male fairy wrens is often a signal to attract females. Here, we explore its function in female purple-crowned fairy wrens. Older and dominant females molted earlier, but we found no evidence to support an adaptive role of early molt in sexual or social selection contexts. Selection for early molt might be relaxed due to year-round territoriality and reproduction.

AB  - The thermal profile of the urban built-up area is essential for reducing the impact of built-up areas on urban heat stress. This study quantifies the variations in the outdoor thermal profile of built forms in a heterogeneous urban area. A two-step process was adopted to quantify built form induced heat stress. The build form typologies referred to as Urban Built Form (UBFX) were clustered based on parameterised build form indices (sky view factor, built height etc.) using statistical data reduction. The heat stress of the categorised UBFs was then examined through field measurements and radiation simulation model. Variations in thermal variables were assessed using three indices - Cooling Potential (CP), Humidex (Hx) and Mean Radiant Temperature (Tmrt) that collectively define the thermal profile of each UBF. A novel Heat Stress Risk Index (HSRI) was conceptualised and computed to represent the aggregate risk of a particular UBF towards heat stress. It was found that among the UBFs, the medium-rise compact (UBF 4) showlowest rate of cooling, exposure to high Tmrt, and high discomfort levels throughout the day and therefore exhibit thermally stressed profile. High rise-open typologies (UBF1) have highTmrt and Hx during the noon (12:00 to 14:00 h), but their high cooling potential reduces the thermal impact of its built form during the cooling hours (18:00 to 20:00 h). Three thermal indices provide varied aspects of thermal performance of UBFs and HSRI cumulatively represents the heat stress risk of the UBFs. This study is a proof of concept, that uses empirical evidence to demonstrate thermal variations in urban built forms during calm and clear weather conditions. Results indicate the significance of built form indices as a policy variable for framing climate sensitive urban development regulations that aim to achieve a thermally efficient built environment.

AB  - Cyanobacteria and thecamoebians are the two major constituents of Non Pollen Palynomorphs (NPP) found in the palynological preparations. The former is well represented in the sediment archives while the latter has restricted occurrence in the Holocene sequence apart from the conventional organic matter of pollen and spores. Well preserved morphotypes of Gleotrichia and Rivularia are the best forms of cyanobacteria found in almost all the studied profiles and their abundance towards Early to Middle Holocene coincides with the heavy rainfall and wet climate conditions during the Holocene climate optimum (HCO). Contrary to cyanobacterial diversity, thecamoebians are restricted to Late Holocene in most of the studied profiles and their occurrence is correlated with the prevailing dry and stressful environmental conditions. The major elements of thecamoebians identified belong to Arcellaceans, Centropyxids and Cucurbitella types. Abundance of Centropyxids and Arcellaceans in Varapuzha, West Kadungallur, Koonamavu, Pachcha and Ernakulam indicates low humidity and low precipitation. However, the relative abundance of Centropyxids in Mid Holocene at Ernakulam and Koonamavu reflects the early colonization of this type competing with the cyanobacteria, whereas, Arcellaceans are essentially confined to Late Holocene. Dominance of cyanobacteria and its proliferation is directly related to freshwater influx of the rainfall as well as the local hydrological regimes associated with the active aquifers controlled by the geomorphological features of the region in which the wetland system sustained. Considering the signatures of cyanobacteria and thecamoebians observed in the sediment archives their occurrence in the wetlands during the Holocene corresponds to the hydrodynamic regimes brought in by the freshwater influx as a result of monsoon variability. The well preserved cyanobacterial signatures in sediment archives of Kerala coast and their scarcity or even absence elsewhere along the west coast of India indicates that they are exclusively adapted to the wetland habitats where the hydrodynamic regimes are regularly controlled by fresh water influx in the form of extended rainy days of the monsoon system.

AB  - Due to unstable economic situation in Russia, there is a high rate of change in indicators of city-forming enterprises economic activity. It has significant effect on ecological, social conditions of monotowns as well as on economic conditions related to real estate prices. Assessment and forecasting the influence of the city-forming enterprise economic activity on open market and cadastral value of lands of monotovvns are important tasks for management of industry activities as well as for researching the perspective of development of the monotown real estate market.
   The mail aim of the study is to develop the forecast model of land cadastral cost in monotowns considering the effect of the city-forming enterprises economic activity factors.
   The methods used in the study. Applying the the regression analysis the authors have developed the model of dependence of land cost in monotovvns on the offered indicators of economic activity of the city-forming enterprises. The method of correlation analysis revealed the indicators exerting reliable impact on the cost of city lands; classification of monotovvns is carried out by the cluster analysis method; the recession analysis method model was used to develop the dependence model of land cost in the researched objects on the factors of economic activity of the city-forming enterprises (linear, logarithmic and regression of the second order). For each model the authors determined the quality coefficients and chose the best dependence.
   The results. By the results of quality check and statistical certainty of the offered models it is revealed that the linear regression model describes the researched dependence in the best way. It is established as well that the land cost in the researched monotovvns is most influenced by such indicators of economic activity of the city-forming enterprises as population in the monotovvn, capacity of production of the city-forming enterprise, the index of atmosphere pollution in the monotown. The developed classification of the monotowns of the Northwestern Federal District, in addition to the purposes of the research, can be applied in case of cadastral assessment of lands of monotovvns.

AB  - Long-lasting community-based resource management systems have offered scholars important lessons in the study of human-environment relations. The examination of such systems has suffered from a sampling bias, however, in that it has focused disproportionately on successful systems. There are fewer studies that have explored the deterioration of such systems, particularly with an interdisciplinary approach. This shortfall is problematic given the increasing social and biophysical disturbances that communities are facing as they become more integrated into, and affected by, larger-scale processes.
   This study addresses this gap by analyzing the modern condition of a long-lasting community-based irrigation system known as the acequias in northern New Mexico. Using a mix of interview, survey, remote sensing, and census data, I examine the extent to which important indicators for the acequias have shifted in the last several decades and explore reasons for these changes. A mix of statistical and qualitative comparative techniques is used to conduct the analysis.
   By examining longitudinal data we find that the acequias are producing less than they have in the past and have mostly lost their common-property-based livestock pasturing system. While some of these changes can be attributed to similar declines in water availability, much of the change results from social drivers including demographic changes, regional-to-global market forces, and public policies. Overall the shift of the acequias to their current state is a result of their integration into a much larger-scale set of social and economic forces than they have experienced in the past. This shift will be very difficult to reverse, meaning the acequia farmers must adapt to the current condition. It is likely that these themes are common across many community-based resource management systems in many locations. In the future, further progress should be made in synthetically comparing such cases in ways that have already been done for long-lasting successful systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper summarizes the results of an extensive experimental study aiming to evaluate the performance and pollutant emissions of diesel and CNG waste collection trucks under realistic and controlled operating conditions in order to support a fleet renewal initiative in the city of Milan. Four vehicles (1 diesel and 3 CNG) were tested in two phases using a portable emission measurement system. The first phase included real world operation in the city of Milan while the second involved controlled conditions in a closed track. Emissions recorded from the diesel truck were on average 2.4 kg/km for CO2, 0.21 g/km for HC. 7.4 g/km for CO, 32.3 g/km for NOx and 46.4 mg/km for PM. For the CNG the values were 3.6 kg/km for CO2, 2.19 g/km for HC, 15.8 g/km for CO, 4.38 g/km for NOx and 11.4 mg/km for PM. CNG vehicles presented an important advantage with regards to NOx and PM emissions but lack the efficiency of their diesel counterparts when it comes to CO, HC and particularly greenhouse gas emissions. This tradeoff needs to be carefully analyzed prior to deciding if a fleet should be shifted towards either technology. In addition it was shown that existing emission factors, used in Europe for environmental assessment studies, reflect well the operation for CNG but were not so accurate when it came to the diesel engine truck particularly for CO2 and NOx. With regard to NOx, it was also shown that the limits imposed by current emission standards are not necessarily reflected in real world operation, under which the diesel vehicle presented almost 4 times higher emissions. Regarding CO2, appropriate use of PEMS data and vehicle information allows for accurate emission monitoring through computer simulation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Seabirds integrate information about oceanic ecosystems across time and space, and are considered sensitive indicators of marine conditions. To assess whether hypothesized long-term foodweb changes such as forage fish declines may be reflected in a consumer's life history traits over time, I used meta-regression to evaluate multi-decadal changes in aspects of egg production in the glaucous-winged gull (Larus glaucescens), a common coastal bird. Study data were derived from literature searches of published papers and unpublished historical accounts, museum egg collections, and modern field studies, with inclusion criteria based on data quality and geographic area of the original study. Combined historical and modern data showed that gull egg size declined at an average of 0.04 cc y(-1) from 1902 (108 y), equivalent to a decline of 5% of mean egg volume, while clutch size decreased over 48 y from a mean of 2.82 eggs per clutch in 1962 to 2.25 in 2009. There was a negative relationship between lay date and mean clutch size in a given year, with smaller clutches occurring in years where egg laying commenced later. Lay date itself advanced over time, with commencement of laying presently (2008-2010) 7 d later than in previous studies (1959-1986). This study demonstrates that glaucous-winged gull investment in egg production has declined significantly over the past similar to 50-100 y, with such changes potentially contributing to recent population declines. Though gulls are generalist feeders that should readily be able to buffer themselves against food web changes, they are likely nutritionally constrained during the early breeding period, when egg production requirements are ideally met by consumption of high-quality prey such as forage fish. This study's results suggest a possible decline in the availability of such prey, and the incremental long-term impoverishment of a coastal marine ecosystem bordering one of North America's rapidly growing urban areas.

AB  - Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), produced by many marine phytoplankton, is the main precursor of the climate relevant gas dimethylsulfide (DMS). Currently, it is generally accepted that the relationship between DMSP and phytoplankton biomass (as chlorophyll a), while not representative of the absolute magnitude of the DMSP pool, is a good indicator of ecosystem structure. In this study we test the strength of the relationships between DMSP and various phytoplankton parameters in Arctic shelf waters of the Barents Sea. Our objective is to assess the predictive value that traditional phytoplankton carbon parameters have on DMSP. We discuss C:DMSP-S variability as a function of seasonality, water masses, grazing and nutrient limitation. For this purpose we analyze data from 5 cruises including winter, spring and summer conditions and across the seasonal ice zone at the time of the study. Highest phytoplankton DMSP concentration was usually measured at the ice edge. Marked seasonal variability was observed in phytoplankton carbon biomass and production but not necessarily in the particulate fraction of DMSP (DMSPp), resulting in seasonally varying C:DMSP-S. High winter DMSPp concentrations, when chlorophyll a and primary production were lowest and flagellates dominant, suggest a heterotrophic source. The production of extracellular carbon and the pool of dissolved DMSP (DMSPd) followed similar seasonal trends, with enhanced concentrations in spring, and we suggest that high dissolved primary production induced by nutrient limiting conditions resulted in high DMSPd concentrations. Mesoscale changes in total DMSP (particulate + dissolved) may be modeled from basin-wide total phytoplankton primary production (rather than from phytoplankton biomass) at seasonal and interannual scales. We conclude there is predictive power of DMSP concentrations in the Barents Sea based on seasonality, the position of the ice edge and the distribution of phytoplankton variables.

AB  - Benthic foraminiferal fauna patterns have been investigated as possible indicators of the various morphological features interpreted as the expression of slightly different environmental conditions within a ria bay. Eighty grab-top samples from the Posiet Bay and twenty littoral stations were examined concerning the distribution of benthic foraminifera in different bottom environments in one of the largest ria bays of the Western Japan Sea. Altogether 51 species of benthic foraminifera belonging to 32 genera were determined from the bay bottom sediments. The zones of high productivity and diversity (Shannon diversity) are established. The distribution of agglutinated and carbonate forms reflects mainly river input. Agglutinated foraminifera dominate within brackish shallow closed and semi-open inlets. Calcareous species dominate within the inshore part of open inlets and seaward part of the bay. The combination of the species composition, an information function (Shannon diversity), and population density are used to characterize modem bottom environments based on benthic foraminifera. Four faunal assemblages were identified by Q-mode cluster analysis. The first assemblage, dominated by Eggerella advena, is present from 7 to 40 m and is associated with temperatures of 9.7-16.9 degreesC, that are typical for semi-open inlet environments with silt substrate. A second assemblage, dominated by Trochammina inflata, occurs in closed inlets at depths up to 21 m, and is associated with temperatures of 12.9-17.5 degreesC, a brackish environment, and muddy substrate. The third Cribroelphidium asterenium assemblage represents a semi-open marine environment, The fourth assemblage. dominated by C. etigoense, is present to a depth of IS m within an open shallow inlet. This assemblage with the highest species diversity is associated with bottom temperatures of 10-18 degreesC and a sandy substrate. The difference in the benthic foraminiferal assemblages at similar depths in Posiet Bay is the result of different hydrologic regimes in closed, semi-open, and open environments. Littoral benthic foraminiferal assemblages are different from bottom ones. Regional environmental conditions can be recognized as deviations from the depth-bottom temperature range, river influx, and coastal configuration features. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Under the indicator models of mate choice, female preferences evolve to exploit the condition-dependence or "indicator value" of male traits, which in turn may cause these traits to evolve to elaborate extremes. If the indicator value of a male trait changes, the payoff function of the female preference for that trait should change and the preference should evolve to a new optimum. I tested this prediction in the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, a species in which the indicator value of a sexually selected male trait, carotenoid coloration, varies geographically. Carotenoid coloration is thought to be an indicator of foraging ability and health because animals must obtain carotenoid pigments from their diet. The primary dietary source of carotenoids for guppies is unicellular algae, the abundance of which varies among natural streams because of variation in forest canopy cover. Carotenoid availability limits male coloration to a greater extent in streams with greater forest canopy cover. Thus, the indicator value of male coloration covaries positively with canopy cover. To test the indicator model prediction, I measured genetic divergence in the strength of female preferences for carotenoid coloration between high- and low-carotenoid availability streams in each of three river drainages. Second-generation laboratory-born females were given a choice between full-sib males raised on three different dietary levels of carotenoids. For all six populations, male attractiveness (as determined from the responses of females to male courtship displays) increased with dietary carotenoid levels. However, the strength of female preferences differed between populations in the predicted direction in only one of three river drainages. These results fail to support a crucial prediction of the indicator model. More studies taking an interpopulation approach to studying mate preference evolution are needed before the explanatory value of the indicator models can be rigorously assessed.

AB  - Tail docking involves amputating a portion of the tail for a variety of reasons. We review the scientific evidence for the rationale for tail docking, a description of the different methods used, the pain response to the procedure and the effectiveness of pain alleviation, and, finally, the alternatives to tail docking and policy regarding the practice. We focus on the three main agricultural species that are tail docked as a management practice: pigs, sheep. and dairy cattle. Methods of tail docking include cutting with a knife or scalpel, cutting with a hot docking iron, or application of a constrictive rubber ring. All methods are commonly performed without analgesia or anaesthesia, and all likely result in some degree of pain. As with any procedure that alters the integrity of an animal, it is important to consider the rationale behind docking in order to evaluate if it is necessary. Tail docking in pigs is routinely conducted on commercial swine farms because it can reduce the incidence of tail biting, an injurious and undesirable behaviour. Both behavioural and physiological changes indicate that tail docking is painful in pigs, but until robust and consistent methods for preventing tail biting are identified, this procedure is likely to continue as a management practice. This approach is reflected in public policy about the procedure. There is both behavioural and physiological evidence that tail docking is painful for sheep; both responses are reduced when pain relief is provided. Prevention of fly strike is the primary reason given for tail docking sheep, but the scientific evidence to support this rationale is surprisingly sparse. Further research is required to justify tail docking of sheep as a routine practice. Dairy cattle are docked because this practice is thought to improve cow cleanliness and udder health, however, there is no scientific evidence supporting this rationale, Tail docking cattle results in relatively few behavioural or physiological indicators of pain, but docked cows are unable to effectively remove flies from their hind end. The practice of tail docking dairy cattle is banned, discouraged or declining in most industrialized countries except the US. The long-term pain associated with tail docking is not well understood in pigs, sheep or cattle. In cases where tail docking may be justified by demonstrated benefits for the animal (possibly in case of pigs and sheep), further research is needed to find either practical alternatives or ways to alleviate the pain associated with this procedure.

AB  - The isotopic composition of carbon in macroalgae (delta C-13) is highly variable, and its prediction is complex concerning terrestrial plants. The determinants of delta C-13 macroalgal variations were analyzed in a large stock of specimens that vary in taxa and morphology and were collected in shallow marine habitats in the Gulf of California (GC) with distinctive environmental conditions. A large delta C-13 variability (-34.6 parts per thousand to -2.2 parts per thousand was observed. Life-forms (taxonomy 57 %, morphology and structural organization 34 %) explain the variability related to carbon use physiology. Environmental conditions influenced the delta C-13 macroalgal values but did not change the physiology, which is most likely inherently species-specific. Values of delta C-13 were used as indicators of the presence or absence of carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) and as integrative values of the isotope discrimination during carbon assimilation in the life cycle macroalgae. Based on delta C-13 signals, macroalgae were classified in three strategies relative to the capacity of CCM: (1) HCO3- uptake (delta C-13 > -10 parts per thousand, (2) using a mix of CO2 and HCO3- uptake (-10 < delta C-13 > -30 parts per thousand), and (3) CO(2 )diffusive entry (delta C-13 < -30 parts per thousand). Most species showed a delta C-13 that indicates a CCM using a mix of CO2 and HCO3- uptake. HCO3- uptake is also widespread among GC macroalgae, with many Ochrophyta species. Few species belonging to Rhodophyta relied on CO2 diffusive entry exclusively, while calcifying macroalgae species using HCO3- included only Amphiroa and Jania. The isotopic signature evidenced the activity of CCM, but it was inconclusive about the preferential uptake of HCO3- and CO2 in photosynthesis and the CCM type expressed in macroalgae. In the study of carbon use strategies, diverse, species-specific, and complementary techniques to the isotopic tools are required.

AB  - Although carbonate ramps are widely described from the geological record, there is still a debate on the relative influence of water temperature, trophic conditions and type of carbonate factories on their development. The ca 2400 km long Australian North West Shelf is among the largest Cenozoic carbonate provinces worldwide, and records a transition from an early Miocene ramp to a middle Miocene rimmed platform. This change is observable on publicly available seismic data, giving the opportunity to investigate environmental influences on platform evolution. This study combines macroscopic and petrographic descriptions of early Miocene strata cropping out in the Cape Range Anticline (North West Cape, southern end of the North West Shelf) and of time-equivalent well cuttings from the adjacent, offshore Exmouth Sub-basin. Particular emphasis is placed on the identification of larger benthic foraminifera at a broad generic level, because differing taxa have a limited range of habitable conditions that serve as environmental proxies. The results show that early Miocene strata are dominantly composed of larger benthic foraminifera with minor coralline algae in the proximal platform, grading to micropackstones in the more distal platform. A ramp margin is inferred from the lithological data on the basis of the lack of framework builders and the presence of open oceanic indicators. Facies shallow upward through individual outcrops, with a proximal to distal trend towards the north-west. These trends along outcrops are consistent with the seismic interpretations. Identification of taxa with warm, oligotrophic water affinity suggests that the ramp was formed in an oligotrophic and warm ocean, despite the absence of coral reefs. Changes of carbonate facies with depth do not seem to be associated with changes in ramp morphology, and the latter may have been controlled by physical oceanic parameters, such as offshore currents and waves.

AB  - The painful nature of lameness makes it a serious welfare issue. Early detection and management of lameness is paramount. In the present case report, a 20-months-old dairy cow was referred with a history of acute lameness (locomotion score 5, on a scale of 5-point). Infrared thermography was used as a useful addition to the diagnostic tools available to clinicians, as it can detect localised variations in temperature and have a great potential to assist diagnosis in bovine lameness. The evaluation of subtle temperature variation associated with inflammatory conditions is a very important indicator to detect inflammation associated with lameness. In this case, the use of the preclinical thermographic examination was capable of pinpointing the location in the area of the greatest inflammation to focus radiographs. Following this procedure, physical and radiographic examinations were taken of the detected area and were evaluated. A non-weight bearing lameness of the right forelimb and a swelling medial hoof that was painful upon palpation was noticed. Radiographic images showed a dislocation of the distal interphalangeal. Conservative management was performed by placing the healthy claw on a block to alleviate weight bearing on the affected claw and the half - limb cast was used for immobilization of phalangeal for 25 days. Complete joint ankylosis was evident on radiographs, one month after. Effectiveness of all treatment measures was monitored through continual locomotion scoring. Clinical outcome was excellent. The management of lameness is centred on improving the welfare of the cow. Although the function of the ankylosed digit is reduced, it still plays a part in bearing weight; movement at pasture and on slatted floors remains satisfactory. The advantages of a conservative approach and a clinical management, if there are adequate conditions, allow to salvage the digit which a long productive life can still be expected, reduce costs for the owner and avoid complications after surgery.

AB  - While the concept of structural monitoring has been around for a number of decades, it remains under-exploited in practice. A main driver for this shortcoming lies in the difficulty to robustly and autonomously interpret the information that is extracted from dynamic data. This hindrance in properly deciphering the collected information may be attributed to the uncertainty that is inherent in i) the finite set of measured data, ii) the models employed for capturing the manifested dynamics, and more importantly, iii) the susceptibility of these systems to variations in Environmental and Operational Parameters (EOPs). In previous work of the authors, a Gaussian Process (GP) time-series approach has been introduced, which serves as a hierarchical input-output method to account for the influence of EOPs on structural response. This in turn enables a robust structural identification. In this scheme, the short-term dynamics are modeled by means of linear-in-the-parameters time-series models, while EOV dependence - acting on a long-term time scale - is achieved via GP regression of the model coefficients on measured EOPs. This work corresponds to a further advancement on this modeling approach, corresponding to its generalization to the vector response case. Particularly, the problem of global identification here is solved via an Expectation-Maximization algorithm tailored to the GP time-series model structure. Moreover, an EOP-dependent innovations covariance matrix is integrated in the model, which helps to capture variation in the vibration power. The resulting model does not only have the capability to represent the long-term response of a structure under variable EOPs, but also facilitates the enhanced tracking of modal quantities in contrast to traditional operational modal analysis techniques. The proposed approach is exemplified on the identification of the vibration response of a simulated wind turbine blade at different points along the blade axis in the flap-wise direction, under variability of both the acting wind speeds and ambient temperatures.

AB  - Sustainable forestry and wood utilisation can play an important role in strengthening a renewable resource-based bioeconomy. Governing associated structural change processes is a complex task; it involves handling multiple demands on forests in a changing climate and the creation and perpetuation of innovation-friendly framework conditions in a variety of sectors and industries. In Germany, the Charter for Wood 2.0 ("Charta fur Holz 2.0") has been established as a multi-actor governance process to increase contributions of sustainable forestry and wood use to climate change mitigation, value creation and resource efficiency. This article develops the methodological framework for the evaluation accompanying the Charter.
   Designing evaluations of multi-actor governance processes in the context of long-term sustainability transitions brings about specific challenges. The existence of multiple interacting aims, the variety of responsible policy levels and actor groups, and the evolving nature of the Charter's instrument mix imply that establishing causal relationships between specific measures and outcomes can be associated with considerable uncertainty. To address this, we adopt a learning-oriented, systemic approach rooted in innovation system analysis, which provides a framework for examining complex cause-effect relationships. Moreover, a participatory approach can promote the relevance of findings for decision-making processes, although certain challenges (relating e.g. to maintaining active participation over time and balancing different perspectives) need to be taken into account.
   Based on insights from evaluation research, we propose an evaluation concept for the Charter and discuss first lessons from its application. The concept encompasses (i) an outcome-oriented evaluation, which uses indicators to monitor developments in the Charter's fields of action and examines causes of developments in in-depth analyses; (ii) a process-oriented evaluation, which reflects on outputs of the Charter process and examines potential options for further developing the process. Additionally, short supplementary analyses may examine changes in external framework conditions.

AB  - Grasslands play a significant role in livestock fodder production and thus, contribute to food security worldwide while providing numerous additional ecosystem services. However, how agroclimatic conditions and adverse weather events relevant for grasslands will change across the European grassland areas has not been examined to date. Using a single reference setup for soil and management over 476 European sites defined by climate stations, we show the probability of eight selected adverse weather events with the potential to significantly affect grassland productivity under climate change and how these events vary regionally across Europe. Changes in these eight key agroclimatic indicators create markedly specific spatial patterns. We found that by 2050, the exposure of the south and west European grasslands to heat and drought may double in comparison with today and that the area with frequent occurrences of heat and drought will expand northwards. However, across Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltic countries to southern Finland and Sweden, the likelihood of these events is likely to decrease. While changing cultivars and management strategies are unavoidable, shifting grassland production to other regions to reduce the risk may not be possible as the risk of adverse events beyond the key grassland-growing areas increases even further. Moreover, we found marked changes in the overall thermal and water regimes across European regions. The effect of adverse weather events in the future could be different in other regions of the world compared to regions in Europe, emphasizing the importance of conducting similar analyses for other major grassland producing regions. To mitigate the impact of climate change, new ways of maintaining grassland productivity need to be developed. These methods include more efficient selection of species mixtures for specific regions, including increased use of legumes and forbs; incorporation of new genetic resources, including the development of hybrid cultivars, such as Festulolium hybrids; and incorporation of state-of-the-art technologies in breeding programs and new grazing management.

AB  - The dormancy and the growth of trees in temperate climates are synchronized with seasons. Preparation for dormancy and its proper progression are key for survival and development in the next season. Using a unique approach that combined microscopy and proteomic methods, we investigated changes in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) embryonic shoots during four distinct stages of dormancy in natural weather conditions. We identified 13 proteins that varied among dormancy stages, and were linked to regulation of protein level; functioning of chloroplasts and other plastids; DNA and RNA regulation; and oxidative stress. We also found a group of five proteins, related to cold hardiness, that did not differ in expression among stages of dormancy, but had the highest abundancy level. Ultrastructure of organelles is tightly linked to their metabolic activity, and hence may indicate dormancy status. The observed ultrastructure during endodormancy was stable, whereas during ecodormancy, the structural changes were dynamic and related mainly to nucleus, plastids and mitochondria. At the ultrastructural level, the lack of starch and the presence of callose in plasmodesmata in all regions of embryonic shoot were indicators of full endodormancy. At the initiation of ecodormancy, we noted an increase in metabolic activity of organelles, tissue-specific starch hyperaccumulation and degradation. However, in proteomic analysis, we did not find variation in expression of proteins related to starch degradation or to symplastic isolation of cells. The combination of ultrastructural and proteomic methods gave a more complete picture of vegetative bud dormancy than either of them applied separately. We found some changes at the structural level, but not their analogues in the proteome. Our study suggests a very important role of plastids' organization and metabolism, and their protection in the course of dormancy and during the shift from endo- to ecodormancy and the acquisition of growth competence.

AB  - Model-based global projections of future land-use and land-cover (LULC) change are frequently used in environmental assessments to study the impact of LULC change on environmental services and to provide decision support for policy. These projections are characterized by a high uncertainty in terms of quantity and allocation of projected changes, which can severely impact the results of environmental assessments. In this study, we identify hotspots of uncertainty, based on 43 simulations from 11 global-scale LULC change models representing a wide range of assumptions of future biophysical and socioeconomic conditions. We attribute components of uncertainty to input data, model structure, scenario storyline and a residual term, based on a regression analysis and analysis of variance. From this diverse set of models and scenarios, we find that the uncertainty varies, depending on the region and the LULC type under consideration. Hotspots of uncertainty appear mainly at the edges of globally important biomes (e.g., boreal and tropical forests). Our results indicate that an important source of uncertainty in forest and pasture areas originates from different input data applied in the models. Cropland, in contrast, is more consistent among the starting conditions, while variation in the projections gradually increases over time due to diverse scenario assumptions and different modeling approaches. Comparisons at the grid cell level indicate that disagreement is mainly related to LULC type definitions and the individual model allocation schemes. We conclude that improving the quality and consistency of observational data utilized in the modeling process and improving the allocation mechanisms of LULC change models remain important challenges. Current LULC representation in environmental assessments might miss the uncertainty arising from the diversity of LULC change modeling approaches, and many studies ignore the uncertainty in LULC projections in assessments of LULC change impacts on climate, water resources or biodiversity.

AB  - Wood is a renewable resource and it actively contributes to enhance energy production under a sustainable perspective. However, harvesting, transport and use of wood imply several consequences and impacts on environment. There are different ways for managing forests dedicated to wood production and a sustainable approach is fundamental to preserve the resource. In this context, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a useful tool for estimating the environmental impacts related to renewable resources. Traditional coppice is a common approach for forest management in several areas, including southern Europe and, specifically, Italy, Spain and the Balkans.
   Due to different terrain conditions, different types of forest operations are considered for wood extraction from coppices, where the main product is firewood used in domestic heating. The aim of this work was to compare the main common systems for firewood production in two different terrain conditions ('flat/low steep' and 'steep/very steep' terrains), in a representative environment for Mediterranean area, located in central Italy, by means of LCA. Seven different impact categories were evaluated in a cradle-to-gate perspective taking into account all the operations carried out from the trees felling to the firewood storage at factory.
   Results showed that the extraction phase was the most important in terms of environmental burdens in firewood production and the use of heavy and high-power machines negatively influenced the emissions compared with manual operations. Finally, considering the general low-inputs involved in wood production in coppice, the transport of workers by car to the work site resulted on consistent contributions into environmental burdens. An additional analysis about the modifications of CH4 and N2O exchanges between soil and atmosphere, due to soil compaction in the extraction phase, was made and based on bibliographic information. Results showed a sensible difference between disturbed and undisturbed soil. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Dredging activities can cause environmental impacts due to, among other, the increase of the Suspended Solid Concentration (SSC) and their subsequent dispersion and deposition (DEP) far from the dredging point. The dynamics of the resulting dredging plume can strongly differ in spatial and temporal evolution. This evolution, for both conventional mechanical and hydraulic dredges, depends on the different mechanisms of sediment release in water column and the site-specific environmental conditions. Several numerical models are currently in use to simulate the dredging plume dynamics. Model results can be analysed to study dispersion and advection processes at different depths and distances from the dredging source. Usually, scenarios with frequent and extreme meteomarine conditions are chosen and extreme values of parameters (i.e. maximum intensity or total duration) are evaluated for environmental assessment. This paper presents a flexible, consistent and integrated methodological approach. Statistical parameters and indexes are derived from the analysis of SSC and DEP simulated time-series to numerically estimate their spatial (vertical and horizontal) and seasonal variability, thereby allowing a comparison of the effects of hydraulic and mechanical dredges. Events that exceed defined thresholds are described in term of magnitude, duration and frequency. A new integrated index combining these parameters, SSCnum, is proposed for environmental assessment. Maps representing the proposed parameters allow direct comparison of effects due to different (mechanical and hydraulic) dredges at progressive distances from the dredging zone. Results can contribute towards identification and assessment of the potential environmental effects of a proposed dredging project. A suitable evaluation of alternative technical choices, appropriate mitigation, management and monitoring measure is allowed in this framework. Environmental Risk Assessment and Decision Support Systems (DSS) may take advantage of the proposed tool. The approach is applied to a hypothetical dredging project in the Augusta Harbour (Eastern coast of Sicily Island Italy). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aims of this study were to identify the species distribution pattern at local and watershed scales, the response to variation of environmental conditions, and the local factors structuring fish communities in Liao River Basin. A total of 187 sites were sampled during May 2009 to June 2010. Univariate and multivariate methods were conducted to identify the variation of species richness and composition. We identified 56 species in the basin, and the predominant orders were Cypriniformes (33 species) and Perciformes (10 species). Species richness degraded seriously (from 106 to 56 species) compared with the data obtained during the 1980s. Based on the similarity of fish communities, the sampling sites were divided into three groups. Group 1 was distributed in the Hun-Tai River Basin located in the southeast region with less anthropogenic disturbance, and was characterized by high physical habitat quality (high velocity, habitat score, and coarse substrate) and water quality. The other two groups were mainly distributed in the main stem and its tributaries, with more stress (high conductivity, CODMn, NH4(+), and sand substrate) caused by agriculture and urban industry. Species richness increased along a longitudinal gradient and reached the maximum in Group 2. The distribution pattern of fish communities was analogue with the scheme of the Grade I aquatic eco-functional zonings and can be used as a good indicator with high verification ability. The indicator species of Group 1 were all small-sized and sensitive to environmental stress, while those species of Groups 2 and 3 were more tolerant. Physical habitat (velocity, habitat score, cobble plus boulder, and dissolved oxygen) and chemical pollutants (NH4(+), CODMn, conductivity, and TN) structured the fish communities at the local scale. The degradation of environmental condition reduced physical habitat, water quality, and sensitive taxa in the downstream sections of Liao River Basin. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to clarify and discuss how quality, relevance, attitudes, beliefs and transfer value act as underlying driving forces in the development of the Cultural Heritage theme in EIAs. One purpose is to identify and discuss some conditions that can better environmental assessment in order to increase the significance of EIA in decision-making with regard to Cultural Heritage.
   The main tools used are different research methods designed for analyses of quality and quality changes, primarily based on the relevant opinions of 160 people occupied with Cultural Heritage in EIA in Norway. The study is based on a review of 40 types of EIAs from 1991 to 2000, an online questionnaire to 319 (160 responded) individuals from 14 different backgrounds, and interviews with three institutions in Sweden and Denmark.
   The study confirms a steadily increasing quality on EIRs over time, parallel with an improvement of the way in which Cultural Heritage is treated in EIA. This is supported by both the interviews and the qualitative comments regarding the survey. Potential for improvements is shown to be a need for more detailed background material as well as more use of adequate methods.
   The survey shows the existence of a wide variety of negative views, attitudes and beliefs, but the consequences of this are difficult to evaluate. However, most certainly, negative attitudes and beliefs have not been powerful enough to be detrimental to the quality of Cultural Heritage component, as nothing in the study indicates that negative attitudes and myths are undermining the system of EIA.
   The study shows the importance of having on-going discussions on quality and quality change over time by people involved in EIA, and how this is a necessary condition for successful implementation and acceptance. Beliefs and negative attitudes can also be a catalyst for developing better practice and advancing new methodology. In addition, new EIA countries must be prepared for several years of development and improvements after implementation. This is important in order to gain acceptance from the bureaucracy, especially from the Cultural Heritage authorities and local population. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Dung-pats excreted directly on pasture from grazing animals can contribute a significant burden of faecal microbes to agricultural land. The aim of this study was to use a combined field and modelling approach to determine the importance of Escherichia coli growth in dung-pats when predicting faecal bacteria accumulation on grazed grassland. To do this an empirical model was developed to predict the dynamics of an E. coli reservoir within 1 ha plots each grazed by four beef steers for six months. Published first-order die-off coefficients were used within the model to describe the expected decline of E. coli in dung-pats. modelled estimates using first-order kinetics led to an underestimation of the observed E coli land reservoir, when using site-specific die-off coefficients. A simultaneous experiment determined the die-off profiles of E. coli within fresh faeces of beef cattle under held relevant conditions and suggested that faecal bacteria may experience growth and re-growth in the period post defecation when exposed to a complex interaction of environmental drivers Such as variable temperature, UV radiation and moisture levels. This growth phase in dung-pats is not accounted for in models based on first-order die-off coefficients. When the model was amended to incorporate the growth of E. coli, equivalent to that observed in the field study, the prediction of the E. coli reservoir was improved with respect to the observed data and produced a previously unquantified step-change improvement in model predictions of the accumulation of these faecal bacteria on grasslands. Results from this study suggest that the use of first-order kinetic equations for determining land-based reservoirs of faecal bacteria should be approached with caution and greater emphasis placed on accounting for actual Survival patterns observed under field relevant conditions.

AB  - Leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula-virgata), a native of Eurasia, is a serious invasive weed of grasslands of the northern Great Plains of the U.S. and prairie provinces of Canada. Leafy spurge is very difficult to control with herbicides, insect biological control agents, and other cultural practices. Previous field investigations revealed pathogen-insect interactions on the roots of leafy spurge leading to mortality. In order to exploit this synergistic relationship as an effective biological control strategy, we undertook an exploration of Europe for soilborne fungi and rhizosphere bacteria on Euphorbia spp. growing in a wide variety of soils in different landscapes. All microbial cultures were screened for growth suppressive or disease potential on leafy spurge plants or callus tissue. Study objectives were to determine relationships of some edaphic factors and host plant conditions with biological control activity, and to screen rhizobacteria isolated from Euphorbia spp. for traits that might contribute to suppression of leafy spurge growth. The most virulent soilborne fungal strains of Fusarium and Rhizoctonia species, based on greenhouse pathogenicity tests, were isolated from roots of Euphorbia spp. with insect feeding damage. High proportions (> 50%) of rhizobacteria were classified as deleterious rhizobacteria (DRB) using a callus tissue bioassay. Euphorbia spp. at sites with high DRB numbers displayed severe fungal disease symptoms and supported insect infestations. Selected soil properties were not correlated with potential biocontrol activity of microbes on leafy spurge; however, insect presence and disease ratings were associated with incidence of growth-suppressive microbes. Certain physiological traits (i.e., exopolysaccharides and hydrogen cyanide production) were good indicators of deleterious activity of rhizobacteria. Our study illustrates that the most effective condition for inducing disease and subsequent mortality of leafy spurge includes a synergism between plant-associated microorganisms and root-damaging insects. Furthermore, the results are valuable for identifying sites for collecting soilborne microorganisms on weeds in their native range for evaluation as biocontrol agents in their invasive range.

AB  - In recent years, considerable investment has been committed to sewerage infrastructure and new sewage treatment plants in the catchment surrounding an estuarine basin along the north-west coast of England. Although this capital investment has resulted in a marked reduction in the input of bacterial loads, relatively high counts of faecal indicator organisms are still being encountered in the coastal receiving waters, and the local bathing waters continue to fail on occasions to comply with the European Community (EC) Bathing Water Directive (1976) mandatory standards. Details are given herein of a comprehensive modelling study aimed at quantifying the impact of various bacterial inputs into the estuary and surrounding coastal waters on the bathing water quality. The model domain includes the coastal area and the entire estuary (namely the Ribble) up to the tidal limits of its tributaries. Faecal coliforms have been used as the main water quality indicator organisms. The numerical model developed for this study combines a depth integrated two-dimensional coastal model and a cross-sectionally integrated one-dimensional river model, and is capable of predicting water surface elevations, velocity fields and faecal coliform concentration distributions across the entire model domain. The hydrodynamic model was calibrated using water level and velocity measurements from three surveys and then validated against measured data from three other surveys. In order to predict the faecal coliform concentration distributions, variable faecal coliform decay rates were used, i.e. different values of decay rates were applied to the coastal and riverine waters, for day- and nighttime, and for wet and dry weather conditions. The maximum and minimum decay rates used were 2.32/day and 0.71/day, for the dry and wet weather surveys, respectively. The model was then applied to (i) assess the impact of previous discharge strategies and investigate the effectiveness of future capital investment works and (ii) predict the impact of a range of strategic options, including: the effects of adding UV treatment, constructing storm water storage tanks and incorporating various combined sewer overflow (CSO) discharge scenarios for different weather conditions.

AB  - Agro-meteorological condition plays a fundamental role in crop production. For a specific region, the comprehensive effects of multiple meteorological factors are important indicators for the climatic suitability of the crops. To evaluate the synthetic effects, an integrated climatic assessment indicator (ICAI) are developed in Jiangsu Province, China. A newly produced meteorological assimilation driving datasets (CMADS V1.0) combined with observation data are used in establishing the indicator. The procedure to construct the indicator involves building statistical crop models by meteorological factors and determining the indicator values by classification. In modeling, two machine learning algorithms: Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are compared and the classification model of RF is chosen to build ICAI due to its better performance in the independent test set. To determine a reasonable division in classification, distribution detection of climatic yield is carried out and Monte Carlo simulations are applied for the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. The generated indicator includes three values: yield loss, normal and yield increment, with the spatial and temporal prediction accuracy from 67.86% to 100% in the test set for the Northern, Central and Southern Jiangsu. The ICAI are used to estimate the past climatic suitability of winter wheat and the future suitability under global warming conditions in Jiangsu Province. The results show that the climate in 1990s has more adverse effects on wheat production than the other two sub-periods in Northern and Southern Jiangsu. The adaptability of wheat production in Southern Jiangsu has improved greatly to the local environments during the past three decades. In addition, when annual temperature accelerates upwards, both possibilities of yield loss in Northern Jiangsu and yield increment in Southern Jiangsu will increase. Therefore, more concerns should be given to the North in future warming climate, while yield potential in the South may be further improved in this circumstance.

AB  - There is widespread interest in how geochemistry affects the genomic makeup of microbial communities, but the possible impacts of oxidation-reduction (redox) conditions on the chemical composition of biomacromolecules remain largely unexplored. Here we document systematic changes in the carbon oxidation state, a metric derived from the chemical formulas of biomacromolecular sequences, using published metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets from 18 studies representing different marine and terrestrial environments. We find that the carbon oxidation states of DNA, as well as proteins inferred from coding sequences, follow geochemical redox gradients associated with mixing and cooling of hot spring fluids in Yellowstone National Park (USA) and submarine hydrothermal fluids. Thermodynamic calculations provide independent predictions for the environmental shaping of the gene and protein composition of microbial communities in these systems. On the other hand, the carbon oxidation state of DNA is negatively correlated with oxygen concentration in marine oxygen minimum zones. In this case, a thermodynamic model is not viable, but the low carbon oxidation state of DNA near the ocean surface reflects a low GC content, which can be attributed to genome reduction in organisms adapted to low-nutrient conditions. We also present evidence for a depth-dependent increase of oxidation state at the species level, which might be associated with alteration of DNA through horizontal gene transfer and/or selective degradation of relatively reduced (AT-rich) extracellular DNA by heterotrophic bacteria. Sediments exhibit even more complex behavior, where carbon oxidation state minimizes near the sulfate-methane transition zone and rises again at depth; markedly higher oxidation states are also associated with older freshwater-dominated sediments in the Baltic Sea that are enriched in iron oxides and have low organic carbon. This geobiochemical study of carbon oxidation state reveals a new aspect of environmental information in metagenomic sequences, and provides a reference frame for future studies that may use ancient DNA sequences as a paleoredox indicator.

AB  - An integrated geochemical and molecular characterisation of the Cretaceous Lamja Formation shale and coal sediments from the Yola Sub-basin, Northern Benue Trough, northeastern Nigeria, has been undertaken to provide an overview on the origin, richness, hydrocarbon generation potential and paleodepositional conditions. This study is based on geochemical analyses of whole rock (total organic carbon content, pyrolysis, bitumen extraction and biomarker distributions) and vitrinite measurements. The total organic carbon (TOC) contents of the Lamja Formation range from 0.8 to 63 % and 0.8 to 1.16 % for coal and shale samples, respectively, with an average TOC value of 43.87 %. The hydrogen index of these samples ranges from 93.1 to 228 mg hydrocarbon (HC)/g TOC. The kerogen is predominantly type III with a significant mixture of type II kerogens, indicative of mainly gas with limited liquid hydrocarbon-generating potential. The analysed Lamja Formation samples have vitrinite reflectance in the range of 0.57-0.82 %R-o and pyrolysis temperature at maximum (T (max)) in the range of 435-451 A degrees C which indicate that the samples are thermally mature and entered early mature to peak oil window stage. The molecular geochemical biomarkers are characterised by dominant odd carbon numbered n-alkanes in the range of n-C-23 to n-C-33, moderately high pristane/phytane (Pr/Ph) ratios (1.77-4.16), very high C-27 17 alpha(H)-22,29,30-trisnorhopane/C-27 18 alpha(H)-22,29,30-trisnorneohopane (Tm/Ts) ratios (> 10) and high concentrations of regular sterane C-29, indicating suboxic to oxic conditions, typical of delta plain/coastal marine environment of deposition with prevalent contribution of land plants and minor aquatic organic matter input. The occurrence of oleanane in the analysed samples is also a strong indicator of a terrestrial angiosperm plant source input and the presence of marine influence.

AB  - Because of high diurnal water quality fluctuations in raw municipal wastewater, the use of proportional autosampling over a period of 24 h at municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to evaluate carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus removal has become a standard in many countries. Microbial removal or load estimation at municipal WWTPs, however, is still based on manually recovered grab samples. The goal of this study was to establish basic knowledge regarding the persistence of standard bacterial fecal indicators and Bacteroidetes genetic microbial source tracking markers in municipal wastewater in order to evaluate their suitability for automated sampling, as the potential lack of persistence is the main argument against such procedures. Raw and secondary treated wastewater of municipal origin from representative and well-characterized biological WWTPs without disinfection (organic carbon and nutrient removal) was investigated in microcosm experiments at 5 and 21 degrees C with a total storage time of 32 h (including a 24-h autosampling component and an 8-h postsampling phase). Vegetative Escherichia coli and enterococci, as well as Clostridium perfringens spores, were selected as indicators for cultivation-based standard enumeration. Molecular analysis focused on total (AllBac) and human-associated genetic Bacteroidetes (BacHumUCD, HF183 TaqMan) markers by using quantitative PCR, as well as 16S rRNA gene-based next-generation sequencing. The microbial parameters showed high persistence in both raw and treated wastewater at 5 degrees C under the storage conditions used. Surprisingly, and in contrast to results obtained with treated wastewater, persistence of the microbial markers in raw wastewater was also high at 21 degrees C. On the basis of our results, 24-h autosampling procedures with 5 degrees C storage conditions can be recommended for the investigation of fecal indicators or Bacteroidetes genetic markers at municipal WWTPs. Such autosampling procedures will contribute to better understanding and monitoring of municipal WWTPs as sources of fecal pollution in water resources.

AB  - We simulated fuel reduction treatments on a 16,000 ha study area in Oregon, US, to examine tradeoffs between placing fuel treatments near residential structures within an urban interface, versus treating stands in the adjacent wildlands to meet forest health and ecological restoration goals. The treatment strategies were evaluated by simulating 10,000 wildfires with random ignition locations and calculating burn probabilities by 0.5 m flame length categories for each 30 m x 30 m pixel in the study area. The burn conditions for the wildfires were chosen to replicate severe fire events based on 97th percentile historic weather conditions. The burn probabilities were used to calculate wildfire risk profiles for each of the 170 residential structures within the urban interface, and to estimate the expected (probabilistic) wildfire mortality of large trees (>53.3 cm) that are a key indicator of stand restoration objectives. Expected wildfire mortality for large trees was calculated by building flame length mortality functions using the Forest Vegetation Simulator, and subsequently applying these functions to the burn probability outputs. Results suggested that treatments on a relatively minor percentage of the landscape (10%) resulted in a roughly 70% reduction in the expected wildfire loss of large trees for the restoration scenario. Treating stands near residential structures resulted in a higher expected loss of large trees, but relatively lower burn probability and flame length within structure buffers. Substantial reduction in burn probability and flame length around structures was also observed in the restoration scenario where fuel treatments were located 5-10 km distant. These findings quantify off-site fuel treatment effects that are not analyzed in previous landscape fuel management studies. The study highlights tradeoffs between ecological management objectives on wildlands and the protection of residential structures in the urban interface. We also advance the application of quantitative risk analysis to the problem of wildfire threat assessment. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Research into transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) diseases has become a high priority worldwide in recent years yet remarkably little is known about the behaviour of TSE infectivity in the environment. The resilience and stability of prion proteins could lead to soils becoming a potential reservoir of TSE infectivity as a result of contamination from activities such as infected carcass burial or the dispersion of effluents from slaughter houses, or by contamination of pastures by infected animals, (e.g. scrapie in sheep). Knowledge of the fate of prion proteins in soils, and associated physico-chemical conditions which favour migration, can be used to help prevent re-infection of animals through grazing, to protect watercourses and develop good management practices. In two consecutive experiments of 9 and 6 months, the migration of recombinant ovine PrP (recPrP) in soil columns was followed under contrasting levels of microbial activity (normal versus reduced), under varying regimes of soil water content and redox potential, and in two different soil types (loamy sand and clay loam). At each analysis time (1, 3, 6 or 9 months), in both soil types, full-length recPrP was detected in the original contaminated layer, indicating the resilience and stability of recPrP under varied soil conditions, even in the presence of active soil microbial populations. Evidence of protein migration was found in every soil column at the earliest analysis time (1 or 3 months), but was restricted to a maximum distance of 1 cm, indicative of limited initial mobility in soils followed by strong adsorption over the following days to weeks. The survival of recPrP in the soil over a period of at least 9 months was demonstrated. In this study, recPrP was used as an indicator for potential TSE infectivity, although infectivity tests should be carried out before conclusions can be drawn regarding the infection risk posed by prions in soil. However, it has been demonstrated that soil is likely to act as a significant barrier to the dispersion of contaminated material at storage or burial sites. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Air pollution in the mountains occurs from time to time. Because of its serious harm, it has attracted widespread and high attention from the whole society. In this regard, many fruitful researches have been carried out at home and abroad and have been widely used. In the development of the analysis theory of the causes of traffic accidents, the theory of system causes is a relatively comprehensive theory, which systematically analyzes the causes of traffic accidents from many aspects in order to find its internal connections. The rise and development of data mining provide powerful tools for the practical application of this theory. There are many small cities and they are facing serious air pollution problems, but there are few studies on the characteristics of air pollution in mountainous urban and rural areas and their influencing factors. Taking the deep mountain area as an example, this paper analyzes the temporal and spatial characteristics of air environmental quality in mountainous urban and rural areas with SO2, PM10, PM2.5, NO2, CO, and O-3 as the main analysis indicators, and compares them with plain cities at the same latitude and studies the characteristics of urban and rural air pollution in mountainous areas and its relationship with terrain and meteorological conditions. Based on the analysis results of the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of air pollution factors, topography and meteorological effects on air pollution and human activities, the characteristics of air pollution in mountainous areas are summarized, and prevention and control measures adapted to local conditions are proposed. Finally, as an important form of artistic expression in urban public spaces, urban public art plays an important role in improving the level of urban cultural construction. At present, the public's demand for participating in urban public art is becoming stronger and stronger. Taking technological development as the starting point, this article explores the innovative path of urban public art design based on interactive experience.

AB  - This study presents the linear theory of thermohaline-shear instability, which is realized in oceanic flows that are dynamically and diffusively stable. The framework is based on the unbounded Couette model, which makes it possible to decouple the destabilizing effects of spatially uniform shear from instabilities caused by the presence of inflection points in velocity profiles. The basic state is assumed to be time dependent, which reflects the role of internal waves in controlling fine-scale shear. Linear stability analysis suggests that conditions for thermohaline-shear instability are met in most ocean regions where temperature and salinity concurrently increase downward. We conclude that thermohaline-shear instability represents a plausible mechanism for the initiation of active diffusive convection, which, in turn, is essential for the formation of thermohaline staircases and maintenance of double-diffusive interleaving.
   Plain Language Summary Warming and decline in sea ice coverage of the Arctic Ocean represent an unambiguous indicator of the ongoing climate change. A critical process in the transition of the Arctic to the new state involves heating of near-surface waters from below. Relatively warm waters enter the Arctic from the Atlantic Ocean and spread throughout the basin at depths of 150-900 m. These waters contain more than enough heat to melt all the sea ice, but it is not clear how this heat can be transferred upward to the surface. In particular, above the warm Atlantic Water lies a region marked by the presence of horizontal layers of 1-10 m thick with almost uniform temperatures in each layer. Stacks of these layers are often called "staircases," in a neat reference to step-like changes of temperature. Staircases act as a heat transport bottleneck in the upper Arctic, which demands full understanding of their physics for the purpose of climate prediction. This study explains their origin by showing that smooth temperature patterns are inherently unstable for the conditions commonly realized in the upper Arctic. Thus, even if nature initially creates a smooth temperature distribution, such stratification can spontaneously buckle due to its instability and form a staircase.

AB  - The recently proposed global and local calibrations for the mean annual air temperature (MAT) reconstruction on the basis of 5- and 6-methyl brGDGTs have rarely been applied to the Chinese LPS yet, leaving the applicability of these calibrations unclear. Here, we used the improved chromatography method to analyze 198 loess-paleosol samples from the Weinan section in the southern CLP for the past 350 kyr. The 6-methyl brGDGTs comprise a major proportion of total brGDGTs, pointing to alkaline conditions for most soil samples from the Weinan LPS. The decoupled profile variation of MBT'(6ME) and MBT'(5ME) suggests their response to different enviromental factors, possibly soil pH (or soil moisture) and temperature, respectively. This discrimination further corraborates that temperature and monsoonal precipitation were not in phase during the last four deglaciations on the CLP. Temperature estimates for the six calibrations tested show similar trends but remarkably differ in amplitudes. The soil moisture appears to affect the global MBT'/CBT calibration, the global MAT(mr) calibration (a calibration based on the multiple linear regression) and the Chinese local SSM (Stepwise Selection Method) calibration, resulting in a significant underestimation of late Holocene temperature. In contrast, the dry climate has no effect on the global MBT'5(ME) calibration. Of the six calibrations, only the Chinese local SSM calibration and global MAT(mr) calibration produce temperature variation amplitude over the past 350 ka that is consistent with other independent proxy data. The recently proposed local calibrations based on 5- and 6-methyl brGDGTs for North China yield the amplitude of temperature changes that is much larger than the results determined by other approaches. All the six calibrations have their own weakness in the MAT reconstruction, due partly to the inconsistency between the brGDGT distribution in the Weinan LPS and the modern soils used to establish these calibrations.

AB  - Profiling post-translational modifications represents an alternative dimension to gene expression data in characterizing cellular processes. Many cellular responses to drugs are mediated by changes in cellular phosphosignaling. We sought to develop a common platform on which phosphosignaling responses could be profiled across thousands of samples, and created a targeted MS assay that profiles a reduced-representation set of phosphopeptides that we show to be strong indicators of responses to chemical perturbagens.
   To develop the assay, we investigated the coordinate regulation of phosphosites in samples derived from three cell lines treated with 26 different bioactive small molecules. Phosphopeptide analytes were selected from these discovery studies by clustering and picking 1 to 2 proxy members from each cluster. A quantitative, targeted parallel reaction monitoring assay was developed to directly measure 96 reduced-representation probes. Sample processing for proteolytic digestion, protein quantification, peptide desalting, and phosphopeptide enrichment have been fully automated, making possible the simultaneous processing of 96 samples in only 3 days, with a plate phosphopeptide enrichment variance of 12%. This highly reproducible process allowed similar to 95% of the reduced-representation phosphopeptide probes to be detected in similar to 200 samples.
   The performance of the assay was evaluated by measuring the probes in new samples generated under treatment conditions from discovery experiments, recapitulating the observations of deeper experiments using a fraction of the analytical effort. We measured these probes in new experiments varying the treatments, cell types, and time-points to demonstrate generalizability. We demonstrated that the assay is sensitive to disruptions in common signaling pathways (e.g. MAPK, PI3K/mTOR, and CDK). The high-throughput, reduced-representation phosphoproteomics assay provides a platform for the comparison of perturbations across a range of biological conditions, suitable for profiling thousands of samples. We believe the assay will prove highly useful for classification of known and novel drug and genetic mechanisms through comparison of phosphoproteomic signatures.

AB  - We model the development of shape preferred orientation (SPO) of a large population of two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) rigid clasts suspended in a linear viscous matrix deformed by superposed steady and continuously non-steady plane strain flows to investigate the sensitivity of clasts to changing boundary conditions during a single or superposed deformation events. Resultant clast SPOs are compared to one developed by an identical initial population that experienced a steady flow history of constant kinematic vorticity and reached an identical finite strain state, allowing examination of SPO sensitivity to deformation path. Rotation paths of individual triaxial inclusions are complex, even for steady plane strain flow histories. It has been suggested that the 3D nature of the system renders predictions based on 2D models inadequate for applied clast-based kinematic vorticity gauges. We demonstrate that for a large population of clasts, simplification to a 2D model does provide a good approximation to the SPO predicted by full 3D analysis for steady and non-steady plane strain deformation paths. Predictions of shape fabric development from 2D models are not only qualitatively similar to the more complex 3D analysis, but they display the same limitations of techniques based on clast SPO commonly used as a quantitative kinematic vorticity gauge. Our model results from steady, superposed, and non-steady flow histories with a significant pure shearing component at a wide range of finite strain resemble predictions for an identical initial population that experienced a single steady simple shearing deformation. We conclude that individual 2D and 3D clasts respond instantaneously to changes in boundary conditions, however, in aggregate, the SPO of a population of rigid inclusions does not reflect the late-stage kinematics of deformation, nor is it an indicator of the unique 'mean' kinematic vorticity experienced by a deformed rock volume.

AB  - This study compares the landslide susceptibility maps from four application models, namely, (1) the bivariate model of the Dempster-Shafer based evidential belief function (EBF); (2) integration of the EBF in the knowledge-based analytical hierarchy process (AHP) as a pairwise comparison model processed by using all available causative factors; (3) integration of the EBF in the knowledge-based AHP as a pairwise comparison model by using high nominated causative factor weights only; and (4) integrated EBF in the logistic regression (LR) as a multivariate model by using nominated causative factor weights only. These models were tested in Pohang and Gyeongju Cities (South Korea) by using the geographic information system GIS platform. In the first step, a landslide inventory map consisting of 296 landslide locations were prepared from various data sources. Then, a total of 15 landslide causative factors (slope angle, slope aspect, curvature, surface roughness, altitude, distance from drainages, stream power index, topographic wetness index, wood age, wood diameter, wood type, forest density, soil thickness, soil texture, and soil drainage) were extracted from the database and then converted into a raster. Final susceptibility maps exhibit close results from the two models. Models 1 and 3 predicted 82.3% and 80% of testing data during the analysis, respectively. Thus, Models 1 and 3 show better performance than LR. These resultant maps can be used to extend the capability of bivariate statistical based model, by finding the relationship between each single conditioning factor and landslide locations, moreover, the proposed ensemble model can be used to show the inter-relationships importance between each conditioning factors, without the need to refer to the multivariate statistic. The research outcome may provide powerful tools for natural hazard assessment and land use planning. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Unlike fungal and bacterial diseases, viruses, and related organisms causing the infection are systemic in nature, and symptoms depend on the variety, type and concentration of the agent. Viral diseases cause significant economic damage in orchards and berry plantations, because there is no effective safety-net of viral diseases. Only healthy, virus and related organisms (phytoplasma, viroid, rickettsia) - free plants can produce high yields of quality fruit. Monitoring of apple and raspberry planting material for initial virology condition was made during 2004-2010 at the Institute of Horticulture, Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry, Plant Propagation Centre. Garden plants were tested according to the European Plant Protection Organization pathogen testing requirements, developed for Malus and Rubus plants. 22 apple varieties, 4 apple rootstocks and 21 raspberries varieties, 4 raspberry hybrids with high economic value, grown at Institute of Horticulture cultivar collection orchards, were tested using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) method. Economically important viruses of apple and raspberry were found in plants, grown in Institute of Horticulture's orchards. The prevalence of viruses was low: 1.7% of the analyzed apple trees and 3.2% of the analyzed raspberry bushes were infected. It was established that the apple cultivars 'Alva' and 'Auksis' were infected with Apple chlorotic leaf spot trichovirus (ACLSV) - 2.7% and 25% of the plants of the tested cultivars, respectively. Arabis mosaic nepovirus (ArMV) was detected in 18.2% to 20.0% of plants of the tested raspberry cultivars 'Raniaja sladkaja', 'Novokitajevskaja', 'Beglianka' and 'Zorinka'. Tomato ringspot virus (ToRSV) was detected in the cultivar 'Novostj Kuzmina' - 4.6% of plants of the tested cultivars were infected.
   Fifteen apple cultivars are recommended as suitable for growing in Lithuanian climate conditions. Our aim was to certify these 15 (6 cultivars created in Lithuania and 9 introduced) cultivars. Apple cultivars were tested using three methods - DAS-ELISA, herbaceous and woody indicators. These plants were cultivated in the Institute of Horticulture's orchard, Plant Propagation Centre, during their annual monitoring.

AB  - The Guaiba Basin is a source of drinking water for Porto Alegre (RS, Brazil). The water from this basin receives industrial, urban, and rural waste from many sources. The mussel species Limnoperna fortunei was chosen based on population data, distribution, and sensitivity. Previous tests with comet assay and micronuclei frequency in this freshwater mussel have shown to be successful in biomonitoring studies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genotoxic contamination of the Guaiba Lake Hydrographic Region, through the determination of damage by the micronuclei and comet assays in L. fortunei (golden mussel). Nine sampling sites were evaluated in three different seasons: five sites in the mouths of the main rivers that flow into Guaiba lake; one site at the mouth of a stream; one major site of sewage discharge; two sites at Guaiba lake, near a sewage discharge; and the control site in a preservation area. DNA damage was detected by the single cell gel assay, as well as the frequency of micronuclei in hemocytes of mussels exposed under laboratory conditions for 7 days to water and sediment samples. Significant results were found in different seasons in almost all sampling sites (P < 0.05, ANOVA Dunnet's test). Most of the positive results were found in samples affected mainly by urban effluents. It was possible to observe that there was a weak relation between mutagenic and genotoxic responses and mussels inorganic elements contents. Seasonal variation was observed at different sampling sites, but always indicating a huge contamination near urban sewage discharge. These results are consistent with previous studies, allowing us to infer that urban contamination is the biggest problem in this region. It is also possible to infer that L. fortunei is a good sentinel organism for the Guaiba Basin. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB  - The UK is vulnerable to wildfire, and vulnerability is likely to increase due to climate change. Whilst the risk is small compared with many other countries, recent fires have raised awareness and highlighted the potential for environmental damage and loss of property and key infrastructure. Most UK wildfires are a result of inadvertent or deliberate human action, but the environmental conditions depend on antecedent and current weather. This paper presents projections of the effects of climate change on UK wildfire danger, using a version of an operational fire danger model, UKCP18 climate projections representing low and high emissions, and several indicators of fire danger. Fire danger will increase across the whole of the UK, but the extent and variability in change varies with indicator. The absolute danger now and into the future is greatest in the south and east (the average number of danger days increases 3-4 times by the 2080s), but danger increases further north from a lower base. The variation in change across the UK for indicators based on absolute thresholds is determined by how often those thresholds are exceeded now, whilst the (lesser) variability in percentile-based indicators reflects variability in the projected change in climate. Half of the increase in danger is due to increased temperature, and most of the rest is due to projected reductions in relative humidity. Uncertainty in the magnitude of the change is due to uncertainty in changes in temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall, and there is a large difference between two of the UKCP18 climate model ensembles. Reducing emissions to levels consistent with achieving international climate policy targets significantly reduces, but does not eliminate, the increase in fire danger. The results imply that greater attention needs to be given to wildfire danger in both emergency and spatial planning, and in the development of guidelines for activities that may trigger fires. They suggest the need for the development of a fire danger system more tailored to UK conditions, and the combination of fire danger modelling with projections of sources of ignition to better estimate the change in wildfire risk.

AB  - The Imjingang Belt in the middle-western Korean Peninsula has tectonically been correlated with the Permo-Triassic Qinling-DabieSulu collisional belt between the North and South China cratons in terms of collisional tectonics. Within the belt, crustal-scale extensional ductile shear zones that were interpreted to be formed during collapsing stage with thrusts and folds were reported as evidence of collisional events by previous studies. In this study, we tried to understand the nature of deformation along the southern boundary of the belt in the Munsan area based on the interpretations of recently conducted structural analyses. To figure out the realistic geometry of the study area, the down-plunge projection was carried out based on the geometric relationships between structural elements from the detailed field investigation. We also conducted kinematic interpretations based on the observed shear sense indicators from the outcrops and the oriented thin-sections made from the mylonite samples. The prominent structures of the Munsan area are the regional-scale ENE-WSW striking thrust and the N-S trending map-scale folds, both in its hanging wall and footwall areas. Shear sense indicators suggest both eastward and westward vergence, showing opposite directions on each limb of the map-scale folds in the Munsan area. In addition, observed deformed microstructures from the biotite gneiss and the metasyenite of the Munsan area suggest that their deformation conditions are corresponding to the typical mid-crustal plastic deformation of the quartzofeldspathic metamorphic rocks. These microstructural results combined with the macro-scale structural interpretations suggest that the shear zones preserved in the Munsan area is mostly related to the development of the N-S trending map-scale folds that might be formed by flexural folding rather than the previously reported E-W trending crustal-scale extensional ductile shear zone by PermoTriassic collision. These detailed examinations of the structures preserved in the Imjingang Belt can further contribute to solving the tectonic enigma of the Korean collisional orogen.

AB  - Highly oil prone source rocks containing sapropelic Type I and mixed Types I and III kerogen are found in 233 m of the 500 m deep, fully cored ENRECA-3 well drilled on Bach Long Vi Island, located at the junction between the Beibuwan and the Song Hong basins offshore northern Vietnam. The cored succession is made up entirely by Oligocene, deep lacustrine deposits. The origin of the organic matter (OM) in 62 samples is evaluated on the basis of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS and GC-MS/MS). OM in 55 samples is sourced primarily from lacustrine organisms and contains abundant 4-methylsteranes, tetracyclic polyprenoids (TPP) and lycopane, and no markers for marine organic matter. The proportion of triterpanes derived from angiosperms is low in most saturated fractions and only traces of gymnosperm diterpanes are detected. In contrast, all aromatic fractions have a high proportion of compounds having an origin from both gymnosperms and angiosperms. Very high concentrations of hopanoids in both fractions suggest significant bacterial alteration of the original OM. Most samples have a high concentration of rare C-31 diaromatic 8,14-secohopanes with a fluorene moiety. Low pristane/phytane (Pr/Ph) ratios indicate that anoxic/suboxic bottom water conditions existed during OM accumulation. The presence of beta-carotane, gammacerane and traces of arylisoprenoids could indicate a stratified water column.
   OM in a few samples with lower than average hydrogen index (HI) is mainly of terrestrial origin with a higher proportion of C-29 steranes, diterpanes and oleanoids and lower concentrations of both saturated and aromatic hopanes. Higher Pr/Ph, a higher C-34 isohopane ratio (IHR34) and a lower homohopane index (HHI) indicate that this low-HI OM was originally deposited under more oxic conditions and subsequently transported to deeper water.
   Low sterane and hopane isomerization ratios show that no samples have reached the oil-window. Some novel maturity parameters for immature lacustrine samples are proposed.

AB  - Objective To study the influence of physical work factors on the risks of future disability pension (DP) due to mental or musculoskeletal diagnoses among nursing professionals, care assistants and all other occupations in the general working population in Sweden.
   Methods The prospective population study was based on representative samples of working individuals (n=79 004) aged 16-64, interviewed in the Swedish Work Environment Survey between 1993 and 2013. Information on diagnosed DP in 1994-2014 was gathered from the Social Insurance Agency's database. The focus was on nursing professionals (registered nurses and midwives) and care assistants, for example, assistant nurses and hospital ward assistants. The outcome was DP, classified into two diagnostic groups. Associations between physical work factors and risk of DP were calculated using Cox regression with HR and 95% CI.
   Results Physical work factors were associated with future DP after adjusting for sociodemographic conditions and psychosocial work factors among care assistants (n=10 175) and among all other occupations (n=66 253), but not among nursing professionals (n=2576). The increased risk among care assistants (n=197) exposed to heavy physical work was 66% (HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.39 to 1.97), and for those exposed to strenuous work postures (n=420) it was 56% (HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.35 to 1.80). Physical work indicators were mainly associated with musculoskeletal DP diagnoses among care assistants, but two indicators were significant also for mental diagnoses. An increased risk of DP was found among nursing professionals (n=102) exposed to detergents or disinfectants (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.05), but not among care assistants.
   Conclusions Heavy physical work and strenuous postures are predictors of future DP, particularly among care assistants and in the general working population. In order to reduce early exit from the workforce, efforts should be made to improve physical and ergonomic working conditions.

AB  - Palythoa caribaeorum is a very common colonial zoanthid in the coastal reefs of Brazil. It is known for its massive production of mucus, which is traditionally used in folk medicine by fishermen in northeastern Brazil. This study identified biologically active compounds in P caribaerum mucus. Crude mucus was collected during low tides by the manual scraping of colonies; samples were maintained in an ice bath, homogenized, and centrifuged at 16,000 g for 1 hat 4 degrees C; the supernatant (mucus) was kept at -80 degrees C until use. The enzymatic (proteolytic and phospholipase A(2)), inhibitory (metallo, cysteine and serine proteases), and hemagglutinating (human erythrocyte) activities were determined. The results showed high levels of cysteine and metallo proteases, intermediate levels of phosholipase A(2), low levels of trypsin, and no elastase and chymotrypsin like activities. The mucus showed potent inhibitory activity on snake venom metalloproteases and cysteine proteinase papain. In addition, it showed agglutinating activity towards O+, B+, and A(+) erythrocyte types. The hemostatic results showed that the mucus prolongs the aPTT and PT, and strongly inhibited platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid, collagen, epinephrine, ADP, and thrombin. The antimicrobial activity was tested on 15 strains of bacteria and fungi through the radial diffusion assay in agar, and no activity was observed. Compounds in P. caribaeorum mucus were analyzed for the first time in this study, and our results show potential pharmacological activities in these compounds, which are relevant for use in physiopathological investigations. However, the demonstration of these activities indicates caution in the use of crude mucus in folk medicine. Furthermore, the present or absent activities identified in this mucus suggest that the studied P caribaeorum colonies were in thermal stress conditions at the time of sample collection; these conditions may precede the bleaching process in zoanthids. Hence, the use of mucus as an indicator of this process should be evaluated in the future. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Good animal welfare considers not only the physical and environmental aspects of an animal's well-being, but also their emotional state. Finding measures of animal emotions is an important area of research, as there is a need for objective, reliable and non-invasive measures to assess how an animal is feeling. There is still little known about the use of peripheral temperatures as an indication of emotional state. Previous research has shown that nasal temperatures in cows drop in response to a positive, low arousal emotional state, but similar effects have been seen in other peripheral areas in response to negative, high arousal emotional states. In this study we have sought to explore the effects of both positive and negative, high arousal emotional states on the nasal temperatures of dairy Cows.
   We found that both positive and negative high arousal experiences cause a significant reduction in the nasal temperature of cattle. The introduction of a positive contrast; highly favoured 'concentrates' feed, following a conditioned neutral feed stimulus, elicited the emotional state of excitement and resulted in a significant decrease in nasal temperature (F-(1.90,F-37E16) = 17.36, p < 0.001). As did the negative contrast; an inedible feed following a conditioned positive feed stimulus, which is considered to elicit the emotional state of frustration (F-(2,F-84) = 8.41, p < 0.001). These findings, suggest that significant drops in nasal temperatures are a result of a change in emotional valence, and not descriptive of the type of valence, or a change in arousal. Further research needs to be conducted as there is so little known about the effects of emotional state on peripheral temperatures, particularly positive emotional states. Our findings support previous research to suggest that there is potential for nasal temperatures in cattle to be used as a reliable indicator of changes in emotional valence, although much more needs to be done before we can draw concrete conclusions regarding the effects.

AB  - Miscanthus x giganteus is often regarded as one of the most promising crops to produce bioenergy because it is renowned for its high biomass yields, combined with low input requirements. However, its productivity has been mainly studied in experimental conditions. Our study aimed at characterizing and explaining young M.giganteus yield variability on a farmers' field network located in the supply area of a cooperative society in east central France. It included the first three growth years of the crop. We defined and calculated a set of indicators of limiting factors that could be involved in yield variations and used the mixed-model method to identify those explaining most of the yield variation. Commercial yields averaged 8.1 and 12.8 t DM ha(-1) for the second and third growth year, respectively. However, these mean results concealed a high variability, ranging from 3 to 19 t DM ha(-1). Commercial yields, measured on whole fields, were on average 20% lower than plot yields, measured on a small area (two plots of 25 m(2)). Yields were found to be much more related to shoot density than to shoot mass, and particularly to the shoot density established at the end of the planting year. We highlighted that planting success was decisive and was built during the whole plantation year. Fields with the lowest yields also had the highest weed cover, which was influenced by the distance between the field and the farmhouse, the preceding crop and the soil type. Our findings show that growing young M.giganteus on farmers' fields involves limiting factors different from those commonly reported in the literature for experimental conditions and they could be useful to assess the economic and environmental impacts of growing M.giganteus on farmers' fields. They could also stimulate the discussion about growing bioenergy crops on marginal lands.

AB  - This study was undertaken to investigate whether the accumulation of end products of anaerobic metabolism can be used as an early indicator of deteriorating conditions during transport of live abalone Haliotis midae. A first series of experiments revealed that the enzyme tauropine dehydrogenase, responsible for the production of tauropine, is present in high activities (54 U g wet weight(-1)) in the shell adductor muscle, but D-lactate dehydrogenase, responsible for the production of D-lactate, is the predominantly active enzyme (10 U g wet weight(-1)) in foot muscle. The next series of experiments investigated the potential of anaerobic metabolism in the abalone by subjecting the gastropod to either functional anoxia (exercise metabolism) or 6 h of environmental anoxia (sea-water gassed with. nitrogen). Exercise, primarily powered by the shell adductor muscle, was mainly fueled by glycolysis resulting in the production of tauropine, whereas during 6 h of experimental anoxia, fermentation of glycogen led to the formation of mainly tauropine in the shell adductor muscle and mainly D-lactate in the foot muscle. The last experiment, investigating changes in these metabolites during simulated (abalone packed in oxygen-filled plastic bags resting on foam sponges soaked in seawater) transportation stress of up to 36 h at 7 and 10degreesC, clearly showed that tauropine accumulation in the shell adductor muscle and D-lactate accumulation in the foot muscle is time-dependent. Both metabolites are already produced during the first 6 h of simulated transportation (especially at 10degreesC), indicating that aerobic metabolism is impaired at an early stage of transportation. Hence, these metabolites can serve as indicators of the conditions abalone were subjected to during transport. Furthermore, abalone use the strategy of metabolic depression in this simulation experiment, as indicated by the decreased glycolytic flux in various tissues.

AB  - Habitat quality regulates fitness and population density, making it a key driver of population size. Hence, increasing habitat quality is often a primary goal of species conservation. Yet, assessments of fitness and density are difficult and costly to obtain. Therefore, species conservation often uses "best available science," extending inferences across taxa, space, or time, and inferring habitat quality from studies of habitat selection. However, there are scenarios where habitat selection is not reflective of habitat quality, and this can lead to maladaptive management strategies. The New England cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis) is an imperiled shrubland obligate lagomorph whose successful recovery hinges on creation of suitable habitat. Recovery of this species is also negatively impacted by the non-native eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), which can competitively exclude New England cottontails from preferred habitat. Herein, we evaluate habitat quality for adult and juvenile New England and eastern cottontails using survival and density as indicators. Our findings did not support selection following an ideal free distribution by New England cottontails. Instead, selected resources, which are a target of habitat management, were associated with low survival and density and pointed to a complex trade-off between density, survival, habitat, and the presence of eastern cottontails. Further, movement distance was inversely correlated with survival in both species, suggesting that habitat fragmentation limits the ability of cottontails to freely distribute based on habitat quality. While habitat did not directly regulate survival of juvenile cottontails, tick burden had a strong negative impact on juvenile cottontails in poor body condition. Given the complex interactions among New England cottontails, eastern cottontails, and habitat, directly assessing and accounting for factors that limit New England cottontail habitat quality in management plans is vital to their recovery. Our study demonstrates an example of management for possible ecological trap conditions via the application of incomplete knowledge.

AB  - Imatinib (IMA) is a highly potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor used as first-line anti-cancer drug in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Due to its universal mechanism of action, IMA also has endocrine and mutagenic disrupting effects in vivo and in vitro, which raises the question of its environmental impact. However, to date, very little information is available on its environmental fate and the potential role of its transformation products (TPs) on aquatic organisms. Given the IMA resistance to hydrolysis and direct photolysis according to the literature, we sought to generate TPs through oxidative and radical conditions using the AOPs pathway.
   Thus, the reactivity of the cytotoxic drug IMA in water in the presence of center dot OH and h+ was investigated for the first time in the present work. In this regard, a non-targeted screening approach was applied in order to reveal its potential TPs. The tentative structural elucidation of the detected TPs was performed by LC-HRMSn. The proposed approach allowed detecting a total of twelve TPs, among which eleven are being described for the first time in this work. Although the structures of these TPs could not be positively confirmed due to lack of standards, their chemical formulas and product ions can be added to databases, which will allow their screening in future monitoring studies.
   Using the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) approach and rule-based software, we have shown that the detected TPs possess, like their parent molecule, comparable acute toxicity as well as mutagenic and estrogenic potential. In addition to the in silico studies, we also found that the samples obtained at different exposure times to oxidative conditions, including those where IMA is no longer detected, retained toxicity in vitro. Such results suggest further studies are needed to increase our knowledge of the impact of imatinib on the environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Dry oak forests have one of the richest understory vegetation in Europe, but the environmental drivers of this community have been scarcely revealed. In this study, we assessed whether the amount of light, soil pH or stand heterogeneity affect primarily the species composition of this community. We investigaed 332 sampling plots in 40-165 year old managed and abandoned Quercus cerris and Q. petraea dominated forests in North Hungary. Presence-absence data of herbaceous species and seedlings of woody species were recorded in 28 subplots within each sampling plot. Stand structure, canopy openness and soil pH were also measured in each plot. The relationships between stand characteristics and the species assemblage were explored by redundancy analysis, while the individual responses of species and species groups were studied by generalized linear mixed models. Multivariate methods and individual species response analyses provided similar results, the amount of light and soil pH were equally important variables (both of them explained 2.8% of species variance), while stand heterogeneity had a bit lower, albeit still significant role in determining understory species composition (1.9% of species variance explained). Seedlings of woody species preferred shaded (half-shaded) conditions, while many herbaceous species were positively related to light. The effect of the three explanatory variables was hard to separate, since they influenced each other as well. Sessile oak seedlings and herbs typical of dry forests, forest edges, grasslands and acidic soil habitats preferred light rich habitats with homogeneous stand structure and low soil pH. Mesic forest herbs and seedlings of other woody species were related to relatively high soil pH, heterogeneous stand structure and closed canopy. These two understory types were clearly separated regarding composition. This study emphasizes the importance of heterogenous light conditions and mosaic, diverse forest structure (presence of homogeneous and heterogeneous forest patches) during forest management for the maintenance of understory biodiversity.

AB  - The ability of a bubble column reactor (BCR) to biodegrade a mixture of styrene and acetone vapors was evaluated to determine the factors limiting the process efficiency, with a particular emphasis on the presence of degradation intermediates and oxygen levels. The results obtained under varied loadings and ratios were matched with the dissolved oxygen levels and kinetics of oxygen mass transfer, which was assessed by determination of k(L)a coefficients. A 1.5-L laboratory-scale BCR was operated under a constant air flow of 1.0L.min(-1), using a defined mixed microbial population as a biocatalyst. Maximum values of elimination capacities/maximum overall specific degradation rates of 75.5 gC.m(-3).h(-1)/0.197 gC.gdw(-1).h(-1), 66.0 gC.m(-3).h(-1)/0.059 gC.gdw(-1).h(-1), and 45.8 gC.m(-3).h(-1)/0.027 gC.gdw(-1).h(-1) were observed for styrene/acetone 2:1, styrene-rich and acetone-rich mixtures, respectively, indicating significant substrate interactions and rate limitation by biological factors. The BCR removed both acetone and styrene near-quantitatively up to a relatively high organic load of 50g.m(-3).h(-1). From this point, the removal efficiencies declined under increasing loading rates, accompanied by a significant drop in the dissolved oxygen concentration, showing a process transition to oxygen-limited conditions. However, the relatively efficient pollutant removal from air continued, due to significant oxygen mass transfer, up to a threshold loading rate when the accumulation of acetone and degradation intermediates in the aqueous medium became significant. These observations demonstrate that oxygen availability is the limiting factor for efficient pollutant degradation and that accumulation of intermediates may serve as an indicator of oxygen limitation. Microbial (activated sludge) analyses revealed the presence of amoebae and active nematodes that were not affected by variations in operational conditions.

AB  - Living mulches are generally seen as a possible way to decrease the reliance on pesticides. We investigated the effect of a frost-sensitive legume living mulch on weed control during the autumn and cash crop performance, in winter oilseed rape crops. A field trial was carried out over two years, comparing seven legume species-fenugreek, spring faba bean, grass pea, lentil, field pea, berseem clover and spring common vetch-and three legume mixtures, as living mulches, in crops with two levels of soil mineral nitrogen content before sowing. The presence of the legume living mulch decreased weed abundance before winter. Field pea, berseem clover, common vetch and the common vetch/faba bean/berseem clover mixture were particularly effective, regardless of the growing conditions, decreasing weed abundance by 20-75% with respect to that in the crop grown alone, in the absence of herbicide application. Weed abundance before winter was negatively correlated with total intercrop biomass, and this relationship was dependent on the legume species considered and soil mineral nitrogen content. As with other legume intercrops, the level of soil mineral nitrogen had a strong influence on intercrop structure, modifying the proportion of legume biomass produced. The legume/oilseed rape biomass ratio was also found to be a useful indicator in all growing conditions: the higher the ratio, the more efficient the weed control. However, a high ratio was associated with a higher risk of competition with the cash crop. The choice of the most appropriate legume living mulch is therefore a compromise between the anticipated ecosystem services and the potential disservices provided by the legume mulch. The introduction of a legume living mulch did not entirely prevent weed growth, but was clearly a relevant agroecological solution for decreasing herbicide, while increasing the sustainability and diversity of weed-control strategies in cropping systems.

AB  - Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is characterized by specific temperature requirements and develops best at about 20 A degrees C. High temperatures during the growing season cause an array of changes in potato plants, which affect its development and may lead to a drastic reduction in economic yield. In natural conditions drought and heat stress are two different types of abiotic stresses that occur in the field simultaneously or separately, in the case of irrigation use on potato plantations. The aim of this work was to assess the response of six potato cultivars to high temperature during the subsequent stages of plant growth under conditions of good soil moisture and drought. The pot experiment was carried out with the cultivars: Aruba, Desir,e, Etola, Finezja, Flaming and Tetyda. The impact of high temperature day/ night 35 A degrees C/25 A degrees C on potato plants was tested in three periods: June 16-30, July 1-15 and July 16-30. In these periods half of the plants were watered to a level close to optimal, while the other half remained without irrigation. Final harvest was performed after full maturity of plants in the control combination. Our studies confirm the view that potato productivity is greatly reduced at temperatures higher than optimum. Here we demonstrated that tested potato cultivar's response to high temperature during the growing season is dependent on the growth stage. The earlier a heat occurs, the more negative its impact on the growth and total yield of potatoes. The results obtained in this study indicate that among the tested cultivars 'Tetyda' was the most tolerant to high temperature acting on the plants during the growing season. Our research shows that the total yield is not the only indicator of potato tolerance to high temperature during the growing season, but the assessment should also take into account the occurrence of secondary tuberization and physiological defects of tubers.

AB  - According to economic theory, economic growth is related to Human Capital (HC). Lithuania is associated with countries where a high level of shadow economy exists. This paper examines the issues of human capital development under conditions of shadow economy. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the power and effects of the Lithuanian shadow economy in the context of human capital and to assess the inter-dependence between the power of the shadow economy and human capital. The theoretical justification for research on the inter-dependence between the power of the shadow economy and human capital is based on the analysis of how changes in the human capital structure and indicators reflect the power of the shadow economy and vice versa. Theoretical analysis has been made on the main features and factors of shadow economy and possible tools of human capital evaluation. On the basis of theoretical findings, the model of shadow economy power has been created and using the linear regression method, the dependence of shadow economy power on human capital has been evaluated. The power of the shadow economy has been calculated as a function of population, GDP, trade, unemployment and the labor force. Variables of social development, such as demographic changes and risk of poverty, indicators of HC economic development and indicators of HC economic potential have been used for the research. For the evaluation of the interdependence of the variables, the years 2005-2012 were used. In evaluating human capital under the conditions of the shadow economy, a few periods have been identified and distinguished. Firstly, the results showed that the level of human capital education and unemployment can be described as the most important indicators that reflect the economic environment and shadow economy. Secondly, the increasing level of the shadow economy increases shadow unemployment, and this in turn influences the attraction of direct foreign investment. And finally, research on the influence of separate factors of the shadow economy on variables of human capital could disclose a deeper understanding of the impact of the shadow economy on human capital.

AB  - Terminal drought causes major yield loss in chickpea, so it is imperative to identify genotypes with best suited adaptive traits to secure yield in terminal drought-prone environments. Here, we evaluated chickpea (At) rd29A:: (At) DREB1A transgenic events (RD2, RD7, RD9 and RD10) and their untransformed C235 genotype for growth, water use and yield under terminal water-stress (WS) and well-watered(WW) conditions. The assessment was made across three lysimetric trials conducted in contained environments in the greenhouse (2009GH and 2010GH) and the field (2010F). Results from the greenhouse trials showed genotypic variation for harvest index (HI), yield, temporal pattern of flowering and seed filling, temporal pattern of water uptake across crop cycle, and transpiration efficiency (TE) under terminal WS conditions. The mechanisms underlying the yield gain in the WS transgenic events under 2009 GH trial was related to conserving water for the reproductive stage in RD7, and setting seeds early in RD10. Water conservation also led to a lower percentage of flower and pod abortion in both RD7 and RD10. Similarly, in the 2010GH trial, reduced water extraction during vegetative stage in events RD2, RD7 and RD9 was critical for better seed filling in the pods produced from late flowers in RD2, and reduced percentage of flower and pod abortion in RD2 and RD9. However, in the 2010F trial, the increased seed yield and HI in RD9 compared with C235 came along only with small changes in water uptake and podding pattern, probably not causal. Events RD2 (2010GH), RD7 (2010GH) and RD10 (2009GH) with higher seed yield also had higher TE than C235. The results suggest that DREB1A, a transcription factor involved in the regulation of several genes of abiotic stress response cascade, influenced the pattern of water uptake and flowering across the crop cycle, leading to reduction in the percentage of flower and pod abortion in the glasshouse trials.

AB  - We introduce a method for hydro turbine biological performance assessment (BioPA) to bridge the gap between field and laboratory studies on fish injury and turbine engineering design. Using this method, a suite of biological performance indicators is computed based on simulated data from a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of a proposed hydro turbine design. Each performance indicator is a measure of the probability of exposure to a certain dose of an injury mechanism. If the relationship between the dose of an injury mechanism (stressor) and frequency of injury (dose-response) is known from laboratory or field studies, the likelihood of fish injury for a turbine design can be computed from the performance indicator. By comparing the values of the indicators from various turbine designs, engineers and biologists can identify the more-promising designs and operating conditions to minimize hydraulic conditions hazardous to passing fish. In this paper, the BioPA method is applied to estimate barotrauma induced mortal injury rates for Chinook salmon exposed to rapid pressure changes in Kaplan-type hydro turbines. Following the description of the general method, application of the BioPA to estimate the probability of mortal injury from exposure to rapid decompression is illustrated using a Kaplan hydro turbine at the John Day Dam on the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest region of the USA. The estimated rates of mortal injury increased from 0.3% to 1.7% as discharge through the turbine increased from 334 to 564 m(3)/s for fish assumed to be acclimated to a depth of 5 m. The majority of pressure nadirs occurred immediately below the runner blades, with the lowest values in the gap at the blade tips and just below the leading edge of the blades. Such information can help engineers focus on problem areas when designing new turbine runners to be more fish-friendly than existing units.

AB  - Specialized anglers of Common Carp Cyprinus carpio in Europe and increasingly in North America usually release trophy-sized fish, often following retention in carp sacks, to facilitate photographic memories. This practice is associated with extended air exposure. We assessed the impact of air exposure for a period of 10min after capture and after an additional 9h of retention in carp sacks on the physiology of small carp at two water temperatures (12 degrees C and 22 degrees C) under laboratory conditions. In a complementary field experiment with large carp, we also assessed the effects of air exposure on their physiology and additionally assessed the effects on tissue damage, postrelease behavior (i.e., movement and time rested), and survival. In the laboratory, plasma lactate increased by 24% during air exposure following simulated capture, and blood pH dropped by 0.16 units relative to a capture-only situation. Other physiological variables were unaffected by the treatment. In the field, air exposure after capture did not affect any physiological variables or indicators of tissue damage. During retention in carp sacks, fish recovered from capture, but subsequent air exposure caused a plasma lactate rise of 358% in the laboratory and 89% in the field experiment, and blood pH dropped by 0.38 units in the laboratory relative to that for the retained fish. In the field experiment, postrelease movement was significantly reduced in air-exposed fish, but normalized within 12h. No mortalities occurred within 2 months postrelease. From a fish welfare perspective, our results suggest that photography should be conducted directly following capture without further retention in carp sacks as this approach is less deleterious to the fish. However, there is no benefit in doing so for maintaining carp populations because no substantial mortalities are to be expected. Overall, Common Carp are highly resilient to even extended air exposure.

AB  - Pressure on limited water resources and the environment requires better understanding of how landscape change impacts river flow. Rainfall-runoff models have traditionally focused on estimating total river flows with less emphasis on modelling the groundwater component or the consequences of different land-use change scenarios. In this paper, we present the GWlag model, a water-generation model that predicts river flows with explicit accounting of the impacts of catchment land-use change and surface groundwater interactions. The paper firstly describes the theory that underpins the model and its calibration then presents a case study application in the Tarcutta Creek catchment of the Murray Darling Basin, Australia. The case study aims at: (i) demonstrating the ability of the model to predict daily river flows; (ii) modelling the impacts of hypothetical plantation forestry expansions on river flows; and (iii) showing the impacts of reduced recharge on the low-flow regime using three indices, namely, Q(90)/Q(50) (where Q(n) refers to nth percentile flow), slope of low-flow part of flow duration curve, and % of zero-flow days. Results showed that predicted flows agreed favourably to those observed at the gauge especially during low-flow conditions. The hypothetical plantation expansion from 32% to 87% of the catchment area has resulted in reductions of 48% and 32%, in Q(50) and Q(20), respectively. The low-flow indices demonstrated the great sensitivity of low flow to reductions in recharge with the trend of the low-flow response changing to non-linear for recharge reductions beyond 10%. GWlag daily river flow predictions compared favourably to those obtained from four other rainfall-runoff models in terms of the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (E). However, GWlag produced the highest E-value for log-transformed flows thus highlighting the model's superior predictive capability during low-flow conditions.

AB  - Anthropogenic CO2 emissions lead to chronically elevated seawater CO2 partial pressures (hypercapnia). The induced ocean acidification will very likely be a relevant factor shaping future marine environments. CO2 exposure concomitantly challenges the animal's capacity of acid-base and ionic regulation as well as the ability to maintain energy metabolism and calcification. Under conditions of acute hypercapnia, numerous studies have revealed a broad range of tolerance levels displayed by various marine taxa. Thus, it is well known that, in contrast to many marine invertebrates, most teleost fish are able to fully compensate acid-base disturbances in short-term experiments (hours to several days). in order to determine whether marine fish are able to preserve aerobic scope following long-term incubation to elevated CO2, we exposed two groups of Atlantic Cod for 4 and 12 months to 0.3 and 0.6 kPa P-CO2, respectively. Measurements of standard and active metabolic rates, critical swimming speeds and aerobic scope of long-term incubated cod showed no deviations from control values, indicating that locomotory performance is not compromised by the different levels of chronic hypercapnia. While the maintenance of high activity levels is supported by a 2-fold increased Na+/K+-ATPase protein expression and 2-fold elevated Na+/K+-ATPase activity in the 12 month incubated fish (0.6 kPa P-CO2), no such elevation in Na+/K+-ATPase activity could be observed in the group treated with 0.3 kPa P-CO2. Owing to the relevance of Na+/K+-ATPase as a general indicator for ion regulatory capacity, these results point at an adjustment of enzymatic activity to cope with the CO2 induced acid-base load at 0.6 kPa P-CO2 while under milder hypercapnic conditions the 'standard' Na+/K+-ATPase capacity might still be sufficient to maintain acid-base status.

AB  - Invasive plants may respond through adaptive evolution and/or phenotypic plasticity to new environmental conditions where they are introduced. Although many studies have focused on evolution of invaders particularly in the context of testing the evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis, few consistent patterns have emerged. Many tests of the EICA hypothesis have been performed in only one environment; such assessments may be misleading if plants that perform one way at a particular site respond differently across sites. Single common garden tests ignore the potential for important contributions of both genetic and environmental factors to affect plant phenotype. Using a widespread invader in North America, Cynoglossum officinale, we established reciprocal common gardens in the native range (Europe) and introduced range (North America) to assess genetically based differences in size, fecundity, flowering phenology and threshold flowering size between native and introduced genotypes as well as the magnitude of plasticity in these traits. In addition, we grew plants at three nutrient levels in a pot experiment in one garden to test for plasticity across a different set of conditions. We did not find significant genetically based differences between native and introduced populations in the traits we measured; in our experiments, introduced populations of C. officinale were larger and more fecund, but only in common garden experiments in the native range. We found substantial population-level plasticity for size, fecundity and date of first flowering, with plants performing better in a garden in Germany than in Montana. Differentiation of native populations in the magnitude of plasticity was much stronger than that of introduced populations, suggesting an important role for founder effects. We did not detect evidence of an evolutionary change in threshold flowering size. Our study demonstrates that detecting genetically based differences in traits may require measuring plant responses to more than one environment.

AB  - A small, closed, lacustrine system developed during the restraining overstep stages of the Oligocene As Pontes strike-slip basin (Spain). The increase in basin accommodation and the headward spread of the drainage, which increased the water input, triggered a change from shallow, holomictic to deeper, meromictic conditions. The lower, shallow, lacustrine assemblage consists of mudstone-carbonate cycles recording lacustrine-palustrine ramp deposition in a saline lake. High Sr content in some early diagenetic calcites suggests that aragonite and calcite made up the primary carbonate muds. Early dolomitization took place together with widespread pedogenic activity. The upper, deep, freshwater, lacustrine assemblage includes bundles of carbonate-clay rhythmites and fine-grained turbidite beds. Primary calcite and diagenetic siderite make up the carbonate laminae. The Mg content of the primary carbonates records variations in Mg/Ca ratios in lacustrine waters. delta(18)O and delta(13)C covariance trends in calcite reinforce closed drainage conditions. delta(18)O data indicate that the lake system changed rapidly from short-lived isotopically light periods (i.e. from seasonal to pluriannual) to longer steady-state periods of heavier delta(18)O (i.e. from pluriannual to millennial). The small delta(13)C changes in the covariant trends were caused by dilute inflow, changing the contributions of dissolved organic carbon in the system and/or internal variations in lacustrine organic productivity and recycling. In both shallow and deep carbonate facies, sulphate reduction and methanogenesis may account, respectively, for the larger negative and positive delta(13)C shifts recorded in the early diagenetic carbonates (calcite, dolomite and siderite). The lacustrine system was very susceptible to high-frequency, climatically forced water balance variations. These climatic oscillations interfered with the low-frequency tectonic and morphological changes in the basin catchment. This resulted in the superposition of high-order depositional, mineralogical and geochemical cycles and rhythms on the lower order lacustrine infill sequence.

AB  - A detailed geochemical study and a sequence stratigraphic interpretation have been conducted on a sedimentary sequence of the Upper Cretaceous La Luna Formation, in a section outcropping in the eastern flank of the Middle Magdalena Basin (MMB), Colombia. The goals were to evaluate geochemical variability related to lithofacies and organic facies changes, characterize depositional environment and investigate the possible relationship between geochemical data and sequence stratigraphic cycles. The La Luna Formation is composed of organic-rich sediments of monotonous appearance, with good to excellent potential for oil generation. Most of the bulk, petrographic and biomarker parameters display a relatively narrow range of variation. However, the geochemical variations are sufficient to differentiate organic facies types B, BC and C in the Salada Member, B and D in the Pujamana Member and B in the Galembo Member. Certain biomarker ratios are consistent within the La Luna Formation and are characteristic of its depositional environment, for example, average ratios of diasterane/sterane are lower than 1, Ts/Tm averages are less than 0.33, the C(35)/C(34) hopane ratio is more than 0.92, and oleanane/C(30) hopane ratios range from 0.02 to 0.19. Regarding depositional condition indicators, the C(35)/C(34) hopane ratio shows a good positive correlation with HI. This suggests that in carbonate environment changes in this parameter are more strongly related to redox condition than to changes in carbonate content. Regarding the possible relationship between organic matter characteristics and sea level changes, in regressive carbonate shelves during shallow stages, HI tends to increase and TOC tends to decrease, while in regressive siliciclastic shelves, both TOC and HI decrease continuously. Some biomarker ratios (oleanane/C(30) hopane, C(20)/C(23) tricyclic, Ts/Tm) increase during base level falls. Regarding delta (13)C/(12)C isotope composition, the aromatic Fraction and whole bitumen display an isotopic shift associated to the main deepening event in the section.

AB  - Here we propose that an important cause of variation in species density may be prior environmental conditions that continue to influence current patterns. In this paper we investigated the degree to which species density varies with location within the landscape, independent of contemporaneous environmental conditions. The area studied was a coastal marsh landscape subject to periodic storm events. To evaluate the impact of historical effects, it was assumed that the landscape position of a plot relative to the river's mouth ("distance from sea") and to the edge of a stream channel ("distance from shore") would correlate with the impact of prior storm events, an assumption supported by previous studies. To evaluate the importance of spatial location on species density, data were collected from five sites located at increasing distances from the river's mouth along the Middle Pearl River in Louisiana. At each site, plots were established systematically along transects perpendicular to the shoreline. For each of the 175 plots, we measured elevation, soil salinity, percent of plot recently disturbed, percent of sunlight captured by the plant canopy (as a measure of plant abundance), and plant species density. Structural equation analysis ascertained the degree to which landscape position variables explained variation in species density that could not be explained by current environmental indicators. Without considering landscape variables, 54% of the variation in species density could be explained by the effects of salinity, flooding, and plant abundance. When landscape variables were included, distance from shore was unimportant but distance from sea explained an additional 12% of the variance in species density (R-2 of final model = 66%). Based on these results it appears that at least some of the otherwise unexplained variation in species density can be attributed to landscape position, and presumably previous storm events. We suggest that future studies may gain additional insight into the factors controlling current patterns of species density by examining the effects of position within the landscape.

AB  - Iron availability to plants is often limited when soil pH is 7 or higher. In C rich, but Fe limiting environments, microorganisms may produce organic chelators that complex Fe and increase its availability to plants. Seedlings of soybean (Glycine max L.) and oat (Avena sativa L.) plants, with Fe-efficient or inefficient uptake mechanisms, were grown in an Fe free nutrient solution at pH 7.5. Experiments (using a complete factorial design) were conducted in which these seedlings were transferred to a fresh nutrient solution and treated with Fe sources (FeCl3, FeEDDHA, and Fe complexed with chelators produced by compost microorganisms (CCMs) after their enrichment in an Fe free, glucose medium), Fe concentrations (0 and 6.7 mu M) and antibiotic (0 and 100 mg streptomycin L-1). Dry weight of soybean plants and Fe uptake were significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) higher when Fe was supplied as (FeCCM)-Fe-59 than as (FeCl3)-Fe-59 and similar to when Fe was supplied as (59)FeEDDHA. Dry weight of the Fe-inefficient Tam 0-312 oat cultivar was also significantly higher when Fe was supplied as FeCCM. Fe uptake by oat, when supplied as (FeCCM)-Fe-59, was twice that for (59)FeEDDHA and (FeCl3)-Fe-59. Chlorophyll concentration in plants supplied with FeCCM and FeEDDHA was significantly greater (P ( 0.05) than in minus Fe control plants and in FeCl3 supplied plants. Activities of catalase and peroxidase, measured as indicators of Fe nutrition in soybean and oats, were generally increased when Fe was supplied with FeCCM as compared to the other Fe sources. The experimental conditions in which the CCMs were produced are similar to those in soil after amendment with manures or other readily available organic materials. These CCMs can bind with Fe, even under slightly alkaline conditions, and effectively improve Fe nutrition of soybean and oat.

AB  - The interaction of motor and cognitive brain systems while performing the tasks of processing information of different modality and complexity is an important component of the brain's integrative activity, which provides the individual adaptation of a person to changing environmental conditions. 116 individuals participated in the research; there were right-handed children aged 7-8, adolescents aged 11-12 and 15-16, and young men aged 19-20 among them. The investigated individuals performed a cognitive task, which included determining the modalities of a signal, the shape of a figure, the meaning of a word, and the fast and error-free reaction of differentiation with left (goL) or right (goR) hand or inhibition of motor action (nogo). The motor task involved a quick reaction to signals of different modality in the go/go/go mode. The results show that in the ontogenesis, the interaction of motor and cognitive brain systems gradually increases during processing of information of different modality and complexity by children, adolescents and young people. Closer functional interaction of motor and cognitive brain systems according to the indicators of speed and success of performing both tasks was found to be greater in the young men aged 19-20 and the adolescents aged 15-16 and 1112 than in the children aged 7-8. The investigated individuals with the high-speed level of performing cognitive tasks were characterized with reliably higher indicators of motor reactions. Correlation analysis confirmed the statistically significant relationship between the speed characteristics of the motor and cognitive functional systems of the brain. The age dynamics of functional interaction between the motor and cognitive systems, as well as the speed and success of performing tasks depended on the mode selection of information processing. The success and speed of performing different variants of motor tasks in the go/go/go mode were higher in all age groups than in the conditions of the combined motor and cognitive tasks while differentiating goL/nogo/goR. The functional interaction of motor and cognitive brain systems in children, adolescents and young men while processing information increased gradually and depended on the modality of signals. The speed and success of results of performing motor and cognitive tasks were higher than for imaginative signals, and lower than for verbal ones for all age groups. Left-brain dominance of functional asymmetry was found for the cognitive systems. The number of mistakes on words was always less and the reaction speed was higher for the right hand than for the left one in the goL/nogo/goR mode. Asymmetry was weaker in the children aged 7-8 for the combined tasks using imaginative stimuli, and statistically significant in the groups of adolescents aged 11-12 and young men aged 15-16 and 19-20 for verbal signals presented in the goL/nogo/goR mode. The research results and methods can be used for the prognostic estimate of human activity in the conditions of complex information loads and neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Relative weakness in sensitivity and contribution integration, especially lack of specific indicators at spatial and temporal scales, may hinder the formation of systematic knowledge for climate change impact on vegetation activity. Considering the interannual variability and periods difference, we investigated the ecosystem sensitivity to hydrothermal conditions and the contribution of individual climatic factors to vegetation activity on spatiotemporal scales during the period of 1980s-2013 in China. We ran simulations of the Common Land Model (CoLM) to obtain the photosynthetic rate, and used the satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), to which we applied a temporal sensitivity analysis, the slope change ratio of accumulative quantity (SCRAQ), and geographical detectors. We show that the discrepancy between warming and precipitation variation contributed to vegetation activity was more notable than the ecosystem sensitivity to hydrothermal conditions, regardless of which temporal and spatial scale was considered. The sensitivity of vegetation activity to hydrothermal variation in most parts of northeastern and western China was higher than elsewhere, and the contribution of warming to vegetation dynamics was relatively high in the Inner Mongolian Plateau and Tibetan Plateau (>60%), where the contribution of warming to the vegetation distribution was also greater than elsewhere in China. Conversely, the contribution of precipitation variation to vegetation dynamics was comparatively greater in northwestern China and subtropical and tropical regions (>55%). The spatiotemporal contribution of precipitation variation to vegetation activity differed between regions, especially on the Tibetan Plateau and in subtropical and tropical regions. Moreover, both the temporal and spatial sensitivities to climate change were weak in the subtropical and tropical regions, where the contribution of climatic factors to vegetation distribution was also small. Overall, temperature sensitivity and its contribution to vegetation activity were positively associated in most regions. However, the regions where precipitation contributed substantially to vegetation activity were not necessarily also highly sensitive to changes in precipitation within the range of variation explored.

AB  - The release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from stationary and mobile sources increases the concentration of these pollutants in the environment. These compounds have the potential to cause adverse effects on human health and the environment. The adoption of management and engineering procedures to control the emission of these pollutants to the air has become essential. The aim of this study was to use an advanced oxidation process namely the catalytic ozonation to reduce the concentration of these pollutants in industrial output. In this experimental study, the catalytic ozonation process in the presence of ZnO nanoparticles coated on zeolite media was used in a laboratory scale to treat the air contaminated with BTEX compounds as indicators of VOCs. For this purpose, First the nanocomposites were synthesized based on chemical co-precipitation method. SEM, XRD, BET and FT-IR analyses were performed to investigate the characteristics of nanocomposites. The variables including initial concentrations of BTEX (50-200 ppm), polluted air flow rate (5-20 l/h), humidity (0-75%) and ozone dose (0.25-1 g/h) were investigated. The concentration of BTEX compounds was measured by the Gas Chromatography (GC) technique according to the NIOSH 1501 manual. The results of SEM, XRD, BET and FT-IR analyses showed the proper synthesis of nanocomposites. According to the laboratory results, the optimal conditions of the process were found to be as follows: the initial concentration of pollutants equal to 50 ppm, inlet air flow rate of 5 l/h, relative air humidity of 25-35%, and inlet ozone concentration equal to 1 g/h. Under these conditions, the removal efficiency of the compounds: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene were obtained 98, 96, 92 and 91%, respectively. Simple ozonation and adsorption processes were less efficient than catalytic ozonation. This process had the ability to reduce the concentration of BTEX compounds to standard level.

AB  - Persistent use of aqueous film-forming foams containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in firefighting has led to severe contamination of soil and aquifers at training sites, which makes remediation of such sites a necessity. We investigated the persistence of binding of PFASs to a mixed-mode remediation agent including repeated leaching, and the effects of competing ions and temperature extremes. The sorbent (RemBind (R)) was added to PFAS-contaminated soils and standard leaching procedures- the US. EPA Multiple Extraction Procedure and the U.S. EPA Leaching Environmental Assessment Framework were applied to quantify desorption of PFASs from remediated and unremediated soils. Possible desorption by competing anions such as orthophosphate (H2PO4-) and humic acid (HA) were assessed, and effects of temperature extremes and ionic strength were also investigated. These are the main environmental factors that could potentially affect desorption of PFASs over time at a typical site. Desorption of PFASs from unremediated soils was related to C-chain length with short-chain PFASs easily desorbed and leached. PFASs with carboxylic head groups leached faster than those with a sulfonic acid head group. The sorbent retained PFASs strongly and reduced desorption and leaching from remediated soils by 92 to 99.9%. There were no detrimental effects on desorption of PFASs from temperature extremes or changes in ionic strength. In remediated soils, effects of competing ions were also absent or minimal. However, in unremediated soils increasing concentrations of orthophosphate and HA increased leaching of some long-chain PFASs. While short-term laboratory desorption experiments cannot exactly mimic long-term field conditions, these results provide site owners and regulatory authorities with a high level of confidence that PFASs binding by RemBind (R) is predicted to be persistent in the long term. However, to give the greatest level of confidence, these simulations should be validated under field conditions for at least several years. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In dairy farming, social isolation of cattle is commonly practiced for husbandry procedures such as artificial insemination, claw trimming and at times, for provision of medical treatment. When isolated, cows express physiological and behavioural signs of stress, such as elevated heart rate, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical activity and increased vocalisation rate. The aim of this study was to examine whether enriching the environment of the isolation pen using both tactile (i.e. an automated grooming brush) and visual (i.e. a mirror) stimulation could alleviate stress induced in socially isolated dairy cows. Eighteen cows (9 lactating and 9 dry cows) were subjected to four isolation conditions of 30 min each; isolation in the presence of a mirror, in the presence of an automated grooming brush, in the presence of both a mirror and an automated grooming brush, and in a non-enriched environment (without brush and mirror) that served as a control condition. Physiological (heart rate and heart rate variability) and behavioural indicators of stress (locomotion, vocalizations, attempts to escape the isolation pen and ear position of the cows) were measured during three phases throughout the isolation period (0-5 min, 10-15 min, 20-25 min). Our results show that, first, the heart rate of cows kept in social isolation, as well as the time cows spent in locomotion and exploration of the pen, decreased throughout the isolation period, regardless of treatment. Second, the presence of an automated grooming brush, a mirror or both an automated grooming brush and mirror in the isolation pen was not associated with reduced indicators of stress (physiological and behavioural measures) compared to the non-enriched environment. The results of our study are not in agreement with the findings of previous studies showing reduced levels of stress among socially isolated heifers/cows kept in the presence of visual enrichment (i.e. mirror/picture of a conspecific), and illustrate the need to further explore practices to reduce stress during social isolation.

AB  - The response of eastern Mediterranean Sea (EMS) circulation to climate forcings over the last 95 kyr BP was studied using core MD04-2722, collected at 1780 m water depth within the Levantine Sea. Foraminiferal stable isotopes and benthic assemblages were combined in order to reconstruct deep water ventilation and oxygenation in relation to surface water freshening. Over the last deglaciation, benthic foraminiferal delta C-13 values and oxygen index decreased, while the 8180 gradient between benthic and planktonic foraminifera increased. The results, respectively, indicate slower ventilation, bottom water oxygen depletion, and stronger stratification prior to S1 sapropel deposition. A combination of deglacial sea level rise and fresher north Atlantic surface water contributions were determined to be a precondition for S1 formation within the Levantine Sea. Local Nile River freshwater supplied during the African Humid Period further strengthened water column stratification. As for S3 deposit, the central role of monsoonal precipitation was estimated. For the last glacial period, three events at around 53, 46 and 37 ka BP were marked by a deep water circulation reduction at the core location. Considering the influence of north Atlantic surface water salinity on Mediterranean Sea circulation, we propose that the 46 and 371 a BP events are responses to Heinrich Events 4 and 5 that supplied fresher surface water to the Mediterranean Sea. Since the '53 ka event' was also characterized by the appearance of low oxygen benthic indicators as observed within the S1 and S3 layers, we tentatively attributed it to 'missing' sapropel S2. Our results indicate that intense stagnation within the EMS could occur when both the local freshwater supply and fresher north Atlantic surface water are contributors. The influence of north Atlantic conditions was significant to EMS circulation under warm and cold climate conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human adenoviruses (hAdVs) are pathogenic viruses responsible for public health problems worldwide. They have also been used as viral indicators in environmental systems. Coliphages (e.g., MS2, Phi X174) have also been studied as indicators of viral pollution in fecally contaminated water. Our objective was to evaluate the distribution of three viral fecal indicators (hAdVs, MS2, and Phi X174), between two different phyllosilicate clays (kaolinite and bentonite) and the aqueous phase. A series of static and dynamic experiments were conducted under two different temperatures (4, 25 degrees C) for a time period of seven days. HAdV adsorption was examined in DNase I reaction buffer (pH = 7.6, and ionic strength (IS) = 1.4 mM), whereas coliphage adsorption in phosphate buffered saline solution (pH = 7, IS = 2 mM). Moreover, the effect of IS on hAdV adsorption under static conditions was evaluated. The adsorption of hAdV was assessed by real-time PCR and its infectivity was tested by cultivation methods. The coliphages MS2 and Phi X174 were assayed by the double-layer overlay method. The experimental results have shown that coliphage adsorption onto both kaolinite and bentonite was higher for the dynamic than the static experiments; whereas hAdV adsorption was lower under dynamic conditions. The adsorption of hAdV increased with decreasing temperature, contrary to the results obtained for the coliphages. This study examines the combined effect of temperature, agitation, clay type, and IS on hAdV adsorption onto clays. The results provide useful new information on the effective removal of viral fecal indicators (MS2, Phi X174 and hAdV) from dilute aqueous solutions by adsorption onto kaolinite and bentonite. Factors enabling enteric viruses to penetrate soils, groundwater and travel long distances within aquifers are important public health issues. Because the observed adsorption behavior of surrogate coliphages MS2 and Phi X174 is substantially different to that of hAdV, neither MS2 nor Phi X174 is recommended as a suitable model for adenovirus.

AB  - This study is a comparative analysis of dew in rural and urban environment. Dew samples were collected between May and October, 2009 in two reference stations in southern Poland: Cracow and Gaik-Brzezowa. The investigation included comparison of volume and chemistry of the collected samples. Due to its formation mechanisms, dew is a good indicator of air pollution. Following parameters were analyzed in 159 collected samples: pH, electric conductivity, concentration of formaldehyde and phenols, concentration of NH4+, Ca2+, K+, Na+, and Mg2+ cations and NO2-, NO3-, SO42-, Cl-, F-, and PO43- anions. The frequency of dew was approximately the same, both in urban and rural conditions reaching 43% of the measurement period. Dew intensity, expressed by volume, was on average two times larger in rural environment than in urban conditions. Urban landuse was recognized as the main factor reducing dew intensity in the urban station in comparison to the rural. Furthermore, the intensity of dew depended on synoptic scale air circulation at both measurement sites. As expected, samples collected in Cracow were much more polluted than the ones from Gaik-Brzezowa. The average TIC (Total Ionic Content) parameter was approximately 50% higher at the urban station. The pH in the rural station was more acidic. NO3- anions and Ca2+ cations were predominant in both measurement sites, however the participation of Ca2+ in Cracow was higher. NO3- indicates pollutions emitted by transport and industrial sources. The concentration of the analytes in both stations, as the volume, depended on air circulation direction. For Gaik-Brzezowa the highest TIC was observed mainly within southern circulation, while for Cracow the highest TIC was noted within both northern and southern. In general the rural station represented background pollution for the whole region and the pollution in Cracow was more dependent on local urban sources as transport or industry.

AB  - Climate change has affected the phenology of plants and animals throughout the world, but few studies have evaluated climate responses of fruit trees in East Asia. In particular, the response of tree phenology to warming during different parts of the year has not been explored. We evaluated long-term records (1963-2008) of chestnut (Castanea mollissima Blume) first flowering, leaf coloring and length of the growing season from Beijing, China. Phenological dates were related with daily temperatures (subjected to an 11-day running mean) for the 12 months leading up to the respective events, using Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression. For each phenological indicator, regression results identified two relevant phases, during which temperatures were correlated with event timing or growing season length.
   First flowering dates in Beijing advanced by 1.6 days per decade over the length of the record, whereas leaf coloring showed no significant trend. The growing season expanded by 4.3 days per decade. First flowering was advanced by high temperatures between January and June, but delayed by warm conditions during the chill accumulation phase (late October through early January). Leaf coloring was advanced by warm conditions during most of the growing season, but delayed by high temperatures in fall. Variation in the length of the growing season was strongly correlated to variation in spring phenology.
   All phenological indicators of chestnut appeared to respond to high temperatures during certain parts of the growing season in a way that ran counter to currently dominant effects. For instance, warming during the period of chill accumulation delayed rather than advanced spring phenology. These secondary temperature responses may explain responses of certain plants and ecosystems that are not in line with general trends of advanced spring and delayed fall phases. It seems possible that the importance of these effects may increase as warming continues. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The roles of climatically driven freshwater flow, nutrient loading, and temperature on phytoplankton community biomass and composition were examined along a downstream transect within the New River Estuary, North Carolina from 2007 to 2010. This microtidal system has a history of eutrophication symptoms, including harmful algal blooms. Riverine discharge strongly controlled nutrient loading to the estuary. Except during very high flow conditions, loads were generally assimilated near the head of the estuary and low concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate, <2 and 0.4 mu mol L-1, respectively, were found throughout most of the estuary. Total phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) was maximal under moderate discharge conditions when flushing time was approximately four days and salinity was in the range of 3-18 psu. The observed non-monotonic relationship between phytoplankton biomass and flushing time reflects a balance between nutrient stimulation of phytoplankton biomass and advective losses associated with river flow. Pigment indicators of major phytoplankton taxa also revealed non-monotonic responses to flushing time with some significant inter-taxa differences in slopes and peak location. These differences suggest that flushing time or environmental covariates of flushing time are important determinants of community composition. We suggest these group-specific differences are due to advantages gained by phytoflagellates through vertical migration, ability of pico-cyanobacteria to exploit low residual nutrient concentrations, and subsidies to the diatom population via sediment resuspension events. In addition to effects of flow, pico-cyanobacteria and harmful raphidophyte taxa demonstrated positive relationships with temperature. Overall, results demonstrate a strong linkage between the phytoplankton community and two important climatic drivers, flow and temperature. The observed sensitivity of phytoplankton biomass to nutrient loads suggests that load reductions (or increases) are likely to decrease (or increase) total phytoplankton biomass in this system. However, phytoplankton community composition appears to be largely determined by environmental factors other than nutrient loading, particularly temperature, stratification and sediment resuspension.

AB  - Clay mineralogy and calcareous nannofossils from Jaguel and Roca formations in the eastern sector of Pellegrini Lake, Neuquen Basin, Republica Argentina. This study presents new mineralogical, sedimentological, and micropaleontological data from the Jaguel (Late Maastrichtian-Early Danian) and Roca (Danian) formations, located in the eastern sector of Pellegrini Lake, Rio Negro province, Republica Argentina. According to the physical characteristics and the age of the sediments that conform these formations, two siliciclastic lithofacies and a carbonate one were recognized, they are named: Maastrichtian grayish yellow calcareous mudstones, Danian olive gray calcareous mudstones, and Danian carbonates. The rocks which constitutes siliciclastic lithofacies were classified as allochemical mudstones and the mineralogy is characterized by high proportions of clay minerals and, to a lesser extent, calcite. The clay mineral association is dominated by a random (R0) I/S mixed-layers (70-90% Sm) accompanied by lower proportions of illite and kaolinite. The mineralogy and the microfabric of the mudstones reflect that these sediments have not been affected significantly by diagenesis. Clay minerals would be of detrital origin and the predominance of the highly smectitic I/S along all sections would be associated with an active volcanism coming from the western magmatic arc, located in the Neuquen Basin during the Late Cretaceous and Paleocene. Micropalaeontological analyses confirmed the presence of Cretaceous-Paleogene transition in the Jaguel Formation beds. The calcareous nannofossils allowed to relate changes in the the mineralogical associations along the K/P transition. In this way, it was possible to detect an increase in kaolinite content close to the K/P boundary (>10%), that decreases towards higher positions of the Danian, which could indicate a warmer and wetter climate during this interval, that it would tend to be drier with seasonal conditions in the late Danian. The Maastrichtian calcareous nannofossil assemblages suggest oligotrophic environments and a well stratified photic zone, nevertheless, in some horizons, the nannoflora is abundant with lower richness which would indicate more restricted marine conditions.

AB  - Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) yield and quality are determined by genotype and environment. This study aimed at analysing the relative importance of the environment for yield and quality of sugar beet genotypes and at assessing parameters which could give essential improvement for beet quality if included as additional selection criteria. For that purpose, root yield and quality (Sugar, K, Na, amino N, total soluble N, betaine, glutamine, invert sugar, raffinose)of 9 sugar beet genotypes were investigated in 52 environments (25 sites in 2003 and 27 sites in 2004) in randomised field trials across Europe.
   The environment accounted for about 80% of the total variance for all parameters. Effects of the tested genotypes were larger for the content of betaine (8.5%) and sugar (7.6%) than for other parameters (1-5%). With the exception of invert sugar and amino N, the genotype by environment interaction was about 3% and thereby lower than the main effect of genotypes. Interactions resulted in an increase of the differences between genotypes which can be used to select genotypes in the most discriminating environments. The response of genotypes in Sugar content was contrasting to other parameters and points to a physiological limit for Sugar storage at about 20%. As no crossover interaction Occurred for root yield or any quality parameter, there seemed to be no specific suitability of the tested genotypes to certain environmental stress conditions. This is probably due to the fact that the harvested beetroot is a vegetative storage organ and has no growth stages Susceptible to Unfavourable environmental conditions such as flowering and grain filling which are important for final yield in cereals. Invert sugar showed the largest relative differences between genotypes which were strongly enhanced in Southern and some south-eastern European environments. Because of its importance during processing, considering invert sugar in breeding could improve technical quality for processing considerably for those extreme environments. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Natural plant regeneration occurs in sites where the edafoclimatic conditions are adequate for initiating germination and where new seedlings can be established that will occupy the place of the trees when they reach their lifespan limit. The objectives of the present study were to quantify the natural population of seedlings of Pinus montezumae Lamb., and to determine the physical and chemical properties in the soils of five sites in La Malinche, Mexico. Because of their physical and chemical characteristics, the soils of the studied sites are very similar, as they form from the weathering of volcanic ash, thus they present an A/C evolution sequence; they have a subangular polyhedral structure, are weakly developed; with abundant roots; the bulk and particle density permit the adequate exchange,of air and nutrient absorption. There is predominance of sandy-lumpy textures in the superficial horizons, which present a very acid pH, they are rich in OM, with a mean CEC and a saturation of bases of over 50%, dominated by Ca2+. The sites between 3000 to 3200 m with orientation to the N had 58% of the seedling population of P. montezumae Lamb., in which there is predominance of those with a size of 1.50 to 2.50 m. In the sites where the altitude is greater than 3200 m, the population of A montezumae Lamb., decreased notably, reaching 7% of the total, with a height of 8 to 12 m, those of greatest size. Therefore, it is considered that altitude and temperature are the principal factors that determine the presence of seedlings. The parent trees present conditions adequate for releasing seeds and propitiating the continuity of the forest mass, although their number decreases in altitudes of over 3000 m, due to the clandestine felling of trees and forest fires. An understory comprised of Muhlenbergia macroura (HBK)., Stipa ichu (Ruiz & Pav) Kunth., and Lupinus elegans HBK. is also common, which are considered indicators of these activities.

AB  - Climatologists have speculated that a spatially coherent pattern of high-latitude temperature trends could be an early indicator of climatic change. The sensitivity of sea ice to the temperature of the overlying air suggests the possibility that trends in Arctic ice conditions may be useful proxy indicators of general climatic changes. Aspects of the north-polar ice pack which have been identified as key parameters to be monitored include ice extent, concentration, type, thickness and motion dynamics. In spite of the considerable interannual, regional and seasonal variations exhibited by these data, there may be some evidence of an emerging trend towards decreasing ice extent and concentration. Collecting data in such a remote and harsh environment to support these analyses is only possible through satellite remote sensing. Remote sensing in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is particularly relevant for polar applications because microwaves are capable of penetrating the atmosphere under virtually all conditions and are not dependent: on the sun as a source of illumination. In particular, analyses of passive microwave imagery can provide us with daily information on sea-ice extent, type, concentration, dynamics and melt onset. A historical record of Arctic imagery from orbiting passive microwave sensors starting from 1973 provides us with an excellent data source for climate change studies. The development of analysis tools to support large area monitoring is integral to advancing global change research. The critical need is to create techniques which highlight the space-time relationships in the data rather than simply displaying voluminous quantities of data. In particular, hypertemporal image analysis techniques are required to help find anticipated trends and to discover unexpected or anomalous temporal relationships. Direct hypertemporal classification, principal components analysis and spatial time-series analysis are identified as three primary techniques for enhancing change in temporal image sequences. There is still a need for the development of new tools for spatial-temporal modelling.

AB  - Following stringent regulations enforced by environmental regulatory authorities, various steps have been recently implemented to ensure the clean combustion of gasoline with minimum emissions by including additives to gasoline. This kinetic and experimental study has been conducted to explore the effect of H-2 and CO addition to Halterman gasoline at stoichiometric conditions of 358 K and 1 bar. Two different mechanisms, a gasoline surrogate (iso-octane, n-heptane, toluene, and ethanol), LLNL, and a KAUST TPRFE (primary reference fuel, toluene, and ethanol), were used to provide a detailed comparative kinetic understanding of gasoline. Via a spherical flame propagating in a constant-volume combustion chamber, the unstretched, adiabatic laminar burning velocity, S-L(o), was measured. H-2 and CO were added (as unitary and binary additives) to the Haltermann gasoline, in proportions of 1, 2.5, 5, and 10% by mass. Adding hydrogen enhanced the S-L(o) significantly, while CO addition had only a slight effect on S-L(o). The maximal mole fractions of OH and H were increased with the H-2 addition, while adding CO raised the O radical peak mole fraction. A strong correlation between S-L(o) and the sum of the O, H, and OH peak mole fractions was evident. The OH radical was identified to be a kinetics indicator for S-L(o) of gasoline/air mixtures at these conditions; a higher fraction of ethanol in Haltermann gasoline was the precursor for high OH concentration. The addition of a binary additive (10% H-2-10% CO) significantly enhanced the consumption of iso-octane compared to other fuel species, strengthening the H-abstraction of iso-octane, 99% compared to 71% with neat Haltermann gasoline. The simulated flame speed showed that the primary chain branching reaction (H + O-2 = O + OH) rate was much higher for the LLNL mechanism than for the KAUST-TPRFE mechanism, and thus, the LLNL overpredicted S-L(o) for the Haltermann gasoline surrogate.

AB  - Climate change migration is increasing and necessitates a re-examination of resettlement planning and processes. Although evidence-based selection of host places would improve climate change resettlement outcomes, few methods for the selection of host communities exist. Consequently, the information base on which most resettlement programs select a host place is often inadequate. This article proposes an empirical methodology to assess resettlement capacity. The methodology uses a hierarchical aggregation approach, where resettlement capacity indicator values are aggregated first into sub-dimension resettlement capacity scores, then further into dimension resettlement capacity scores, and finally into an overall resettlement capacity index. The aggregation allows for the calculation of the relative importance of the different sub dimensions and the two primary dimensions - assets and conditions. Using 75 indicators and a hierarchical min-max additive approach based on a five-kilometer grid, we create an overall resettlement capacity index for Ethiopia, with and without normalizing the relevant indicators for population size. The results show significant spatial variation in resettlement capacity, and a clear difference between using the population size normalized and non-normalized indicators, particularly regarding places with very low population density. High resettlement capacity sites are scattered in central, southcentral, and northern Ethiopia, and they also occur in small clusters along southern and northwestern borders. Moderate resettlement capacity sites occur more generally all over Ethiopia. Sites with low resettlement capacity cluster in southeastern and western parts of the country. Compared to the low and moderate resettlement capacity sites, those with high resettlement capacity are endowed with human, physical, and financial capital infrastructures. In all three capacity groups, assets contribute significantly less to resettlement capacity than conditions. Sites that are prone to natural hazards, both currently and in the future, are concentrated in the western and northern tips of the country. The calculated resettlement capacity indices are robust to potential missing indicators and change in the unit of analysis. The findings of the study can be used to identify areas for more comprehensive, localized analyses to determine their suitability for resettlement.

AB  - Intracellular free zinc ([Zn2+](i)) is mobilized in neuronal and non-neuronal cells under physiological and/or pathophysiological conditions; therefore, [Zn2+](i) is a component of cellular signal transduction in biological systems. Although several transporters and ion channels that carry Zn2+ have been identified, proteins that are involved in Zn2+ supply into cells and their expression are poorly understood, particularly under inflammatory conditions. Here, we show that the expression of Zn2+ transporters ZIP8 and ZIP14 is increased via the activation of hypoxia-induced factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) in inflammation, leading to [Zn2+](i) accumulation, which intrinsically activates transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channel and elevates basal [Zn2+](i). In human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs), treatment with inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), evoked TRPA1-dependent intrinsic Ca2+ oscillations. Assays with fluorescent Zn2+ indicators revealed that the basal [Zn2+](i) concentration was significantly higher in TRPA1-expressing HEK cells and inflammatory FLSs. Moreover, TRPA1 activation induced an elevation of [Zn2+](i) level in the presence of 1 mu M Zn2+ in inflammatory FLSs. Among the 17 out of 24 known Zn2+ transporters, FLSs that were treated with TNF-alpha and IL-1 alpha exhibited a higher expression of ZIP8 and ZIP14. Their expression levels were augmented by transfection with an active component of nuclear factor-kappa B P65 and HIF-1 alpha expression vectors, and they could be abolished by pretreatment with the HIF-1 alpha inhibitor echinomycin (Echi). The functional expression of ZIP8 and ZIP14 in HEK cells significantly increased the basal [Zn2+](i) level. Taken together, Zn2+ carrier proteins, TRPA1, ZIP8, and ZIP14, induced under HIF-1 alpha mediated inflammation can synergistically change [Zn2+](i) in inflammatory FLSs.

AB  - Purpose
   Rural areas are one of the effective regions in economy and self-sufficiency field especially in agricultural and livestock section. Planning in the rural section and the effort in solving the problems of farmers lead to increase their interest in farming and manufacturing in the villages and decrease their migration to the cities and metropolitans. Therefore, the present study aimed at feasibility of electricity to a rural household in Iran using off-grid solar-based hybrid system.
   Design/methodology/approach
   In renewable energy projects, a successful evaluation requires suitable criteria so that one can properly analyze the operational behavior of all feasible scenarios. In the present paper, HOMER software has been used for this purpose for a village with no access to electricity grid (Bar Aftab-e Jalaleh, Iran). Due to drastic fluctuation of fossil fuel prices and varied solar radiations in various years because of climate change, sensitivity analysis has been performed using HOMER.
   Findings
   In the optimum status economically, 70% of needed energy is provided by solar cells at the price 0.792 $/kWh. The comparison between the optimum condition economically and the condition that only use fossil fuels revealed that the return on investment will occur after less than 2 years and have remained profitable over 23 years.
   Social implications
   The authors hope that the results of this study can be used in planning of the authorities to realize the interests of people in this village.
   Originality/value
   According to the surveys, despite Iran being the first country in terms of providing solar power to the villages, so far no socio-economic-environmental assessment has been done for a solar cell-based micro-grid in an off-grid mode for a remote village that is deprived of electricity from a national electricity grid. In addition, for the first time in Iran, the effect of the fuel price and solar radiation parameters variability on the performance of system have been investigated.

AB  - Over the recent years, drought has been occurring with an ever increasing frequency in Poland. The longer the rainless period lasts, the more acute its impacts are. Agricultural drought manifests itself as a prolonged period of water shortage for agricultural crops during their growth season resulting in yield reduction. Extent of drought was evaluated by the climatic water balance (CWB). Climatic water balance is an indicator that determines the state of humidification of the environment using data measured at meteorological stations. It is defined as the difference between atmospheric precipitation and evapotranspiration (in millimeters) calculated by an empirical formula taking into account: temperature, sunshine, and length of the day. CWB was calculated using meteorological data from 294 weather stations and weather posts across Poland. Spatial data from point measurements were interpolated using the Geographic Information System (GIS) software. Yield forecasts were made for major crops in Poland using agro-meteorological yield models and weather indices (WI). Yield figures were based on data from the Central Statistical Office of Poland (GUS).
   The autumn of 2011 was the driest in several dozen years in many localities of southeastern Poland. For instance, at the weather station in Pulawy, the lowest level of precipitation had been recorded since 1871. Weather conditions prevailing in the growing season of 2012 were very beneficial for winter cereals and winter rapeseed. As for sugar beet, the weather also favored high yields over most of the growing season, except the final stage of growth. Notwithstanding the extreme drought in the autumn of 2011, the good weather conditions in the remaining part of the growth period caused the yields of winter crops and sugar beet to be high.
   The very scant autumn precipitation, even though it had negative impact on the germination of cereals, seedling emergence, and seedling growth, did not cause any major losses to yields. Water supplies from September precipitation combined with frequent morning mists, fogs, and dew mitigated the impact of prolonged drought and were sufficient to sustain the yields at an acceptable level.

AB  - The role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in microbial metabolism and stress response has emerged as a major theme in microbiology and infectious disease. Reactive fluorescent dyes have the potential to advance the study of ROS in the complex intracellular environment, especially for high-content and high-throughput analyses. However, current dye-based approaches to measuring intracellular ROS have the potential for significant artifacts. Here, we describe a robust platform for flow cytometric quantification of ROS in bacteria using fluorescent dyes, with ROS measurements in 10s-of-1000s of individual cells under a variety of conditions. False positives and variability among sample types (e. g., bacterial species, stress conditions) are reduced with a flexible four-step gating scheme that accounts for side-and forwardscattered light (morphological changes), background fluorescence, DNA content, and dye uptake to identify cells producing ROS. Using CellROX Green dye with Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Mycobacterium bovis BCG as diverse model bacteria, we show that (1) the generation of a quantifiable CellROX Green signal for superoxide, but not hydrogen peroxide-induced hydroxyl radicals, validates this dye as a superoxide detector; (2) the level of dye-detectable superoxide does not correlate with cytotoxicity or antibiotic sensitivity; (3) the non-replicating, antibiotic tolerant state of nutrient-deprived mycobacteria is associated with high levels of superoxide; and (4) antibiotic-induced production of superoxide is idiosyncratic with regard to both the species and the physiological state of the bacteria. We also show that the gating method is applicable to other fluorescent indicator dyes, such as the 5-carboxyfluorescein diacetate acetoxymethyl ester and 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride for cellular esterase and reductive respiratory activities, respectively. These results demonstrate that properly controlled flow cytometry coupled with fluorescent probes provides precise and accurate quantitative analysis of ROS generation and metabolic changes in stressed bacteria.

AB  - The study of environmental change during the 'Little Ice Age' ('LIA') offers a great potential to improve our current understanding of the climate system and human-environment interactions. Here, a high-resolution multiproxy investigation of a Mediterranean mire from central-western Spain, covering the last similar to 700 years, was used to reconstruct peat dynamics and land-use change and to gain further insights into their relationship with 'LIA' climate (temperature and moisture). To accomplish this, concentrations and accumulation rates of major and minor lithogenic (Si, K, Ti, Rb and Zr) and biophilic (C and N) elements, as well as humification indices (UV-absorbance and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)) and pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs, were determined. Peatland dynamics seems to have been coupled to changes in solar irradiance and hydrological conditions. Our results point to wetter conditions after the mid-16th century, although with high intra-annual fluctuations. At the late 18th century, when solar activity was systematically higher than before, peat carbon accumulation rates (PCAR) showed a continuous increase and the humification indices suggest a change towards more humified peat. Enhanced soil erosion occurred at similar to AD 1660-1800 (SE1), similar to AD 1830-1920 (SE2) and similar to AD 1940-1970 (SE3), although a minor increase in Si fluxes was also detected by similar to AD 1460-1580. All phases coincided with higher abundances of fire indicators, but the changes recorded during the similar to AD 1460-1580 event and SE1 coincide with the Sporer and Maunder minima, so a climatic influence on soil erosion cannot be discounted. Changes in the sources of mineral matter to the catchment between similar to AD 1550 and similar to AD 1650 and since the mid-17th century were likely related to modifications of tree cover and/or variations in wind strength.

AB  - The evolution of precipitation is a key question concerning future climatic changes, especially in regions like the Mediterranean area which are currently prone to droughts. The influence of atmospheric circulation changes (in the mid-latitude westerlies or in the strength of the subtropical subsidence), along with changes in local mechanisms generating precipitation (such as convection) make it difficult to predict precipitation changes confidently over this area. Understanding its governing mechanisms is crucial. A possible approach is to test our understanding on different documented past climatic contexts. This paper focuses on the Last Glacial Maximum period (LGM) over the western Mediterranean region and puts in perspective the available information inferred from paleo-climatic records and the outputs of nine global climate models. We first review the available information on LGM precipitation in this region and find that the environmental conditions prevailing at this period range from humid to semi-arid, depending on the proxies. Model outputs from the PMIP3-CMIP5 database also yield a wide range of mean annual responses in this area, from wetter to drier conditions with respect to the pre-industrial period. This variety of responses allows to investigate the mechanisms governing LGM precipitation in the western Mediterranean area. Over the Iberian Peninsula and northern Morocco, most models simulate a larger amount of LGM precipitation in winter w.r.t. the pre-industrial period. This feature is mainly due to the large-scale effect of the southward shift of the North Atlantic jet stream, which is closely associated with the surface air temperature changes over the northwestern North Atlantic. In summer, precipitation changes mainly result from convection and are correlated to local surface air temperature anomalies, highlighting the key role of local processes. These contrasted changes in winter and summer, linked to different mechanisms, could explain the range of various signals derived from paleo-climatic archives, especially if the climatic indicators are sensitive to seasonal precipitation.

AB  - The successive reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the enlargements of the European Union (EU) and the impacts of climate change have amplified the diversity of European agriculture. These rapid changes have resulted in the intensification of agricultural activities in some regions, while they have led to the marginalization of agriculture and its eventual abandonment in others. The objective of this paper is to investigate the factors that are behind the differential performance of agriculture across the EU-27 countries. Ward's, k-means and two-step clustering methods were used to classify European agriculture based on gross-value-added farm, land and labour productivity indicators. Significant differences were revealed between the Northern-Central counties and the continental peripheries (Mediterranean, Eastern, Northern Scandinavian). An exact logistic regression model was used to analyse the factors behind this differential performance. Agricultural sectors characterized by a young and better trained farm population are more likely to attain high economic performance. The odds to attain high economic performance are almost 9 times greater for countries with a highly trained farm population, namely, the Netherlands (72%) and Germany (69%), than for countries with poor farm training, while an ageing farm population such as in Portugal (72%) and Bulgaria (66%) is 92% less likely to be high performing. The importance of investments in agriculture was also identified. The significance of the wheat yield variable highlights the importance of both environmental conditions and technical efficiency on farm economic performance. Similarly, countries with a high share of utilized agricultural land in less favoured areas, such as in the Mediterranean, are 94% less likely to attain high economic performance. The redesign of CAP direct payments between old and new member states after 2013 combined with the impacts of agricultural trade liberalization and climate change are expected to deteriorate the position of low performing agricultural sectors further.

AB  - In this study we examine how seed richness, diversity and composition from winter deposited sediment vary at increasing distances from a river channel. The objectives were to (1) describe the abundance, diversity, species composition and indicator species of seed deposited in a riparian wetland at different distances from the stream, (2) determine the range of variability in seed deposition at two spatial scales namely within distances and between distances from the river, and (3) determine the temporal patterns in seed germination at different distances from the river. A transect was established perpendicular to the river channel extending 101m into the river valley. Samples of winter deposited sediment were collected in early spring in 20 cm x 20 cm plots with three replicates positioned 2m, 16m, 23m, 41 m, 70m and 101 m from the river. Germination from the sediment seed pool was followed for six weeks under, respectively, moist and wet conditions in a greenhouse with a natural light regime and a mean temperature of 20 C. Overall, we found that winter high flow deposited a substantial amount of viable seeds in the inundated area. Germination was most successful under moist conditions where the number of seedlings ranged from 1050 to 3817 m(-2). Species richness (10.7 +/- 1.5 species), Shannon diversity (2.13 +/- 0.13) and evenness (0.90 +/- 0.03) peaked in samples taken 16m from the river channel. Variation in vegetation parameters was very high between samples, and 36% of the observations showed higher variation within replicates from the same distance than between distances reflecting high variability on a small spatial scale. The higher diversity of seedlings 16m from the river coincided with a confluence zone emerging within the floodplain due to the complex flow arising during inundations, causing higher sediment deposition. Most seeds and most species germinated within the first three weeks, indicating that species commonly deposited with winter high flow in riparian wetlands show early germination, giving them a competitive advantage when vegetation establishes in early spring.

AB  - Play has long been identified as a potential welfare indicator because it often disappears when animals are under fitness challenge and because it is thought to be accompanied by a pleasurable emotional experience. But animal play is a vexing behavioural phenomenon, characteristically flexible and variable within and between species, with its proximate mechanisms and ultimate functions still not fully understood. Its relationship to animal welfare is therefore complex and merits a focused theoretical investigation. We review evidence on four aspects of the play-welfare relationship: first, that play indicates the absence of fitness threats; second, that play acts as a reward and flags up the presence of opioid-mediated pleasurable emotional experiences; third, that play brings immediate psychological benefits and long-term fitness and health benefits, and thus improves current and future welfare; and finally, that play is socially contagious and therefore capable of spreading good welfare in groups. On this basis, we argue that play does indeed hold promise as a welfare indicator and also as a tool to improve it; but we also point to difficulties in its study and interpretation, and identify some unresolved questions. As a welfare indicator, play may signal both the absence of bad welfare and the presence of good welfare, thus covering a wide range of the welfare spectrum. However, play can also increase in stressful situations, in response to reduced parental care, or as a rebound after a period of deprivation and therefore does not consistently reflect favourable environmental conditions. A better fundamental understanding is needed of the varied ultimate functions and proximate mechanisms of play, and the species-specific play patterns of captive animals, in order to be able to explain exactly what an animal's play behaviour tells us about its welfare state, and whether and how play might be applied as a tool to improve welfare.

AB  - High resolution analyses of foraminiferal and radiolarian assemblages were performed on core MD 85682 (10 degrees 53'5N-52 degrees 23'E, 3092 m depth, 7.23 m length), located close to the Socotra Island, beneath the 10 degreesN gyre of the upwelling area of the Somali Basin (NW Indian Ocean), in order to reconstruct the paleoproductivity changes during the last 72 kyr. Correspondence and cluster analyses of combined planktonic foraminiferal and radiolarian quantitative data show that the distribution pattern of the microfauna is partly controlled by temperature and hydrographic structures and their interrelations on water mass fertility. The continuous occurrence of high abundances of foraminiferal species well known in fertile areas such as Globigerinita glutinata, Globigerina bulloides and Globigerina falconensis, as well as radiolarian species characteristic of upwelling systems, testifies to a sustained activity of the upwelling during the last 72 kyr. Downcore evolution of these biological proxies suggests an increase in paleoproductivity during isotope stages 1 and 3, which reflects a stronger upwelling activity during these periods. These observations are in agreement with the results previously obtained by geochemical markers such as biogenic barium, phosphorus, organic matter, and also trace elements related to the organic matter and indicators of redox conditions (vanadium). Samples from isotope stage 2 record a more complex biological and geochemical signature, resulting from increased terrigenous input. Comparison between the biological signatures obtained both under the Socotra (10 degreesN) and Somali (5 degreesN) upwelling areas indicates higher productivity throughout the last 72 kyr record of the Socotra upwelling system. In both areas, a similar evolution of biological proxies indicative of high fertility is observed during isotope stages 1 and 3. However, minor differences in the biological and geochemical signatures are related to local conditions prevailing beneath the two gyres. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Natural dyes are more eco-friendly alternatives to synthetic dyes. This research focuses on natural dyes and improved dye craft using plants employed by various ethnic groups in Southwestern China. In this study, we assessed the suitability of dried extracts from Buddleja officinalis flowers for dyeing hemp fabric. and valuated indicators including color strength (K/S), color characteristics, and fastness properties in response to washing, rubbing, and perspiration using metallic and natural mordants under pre-, post-, and simultaneous mordanting conditions. Specifically, we investigated the pigment compound crocin by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy analysis before using it to dye hemp fabric. Optimum dyeing conditions including staining temperature, staining duration, and pH have been identified using an orthogonal array experimental design. Optimum results were achieved when dyeing at pH 5, and at 60 degrees C for 90 min. Hemp fabric dyed without mordant had a shade of yellowness, while fabric mordanted with gum rosin, plant ash, KAl(SO4)2, and Chaenomeles speciosa had a variety of pale to dark yellowness color shades. A darker yellow-green color shade was obtained with FeSO4 mordant. The color change of washing fastness was mostly very poor, while the color stain of washing and perspiration fastness were good to excellent, and rubbing fastness was also good to excellent. The color fastness was kept and improved by the three natural mordants, especially gum rosin and plant ash, but reduced by FeSO4. Those results show that the use of aqueous extract from B. officinalis flowers combined with natural mordants represents a promising approach for textile dyeing, revealing an alternative method that could improve and extend the dyeing properties of this indigenous dye plant. In addition, our findings lay the foundation for further basic studies and demonstrate the utility of preserving natural dye plants, along with the related traditional knowledge of indigenous groups in Yunnan, China.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The thermal distribution inside a compost-bedded pack barn and the behavioural aspects plays an important role in terms of welfare and sustainability for dairy cows. Through a spatial variability assessment of thermal conditions in a compost barn, we found different regions with comfortable or stressful conditions based on air and bed temperature, as well as wind speed. Regarding the behaviour of cows with different number of lactations, we observed a higher probability of water intake in primiparous cows and increased walking behaviour in multiparous cows during the hottest periods. We suggest that special attention must be given to environmental control in a compost barn, mainly during hot seasons, to avoid different hot spots inside the facility. Additionally, with unbalanced environmental resources, the hierarchy of multiparous over primiparous cows might predominate the alleviation of the herd's thermal stress.
   The spatial variability and behavioural aspects of compost-bedded pack barns remain unknown in subtropical regions. In this study, we investigated whether spatial variability occurs in the thermal environment of a compost barn and how the behaviour of dairy cows with different numbers of lactations differs in this system. The spatial sampling design comprised a grid of 108 locations inside the facility. At each location, we measured air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and bed temperature at 9:00, 12:00, and 15:00. We performed 24-h behavioural observations. Regarding spatial variability, the north face showed high air temperature values, and the distribution of relative humidity varied from the north to the south face. Kriging maps revealed a high bedding temperature trend, indicating heterogeneous ventilation management. Primiparous cows visited the water trough during the hottest hours of the day, whereas multiparous cows displayed a higher probability of walking during these periods. In conclusion, we observed a heterogeneous management of ventilation through the spatial distribution of the thermal environment inside the compost-bedded pack barn, with multiparous cows exhibiting dominance over primiparous cows seeking environmental resources.

AB  - In the late Quaternary, glacial-interglacial transitions are marked by major environmental changes. Glacial periods in the western equatorial Atlantic (WEA) are characterized by high continental terrigenous input, which increases the proportion of terrestrial organic matter (e.g. lignin, alkanes), nutrients (e.g. iron and sulphur), and lower primary productivity. On the other hand, interglacials are characterized by lower continental contribution and maxima in primary productivity. Microbes can serve as biosensors of past conditions, but scarce information is available on deep-sea sediments in the WEA. The hypothesis put forward in this study is that past changes in climate conditions modulated the taxonomic/functional composition of microbes from deep sediment layers. To address this hypothesis, we collected samples from a marine sediment core located in the WEA, which covered the last 130 kyr. This region is influenced by the presence of the Amazon River plume, which outputs dissolved and particulate nutrients in vast oceanic regions, as well as the Parnaiba river plume. Core GL-1248 was analysed by shotgun metagenomics and geochemical analyses (alkane, lignin, perylene, sulphur). Two clusters (glacial and interglacial-deglacial) were found based on taxonomic and functional profiles of metagenomes. The interglacial period had a higher abundance of genes belonging to several sub-systems (e.g. DNA, RNA metabolism, cell division, chemotaxis, and respiration) that are consistent with a past environment with enhanced primary productivity. On the other hand, the abundance of Alcanivorax, Marinobacter, Kangiella and aromatic compounds that may serve as energy sources for these bacteria were higher in the glacial. The glacial period was enriched in genes for the metabolism of aromatic compounds, lipids, isoprenoids, iron, and Sulphur, consistent with enhanced fluvial input during the last glacial period. In contrast, interglacials have increased contents of more labile materials originating from phytoplankton (e.g. Prochlorococcus). This study provides new insights into the microbiome as climatic archives at geological timescales. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction
   Whereas scientists depend on the language of probability to relay information about hazards, risk communication may be more effective when embedding scientific information in narratives. The persuasive power of narratives is theorized to reside, in part, in narrative transportation.
   Purpose
   This study seeks to advance the science of stories in risk communication by measuring real-time affective responses as a proxy indicator for narrative transportation during science messages that present scientific information in the context of narrative.
   Methods
   This study employed a within-subjects design in which participants (n = 90) were exposed to eight science messages regarding flood risk. Conventional science messages using probability and certainty language represented two conditions. The remaining six conditions were narrative science messages that embedded the two conventional science messages within three story forms that manipulated the narrative mechanism of character selection. Informed by the Narrative Policy Framework, the characters portrayed in the narrative science messages were hero, victim, and victim-to-hero. Natural language processing techniques were applied to identify and rank hero and victim vocabularies from 45 resident interviews conducted in the study area; the resulting classified vocabulary was used to build each of the three story types. Affective response data were collected over 12 group sessions across three flood-prone communities in Montana. Dial response technology was used to capture continuous, second-by-second recording of participants' affective responses while listening to each of the eight science messages. Message order was randomized across sessions. ANOVA and three linear mixed-effects models were estimated to test our predictions.
   Results
   First, both probabilistic and certainty science language evoked negative affective responses with no statistical differences between them. Second, narrative science messages were associated with greater variance in affective responses than conventional science messages. Third, when characters are in action, variation in the narrative mechanism of character selection leads to significantly different affective responses. Hero and victim-to-hero characters elicit positive affective responses, while victim characters produce a slightly negative response.
   Conclusions
   In risk communication, characters matter in audience experience of narrative transportation as measured by affective responses.

AB  - Eroding permafrost coasts are likely indicators and integrators of changes in the Arctic System as they are susceptible to the combined effects of declining sea ice extent, increases in open water duration, more frequent and impactful storms, sea-level rise, and warming permafrost. However, few observation sites in the Arctic have yet to link decadal-scale erosion rates with changing environmental conditions due to temporal data gaps. This study increases the temporal fidelity of coastal permafrost bluff observations using near-annual high spatial resolution (<1 m) satellite imagery acquired between 2008-2017 for a 9 km segment of coastline at Drew Point, Beaufort Sea coast, Alaska. Our results show that mean annual erosion for the 2007-2016 decade was 17.2 m yr(-1), which is 2.5 times faster than historic rates, indicating that bluff erosion at this site is likely responding to changes in the Arctic System. In spite of a sustained increase in decadal-scale mean annual erosion rates, mean open water season erosion varied from 6.7 m yr(-1) in 2010 to more than 22.0 m yr(-1) in 2007, 2012, and 2016. This variability provided a range of coastal responses through which we explored the different roles of potential environmental drivers. The lack of significant correlations between mean open water season erosion and the environmental variables compiled in this study indicates that we may not be adequately capturing the environmental forcing factors, that the system is conditioned by long-term transient effects or extreme weather events rather than annual variability, or that other not yet considered factors maybe responsible for the increased erosion occurring at Drew Point. Our results highlight an increase in erosion at Drew Point in the 21st century as well as the complexities associated with unraveling the factors responsible for changing coastal permafrost bluffs in the Arctic.

AB  - Fat mass and body condition are important metrics in bioenergetics and physiological studies. They can also link foraging success with demographic rates, making them key components of models that predict population-level outcomes of environmental change. Therefore, it is important to incorporate uncertainty in physiological indicators if results will lead to species management decisions. Maternal fat mass in elephant seals (Mirounga spp) can predict reproductive rate and pup survival, but no one has quantified or identified the sources of uncertainty for the two fat mass estimation techniques (labeled-water and truncated cones). The current cones method can provide estimates of proportion adipose tissue in adult females and proportion fat of juveniles in northern elephant seals (M. angustirostris) comparable to labeled-water methods, but it does not work for all cases or species. We reviewed components and assumptions of the technique via measurements of seven early-molt and seven late-molt adult females. We show that seals are elliptical on land, rather than the assumed circular shape, and skin may account for a high proportion of what is often defined as blubber. Also, blubber extends past the neck-to-pelvis region, and comparisons of new and old ultrasound instrumentation indicate previous measurements of sculp thickness may be biased low. Accounting for such differences, and incorporating new measurements of blubber density and proportion of fat in blubber, we propose a modified cones method that can isolate blubber from non-blubber adipose tissue and separate fat into skin, blubber, and core compartments. Lastly, we found that adipose tissue and fat estimates using tritiated water may be biased high during the early molt. Both the tritiated water and modified cones methods had high, but reducible, uncertainty. The improved cones method for estimating body condition allows for more accurate quantification of the various tissue masses and may also be transferrable to other species.

AB  - The organic-rich Changliang Mountain oil shale, located in the North Qiangtang depression, northern Tibet, is considered to be excellent mineral resource in China. The Changliang Mountain oil shale reported here was deposited in a tidal flat-lagoon environment and is characterized by black thin-layered oil shales intercalated with dark-gray marls. Here, we present geochemical data from the Changliang Mountain oil shale profile, in order to investigate the mechanism of organic matter (OM) accumulation and to establish the formation model for the marine oil shale deposition. Total organic carbon (TOC) values range from 2.96 to 23.47% in the oil shale samples, while the marl samples contains low TOC contents, ranging from 0.06 to 0.21%. In the organic-rich oil shale sediments, many redox indicators, including Mo/Al ratios, V/Cr ratios, Th/U ratios, Ni/Co ratios, and the relationship of Mo to TOC suggest a deposition under dysoxic to anoxic environments. Subsequently, the bottom water evolved into an oxic water body when the organic-poor marls were deposited. However, the negative and/or weak relationship between TOC and productivity indices P/Ti and Ba/Al indicates that OM accumulation was not controlled mainly by primary productivity, but dysoxic/anoxic bottom water environment A stratified water column may be initiated by the supply of fresh water from the continent nearby, combining with warm and humid climate, which is beneficial to the reproduction of marine organisms. The death and bury of these organisms could lead to the formation of dysoxic/anoxic bottom waters and enhance the preservation of OM. In this study, a preservation model of the Changliang Mountain oil shale was established. The model implies that excellent preservation is the major controlling factor for OM enrichment in the oil shale layer. In addition, factors such as mixed deposition with clay minerals, and detrital matter input cannot be ignored for their influence on OM enrichment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lake Victoria, East Africa, supports a fishery that yields about one million tonnes per annum consisting predominantly of three species, Nile Perch (Lates niloticus), Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and a native sardine-like cyprinid called Dagaa (Rastrineobola argentea). The non-native Nile Perch is the most valuable of these species and supports an important commercial export industry; there are fears that overfishing, due to the growth of fishing capacity, is threatening the Nile Perch fishery. Based on its economic importance and the notion that overfishing is threatening the resource, the current fishery management system was developed to control fishing capacity and effort. This system, using the concepts of co-management, where fishing communities and stakeholders participate through community organizations called Beach Management Units (BMUs) to actively manage the fishery in partnership with the central government, has been criticized that it is "fishery-based," focusing on a single species and taking no account of ecological conditions in the lake, nor other species. A more "holistic" approach, which places a greater emphasis on changing nutrient concentrations and primary productivity as drivers of fish populations, has been proposed. Though fishery biologists and managers on Lake Victoria recognize that ecological conditions affect fishery populations, there appears to be two major challenges hindering the implementation of such approaches: first, the lack of a coherent objective of the Lake Victoria fishery, and second, the challenges associated with incorporating and implementing concepts of nutrient information and multiple species into a practical fishery management program.
   This article describes the current fishery co-management program to determine the feasibility of implementing a holistic approach on Lake Victoria. It is concluded that whether a management system should be "holistic" or "fishery-based" is of little importance; what is needed on Lake Victoria are clear objectives and a management plan that will enable those objectives to be achieved, utilizing both ecological and fisheries data where appropriate.

Prior studies have determined the effectiveness of shrub-type cover for this purpose in Spain using small plots sustaining the growth of mature shrubs without considering scaling effects or the establishment and colonisation period, in which the risk of soil erosion is high. In addition, these studies have assessed the effects of high magnitude-low frequency simulated rainfall. The aim of the present study was to measure under natural rainfall conditions the effects of three shrub covers (Colutea arborescens, Dorycnium pentaphyllum and Medicago strasseri) on runoff and soil loss. Plots 20.2 m x 4 m were created and runoff discharge and sediment concentrations were measured after each rainfall event for 2.5 years (establishment period) and for the following 4 years when the shrubs were well-developed. The results of this experiment were compared with those of a previous study, in which the same data were recorded under conditions of simulated high-intensity rainfall in small plots (0.25 m(2)). In the control plot (bare soil), 5 rainfall events were responsible for 85% of the erosion (37.5 Mg ha(-1)) and 59% of the runoff (128.8 mm) produced. When the shrub covers were mature, runoff and erosion were reduced (by 84-95% and 95-99% respectively) compared to the establishment period. The effects of the shrubs at mitigating soil and water losses were more pronounced following high intensity rainfall events. Compared to smaller plots, the 80.8 m(2) plots tested here showed similar soil losses under high intensity thunderstorms but runoff losses were much lower, suggesting that some of the runoff reinfiltrates the slope due to shrub distribution effects.

AB  - The little-known Emakwezini Formation (Adelaide Subgroup, Beaufort Group, Karoo Supergroup) crops out in a narrow strip just inland of the eastern coast of South Africa in northern KwaZulu-Natal. It is an actively mined coal-bearing succession characterised by fining-upward successions of coarse- to fine-grained sandstones together with mudstones containing a fossil assemblage of animal traces, insects, molluscs, arthropods, fish and plants. Previously, only Glossopteris leaves and Phyllotbeca australis had been describe from this formation, on the basis of a few very small, scattered and poorly provenanced collections.
   Recent regional-scale sedimentary facies analysis (based on field relationships, provenance studies, palaeocurrent and subsurface data) together with palaeobotanical studies of a newly discovered, well-preserved and diverse paleoflora from the Emakwezini Formation, have permitted a more detailed interpretation of the depositional environment. The current investigation also reveals the first evidence of the plant fossils Dictyopteridium flabellatum, Rigbya arberioides, Lidgettonia spp., and Trizygia speciosa in the upper parts of the Emakwezinin Formation, strongly supporting a Late Permian age based on correlation with floras from Upper Permian units in the main Karoo Basin. In the lower part of the unit, within the partings of actively mined coal seams. our preliminary investigations also show the presence of a new flora including both the glossopterid fructification Ottokaria sp. (only known from the Lower Permian in South Africa) and the sphenopsid Schizoneura gondwanensis (typical of the Upper Permian in South Africa).
   With sediments sourced from a north-easterly continental interior, the Emakwezini Formation was deposited rapidly in a fluviolacustrine setting under moist conditions capable of supporting an abundant and diverse biota. the permanently moist environment in which the Emakwezinin Formation was deposited contrasts with that of the time-equivalent lower Beaufort Group units in the main Karoo basin where environmental indicators suggest deltaic, lacustrine and meandering fluvial systems developed in a seasonally dry and more arid setting. Thus, within southern Africa, during the Middle to Late Permian, the environmental conditions, including climate, were varied leading to a mosaic of continental depositional settings.

AB  - Monoterpene emissions, monoterpene synthase activities, photosynthesis, fluorescence yield in the dark and drought stress indicators (stomatal conductance and mid-day water potential) were concurrently measured under similar temperature and illumination in current-year leaves of Quercus ilex L. of plants grown in open-top chambers at ambient (350 ppm) and elevated (700 ppm) CO2. The study was undertaken to understand the effect of CO2 on monoterpene biosynthesis, and to predict and parameterize the biogenic emissions at growing CO2 concentrations. The results of the 1998 and 1999 studies show that at elevated CO2, and in the absence of persistent environmental stresses, photosynthesis was stimulated with respect to ambient CO2, but that the emission of the three most abundantly emitted monoterpenes (alpha -pinene, sabinene and beta -pinene) was inhibited by approximately 68%. The enzyme activities of the monoterpene synthases catalysing the formation of the three monoterpenes were also inhibited at elevated CO2 and an excellent relationship was found between monoterpene emission and activity of the corresponding enzyme both at ambient and elevated CO2. Interestingly, however, limonene emission was enhanced in conditions of elevated CO2 as it was also the corresponding synthase. The ratio between enzyme activity and emission of the three main monoterpenes was high (above 20) at ambient CO2 but it was below 10 at elevated CO2 and, for limonene, on both treatments. Our results indicate that the overall emission of monoterpenes at elevated CO2 will be inhibited because of a concurrent, strong down-regulation of monoterpene synthase activities. When the enzyme activity does not change, as for limonene, the high photosynthetic carbon availability at elevated CO2 conditions may even stimulate emission. The results of the 1997 study show that severe and persistent drought, as commonly occurs in the Mediterranean, may inhibit both photosynthesis and monoterpene (a-pinene) emission, particularly at ambient CO2. Thus, emission is probably limited by photosynthetic carbon availability; the effect of elevated CO2 per se is not apparent if drought, and perhaps other environmental stresses, are also present.

AB  - This review considers the role of pedogenic processes in modifying wind-blown dust (loess), concentrating particularly on the ways that resulting properties may be interpreted as indicators of past climatic conditions and changes. Emphasis is placed on the sequences of palaeosols developed within loess deposits that are frequently regarded as some of the best terrestrial equivalents of marine-sediment records of long-term global climatic change. A palaeosol is generally interpreted in terms of the broad pedogenic processes and environments assumed to be currently responsible for that type of soil forming at the present surface. Even the very presence of a palaeosol may have palaeoclimatic significance, however, in that it is often taken to indicate a period of relative land surface stability and warmer and/or moister conditions between cold and/or and phases of loess accumulation. In reality, it may be more useful to consider many loess-palaeosol sequences in terms of changing balances between pedogenesis and loess accumulation over geological time. In most regions, it seems that the balance swings towards pedogenesis during interglacials or interstadials when sediment supply and transport are limited and the climate is warmer and/or wetter. Where accumulation rates are still appreciable during these 'soil-forming intervals', however, the soils and palaeosols may be accretionary with surface build-up keeping pace with pedogenesis. Welding may also occur where covering sediments are insufficiently thick to isolate an underlying palaeosol from the effects of pedogenesis active at a new land surface. Further complications occur due to reworking of palaeosols and syndepositional pedogenic alteration of loess units. Generally, such pedocomplexes can only be deciphered if the different pedogenic, geomorphic and sedimentary processes are identified and ordered within a pedosedimentary reconstruction. A recent trend has been to treat some loess-palaeosol sequences as quasi-continuous time series, particularly when comparing depth functions of climatic-proxy properties such as magnetic susceptibility and grain size with marine and ice-core isotope curves.

AB  - QuestionsMountain grasslands can be strongly affected by extreme droughts such as those related to climate change. What are the impacts of extreme droughts on community composition, diversity, Ellenberg indicator scores and species groups in oligotrophic montane Nardus grasslands, and what are the associated mechanisms of vegetation change?
   LocationRhon Mountains, Germany.
   MethodsOver three consecutive years, we investigated the effects of yearly droughts (April-August) in an experimental setup with rainout shelters. Owing to the coincidence of ambient extreme dry conditions in those years and our artificial rainfall reduction, we evaluated the contribution to community change of ambient drought conditions and the treatments. We analysed changes in community composition by applying redundancy analysis to species differences in comparison with the pretreatment year, and used mixed-effects models to test for changes in community-weighted means of Ellenberg indicator scores, sociological and functional groups.
   ResultsWe found significant changes in species abundance and community structures in response to drought. Evenness increased, but species richness remained rather stable over time. Ellenberg indicator scores for temperature and nitrogen increased, whereas the score for moisture decreased. Simultaneously, dominant species declined and subdominants increased. Changes occurred with a time lag and were driven largely by the high ambient drought level and less by the artificial treatments.
   ConclusionsOur results show that drought-related changes in community composition in Nardus grasslands occur across community structures, characteristic species, and species groups. The post-drought recovery of the community is shaped by community filters, which in particular allow subdominants to take advantage of newly available niches in the matrix, even if they lack strong drought tolerance. Our findings indicate a certain resilience of the community to droughts related to climate change, which suggests that the observed changes should not lead to an accelerated short-term decline in these grasslands, but that this cannot be excluded in the long term.

AB  - The Wuliyasitai southern sag is an oil-rich area in the Erlian Basin. The geochemical characteristics of the organic matter were comprehensively analyzed by a combined investigation of Rock-Eval pyrolysis, molecular geochemistry, vitrinite reflectance, and thin section observation. The studied samples have vitrinite reflectance (Ro) values of 0.33-1.22% and pyrolysis parameter T-max values of 424-456 degrees C, suggesting that organic matter is mainly present in the low mature to mature stage. The values of the abundance indicators including total organic carbon (TOC), chloroform bitumen "A," potential hydrocarbon generation amount (PG), hydrogen index (HI), and total hydrocarbon (HC) suggest a good to very good hydrocarbon generation potential. The pyrolysis parameter T-max and HI obtained imply that the samples are dominated by the type II1-II2 organic matter. The composition characteristics of n-alkanes, steranes, and terpanes confirm that the organic matter has mixed input sources. The Aershan Formation (Klba) in the southeastern part of the sag show higher contributions of algae and bacteria due to fertilization by volcanic ash. The hydrocarbon generation threshold was determined from the hydrocarbon index (HCI), production index (PI), chloroform bitumen "A"/TOC, and HC/TOC. By analyzing the relationships between TOC and pyrolysis parameter HCI, chloroform bitumen "A"/TOC, the lower limits of the TOC values for effective source rocks were established to be 2.5 wt % in the K1bt(1) and 1.5 wt % in the K1ba. The pristane/phytane (Pr/Ph), gammacerane/C-31 22R hopane, C-35/C-34 homohopane and trace element ratios suggest that the source rocks are primarily deposited in a freshwater sub-oxidizing environment. The TOC and HI are negatively correlated with Pr/Ph, indicating that redox conditions play an important role in source rock preservation. Most molecular maturity parameters are not recommended owing to their poor correlations with Ro.

AB  - Air pollution is an increasingly concerning problem given it constitutes a risk for people's health and the environment. In Mexico, there are some regions where society does not know the conditions of air quality, and in some others this information is not used or analyzed. Hence is important the study of air quality evolution to generate strategies that allow to mitigate adverse effects on population. In this research we analyze the trend of Criteria Air Pollutants (PM10 and O-3 and CO), considering the distribution of good, regular and bad days for air quality, as well as the trend of hourly, daily, monthly and annual concentrations in the city of Villahermosa, Tabasco between 2011-2017, with information provided by the State government, in order to design an effective communication mechanism. We obtained air quality indicators based on the official Mexican regulation and the temporal behavior of the pollutants. Additionally, we trained artificial neural network models for the prediction of air pollutant concentration. Finally, we propose the design of a web portal for the communication of air quality. According to the weekly behavior, is shown that we are exposed daily to potential health hazards by any of the air pollutants, also that the second trimester of each year shows the worst conditions and that the pollutants that have a greater contribution to air pollution in the city are CO, PM10 and O-3. Likewise, the tendencies of PM10 and O-3 indicate a slow decrease of -0.5 ug/m(3)-year, -0.0004 ppm-year respectively, which requires a redefinition of government strategies that may potentiate their decrease. In this sense, the web portal is proposed under two main approaches: First, with the purpose of communication, aimed to the society so it can take preventive measures on their exposure to high contamination levels. The second approach is aimed to the academic community and government authorities, with graphic information on the criteria air pollutants' tendencies, providing analytical elements for structuring environmental policies.

AB  - The influence of human harvest on evolution of secondary sexual characteristics has implications for sustainable management of wildlife populations. The phenotypic consequences of selectively removing males with large horns or antlers from ungulate populations have been a topic of heightened concern in recent years. Harvest can affect size of horn-like structures in two ways: (a) shifting age structure toward younger age classes, which can reduce the mean size of horn-like structures, or (b) selecting against genes that produce large, fast-growing males. We evaluated effects of age, climatic and forage conditions, and metrics of harvest on horn size and growth of mountain sheep (Ovis canadensis ssp.) in 72 hunt areas across North America from 1981 to 2016. In 50% of hunt areas, changes in mean horn size during the study period were related to changes in age structure of harvested sheep. Environmental conditions explained directional changes in horn growth in 28% of hunt areas, 7% of which did not exhibit change before accounting for effects of the environment. After accounting for age and environment, horn size of mountain sheep was stable or increasing in the majority (similar to 78%) of hunt areas. Age-specific horn size declined in 44% of hunt areas where harvest was regulated solely by morphological criteria, which supports the notion that harvest practices that are simultaneously selective and intensive might lead to changes in horn growth. Nevertheless, phenotypic consequences are not a foregone conclusion in the face of selective harvest; over half of the hunt areas with highly selective and intensive harvest did not exhibit age-specific declines in horn size. Our results demonstrate that while harvest regimes are an important consideration, horn growth of harvested male mountain sheep has remained largely stable, indicating that changes in horn growth patterns are an unlikely consequence of harvest across most of North America.

AB  - The studies were carried out with the purpose to determine the effectiveness of applying the designated doses of fertilizers for the formation of planned yields of potato tubers of the early-ripening varieties Molly and Colette, within the conditions of the forest steppe of the Middle Volga region. The influence of mineral nutrient status, designed for obtaining the yields of potatoes 25, 35 and 45 tons/ha, in comparison with the unfertilized controlvariant, has been studied. The analysis of the dynamics of the potato plants leaf area, the parameters of leaf photosynthetic potential, the utilization coefficient of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) showed, that these indicators of photosynthetic activity were directly dependent on the level of mineral nutrition. The application of fertilizers and raising their doses increased the value of photosynthetic potential (PP). In the control variant, without applying fertilizers, the sum of photosynthetic potential was 1.762 million for the variety Molly, 1.894 million m(2)/ha x days for the variety Colette. The application of fertilizers, designed for a potato yield of 25 tons per hectare, has increased this index by 1.49 and 1.51 times, and the fertilization, designed for the yield 45 t/ha has increased this index by 2.25 and 2.01 times. For every 1 thousand units, the PP was formed in the variety Molly from 10.15 kg in the control variant to 11.25 kg of potato tubers with underlying of 45 t/ ha, and in the variety Colette, respectively, from 10.32 to 11.45 kg. With regard to natural fertility, theyield of varietyMolly was 16.76 t/ha and 18.32 t/ha of thevariety Colette. Fertilizers, designed for 25-45 t/ha of potato tubers, ensured the yield of variety Molly 28.23-43.57 t/ha, the variety Colette - 29.72-29 t/ha.

AB  - Background: There is little information on the prevalence of Fasciola hepatica infection in the horse population in Ireland or the potential impact of fluke infection on animal health.
   Objectives: To investigate F. hepatica infection in the Irish horse population and to assess the diagnostic potential of an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the F. hepatica recombinant cathepsin L1 (CL1) antigen.
   Study design: Cross-sectional abattoir survey of horses for liver fluke status.
   Methods: Animals (n = 200) were examined at an abattoir between May 2013 and April 2014. Horses were graded ante mortem for body condition score. Blood and faeces were collected and livers were examined post mortem by gross morphology. A cohort (n = 35) of livers were also examined histologically. Haematology and blood biochemistry, including serum liver enzyme activities, were measured and faeces were sedimented for egg counts. Serum was assayed by indirect ELISA using a recombinant CL1.
   Results: The prevalence of liver fluke infection was 9.5%. There was no correlation between liver fluke status and time of year, breed classification, age group, sex, body condition score, ante mortem assessment, strongyle infection status, serum liver enzyme activities or CL1 concentration. A comparison of the CL1 ELISA in horse sera compared with a reference standard diagnosis showed high specificity of 95.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 91.5-98.0%), but low sensitivity of 42.1% (95% CI 20.2-66.5%).
   Main limitations: This study is limited by its nature as an abattoir study, the relatively small number of animals examined (n = 200), and the absence of a known negative group of horses.
   Conclusions: Blood biomarkers are not good indicators of liver fluke infection and the CL1 ELISA is not a sensitive tool for diagnosis of fluke infection in the horse. The prevalence of F. hepatica in horses indicates that further research is required to assess the potential impact of liver fluke on equine liver health.

AB  - In detrital coastal aquifers, seawater and surface water may interact with groundwater in multiple ways. Understanding the interference of water fluxes in this type of environment is essential to effectively manage the groundwater resources in water-stressed regions, such as the Mediterranean coastal fringe. In this research, the characterization of the main hydrogeochemical processes and the interaction between surface water and groundwater in the Marbella-Estepona coastal aquifers (southern Spain) have been carried out by means of the combined use of different hydrogeochemical indicators along with isotope data. The results show that the diversity of source lithologies (peridotite, carbonate and/or metapelitic) substantially conditions the groundwater geochemistry. The analysis of ionic deltas made it possible a preliminary screening of the geochemical reactions that occur in the Marbella-Estepona aquifers, while the Discriminant Analysis allowed for a consistent classification of sampled groundwater types. The dissolution of calcite and dolomite determines the chemical composition of the groundwater from the eastern sector that are more conditioned by the rainwater infiltration. The dissolution of magnesium-bearing minerals (predominantly forming peridotite rocks) is observed in grodndwater samples from the western and central sectors, whose chemical composition showed a greater influence of surface water. The spatial analysis of rC1(-)/Br- in groundwater has permitted to corroborate that saline intrusion is negligible, hardly affecting to its original water quality. The irregularly distributed recharge by precipitation (seasonal effect) and the atmospheric circulation of cloud fronts (coastal/continental effect) explains why most of groundwater sampled is isotopically impoverished with respect to the rainfall signature. The isotope approach also suggests the hydraulic relationship between surface water and groundwater in the study site. A deeper knowledge of spatial hydrogeochemical variations in coastal groundwater and the influence of water sources over them are crucial for a sustainable groundwater management and global change adaptation in equivalent Mediterranean water -stressed regions.

AB  - The seedlings of pedunculate oak (Quercos robur L.) were exposed to different ater contents (non-limiting and severe drought) for 30 days in a greenhouse in order to examine the effects of prolonged summer drought on diurnal fluctuations of gas exchange parameters.
   Results showed that, in control treatment, diurnal course of photosynthetic rate (A), transpiration rate (E) and stomatal conductance (g(s)) was bimodal, showing clear midday depression. In stress treatment, the diurnal dynamics of A exhibited an atypical double-peaked pattern, whereas the diurnal change in E and g(s) presented a single-peaked curve. A positive and significant correlation between A and g(s) was observed in well-watered as well as in drought stressed plants, whereas intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) increased with decreasing A rate. Therefore, we might assume that in both treatments die largest part of the reduction in photosynthesis was caused by stomatal closure; however, this finding does not preclude the existence of alternative mechanisms that may also have affected photosynthesis. The diurnal dynamics of instantaneous water use efficiency (WUE) exhibited maximum values in the early morning, afterwards it decreased during late morning and throughout the afternoon with the decline being greater in the stressed than in the control plants. Comparing to the control, the plants subjected to permanent water deficit have increased intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) during the early morning, pointing out on minimized loss of water per fixed CO2. Leaf temperature (TI), as an environmental factor, was in a significant negative correlation with WUE, and in a positive one with E, in both treatments. The results of the study point to the adverse effect of prolonged experimental drought on net photosynthesis and other gas exchange parameters in pedunculate oak leaves, allowing them to he used as an important indicator of environmental conditions and trends in climate change.

AB  - Suitable management and sufficient precipitation on grasslands can provide carbon sinks. The net carbon accumulation of a site from the atmosphere, modeled as the Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP), is a useful means to gauge carbon balance. Previous research has developed methods to integrate flux tower data with satellite biophysical datasets to estimate NEP across large regions. A related method uses the Ecosystem Performance Anomaly (EPA) as a satellite-derived indicator of disturbance intensity (e.g., livestock stocking rate, fire, and insect damage). To better understand the interactions among management, climate, and carbon dynamics, we evaluated the relationship between EPA and NEP data at the 250 m scale for grasslands in the Central Great Plains, USA (ranging from semi-arid to mesic). We also used weekly estimates of NEP to evaluate the phenology of carbon dynamics, classified by EPA (i.e., by level of disturbance impact). Results show that the cumulative carbon balance over these grasslands from 2000 to 2008 was a weak net sink of 13.7 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Overall, NEP increased with precipitation (R-2 = 0.39, P < 0.05) from west to east. Disturbance influenced NEP phenology; however, climate and biophysical conditions were usually more important. The NEP response to disturbance varies by ecoregion, and more generally by grassland type, where the shortgrass prairie NEP is most sensitive to disturbance, the mixed-grass prairie displays a moderate response, and tallgrass prairie is the least impacted by disturbance (as measured by EPA). Sustainable management practices in the tallgrass and mixed-grass prairie may potentially induce a period of average net carbon sink until a new equilibrium soil organic carbon is achieved. In the shortgrass prairie, management should be considered sustainable if carbon stocks are simply maintained. The consideration of site carbon balance adds to the already difficult task of managing grasslands appropriately to site conditions. Results clarify the seasonal and interannual dynamics of NEP, specifically the influence of disturbance and moisture availability. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Indian summer monsoon is fundamentally a giant land-sea breeze produced by the heating of the Eurasian land mass and the relative cooling of the Indian Ocean. It is a significant component of the climate system as it has global linkages through El Nino-Southem Oscillation (ENSO) and other factors. Changes in the land-ocean temperature contrast can have a profound influence on the strength of the monsoon winds and precipitation. Although India is fortunate to have instrumental records of rainfall dating back to. the 18(th) century, it is important to investigate how on geological time scales, the monsoon may have responded to variations in the incoming solar energy, the earth's orbital characteristics and glacial boundary conditions.
   For reconstructing past monsoon episodes, recourse has to be taken to proxy data as indirect evidence of what the conditions might have been like. There are many high-resolution proxy indicators such as width and density of tree rings in the Himalayan forests, geochemical characteristics of Arabian Sea corals, laminated ocean-floor sediment cores off the west coast of India, lake-bed pollen sequences from northwestern India, and high-elevation ice cores from the Tibetan region. It must be realised that inferences drawn from proxy studies are bound to have limitations and uncertainties and cannot be expected to match the accuracy of analyses carried out with recent meteorological data. However, for studies on time scales of hundreds to thousands of years, there is perhaps no alternative to the use of proxy data.
   It is now generally agreed that the climate of the Holocene was relatively stable, but was characterised by millennial scale variability and long-term trends including changes in the nature of ENSO. As more results emerge from proxy studies, we would be in a better position to re-construct past monsoons, droughts and floods over the Indian region. If parallels to the present global warming trend were discovered in the historical past, they would help in building better monsoon prediction models.

AB  - In this study, we analyse the cumulative rate of compositional change along an altitudinal gradient in the Swiss Alps for three different groups of aquatic organisms - Cladocera, chironomids, and diatoms. In particular, we are interested in the magnitude of unusually large changes in species composition that allows the detection of critical ecotones for each of these three organism groups. The estimated rate-of-change is the distance in ordination space using principal coordinate analysis based on chord distance and chi-square distance. These analyses highlight the cumulative rate-of-change and the cumulative relative rate-of-change, as the chi-square distance is relative to the total species composition. We found that the major changes in taxonomic composition for the three organism groups and therefore also the major ecotones are just below the modern tree-line (1900-2000 m a.s.l.), which may indirectly be an effect of the tree-line. For diatoms and Cladocera (only chi-square distance) there is also an ecotone at 2055 m a.s.l., which may be a direct or indirect response to climate. Further, the ecotone region below the modern tree-line is much wider for chironomids, with an extension downwards due to a shift in relative abundance patterns. For diatoms there is a stronger rate-of-change above 1650 m a.s.l. when chi-square distance is used. Coupled with the even distribution of diatom richness, this suggests that at higher altitudes the change is more strongly associated with a few species becoming dominant compared to lower elevations. Hence, there are considerable differences among the three organism groups, suggesting that different environmental factors may influence the rates of compositional change within and among groups. This supports the general usefulness of multi-proxy studies, namely the study of several independent groups of organisms to reconstruct past environmental conditions but also points to the importance of careful site selection in such studies.

AB  - The interaction of organic matter with mineral components of the solid phase of soils is the most important process that regulates the cycle and balance of carbon in the biosphere. The adsorption of humic acids on minerals is accompanied by their fractionation in size, composition, and amphiphilicity, thus decreasing their heterogeneity. Despite a strong interest in studying the regularities and mechanisms of the interaction between natural organic matter and layered aluminosilicates, it is necessary to take into account the natural diversity of soil organic matter, adsorption conditions, and mineral composition. This study was designed to investigate the adsorption regularities of fulvic acid (FA) and water-extractable organic matter (WEOM) isolated from horizon H of peaty-podzolic-gleyic soil on kaolinite and muscovite. Sorbates and sorbents were examined by the following methods: high-pressure size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and potentiometric titration. The specific surface areas of the sorbents were determined by the sorption of N-2 molecules. We found that hydrophobic components of FA and WEOM are mainly adsorbed on mineral surfaces. The adsorption of FA and WEOM on kaolinite and muscovite is followed by decreased hydrophobicity of organic matter and decreased heterogeneity of its amphiphilic properties in an equilibrium solution. At pH levels around 6, sorption of organic matter from FA solution containing 19% and 81% hydrophilic and hydrophobic components, respectively, onto kaolinite and muscovite occurs mainly due to hydrophobic components. Hydrophobic interactions on siloxane surfaces are the main mechanism to fix FA on both minerals. Kaolinite adsorbs slightly more organic carbon per unit area than muscovite. The adsorption of WEOM from a solution with 41% hydrophilic and 59% hydrophobic components results not only from hydrophobic and hydrophilic components but also from hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions and depends on pH. The most hydrophobic fractions of organic matter are adsorbed from the hydrophobic components on the surface of both minerals. Under conditions of the performed experiments at pH < 5, more WEOM is adsorbed on muscovite than on kaolinite.

AB  - Competition simultaneously limits the availability of above- and below-ground resources for plants. How plants respond to density with changes in patterns of biomass allocation is poorly understood. Previous studies had inconsistent results, but emphasised increased biomass allocation to stems in response to density. However, the response of plants to density may depend on environmental conditions and on characteristics of the species.
   We grew 43 herbaceous plant species at three densities (1, 8 and 64 individuals per pot) and two nutrient levels in a common garden and measured biomass allocation to roots (RMF), leaves (LMF) and stems (SMF), and specific root (SRL) and stem length (SSL). The species differed in functional group (grasses, forbs and legumes), life span and realised niche with respect to nutrients (Ellenberg's nutrient indicator value).
   Intraspecific competition and self-thinning increased with nutrient supply. Overall, plants increased their RMF with density independent of nutrient level, indicating that competition was mainly for below-ground resources. However, characteristics of the species influenced their responses to density and nutrients in terms of biomass allocation, SRL and SSL. At high densities, legumes were more productive than the other functional groups and hardly changed their allocation patterns, suggesting that they were less nutrient limited due to their mutualism with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. The SRL of perennials was lower, and their RMF was higher and increased more strongly in response to density than that of annuals, which could be interpreted as mechanisms to increase survival. The realised niche of species with respect to nutrients influenced the response to density and nutrients in terms of SMF, LMF, SRL and SSL in line with adaptations to both nutrient availability and competition for light in the typical habitats.
   Synthesis. We found that intraspecific competition was mainly for below-ground resources, which may be typical for many species growing in moderately nutrient-rich but high-light habitats. Our results show that growth conditions, species characteristics and their interactions influence patterns of biomass allocation and plant morphology.

AB  - The phrase "soil health" describes the condition of a soil in terms of its physical, chemical, and biological properties. The relationship between soil health and crop yield is rather complex, and quantifying their spatial characteristics at field scale is often limited in the literature. To explore the significance and spatial characteristics of soil health and its indicators in crop production, field-based research was conducted in 2018 at the Blackland Research Center, Texas with the following objectives: (i) to quantify soil health indicators of the Haney Soil Health Tool across a corn field; (ii) to relate soil health status to drought-year corn yield using geospatial techniques; and (iii) to evaluate the relationship among soil health, corn yield, and soils types. We collected 218 samples from 0 to 10 cm soil depth in a 27-ha field following a 35 m x 35 m grid sampling scheme. Samples were analyzed for water extractable organic carbon (WEOC), total nitrogen, nitrate-nitrogen, ammoniacal-nitrogen, and 24-hr CO2 evolution (1-day CO2). Analyses results were used to calculate a soil health value based on Haney Soil Health Tool. The field had an average soil health value of 8.5 (+/- 2.2), and corn yield of 2.9 t ha(-1) (+/- 1.3); however, corn yield was more variable (CV > 43%) than soil health (CV = 26.7%). Overall, soil samples with lower values of 1-day CO2, WEOC, and organic nitrogen indicated a lower soil health value, which generally corresponding to lower corn yield. Corn yield may be weakly predicted by soil health (Corn yield = -0.29 + 0.39 x Soil health value, R-2 = 0.28). Soil type and rainfall exhibited measurable effects upon the calculated soil health value; corn yields were greater for Houston Black clay than Austin silt clay under drought-year conditions. The variation in drought-year corn yield can be explained by the soil health and its indicators in Texas Blackland soils. Further research is necessary to verify the relationship in differing soil types, management scenarios, and annual rainfall totals.

AB  - Rates of human-induced environmental change continue increasing with human population size, potentially altering animal physiology and negatively affecting wildlife. Researchers often use glucocorticoid concentrations (hormones that can be associated with stressors) to gauge the impact of anthropogenic factors (e.g. urbanization, noise and light pollution). Yet, no general relationships between human-induced environmental change and glucocorticoids have emerged. Given the number of recent studies reporting baseline and stress-induced corticosterone (the primary glucocorticoid in birds and reptiles) concentrations worldwide, it is now possible to conduct large-scale comparative analyses to test for general associations between disturbance and baseline and stress-induced corticosterone across species. Additionally, we can control for factors that may influence context, such as life history stage, environmental conditions and urban adaptability of a species. Here, we take a phylogenetically informed approach and use data from HormoneBase to test if baseline and stress-induced corticosterone are valid indicators of exposure to human footprint index, human population density, anthropogenic noise and artificial light at night in birds and reptiles. Our results showa negative relationship between anthropogenic noise and baseline corticosterone for birds characterized as urban avoiders. While our results potentially indicate that urban avoiders are more sensitive to noise than other species, overall our study suggests that the relationship between human-induced environmental change and corticosterone varies across species and contexts; we found no general relationship between human impacts and baseline and stress-induced corticosterone in birds, nor baseline corticosterone in reptiles. Therefore, it should not be assumed that high or low levels of exposure to human-induced environmental change are associated with high or low corticosterone levels, respectively, or that closely related species, or even individuals, will respond similarly. Moving forward, measuring alternative physiological traits alongside reproductive success, health and survival may provide context to better understand the potential negative effects of human-induced environmental change.

AB  - The Late Devonian was marked by repeated faunal crises and episodes of geographically widespread marine anoxia, and featured one of the 'Big Five' mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic Aeon during the Frasnian-Famennian transition. However, the processes responsible for causing the numerous anoxic events remain unclear. This study highlights the occurrence of disturbances to the phosphorus cycle during several Late Devonian crises by investigating sedimentary concentrations of the element (P-tot) as a tracer of nutrient influx, as well as its ratio with total organic carbon (TOC) to infer the recycling of the element from marine sediments. Increased TOC/P-tot ratios in the Frasnian-Famennian Lower and Upper Kellwasser horizons and upper Famennian Annulata and Hangenberg levels suggest that such nutrient recycling occurred across extensive areas of the marine shelf in Laurentia and both Rheic Ocean margins at those times, helping to sustain reducing conditions in those environments. Elevated P-tot values in the Upper Kellwasser, Annulata, and Hangenberg levels are consistent with an enhanced nutrient influx as the initial trigger for the anoxia. Correlation of phosphorus trends with other geochemical indicators of weathering/detrital influx (osmium-isotope, silicon/aluminum, and titanium/aluminium ratios) support a scenario in which terrestrial runoff provided these nutrients both to marine shelves and the oceanic inventory. Upwelling of oceanic deep-water bodies may have then brought the phosphorus to areas that had not featured major direct inputs of terrigenous material. The exception is the Lower Kellwasser Event, during which there was no increase in phosphorus delivery to marine areas and no evidence for terrestrial influx at the studied sections, invoking a different mechanism for the development of water-column anoxia. Clearly, the Late Devonian marine realm was unusually susceptible to becoming anoxic through various possible triggers, including nutrient influx from land and/or deep-water upwelling, and the recycling of phosphorus from newly deposited sediments.

AB  - The literature shows a great number of soil quality indices (SQ(I)) based on organic matter and its fractions. Our objectives were to determine the changes in soil organic carbon (SOC), carbon fractions and SQ(I) in three production systems based on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The three production systems involved wheat monoculture under conventional tillage and no-tillage (WWCT and WWNT, respectively) and traditional management, wheat under conventional tillage and grazing of natural grasses, alternated one year each (WG(CT)). In turn, each treatment was divided into N-P-fertilized (f) and non-fertilized (nf). We analysed SOC, labile fractions and their ratios (SQ(I)) at 0-5, 5-10 and 10-20 cm soil depths. SOC was significantly higher in WWNT-f than in WWCT-f and WG(CT)-f at 0-5 and 0-20 cm range. Conversely, the lowest concentration was found in WWNT and WWCT in non-fertilized plots. Particulate organic C (POC, 105-2,000 mu m) was significantly affected by tillage at 0-5 cm with the greatest concentrations found in WWNT (mean = 3.2 g kg(-1)) followed by WG(CT) and WWCT (mean = 2.0 g kg(-1)). Soils under CT showed the lowest lability index (LI) values, whereas the conversion to NT increased it (0.74-1.28). Carbon management index (CMI) increased significantly at the 0-20 cm seven years after NT establishment compared to WWCT. SQ(I) such as LI, CMI and SOC/silt+clay were more sensitive for differentiating production systems, whereas C pool index and C/N were more sensitive for differentiating the fertilizer application effect. Considering improvement in SQ(I) and carbon fractions as indicators of better soil quality, adoption of NT improved the soil quality in the semiarid rainfed conditions in the short term.

AB  - Aims We investigated whether biotic homogenization of plant communities occurs over three decades in a small urban protected forest, and what the possible drivers are underlying the observed changes. Location A 96 ha temperate forest, Montreal, Canada. Methods We surveyed vegetation and explanatory variables (ecological conditions, disturbances, spatial structure) in 62 plant communities in 1980 and 2011. We collected plant attributes to identify functional groups (FGs). We evaluated changes in beta diversity using tests for homogeneity of multivariate dispersions. We used space-time interaction models to assess changes in FGs spatial structures. We used multivariate analyses to identify relationship between spatial patterns and explanatory variables, and variation partitioning analyses to identify the drivers involved in beta diversity changes. Results Beta diversity declined only in the herb-shrub communities. About 35% of their FGs had significantly changed their spatial distribution over time. Those that contracted their distribution were mainly composed of plants with wind-dispersed seeds or with low to intermediate vegetative propagation capabilities, while those that expanded were plants with fleshy fruits or extensive vegetative propagation capabilities. In 1980, communities were structured into small isolated clumps, while in 2011, clumps expanded and coalesced near disturbed areas. In 1980, the spatial assembly processes relied essentially on endogenous factors while in 2011 exogenous factors, such as disturbances, became more influential. Multivariate analyses suggested that edge effect, past agricultural disturbances, and beaver activities facilitated the decrease of beta diversity (homogenization process). Conclusions The homogenization of herb-shrub communities likely resulted from changes in their clumped spatial structure. FGs with the most adapted attributes to disperse under urban forest conditions were those that expanded spatially. Structural changes seem to have begun with an unpredictable stage governed by dispersal limitation processes, followed by a predictable stage mostly driven by land-use legacy and disturbances.

AB  - Climate change places considerable stress on riverine ecosystems by altering flow regimes and increasing water temperature. This study evaluated how water temperature increases under climate change scenarios will affect stream invertebrates in pristine headwater streams. The studied headwater-stream sites were distributed within a temperate catchment of Japan and had similar hydraulic-geographical conditions, but were subject to varying temperature conditions due to altitudinal differences (100 to 850 m). We adopted eight general circulation models (GCMs) to project air temperature under conservative (RCP2.6). intermediate (RCP4.5), and extreme climate scenarios (RCP8.5) during the near (2031-2050) and far (2081-2100) future. Using the water temperature of headwater streams computed by a distributed hydrological-thermal model as a predictor variable, we projected the population density of stream invertebrates in the future scenarios based on generalized linear models. The mean decrease in the temporally averaged population density of Plecoptera was 61.3% among the GCMs, even under RCP2.6 in the near future, whereas density deteriorated even further (90.7%) under RCP8.5 in the far future. Trichoptera density was also projected to greatly deteriorate under RCP8.5 in the far future. We defined taxa that exhibited temperature-sensitive declines under climate change as cold stenotherms and found that most Plecoptera taxa were cold stenotherms in comparison to other orders. Specifically, the taxonomic families that only distribute in Palearctic realm (e.g., Megarcys ochracea and Scopura low) were selectively assigned, suggesting that Plecoptera family with its restricted distribution in the Palearctic might be a sensitive indicator of cli mate change. Plecoptera and Trichoptera populations in the headwaters are expected/anticipated to decrease over the considerable geographical range of the catchment, even under the RCP2.6 in the near future. Given headwater invertebrates play important roles in streams, such as contributing to watershed productivity, our results provide useful information for managing streams at the catchment-level.

AB  - The Lower-Middle Miocene Kucukkuyu Formation crops out extensively in the Edremit Gulf area (NW Turkey). In this study, shale samples from this unit were investigated to evaluate source rock characteristics, depositional conditions, and hydrocarbon potential. Outcrop samples of the Kucukkuyu Formation were taken from different locations and analyzed by Rock-Eval pyrolysis, vitrinite reflectance (R-o), stable carbon isotope (delta C-13), total sulfur (TS), gas chromatography (GC), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The total organic carbon (TOC) values range from 0.23 to 6.1 wt.% with an average of 1.76 wt.% for the northern samples and 0.24 to 2.82 wt.% with an average of 1.66 wt.% for the southern samples around the Edremit Gulf. Hydrogen index (HI) values were up to 606 and 712 mg HC/g TOC in the north and south of the gulf, respectively. Organic matter type in the formation consists predominantly of Type II and III kerogen with a minor component of Type I kerogen. Tmax values ranging from 414 to 496 degrees C in the north and 423 to 446 degrees C in the south of the gulf indicate that most samples are at the beginning of the oil generation window and are thermally immature or early-mid-mature. Vitrinite reflectance (R-o) and biomarker maturity parameters support this result. Based on geological observations, biomarker distributions, and TOC/TS ratios, the Kucukkuyu Formation was deposited in a freshwater to slightly brackish water environment under anoxic-suboxic conditions with organic matter input from aquatic organisms and from terrestrial higher plants. According to Rock-Eval pyrolysis data, the Kucukkuyu Formation mostly has medium to good hydrocarbongeneration potential. However, as these potential source rocks are in general immature and/or early-mature, the hydrocarbon potential of the study area is very limited.

AB  - This paper reports the effects of variations in the fuel composition of H-2/CO/CH4 syngas on the characteristics of NOx and CO emissions in a partially-premixed gas turbine combustor. Combustion tests were conducted on a full range of fuel compositions by varying each component gas from 0% to 100% at heat inputs of 40 and 50 kW(th). Flame temperature, combustor liner temperature, ignition delay time, and flame structure were investigated computationally and experimentally to judge whether they are significant indicators of NOx and CO formation. The characteristics of and reasons for NOx and CO emissions were investigated by analyzing the emission mechanisms and relationships among fuel property, equivalence ratio, flame temperature, liner temperature, flame shape. The flame structures were investigated using the following flame visualization methods: (1) time-averaged OH* chemiluminescence and its Abel-deconvolution; (2) direct photography; and (3) instantaneous OH-PLIF. The flame structures were greatly changed by the fuel composition and heat input, and they were subjected to key affecting parameters of the temperatures of the flames and the liners. NOx and CO emissions also largely varied according to fuel composition and heat input, showing neither linearly nor exponentially clear proportional trends toward the syngas compositions because of the singular conditions. For example, only the 100% CO flame at low load emitted lots of CO, whereas complete combustion was observed in other cases. However, the qualitative observations showed that the root causes of NOx emission behaviors were flame temperature and flame structure, which were directly related to the residence time in the flame. Various sets of practical test results were obtained, and these results could contribute to the optimal selection of the fuel-feeding condition when fuel is changed from natural gas to syngas in order to minimize NOx and CO emissions with stable combustion.

AB  - While the upward shift of plant species has been observed on many alpine and nival summits, the reaction of the subalpine and lower alpine plant communities to the current warming and lower snow precipitation has been little investigated so far. To this aim, 63 old, exhaustive plant inventories, distributed along a subalpine-alpine elevation gradient of the Swiss Alps and covering different plant community types (acidic and calcareous grasslands; windy ridges; snow-beds), were revisited after 25-50 years. Old and recent inventories were compared in terms of species diversity with Simpson diversity and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity indices, and in terms of community composition with principal component analysis. Changes in ecological conditions were inferred from the ecological indicator values. The alpha-diversity increased in every plant community, likely because of the arrival of new species. As observed on mountain summits, the new species led to a homogenization of community compositions. The grasslands were quite stable in terms of species composition, whatever the bedrock type. Indeed, the newly arrived species were part of the typical species pool of the colonized community. In contrast, snowbed communities showed pronounced vegetation changes and a clear shift toward dryer conditions and shorter snow cover, evidenced by their colonization by species from surrounding grasslands. Longer growing seasons allow alpine grassland species, which are taller and hence more competitive, to colonize the snowbeds. This study showed that subalpine-alpine plant communities reacted differently to the ongoing climate changes. Lower snow/rain ratio and longer growing seasons seem to have a higher impact than warming, at least on plant communities dependent on long snow cover. Consequently, they are the most vulnerable to climate change and their persistence in the near future is seriously threatened. Subalpine and alpine grasslands are more stable, and, until now, they do not seem to be affected by a warmer climate.

AB  - Land surface phenology (LSP) is directly related to seasonal variations in the condition of vegetated land surfaces and hence is an important indicator for studying the effect of climate change on ecosystems. Satellite data is widely used to monitor LSP over regional to global extents. Currently, there are many algorithms for generating satellite based LSP products. The Committee of Earth Observing System identifies performance assessments of these products as a pressing need. Performance assessment includes both validation in comparison to independent reference data and evaluation by comparison against estimates of noise free phenology indicators. This study proposes a novel methodology for evaluation of satellite based LSP algorithms and applies this methodology to evaluate three well-known LSP algorithms, Savitzky-Golay based filter (SGF), asymmetric Gaussian fitting (AGF) and logistic function fitting (logistic), using 20 years of daily Normalized Difference Vegetation Index composites for Canada and Northern USA. The three LSP methods were evaluated in terms of accuracy for start of season, maximum of season and end of season. Signal to noise ratio (SNR) and the temporal gap frequency (gaps) of the NDVI time series are shown to be proportional to the confidence level for clear sky labeling. The SGF and logistic methods were found to be more sensitive to the SNR than AGF. However, AGF require a minimum proportion of temporal samples for reconstruction. These results highlight the importance of evaluating the trade-off between gap frequency and SNR impacts on LSP methods and indicate that the performance of these methods will depend on both land surface condition and the clear sky identification approach adopted. The developed evaluation approach serves as a basis for assessing the uncertainty in satellite LSP products due to radiometric noise and missing data.

AB  - We have measured iron (Fe) isotope compositions of bulk samples and chemically extracted pyrite in two black shale units: the Oatka Creek Formation (OCF) and the younger Geneseo Formation (GF) deposited in the Appalachian basin during the mid-to-late Devonian. The depositional redox conditions for these units are well established through multiple paleoproxies, including degree of pyritization (DOP) and ratios of total Fe to Al (Fe-T/Al), suggesting that both deposits reflect oxygen-deficient environments, but that euxinia (anoxia with hydrogen sulfide in the bottom waters) was more frequent and persistent during deposition of the OCF. Iron isotopes show systematic variations that are consistent with the inferred water column redox conditions. Samples from the OCF yield low and variable bulk Fe isotope compositions (-0.44 parts per thousand to 0.03 parts per thousand in delta Fe-56 relative to average igneous rocks) that are inversely correlated with Fe-T/Al, whereas bulk delta Fe-56 values (delta Fe-56(T)) of the GF fall in a narrower range (-0.09 parts per thousand to 0.12 parts per thousand). delta Fe-56 values of pyrite (delta Fe-56(Py)) display good correlation with delta Fe-56(T) in the OCF, but no such Correlation is observed in the GF. The Fe isotope data and other paleo-redox indicators, when viewed collectively, point to a benthic Fe source on the shelf and shelf-to-basin transfer that operated during deposition of the OCF, similar to what has been observed in the modern Black Sea. For the first time this study confirms the strength of Fe isotopes in delineating this Fe enrichment mechanism in the ancient geological record and emphasizes the utility of the Fe isotope proxy for fingerprinting and quantifying ancient biogeochemical cycling of Fe.

AB  - Clouds play a significant role in weather forecasts, water cycle, and climate system. However, existing methods ignore the relations of ground-based cloud images. In this letter, we propose a novel method named task-based graph convolutional network (TGCN) for ground-based cloud classification, which takes image relations into consideration. To this end, we construct the graph using convolutional neural network-based features of ground-based cloud images which are learned in a supervised manner, and incorporate the graph computation into TGCN. Given that existing ground-based cloud databases are with limited labeled training images and categorized according to different classification criteria, we release the largest ground-based remote sensing cloud database (GRSCD) to provide a comparative study for different methods and to further improve the study of regional sky conditions. The experimental results on GRSCD manifest the effectiveness of TGCN for ground-based cloud classification.
   Plain Language Summary Clouds are an important indicator of weather conditions. The investigation of ground-based cloud classification is performed using hand-crafted methods or convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Although CNNs have exhibited remarkable performance in ground-based cloud classification, they are limited to fixed data structures, which results in inadequate learning for cloud representations. Specifically, CNNs take ground-based cloud images and their labels as inputs, and therefore they cannot discover the intrinsic data structures without considering the relations among ground-based cloud images. As a kind of natural texture, clouds possess large intraclass and small interclass variances. Furthermore, the effectiveness of deep learning is highly dependent on labeled training samples, which could not be satisfied by the existing public ground-based cloud databases. In this letter, we release the largest ground-based remote sensing cloud database (GRSCD) with 8,000 cloud images and propose the task-based graph convolutional network to explicitly construct the relations among ground-based cloud images so as to mine their inherent structure information. As far as we know, we first apply graph convolutional network to model image relations in the deep network for ground-based cloud classification. Extensive experiments validate that the proposed method can exceed the conventional and CNN-based methods on GRSCD.

AB  - A better understanding of deforestation drivers across countries and spatial scales is a precondition for designing efficient international policies and coherent land use planning strategies such as REDD+. However, it is so far unclear if the well-studied drivers of tropical deforestation behave similarly across nested subnational jurisdictions, which is crucial for efficient policy implementation. We selected three countries in Africa, America and Asia, which present very different tropical contexts. Making use of spatial econometrics and a multi-level approach, we conducted a set of regressions comprising 3,035 administrative units from the three countries at micro-level, plus 361 and 49 at meso- and macro-level, respectively. We included forest cover as dependent variable and seven physio-geographic and socioeconomic indicators of well-known drivers of deforestation as explanatory variables. With this, we could provide a first set of highly significant econometric models of pan tropical deforestation that consider subnational units. We identified recurrent drivers across countries and scales, namely population pressure and the natural condition of land suitability for crop production. The impacts of demography on forest cover were strikingly strong across contexts, suggesting clear limitations of sectoral policy. Our findings also revealed scale and context dependencies, such as an increased heterogeneity at local scopes, with a higher and more diverse number of significant determinants of forest cover. Additionally, we detected stronger spatial interactions at smaller levels, providing empirical evidence that certain deforestation forces occur independently of the existing de jure governance boundaries. We demonstrated that neglecting spatial dependencies in this type of studies can lead to several misinterpretations. We therefore advocate, that the design and enforcement of policy instruments such as REDD+ should start from common international entry points that ensure for coherent agricultural and demographic policies. In order to achieve a longterm impact on the ground, these policies need to have enough flexibility to be modified and adapted to specific national, regional or local conditions.

AB  - We modelled population-level consequences of chronic external gamma irradiation in aquatic invertebrates under laboratory conditions. We used Leslie matrices to combine life-history characteristics (duration of life stages, survival and fecundity rates) and dose rate-response curves for hatching, survival and reproduction fitted on effect data from the FREDERICA database. Changes in net reproductive rate R-0 (offspring per individual) and asymptotic population growth rate lambda (dimensionless) were calculated over a range of dose rates in two marine polychaetes (Neanthes arenaceodentata and Ophryotrocha diadema) and a freshwater gastropod (Physa heterostropha). Sensitivities in R-0 and lambda to changes in life-history traits were analysed in each species. Results showed that fecundity has the strongest influence on R-0. A delay in age at first reproduction is most critical for lambda independent of the species. Fast growing species were proportionally more sensitive to changes in individual endpoints than slow growing species. Reduction of 10% in population lambda were predicted at dose rates of 6918, 5012 and 74,131 mu Gy.h(-1) in N. arenaceodentata, O. diadema and P. heterostropha respectively, resulting from a combination of strong effects on several individual endpoints in each species. These observations made 10%-reduction in lambda a poor criterion for population protection. The lowest significant changes in R-0 and lambda were respectively predicted at a same dose rate of 1412 mu Gy h(-1) in N. arenaceodentata, at 760 and 716 mu Gy h(-1) in O. diadema and at 12,767 and 13,759 mu Gy h(-1) in P. heterostropha. These values resulted from a combination of slight but significant changes in several measured endpoints and were lower than effective dose rates calculated for the individual level in O. diadema and P. heterostropha. The relevance of the experimental dataset (external irradiation rather than contamination, exposure over one generation only, effects on survival and reproduction only) for predicting population responses was discussed.

AB  - Background: Explaining species range size pattern is a central issue in biogeography and macroecology. Although several hypotheses have been proposed, the causes and processes underlying range size patterns are still not clearly understood. In this study, we documented the latitudinal mean range size patterns of terrestrial mammals in China, and evaluated whether that pattern conformed to the predictions of the Rapoport's rule several analytical methods. We also assessed the influence of the mid-domain effect (MDE) and environmental factors on the documented range size gradient.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Distributions of 515 terrestrial mammals and data on nine environmental variables were compiled. We calculated mean range size of the species in each 5 degrees latitudinal band, and created a range size map on a 100 km x 100 km quadrat system. We evaluated Rapoport's rule according to Steven's, mid-point, Pagel's and cross-species methods. The effect of the MDE was tested based on a Monte Carlo simulation and linear regression. We used stepwise generalized linear models and correlation analyses to detect the impacts of mean climate condition, climate variability, ambient energy and topography on range size. The results of the Steven's, Pagel's and cross-species methods supported Rapoport's rule, whereas the mid-point method resulted in a hump-shaped pattern. Our range size map showed that larger mean latitudinal extents emerged in the mid-latitudes. We found that the MDE explained 80.2% of the range size variation, whereas, environmental factors accounted for <30% of that variation.
   Conclusions/Significance: Latitudinal range size pattern of terrestrial mammals in China supported Rapoport's rule, though the extent of that support was strongly influenced by methodology. The critical factor underlying the observed gradient was the MDE, and the effects of climate, energy and topography were limited. The mean climate condition hypothesis, climate variability hypothesis, ambient energy hypotheses and topographical heterogeneity hypotheses were not supported.

AB  - Steam pyrolysis experiments were performed on immature samples from the Irati oil shale, Parana Basin, Brazil, using a maximum temperature of 350 degrees C with up to 98 h exposure time at that temperature. The objectives were to study geochemical and petrographical changes in the source material during stepwise increase in maturity, in steam conditions, comparing the properties of expelled oil with the bitumen retained in the solid residue after experimentation.
   Petrographical and geochemical parameters such as vitrinite reflectance and T-max, indicated an increase in maturity related to the exposure time of the organic matter to the maximum temperature. However, biomarker ratios such as 22S/(22S + 22R) C-31 and C-32 homohopanes, 20S/(20S + 20R) and alpha beta beta/(alpha beta beta + alpha alpha alpha) C-29 sterane, which are considered to be indicators of organic matter maturity levels, did not reach their equilibrium values. Some biomarkers frequently used as indicators of specific sources and/or paleoenvironments of deposition such as hopane/sterane ratio, and the concentrations of C-27 and C-29 steranes showed significant variations related to the stage of maturity. Based on the evaluation of Rock-Eval parameters, the transformation ratios in steam pyrolysis conditions reached levels higher than 80% in samples having 9 and more hours of exposure time to maximum temperature. Bitumen was found to be enriched in components of heavier molecular weight (resins and asphaltenes), whereas the expelled oils contained higher quantities of aliphatic and aromatic components. At relatively low maturity levels the n-alkane distribution of expelled oils indicate a somewhat higher maturity level when compared to the n-alkane distribution of the bitumen retained in the source rock, whereas at higher maturity levels the n-alkane distribution for the expelled oil and for the bitumen is very similar.

AB  - The effect of synergy between sediment organic enrichment and lack of night oxygen renewal in the water column on growth and survival of Zostera marina, and how it is reflected in the sulfur parameters in the plants (delta(34)S, TS and S(0)) was studied experimentally. An experiment consisting of Z. marina mesocosms with different levels of organic enrichment and water column aeration was established, and the effects on sediment conditions, sulfide invasion and growth and survival of Z. marina were examined over a 4 week period. Shoots growing in Ambient Organic matter-sediments showed signs of sulfide invasion, as TS increased in all plant compartments and delta(34)S of the plant tissues decreased during the experiment, but neither growth rate nor survival were significantly affected. The lack of night oxygen renewal had no evident effects in non-enriched sediments as porewater sulfide concentrations, AVS- and CRS-pools were not different from the corresponding 24 h aeration treatment. Plant growth rate and survival were neither different from the corresponding 24 h aeration treatment. On the contrary, shoots growing on High Organic matter-sediments suffered a massive sulfide invasion and it was directly correlated to the observed decrease in growth rates. Even though the lack of night oxygen renewal had no evident effects on sediment variables there were, however, strong indications that the different aeration levels affected plant performance, suggesting a lower sulfide oxidation capacity and confirming that low water column oxygen concentrations reduces the defense capacity of the shoots against sulfide invasion.
   Although delta(34)S, TS and S(0) concentrations together provided a powerful set of indicators to detect the invasion of sulfide in Z marina shoots, this study enlightens the need for a deeper investigation of sulfide intrusion in seagrasses and the relation between plant sulfur parameters and sediment conditions.

AB  - We reviewed the literature to examine the vulnerability to water stress-induced embolism of Pinaceae relative to other conifers and to Study the inter-relationships among the main traits involved in the hydraulic function within the Pinaceae. Results showed that Pinaceae (particularly the genus Pinus) are more vulnerable to xylem embolism, and show less variability in this character, than other conifers. Detailed data from 12 populations of Pinaceae (11 species) from three different areas (Pinol and Sala 2000; Martinez-Vilalta and Pinol 2002; Oliveras et al. 2003) was used to study the relationships among hydraulic properties of stems. These included: leaf-to-wood area ratio (A(L):A(W)), wood- and leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity (K-W and K-L, respectively), vulnerability to xylem embolism (Psi(50PLC)), carbon isotope composition of needles (delta(13)C) and minimum needle water potential (minimum Psi(L)). Results showed that hydraulic properties tended to be more correlated among each other than with indicators of environmental (precipitation to potential evapotranspiration ratio, P/E) or physiological water stress (minimum Psi(L)). The only exception was an increase of delta(13)C with decreasing minimum Psi(L) and P/E. Overall, A(L):A(W) ratio decreased with increasing vulnerability to xylem embolism, and with increasing K-W and K-L (P<0.05). We found a strong positive relationship between carbon isotope composition and the estimated maximum loss of conductivity due to xylem embolism under field conditions, suggesting stronger stomatal control in more vulnerable species with higher levels of native embolism. Overall, results are consistent with a range of drought-avoidance strategies to minimise the gradient of water potential through the xylem, and show that different relationships among traits are possible depending on the scale of study (individual vs. species or populations). The strong interdependence among hydraulic traits implies that no single trait is a sufficient predictor of drought-resistance in Pinaceae. Finally, it is hypothesised that the intrinsically vulnerable xylem of pines may limit their survival under extremely dry conditions.

AB  - Archaea occupy an important niche in the global carbon cycle and their lipids are widely used as indicators of environmental conditions in both paleoenvironmental and modern biogeochemical studies. The principal sources of archaeal lipids in marine sediments are benthic archaea, fossil remnants of planktonic archaea, and allochthonous sources such as soils. However, the relative contributions of these sources to the sedimentary lipid pool have not been comprehensively constrained, complicating a mechanistic understanding of archaeal lipid proxies. In order to provide insights into the relative contributions of these sources and identify signals derived from sedimentary activity, we performed a systematic survey of stable carbon isotopic compositions (delta C-13) of both core and intact archaeal lipids via analyses of their phytanyl (Phy) and biphytanyl (BP) moieties in diverse marine sediments. The sample set consisted of 44 sediment horizons from the Mediterranean and adjacent basins and represented diverse sources of organic matter and depositional conditions. Complementary geochemical data enabled the comparison of lipid distributions and carbon isotopic signatures with prevailing redox conditions. The delta C-13 of tricyclic BP (BPcren) from the core and intact forms of crenarchaeol ranged from -19.1 to -28.6% and -18.1 to -27.4%, respectively. delta C-13 values of core and intact BPcren did not differ, suggesting that intact crenarchaeol is either a fossil relic from planktonic archaea or a product of lipid recycling by benthic archaea, as opposed to being synthesized de novo by sedimentary archaea. delta C-13 values of BP0 derived from core and intact forms of glycerol and butanetriol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs and BGDTs, respectively), but predominantly from caldarchaeol (GDGT-0), ranged from -19.4 to -32.0% and -20.9 to -37.0%, respectively. In contrast to BPcren, intact-lipid derived BP0 was often C-13-depleted relative to its core counterpart, consistent with in situ production by sedimentary archaea. This relative depletion was most pronounced in sulfate reduction zones, likely due to heterotrophic activity. Core and intact archaeol exhibited the largest ranges in delta C-13 values, from -21.6 to -42.1% and -22.7 to -58.9%, respectively. This strong C-13-depletion relative to both total organic carbon and dissolved inorganic carbon is consistent with mixtures of functional sources of sedimentary chemolithoautotrophic, methanotrophic, methanogenic and heterotrophic archaea. Based on the substantial C-13-depletion of BPcren and BP0 in samples in the vicinity of the Rhone River delta relative to a distal marine reference site, we infer that the terrestrial soil contribution of archaeal lipids to these sediments is as high as 43%. Hence, terrestrial input of archaeal lipids, including their intact forms, can be substantial and suggests caution when using existing molecular proxies aimed at constraining riverine input. In summary, our comparative isotopic analysis of sedimentary core versus intact archaeal lipids improves the apportionment of their diverse sources and confidence in distinguishing in situ lipid production by sedimentary archaea.

AB  - Phenological events are good indicators of the effects of climate change, since phenological phases are sensitive to changes in environmental conditions. Although several national phenological networks monitor the phenology of different plant species, direct observations can only be conducted on individual trees, which cannot be easily extended over large and continuous areas. Remote sensing has often been applied to model phenology for large areas, focusing mostly on pure forests in which it is relatively easier to match vegetation indices with ground observations. In mixed forests, phenology modelling from remote sensing is often limited to land surface phenology, which consists of an overall phenology of all tree species present in a pixel. The potential of remote sensing for modelling the phenology of individual tree species in mixed forests remains underexplored. In this study, we applied the seasonal midpoint (SM) method with MODIS GPP to model the start of season (SOS) and the end of season (EOS) of six different tree species in Slovenian mixed forests. First, substitute locations were identified for each combination of observation station and plant species based on similar environmental conditions (aspect, slope, and altitude) and tree species of interest, and used to retrieve the remote sensing information used in the SM method after fitting the best of a Gaussian and two double logistic functions to each year of GPP time series. Then, the best thresholds were identified for SOS and EOS, and the results were validated using cross-validation. The results show clearly that the usual threshold of 0.5 is not best in most cases, especially for estimating the EOS. Despite the difficulty in modelling the phenology of different tree species in a mixed forest using remote sensing, it was possible to estimate SOS and EOS with moderate errors as low as <8 days (Fagus sylvatica and Tilia sp.) and <10 days (Fagus sylvatica and Populus tremula), respectively.

AB  - Large volume of waste rocks is produced during mining activities in Nigeria and these waste rocks are deemed to be resourceful as embankment fills. This paper evaluates the stability of barrier engineering structures build using such waste rocks. To assess this, a total of 18 waste rock samples were collected from evenly designated units of three Nigerian mine sites, namely Enyigba, Itakpe, and Jos mine sites. Each of the samples was subjected to sieve, Atterberg, triaxial, compaction, consolidation, and permeability tests to determine the geotechnical characterizations of the waste rocks as embankment fill materials. The samples were further subjected to X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS) tests to ascertain the heavy metals' concentrations of the samples. Results of these tests were analyzed using GeoStudio geo-environmental software suite to generate the relevant numerical and graphical simulation models. Laboratory data revealed that the waste rocks are competent engineering materials with intermediate shear strength capable of supporting earth structures. This agrees with the simulation results which suggested that factors of safety would, respectively, be above 1.9 and 3.8 at the downstream and upstream reaches of the proposed embankments during normal (steady state) operation. Nevertheless, the factor of safety values could drop to as low as 1.0 at the upstream during transient (drawdown) conditions. The value indicated critical stability that could lead to slope failure and it is less than the minimum limits recommended by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the Canadian Dam Association for an upstream FOS during a reservoir drawdown. Thus, the critical unloading conditions of the embankments are unsafe. Evidences from advection-dispersion analysis revealed that 22-31,120% of contaminants from polluted impounded ponds may exit through the embankments in the first decade of the dams' operation. These anticipated environmental impacts underscore the need for stabilization of the proposed structures to improve both stability and barrier efficiency.

AB  - Japanese horseradish (wasabi) grows in very specific conditions, and recent environmental climate changes have damaged wasabi production. In addition, the optimal culture methods are not well known, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for incipient farmers to cultivate it. Chlorophyll a, b and carotenoid contents, as well as their allocation, could be an adequate indicator in evaluating its production and environmental stress; thus, developing an in situ method to monitor photosynthetic pigments based on reflectance could be useful for agricultural management. Besides original reflectance (OR), five pre-processing techniques, namely, first derivative reflectance (FDR), continuum-removed (CR), de-trending (DT), multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), and standard normal variate transformation (SNV), were compared to assess the accuracy of the estimation. Furthermore, five machine learning algorithms-random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM), Cubist, and Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB)-were considered. To classify the samples under different pH or sulphur ion concentration conditions, the end of the red edge bands was effective for OR, FDR, DT, MSC, and SNV, while a green-peak band was effective for CR. Overall, KELM and Cubist showed high performance and incorporating pre-processing techniques was effective for obtaining estimated values with high accuracy. The best combinations were found to be DT-KELM for chl a (RPD = 1.511-5.17, RMSE = 1.23-3.62 mu g cm(-2)) and chl a:b (RPD = 0.73-3.17, RMSE = 0.13-0.60); CR-KELM for chl b (RPD = 1.92-5.06, RMSE = 0.41-1.03 mu g cm(-2)) and chl a:car (RPD = 1.31-3.23, RMSE = 0.26-0.50); SNV-Cubist for car (RPD = 1.63-3.32, RMSE = 0.31-1.89 mu g cm(-2)); and DT-Cubist for chl:car (RPD = 1.53-3.96, RMSE = 0.27-0.74).

KW  - ENTOMOPATHOGENIC FUNGUS
KW  - CULEX-QUINQUEFASCIATUS
AB  - Background
   The fungal toxin acts as effective, low-cost chemical substances for pest control worldwide and also an alternative to synthetic insecticides. This study assessed the larvicidal potential of Metarhizium anisopliae fungi derived metabolites against Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi, Culex quinquefasciatus and non-targeted organisms at 24hr post treatment.
   Method
   Isolation of entomopathogenic fungi M. anisopliae from natural traps confirmed by using 18s rDNA biotechnological tools. Crude extracts from M. anisopliae solvent extraction and their secondary metabolites were bio-assayed following WHO standard procedures against Ae. aegypti, An. stephensi and Cx. quinquefasciatus, Artemia nauplii, Eudrilus eugeniae, and Solanum lycopersicum after 24 hr exposure. Histopathological analysis of E. eugeniae treated with fungi metabolites toxicity compared to those treated with Monocrotophos after 24hrpost-treatment. M. anisopliae metabolites were characterized using GC-MS and FT-IR analysis.
   Results
   The larvicidal activity was recorded in highest concentration of 75 mu g/ml, with 85%, 97% and 89% mortality in Ae. aegypti, An. stephensi and Cx. quinquefasciatus respectively. M. anisopliae metabolites produced LC50 values in Ae. aegypti, 59.83 mu g/ml, in An. stephensi, 50.16 mu g/ml and in Cx. quinquefasciatus, 51.15 mu g/ml respectively. M. anisopliae metabolites produced lower toxic effects on A. nauplii, LC50 values were, 54.96 mu g/ml respectively. Bioindicator toxicity results show 18% and 58% mortality was recorded in E. eugeniae and A. nauplii and also there is no phytotoxicity that was observed on S. lycopersicum L. under semi-field condition. E. eugeniae histopathological studies shows fungal metabolites showed lower sub-lethal effects compared to synthetic chemical pesticide at 24hrs of the treatment. The GC-MS and FT-IR analysis identified five major components of active ingredients.
   Conclusion
   Findings of this study indicate that, M. anisopliae ethyl acetate derived secondary metabolites are effective against larvae of Ae. aegypti, An. stephensi and Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquito species, lower toxicity effects were observed on non-target organisms such as, Artemia nauplii, Eudrilus eugeniae as well as, no toxicity effect were observed on Solanum lycopersicum. Further research should be conducted in laboratory for separation of single pure molecule and be tested semifield conditions.

AB  - Recent environmental archeological evidence has started to throw light on both the timing and processes of human colonization of the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Yarlung Tsangpo (YT) valley, a very important region of the southern TP for occupation, is home to not only modern Tibetans but also their ancestors. However, a lack of suitable sedimentary strata has limited the establishment of a secure chronology. Here, we report on a new stratigraphic section with prehistoric pottery and cultural layers that was discovered on a terrace of the YT at Liena, in Nyingchi County. The cultural layers are overlain by, and bedded within, eolian and lacustrine sediments. We used the quartz Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) method to date 11 samples and performed geochemical analysis on 100 samples to derive paleoenvironmental indicators. The OSL analysis gave an age of 4.3 ka BP for the cultural layer, which makes it the earliest human activity in the YT valley of Nyingchi to date. In addition, commencement of eolian deposition was dated to at least 8.3 ka, coinciding with the Holocene warm period. We discuss possible causal factors for human occupation in the valley and show that climatic changes played a crucial role in prehistoric human migration c. 8.3-4.3 ka BP. Before the early Holocene, most of the river terraces in the valley were being actively reworked by rivers or covered by lakes. So there were no suitable places for occupation by ancient populations. With the recession of dammed lakes during the Holocene warm period, the relatively flat and wide valley terraces, blanketed with rich eolian deposits (such as sandy loess), provided an attractive place for ancient people engaged in nomadic and even agricultural activities. Hence, the climate conditions of the Holocene warm period drove the environmental changes that provided favorable conditions for ancient human activities.

AB  - Crop water productivity modeling becomes a valuable tool in developing deficit irrigation strategies and optimizing agricultural water use for economical and sustainable production in arid and semi-arid regions. The objective of the current study was to test and validate the FAO-developed AquaCrop model for sugar beet under different combinations of on-farm water management practices using 2years average measured data sets collected during the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 cropping seasons. The model was first calibrated using the data set of nine full irrigation treatments and then validated for twenty-seven deficit irrigation treatments, respectively. The model performance was evaluated using different statistical indicators, e.g., coefficient of determination (R-2), normalized root-mean-square error, degree of agreement (d(index)) and the mean bias error. The results revealed that AquaCrop was able to simulate sugar beet canopy cover fairly for all treatments. The model performance was also excellent for simulating sugar beet root yield and biomass under all no-stress and mild-stress treatments. However, the model showed poor results when moderate water stress was applied without mulching or sever stresses were applied irrespective of the mulching conditions. The results further revealed that the model overestimated the water productivity for all treatments. The AquaCrop model can thus be satisfactorily used for evaluating the effectiveness of proposed irrigation management strategies for sugar beet, however, the limitations should be kept in mind when interpreting the results in severely stressed conditions. Moreover, on the basis of the obtained results, it is strongly recommended that the sugar beet growers should raise their crop on medium raised bed covered with black film or straw mulch and should apply 20-40% deficit irrigation instead of full irrigation as this will be the most advantageous treatment in terms of improved yield and increased water productivity.

AB  - The performance of no-till (NT) in temperate regions may be enhanced through the integration of additional conservation practices such as cover cropping and crop rotations. This study assessed the long-term impacts of continuous (20 + years) NT in comparison to plow-till (PT) management on soil properties and corn (Zea mays L.) yields in New York. The effects of tillage were assessed in combination with different cropping systems (24 years corn monoculture vs. 12 years corn monoculture; and with or without interseeded cover crops) on three soil textures: clay loam, loamy sand and silt loam. We measured four soil biological indicators - organic matter (OM), active carbon (ActC), respiration (Resp) and protein (Prot); four soil physical indicators - available water capacity (AWC), water stable aggregation (WSA), penetration resistance (PR) and water infiltration rate (InfRate); soil chemical indicators (plant available nutrients, pH and total N), and corn yield. Soil managed under long-term NT showed the most favorable soil biological, physical and chemical conditions for plant development, with higher levels of OM, Prot, Resp, WAS, total N, P and Zn, and InfRate. Benefits of introducing a grass-legume cover crop mixture into the cropping system were evident after 4 years for OM, Prot, Resp, AWC, Fe and Zn. Cover crop effects were greater under NT than PT, and additive to the NT benefits. On the clay loam soil, the effects of a 6-year interruption of continuous corn production with a perennial grass crop were still discernable with several soil health indicators 12 years after resuming corn production under NT. The better soil conditions under NT resulted in higher corn yields in both the loamy sand and silt loam soils, but not the clay loam. Our study shows that long-term NT can be viable in temperate regions, promoting significant improvement in soil health and crop yield and that these benefits are enhanced when NT is combined with crop rotation (perennial grass) and cover crops.

AB  - This review is based on 59 papers published between 2002 and 2015, referring to about 450 treatment trains providing data regarding sludge concentrations for 169 compounds, specifically 152 pharmaceuticals and 17 personal care products, grouped into 28 different classes. The rationale of the study is to provide data to evaluate the environmental risk posed by the spreading of treated sludge in agriculture. Following discussion of the legislative scenario governing the final disposal of treated sludge in European countries and the USA, the study provides a snapshot of the occurrence of selected compounds in primary, secondary, mixed, digested, conditioned, composted and dried sludge originating in municipal wastewater treatment plants fed mainly with urban wastewater as well as in sludge-amended soil. Not only are measured values reported, but also predicted concentrations based on K-d values are reported. It emerges that in secondary sludge, the highest concentrations were found for fragrances, antiseptics and antibiotics and an attenuation in their concentrations occurs during treatment, in particular anaerobic digestion and composting. An in-depth literature survey of the (measured and predicted) K-d values for the different compounds and treated sludge are reported and an analysis of the influence of pH, redox conditions, sludge type was carried out The data regarding measured and predicted concentrations of selected compounds in sludge-amended soil is then analyzed. Finally an environmental risk assessment posed by their occurrence in soil in the case of land application of sludge is examined, and the results obtained by different authors are compared. The most critical compounds found in the sludge-amended soil are estradiol, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, tetracycline, caffeine, triclosan and triclocarban. The study concludes with a focus on the main issues that should be further investigated in order to refine the environmental risk assessment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Assessing the health of rangeland ecosystems based solely on annual biomass production does not fully describe the condition of the plant community; the phenology of production can provide inferences about species composition, successional stage, and grazing impacts. We evaluated the productivity and phenology of western South Dakota mixed-grass prairie in the period from 2000 to 2008 using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The NDVI is based on 250-m spatial resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery. Growing-season NDVI images were integrated weekly to produce time-integrated NDVI (TIN), a proxy of total annual biomass production, and integrated seasonally to represent annual production by cool- and warm-season species (C-3 and C-4, respectively). Additionally, a variety of phenological indicators including cool-season percentage of TIN were derived from the seasonal profiles of NDVI. Cool-season percentage and TIN were combined to generate vegetation classes, which served as proxies of the conditions of plant communities. TIN decreased with precipitation from east to west across the study area. However, the cool-season percentage increased from east to west, following patterns related to the reliability (interannual coefficient of variation [CV]) and quantity of midsummer precipitation. Cool-season TIN averaged 76.8% of the total TIN. Seasonal accumulation of TIN corresponded closely (R-2>0.90) to that of gross photosynthesis data from a carbon flux tower. Field-collected biomass and community composition data were strongly related to TIN and cool-season percentage. The patterns of vegetation classes were responsive to topographic, edaphic, and land management influences on plant communities. Accurate maps of biomass production, cool- and warm-season composition, and vegetation classes can improve the efficiency of land management by facilitating the adjustment of stocking rates and season of use to maximize rangeland productivity and achieve conservation objectives. Further, our results clarify the spatial and temporal dynamics of phenology and TIN in mixed-grass prairie.

AB  - This study presents an analysis of phytosociological releves together with data on phytogeographical elements, life forms and Ellenberg's indicator values in the alpine flora of the Western Carpathians. We examined the frequency of arctic-alpine taxa in individual vegetation types and their distribution within the Western Carpathians, as well as the comparison to the distribution of Carpathian and West-Carpathian endemics. The combination of arctic-alpine and endemic Carpathian and West-Carpathian elements leads to new insights of spatial patterns and chorological aspects in vegetation. The data sets of 5,030 phytosociological releves containing at least one arctic-alpine taxon, and of 3,510 releves from 14 alliances in which at least 25% of the total number of releves contained at least two arctic-alpine taxa, were used for individual analyses: the main gradients in floristic composition were analysed by Detrended Correspondence Analysis; the frequency of arctic-alpine species was used as an attribute data in DCA Attribute Data Analysis; the multiple comparisons were performed and the box and whisker plots were constructed. We confirmed the hypothesis that more arctic-alpine taxa occur in plant communities of the Carici rupestris-Kobresietea as compared to other vegetation types in the Western Carpathians and to other phytogeographical elements in the West Carpathian flora. In addition, the occurrence of arctic-alpine species was significantly correlated not only with the European high-mountain element, but also with the occurrence of the Carpathian and/or West Carpathian endemic taxa. One possible explanation relates to the theory of an island phenomenon in the highest mountains. The diverse conditions of the mountains gave rise to the formation of refuges for relic taxa, and in addition, depending on the plasticity of individual taxa, the same habitats also provided suitable conditions for speciation and hence became centres of endemism.

AB  - Aim Pollen ratios are widely used to gain palaeovegetation and palaeoclimatic information from fossil pollen spectra, although their applicability has seldom been tested with modern pollen data. I used a data set of 113 lake-surface sediments from the eastern Tibetan Plateau to test the reliability of several pollen ratios.
   Location The lake-surface pollen spectra cover a wide range of vegetation types (temperate desert, temperate steppe, alpine desert, alpine steppe, high-alpine meadow, sub-alpine shrub, coniferous and mixed forest) and climatic conditions (mean July temperature, T-July: 4.0-17.4 degrees C; mean annual precipitation, P-ann: 104-670 mm).
   Methods Lake-surface sediments were analysed palynologically, and several pollen ratios were calculated. These ratios were interpreted with respect to vegetation and climatic conditions.
   Results The arboreal pollen sum (AP) was highest in samples from forested areas and was significantly correlated with P-ann (r(2) = 0.44). In non-forested areas, samples from large lakes and from lakes surrounded by sparse vegetation had increased AP values, suggesting that AP is a useful vegetation density indicator. Artemisia/Chenopodiaceae (A/C) ratios were lowest in desert areas and were positively correlated with P-ann (r(2) = 0.25). The aridity pollen index was inappropriate for inferring (palaeo-) climatic information from samples on the eastern Tibetan Plateau as it had no significant correlation with the environmental factors. Artemisia/Cyperaceae (A/Cy) ratios had a significant correlation with T-July (r(2) = 0.23), but only a weak correlation with P-ann, which indicates that the A/Cy ratio is applicable as a temperature indicator. Furthermore, it is a valuable tool for the differentiation of high-alpine meadow from steppe vegetation.
   Main conclusions AP sum, A/C ratio and A/Cy ratio are useful tools for qualitative and semi-quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstruction on the Tibetan Plateau; however, the results obtained should not be interpreted quantitatively.

AB  - The paleo-evolution of the Black Sea level during the Lateglacial-Holocene transition is still unclear, which motivates us to provide new estimates for that period based on the analysis of water budget. Hydrological conditions in the Black Sea catchment area are reconstructed here using water balance equation, available data, and constraints based on simple theory relating the runoff ratio with climatic characteristics. In order to estimate the impact of the aridity of climate we consider two alternative scenarios: (1) climate change under constant in time gradient in precipitation and evaporation over land and sea, and (2) climate change accounting for changes in the horizontal distribution of precipitation and evaporation. Hydrological data are compiled from available present-day data and paleo-observations. A number of sensitivity experiments is carried out revealing that the hydrological conditions in the Black Sea watershed should have evolved towards a very arid climate (similar to the present-day climate in the Caspian Sea area) in order to initiate a drop of sea level of similar to 100 m below the sill depth of the Bosporus Straits, as speculated in some recent research. Estimates of sea level changes reveal a qualitative agreement with the coast-line evolution inferred from paleo-observations. The Younger Dryas draw down of the Black Sea starts at about 13.3 to 13 kyr BP, with a maximum low-stand of 104 m at 11.5 kyr BP. In an arid climate scenario the sea level reaches the outlet at about 8.8 to 7.4 kyr BP. Approximately at that time, Mediterranean sea level was about 10 m higher, making flooding events of the Black Sea possible. However, the nature and exact timing of the Holocene reconnection depends also on other (not well known) factors; one of them is the Bosporus sill depth, motivating further research in this field. Estimates of the water transport through the Bosporus Straits are also provided for the time of Lateglacial-Holocene transition.

AB  - Besides being a potent chemical carcinogen, benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) has also been shown to suppress the immune response of mammals. However, even though BaP is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant to which aquatic species may be directly exposed, information regarding the effects of BaP on the immune system of fish is still lacking. Therefore, laboratory studies were conducted using Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) to examine the effects of BaP on host immune status. A single IP injection of BaP at 2, 20 or 200 mug/g BW had no effect upon medaka survival or condition factors for up to 7 days post-injection. Forty-eight hours after injection of either BaP or the vehicle control, fish were sacrificed and the appropriate organs/cells used to assess effects upon: splenic lymphocyte proliferation-, kidney phagocyte intracellular superoxide ((.)0(2)(-)) production, and, CYPIA protein level/activity. In separate experiments, fish were injected with either sheep red blood cells or the bacterial pathogen Yersinia ruckeri at 48 h post-BaP exposure for later determination of antibody-forming cell (AFC) numbers and bacterial host resistance, respectively. Results demonstrated that in the absence of effects upon host survival or condition factors, a single exposure to a relatively low dose of BaP (2 mug/g BW) significantly suppressed mitogen-stimulated T- and B-lymphocyte proliferation (in the absence of elevated hepatic CYPIA expression/activity). At higher concentrations, BaP also reduced AFC numbers, phagocyte-mediated O-.(2)- production, and host resistance against bacterial infection. These results clearly demonstrate the ability of BaP to compromise the immune response of fish and indicate the utility of the fish immune response to serve as an early indicator of BaP exposure/effects in exposed feral populations.

AB  - beta-Cyclodextrin derivatives, MRCD and p-MRCD, which have a 4-(dimethylamino)azobenzene moiety with a carbonyl substituent at 2' and 4' positions, respectively, have been prepared as color change indicators for detecting organic compounds, In a 10% ethylene glycol solution, MRCD and p-MRCD form intramolecular self-complexes in which the pendant dye moiety is included in the cyclodextrin cavity with an orientation parallel and perpendicular to the cyclodextrin axisis, respectively, When guest molecules are added to the acidic solutions of MRCD (pH 1.60) and p-MRCD (pH 2.40), they exhibit color changes from yellow to red for MRCD and from orange to red for p-MRCD. These color changes, which arise from the structural change of the dye moieties from the azo form to the azonium one, are caused when MRCD and p-MRCD undergo a conformational change in which the dye moieties inserted in the cyclodextrin cavities are excluded to outside of the cavities upon guest accommodation. The extent of the guest-induced color changes of MRCD and p-MRCD depend on the shape, size, number, and position of the functional group of guest molecules. Selectivities between MRCD and p-MRCD in guest detection are roughly parallel and reflected in the host-guest binding constants. Among guest molecules examined, ursodeoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid were detected by MRCD and p-MRCD with high sensitivities. 1-Adamanetanecarboxylic acid and (-)borneol were also detected with high sensitivities. In neutral conditions, however, the selectivity in guest detection of p-MRCD is different from that in acidic conditions as shown by the fact that, for example, 1-adamantanol and 2-adamantanol were detected by p-MRCD with larger sensitivities than 1-adamanetanecarboxylic acid. The result indicates that the ionic nature of the guest molecules is an important factor for detection of the guest molecules. All these results demonstrate that MRCD and p-MRCD can be used as color change indicators for detecting various organic compounds in aqueous solution.

AB  - The work on this thesis began in 2003 when the global HIV epidemic was out of control. A minority of persons with HIV were benefitting fully from the recently introduced highly efficacious antiretroviral therapy (ART) combinations. Among the global challenges were lack of access to good health care, drug toxicity, and emergence of drug-resistant virus. It was unknown how long the drugs could maintain their efficacy in the individual even if administered as intended, and there was a fear that the increased drug pressure would increase the prevalence of drug resistance, subsequently leading to transmission of resistant virus from one individual to another, and thereby waning the treatment options available. Hence, we were far from the ideal conditions where an HIV-infected individual gets to know immediately that he/she is infected, has access to specialized medical and social support, receives a drug combination which effectively suppresses the virus and has no side effects, and is free of comorbid conditions both before and after he/she gets infected. The nine papers on which this thesis is based each aimed to provide new knowledge to aspects of the above.
   Late diagnosis and late presentation to clinical care continue to be major barriers to improved HIV management. We used nationwide hospital registries to explore the potential for an indicator disease-based HIV testing strategy. A range of conditions that were manifestations of the HIV infection itself were found to be associated with highly increased risk of HIV diagnosis during the coming year, but less so 3 to 5 years later. Other conditions were associated with an almost constant 5-year long increased risk of being diagnosed with HIV because they share behavioural risk factors with HIV, making them indicators of not only current HIV but also of future HIV acquisition. Hence, indicator condition-based testing should be adapted to the local epidemic and could be a valuable addition to the existing detection practice.
   Once diagnosed, getting the full benefit of modern HIV care requires access to a good health care system. We compared temporal trends in quality and quantity of ART introduction in Denmark and Greenland. Despite similar levels of health worker education and economic resources, ART implementation and mortality decline in Greenland lacked several years behind Denmark. The study reminded us that although economy may be a prerequisite for implementing an effective HIV care system, it is certainly not all it takes.
   The nationwide nature of the Danish HIV Cohort Study also allowed us to study a number of time trends at the population level. Despite what was feared, we found that the prevalence of triple-drug class virological failure (TCF) seemed to have stabilized after 2000; that the incidence rates of drug resistance acquisition were decreasing during 1999-2005; and that the prevalence of potential transmitters of drug-resistant HIV decreased during 1997-2004. We also looked at some of the consequences of virological failure and drug resistance and found that even modest levels of viraemia were associated with a high risk of future failure and death, and that in persons who have experienced TCF, the number and pattern of resistance mutations were independent predictors of death. Hence, despite the overall positive trends in virological failure and drug-resistance development at the population level, our findings underline the crucial importance of always having an effective treatment option available for the individual patient with drug-resistant virus.
   As mortality was declining for persons with access to ART and good HIV care, it became important to know how long persons with HIV could expect to live compared to the general population. We projected long-term survival and found that a 25-year old person with HIV and without hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection had a 50 percent chance of surviving another 39 years, only 12.2 years less than a person in a matched general population cohort would survive.
   With improved survival and declining HIV-related comorbidity, non-HIV related comorbidity became a more visible contributor to the health status of persons with HIV. We assessed the impact of non-HIV related comorbidity acquired before the person became infected with HIV. We found that 32% of the observed mortality in our cohort was due to HCV and comorbidities measured by the Charlson Comorbidity Index, 13% corresponded to the background mortality in the population, and that only 55% of the mortality could be attributed to HIV. Our findings confirmed that persons acquiring HIV differ at large from the general population, and that we should not expect overall mortality rates in populations with HIV to reach the levels in the general population.
   This thesis attempted to map some of the many challenges on the road towards increased survival of individuals and populations with HIV up to a level, which today in many settings is close to that of the general population. The studies in this thesis have each paid their modest contribution to show how crucially important it is to be diagnosed in time, to have access to a well-functioning health system, and to keep free of comorbidity both before and after acquiring HIV. After many years of struggle and despair, and thanks to enormous advances in prevention and treatment, we are now looking towards a promising future.

AB  - In the course of human industrial activity, atmospheric air is polluted by gaseous pollutants, among which sulfur compounds, and sulfur dioxide (SO2) in particular, play a key role. Vegetation is a universal filter that is capable, in conjunction with certain technical facilities, of protecting the environment from pollution by the ingredients of industrial emissions. The purpose of this work is to determine the level of accumulation of sulfur and glutathione in the leaves of woody plants growing in the areas of sanitary protection zones of enterprises of the city of Zaporizhzhya in order to develop recommendations for the creation of an effective biofilter. The objects of the study were the woody plant species growing in the area of protective plantations of a number of enterprises in Zaporizhzhya: RE Zaporizhzhya Titanium & Magnesium Combine, Zaporizhzhya Aluminium Plant PJSC, Zaporizhzhya Abrasive Plant PJSC, Zaporizhstal PJSC, Zaporizhzhya Ferroalloy Plant PJSC, Zaporizhvohnetryv PJSC, PrJSC "Ukrgratit" and Zaporizhtransformator PJSC. The control area was a forest belt located 12 km away from the source of pollution. At each site 5 model trees of a given age category of each species were selected. The leaves needed in order to determine the sulfur content were taken from the south-eastern side of the crown at a distance of 2 m above the soil surface under the same lighting conditions. We have established that the accumulation of sulfur in leaves of woody plants which grow under the conditions of outdoor air pollution by sulfur dioxide (SO2) occurs during the entire vegetation period, with the young leaves that have just finished growing being the most affected. The maximum amount of sulfur is observed at the end of the growing season. The greater concentration of sulfur in the leaves of woody plants in the areas of sanitary protection zones of industrial enterprises is linked to the higher level of gaseous pollutant emissions in the atmosphere of a given enterprise, but the degree of increase in the content of the pollutant in the leaves of plants of various protective plantations is not proportional to the quantitative indicators of the level of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the air. Woody plant species were divided into three groups according to the amount of sulfur accumulated in their leaves: I - the maximum level - Betula pendula, Tilia cordata, Salix alba, Robinia pseudoacacia, Populus alba, P. simonii, P. nigra, II - medium - Acer platanoides, A. negundo, Fraxinus lanceolata, Catalpa bignonioides, III - the smallest -Morns alba, Ailanthus altissima, Elaeagnus angustifolia and Ulmus carpinifolia. The increase in sulfur content in the leaves of woody plants growing in the area of sanitary protection zones is consistent with the increase in glutathione content compared to our control parameters, which is not only of high physiological significance, but its formation can also be one of the ways of metabolizing this element. The obtained results can be used for the development of recommendations with the purpose of selecting the assortment of woody plants for the reconstruction of green plantations growing in the area of sanitary protection zones of enterprises. In a subsequent study, the accumulation of gaseous pollutants such as chlorine and phenol in the leaves of woody plants growing in and around protective forest belts will be examined.

AB  - Sediment cores from Lone Spruce Pond (60.007 degrees N, 159.143 degrees W), southwestern Alaska, record paleoenvironmental changes during the global Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and during the last 14,500 calendar years BP (14.5 cal ka). We analyzed the abundance of organic matter, biogenic silica, carbon, and nitrogen, and the isotope ratios of C and N, magnetic susceptibility, and grain-size distribution of bulk sediment, abundance of alder shrub (Alnus) pollen, and midge (Chironomidae and Chaoboridae) assemblages in a 4.7-m-long sediment sequence from the depocenter at 22 m water depth. The basal unit contains macrofossils dating to 25-21 cal ka (the global LGM), and is interpreted as glacial-lacustrine sediment. The open water requires that the outlet of the Ahklun Mountain ice cap had retreated to within 6 km of the range crest. In addition to cladocerans and diatoms, the glacial-lacustrine mud contains chironomids consistent with deep, oligotrophic conditions; several taxa associated with relatively warm conditions are present, suggestive of relative warmth during the global LGM. The glacial-lacustrine unit is separated from the overlying non-glacial lake sediment by a possible disconformity, which might record a readvance of glacier ice. Non-glacial sediment began accumulating around 14.5 cal ka, with high flux of mineral matter and fluctuating physical and biological properties through the global deglacial period, including a reversal in biogenic-silica (BSi) content during the Younger Dryas (YD). During the global deglacial interval, the delta C-13 values of lake sediment were higher relative to other periods, consistent with low C:N ratios (8), and suggesting a dominant atmospheric CO2 source of C for phytoplankton. Concentrations of aquatic faunal remains (chironomids and Cladocera) were low throughout the deglacial interval, diversity was low and warm-indicator taxa were absent. Higher production and air temperatures are inferred following the YD, when bulk organic-matter (OM) content (LOI 550 A degrees C) increased substantially and permanently, from 10 to 30 %, a trend paralleled by an increase in C and N abundance, an increase in C:N ratio (to about 12), and a decrease in delta C-13 of sediment. Post-YD warming is marked by a rapid shift in the midge assemblage. Between 8.9 and 8.5 cal ka, Alnus pollen tripled (25-75 %), followed by the near-tripling of BSi (7-19 %) by 8.2 cal ka, and delta N-15 began a steady rise, reflecting the buildup of N and an increase in denitrification in soils. Several chironomid taxa indicative of relatively warm conditions were present throughout the Holocene. Quantitative chironomid-based temperature inferences are complicated by the expansion of Alnus and resulting changes in lake nutrient status and production; these changes were associated with an abrupt increase in cladoceran abundance and persistent shift in the chironomid assemblage. During the last 2,000 years, chironomid-assemblage changes suggest cooler temperatures, and BSi and OM values were generally lower than their maximum Holocene values, with minima during the seventh and eighth centuries, and again during the eighteenth century.

AB  - Statistics show negative forecasts of the demographic indicators of the Russian population including their size and health. The human habitat which has been deteriorating in recent decades causes cardinal changes in the assortment and variety of food and significantly contributes to the reduction of their biological value. The depletion of food products (FP) of vegetable and animal origin in vital mineral elements, vitamins and other physiologically active components represents a serious long-term threat to human health and the national security. Industrial methods of enriching FP have certain limitations: a narrow set of micronutrients, their interaction among themselves and accessibility for not all groups of the population. One way to reduce the negative consequences is through the introduction and breeding of new for Russia species and varieties of agricultural plants and organize a mass production of functional foods (FF) that contribute to the prevention and/or suspension of the development of dangerous diseases and slowing down the aging process. The so-lution of this multifaceted problem lies in changing the consumption structure of foods and their chemical composition conditioned by both the assortment of grown plant species and cultivars of food plants, as well as the composition and quality of soils, fertilizers and the conditions for crop cultivation. Taking into account the prevailing demographic situation in the Russian Federation, it is necessary to create a comprehensive national program for the allocation of new high-content sources of FF ingredients based on traditional and underutilized crops, cultivars and forms of cereal, vegetable and fruit crops and their inclusion in agricultural production as well as existing and newly created technological processes in food industry. The advantages of creating and developing a national system of the functional food in Russia will be: the improvement of public health and life expectancy, the reduction of the Federal Compulsory Medical Insurance Fund expenditures and the development of business structures involved in the production of the FF.

AB  - In dry and warm environments sub-cloud evaporation influences the falling raindrops modifying their final stable isotopic content. During their descent from the cloud base towards the ground surface, through the unsaturated atmosphere, hydrometeors are subjected to evaporation whereas the kinetic fractionation results to less depleted or enriched isotopic signatures compared to the initial isotopic composition of the raindrops at cloud base. Nowadays the development of Generalized Climate Models (GCMs) that include isotopic content calculation modules are of great interest for the isotopic tracing of the global hydrological cycle. Therefore the accurate description of the underlying processes affecting stable isotopic content can improve the performance of iso-GCMs. The aim of this study is to model the sub-cloud evaporation effect using a) mixing and b) numerical isotope evaporation models. The isotope-mixing evaporation model simulates the isotopic enrichment (difference between the ground and the cloud base isotopic composition of raindrops) in terms of raindrop size, ambient temperature and relative humidity (RH) at ground level. The isotopic enrichment (Delta delta) varies linearly with the evaporated raindrops mass fraction of the raindrop resulting to higher values at drier atmospheres and for smaller raindrops. The relationship between Delta delta and RH is described by a 'heat capacity' model providing high correlation coefficients for both isotopes (R-2 > 80%) indicating that RH is an ideal indicator of the sub-cloud evaporation effect. Vertical distribution of stable isotopes in falling raindrops is also investigated using a numerical isotope-evaporation model. Temperature and humidity dependence of the vertical isotopic variation is clearly described by the numerical isotopic model showing an increase in the isotopic values with increasing temperature and decreasing RH. At an almost saturated atmosphere (RH=95%) sub-cloud evaporation is negligible and the isotopic composition hardly changes even at high temperatures while at drier and warm conditions the enrichment of O-18 reaches up to 20 parts per thousand, depending on the raindrop size and the initial meteorological conditions.

AB  - North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis aggregate in Roseway Basin on the western Scotian Shelf where their energy-rich food sources, diapausing copepods Calanus spp., are concentrated at depth. The Canadian Species at Risk Recovery Strategy for right whales provides provisional Critical Habitat (CH) boundaries for Roseway Basin based on right whale occupancy, with the stipulation that the boundaries be refined using spatially explicit indicators of CH, specifically the environmental, oceanographic, and bathymetric conditions responsible for the copepod aggregations and distribution. We measured the concentration, energy density, spatial distribution, and extent of the right whale food base and the related oceanography at depth in the Basin during late-summer 2008 with the goal of refining the spatial extent of right whale CH. We show that the diapausing copepods were distributed throughout the Basin, with elevated concentrations located at depth toward the northeast and along the southern Basin margin slope. The aggregations were associated with warm, salty, high-density (26.0 to 26.2 sigma(t), kg m(-3)), continental slope-influenced water masses and not with cold, fresh, low-density (< 26.0 sigma(t)) water masses originating on the Scotian Shelf. Tidally driven variation in the copepod aggregations across the southern slope was coincident with the movement of the 26.0 sigma(t) isopycnal. We propose a mechanism, based on water mass density and advection, that explains the spatial and temporal (e.g. inter-annual) variation in diapausing Calanus energy density (joules per unit ocean volume) distribution, and by proxy, variation in right whale occupancy of the Basin. We further propose that the provisional CH boundaries, partly conditioned on vessel-strike mitigation measures, be extended to better encompass the critical feeding habitat. This could be achieved without compromise regarding vessel traffic and existing vessel-strike mitigation.

AB  - Background: Most previous studies on reliance on social benefits have focused on health, sickness absence, work environment and socioeconomic status in adulthood. Extending the focus to include early life circumstances may improve our understanding of processes leading to educational and occupational marginalisation and exclusion. The aim of this study was to investigate if multiple negative life events in childhood determined future labour market participation, and to identify important negative life events for labour market participation in young adulthood.
   Methods: Of a cohort of 3,681 born in 1989 in the county of Ringkjoebing, Denmark, 3,058 (83%) completed a questionnaire in 2004. They were followed in a register on social benefits for 12 months in 2010-2011. Logistic regression analyses were used to investigate associations between negative life events in childhood and future labour market participation, taking into account effects of socio-economic position, school performance, educational plans, vocational expectations and general health.
   Results: A total of 17.1% (19.9% males, 14.4% females) received social benefits for at least 4 weeks during follow-up. Labour market participation decreased with number of negative life events, especially for females: Females who had experienced their parents' divorce, had been abused, or had witnessed a violent event, showed decreased labour market participation, when adjusting for SES, school performance, educational plans, vocational expectations and general health at baseline. Attributable fractions ranged from 2.4% (parents' alcohol/drug abuse) to 16.1% (parents' divorce) for women. For men, risk estimates were lower and insignificant in the most adjusted models. Attributable fractions ranged from 1.0% (parents' alcohol/drug abuse) to 4.9% for witnessing a violent event.
   Conclusions: Information on childhood conditions may increase the understanding of determinants of labour market participation for young adults. Knowledge of negative life events in childhood should be taken into account when considering determinants of labour market participation and identifying high-risk groups.

AB  - The raised coral reef sequences at Kish Island provide a rare window into the depositional setting and paleoenvironment of a high-latitude, shallow-water coral reef that developed under turbid conditions in the Persian Gulf during Marine Isotope Stage 7 (similar to 200 to 250 ka). Six sedimentary facies and eight foraminiferal assemblages can be identified throughout the sequence. A ninth assemblage can be defined for the modern subtidal realm. At the base of the sequence is a marl rich in hyaline foraminifera (Elphidium, Ammonia, Asterorotalia, Bulimina, Nonion, and Quinqueloculina) and ostracods, which was deposited in about 30-40 m water depth in a turbid deltaic setting. Shallowing resulted in the marl becoming sandy, and changing to a mollusc-rich facies with rare foraminifera (mostly smaller miliolid taxa) that formed the substrate for coral recruitment. The coral marl layer contains many large corals embedded in situ in an aggregate and coralline algae-rich marl. Two abundance peaks in the foraminifera occur at the base and mid-way through this layer, which also correspond to a change from Murrayinella-dominated to Placopsilina-dominated assemblages, indicating deepening and more open-marine conditions, but elevated turbidity. Towards the top of the layer, abundance of foraminifera decreases and miliolid foraminifera become dominant. The top-most layer is dominated by coral and mollusc fragments and has an Amphistegina-rich reef-related assemblage. Of the Late Pleistocene foraminiferal assemblages, the Murrayinella-, Pararotalia-, and Placopsilina-dominated assemblages are no longer present in the modern gulf for unknown reasons. Of the other five assemblages, only the Amphistegina assemblage is found within proximity to the modern Kish Island. The Elphidium and Asterorotalia-Bulimina assemblages are from deeper areas of the gulf. The Ammonia and Quinqueloculina assemblages occur in lagoonal sediments on the Arabian side of the gulf. Like the modern Persian Gulf, the diversity of foraminifera was low (similar to 80 common species) during the Pleistocene and does not correlate with foraminiferal abundance.

AB  - Rates of tree growth in tropical forests reflect variation in life history strategies, contribute to the determination of species' distributional limits, set limits to timber harvesting and control the carbon balance of the stands. Here, we review the resources that limit tree growth at different temporal and spatial scales, and the different growth rates and responses of functional groups defined on the basis of regeneration strategy, maximum size, and species' associations with particular edaphic and climatic conditions.
   Variation in soil water availability determines intra- and inter-annual patterns of growth within seasonal forests, whereas irradiance may have a more important role in aseasonal forests. Nutrient supply limits growth rates in montane forests and may determine spatial variation in growth of individual species in lowland forests. However, its role in determining spatial variation in stand-level growth rates is unclear. In terms of growth rate, we propose a functional classification of tropical tree species which contrasts inherently fast-growing, responsive species (pioneer, large-statured species), from slow-growing species that are less responsive to increasing resource availability (shade-bearers, small-statured species). In a semi-deciduous forest in Ghana, pioneers associated with high-rainfall forests with less fertile soils, had significantly lower growth rates than pioneers that are more abundant in low-rainfall forests with more fertile soils. These results match patterns found in seedling trials and suggest for pioneers that species' associations with particular environmental conditions are useful indicators of maximum growth rate.
   The effects of variation in resource availability and of inherent differences between species on stand-level patterns of growth will not be independent if the functional group composition of tropical forests varies along resource gradients. We find that there is increasing evidence of such spatial shifts at both small and large scales in tropical forests. Quantifying these gradients is important for understanding spatial patterns in forest growth rates.

AB  - 1. Variations in the relative biovolumes of dominant cyanobacterial taxa were evaluated in the context of environmental conditions using canonical correlation analysis (CCorrA) and Redundancy Analysis (RDA). The objective was to test a conceptual model in which underwater irradiance determines dominance by bloom-forming (high light adapted) or non-blooming (low light adapted) taxa.
   2. The data set consisted of 404 contiguous observations, collected over a 3-year period at eight pelagic sites, in shallow Lake Okeechobee, Florida, U.S.A. Data included species biovolumes, total phosphorus (TP) total nitrogen (TN), dissolved oxygen (DO) and chlorophyll a concentrations, as well as two indices: underwater irradiance (Secchi depth) and the ratio of Secchi:total depth.
   3. The first environmental canonical variable was strongly correlated with the two light-related indices, and negatively correlated with TP. This reflects the predominant role of resuspended P-rich lake sediments in controlling underwater irradiance in the shallow lake. The first species canonical variable displayed a strong negative correlation with Lyngbya limnetica and L. contorta, and positive correlations with Anabaena circinalis, Aphanizomenon flos aquae and Microcystis spp. The results support the conceptual model; the first pair of canonical variables explained 55% of the variation in the species-environmental data set. RDA results provided further support for the hypothesis that irradiance was the major force controlling community structure.
   4. One unexpected result was a positive association between Oscillatoria spp. dominance and indicators of high irradiance. This conflicts with past research indicating that Oscillatoria is a low light adapted taxon, and the finding that it is the most abundant taxon in Lake Okeechobee. This may reflect the fact that the two Lyngbya taxa were more strongly associated with low light conditions than Oscillatoria. CCorrA results indicated that Oscillatoria densities are strongly controlled by water temperature. There is a need for more detailed studies of cyanobacteria ecophysiology in order to explain fully the seasonality of phytoplankton in this and other shallow subtropical lakes.

AB  - In order to realize the active and synchronous control of nitrogen (N) and organic matter (OM) release from sediments, this study compared the spatiotemporal changes in the physical, chemical, and biological indicators in the water system under different CaO2 dosing modes. Results from 90-day incubation experiment showed that CaO2 formed a dense barrier layer near its dosing position, improved the anoxic condition of water system, increased the physical adsorption of pollutants by sediments, and reduced the nutrients in overlying water, interstitial water, and sediments. Comprehensive comparison, the improvement effect of shallow injection group (I1) was the most obvious. Meanwhile, the activities of ammonia oxidizing bacteria and nitrite oxidizing bacteria near dosing position and those of denitrifiers and anammox bacteria adjacent to dosing site were significantly increased in all test groups (p <0.01), thereby realizing the biological removal of N and OM in sediments. In addition, DO and ORP were steadily higher than 5 mg L-1 and 100 mV in I1, where the NH4+-N concentration in overlying water was stable below 1 mg L-1, and the easily released N content in the upper (0-3 cm) and middle (4-6 cm) sediments decreased by 41.64% and 43.56%, respectively. Compared with the large pollutant flux in control (14.31 TN mg m(-2) d(-1) and 194.05 mg TCOD m(-2) d(-1)), I1 completely inhibited the pollutant release and reduced the original nutrients in overlying water. In general, CaO2 efficiently and synchronously controlled the endogenous release of N and OM under the combined actions of physical interception, physical adsorption, chemical oxidation, and biological transformation. Therefore, this study may provide valuable reference and guidance for the active and synchronous removal of N and OM in sediments and inhibition of endogenous pollutant release under anoxic condition.

AB  - Bio-energy crops need to be grown on marginal salt and drought lands in India as per policy. Understanding environmental stress response in bio-energy crops might help in promoting cultivation of bio-energy feedstock on marginal salty and drought land. This is one of the first report for vegetative propagation of Bamboo (Bambusa balcooa) under salt and drought stress to understand antioxidant enzymes' gene regulations to combat stress through activation of antioxidant enzymes and osmo-protectant molecules to scavenge reactive oxygen species as measured by physiological changes. Morphological, physiological, and biochemical traits were noted as indicators of plant health upon different sodium chloride (NaCl) salt-stress while various drought conditions with correlation analysis. A significant up-regulation of genes related to most of the antioxidant enzymes was observed up to salinity of 14 mS cm(- 1) electric conductivity (EC) at 150 mM NaCl experimental salt stress which declined with higher salt-stress. While in the case of drought-stress, all genes remained up-regulated while proline dehydrogenase (PDH) remained down-regulated up-to 100% drought-stress having 4% soil moisture. The gene expressions of antioxidant enzymes were significantly correlated with their corresponding gene-products namely super-oxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities. Biochemical parameters such as, soluble sugar, proline, malondialdehyde (MDA), total amino acids, hydrogen peroxide and electrolyte leakage ratio also showed positive correlation (p = 0.001) with salt condition. Genetic and biochemical test parameters were significantly correlated with physiological attributes of plant health at soil EC of 14 mS cm(- 1) shown as 150 mM NaCl salt stress and 60% drought-stress having 17% soil moisture content, were the optimum stress tolerance limits observed. Application of these data would be useful to cultivate 0.63 million ha of salinity affected land and 10.05 million ha of drought affected land among wastelands in India to meet biofuel need.

AB  - Current shipping activities employ about 3% of the world-delivered energy. Most of this energy is conveyed by diesel engines. In Europe, release of NOx and particulate matter (PM) from shipping is expected to equal the road-transport one by the year 2020. This paper addresses a typical central Mediterranean city-port condition to evaluate the relative contribution of shipping activities to the local air quality. A 3-year long air quality dataset collected at the boundary between the port of Civitavecchia (the major port in central Italy) and the city itself was analyzed to evaluate the long-term, relative contribution of the port and of the city at determining the loads of EU-regulated pollutants (NO2, PM10 and SO2). In addition, black carbon and ultrafine-to-coarse particles data collected along a short-term, intensive campaign were used to assess the port's role at emitting these unregulated pollutants. Cross-analysis of the measurements, allowed to assess which shipping-related activities and port's sectors represent the principal emitters. At the city-port boundary, the annual share of regulated pollutants originating in the port area by shipping and ground movements is of 33% for PM10, 43% for NO2, and 60% for SO2. Analysis of non-regulated pollutants shows the in-port, high polluting potential of some ship categories, in particular those employing low-sulfur but poorly refined oils. These conditions appear to be more often associated with Ro-Ro passenger ships. Piers closest to the Civitavecchia urban settlements are also observed to host the largest emissions. Meteorology and location of the piers with respect to residential areas are confirmed to govern the port's share at impacting the city air quality. Even though air quality thresholds for regulated pollutants are not exceeded in Civitavecchia, constant consideration of an enlarged set of environmental variables should drive actions implemented to mitigate the port's impact onto the nearby city's air quality.

AB  - BackgroundDeep body temperature is a critical indicator of heat strain. However, direct measures are often invasive, costly, and difficult to implement in the field. This study assessed the agreement between deep body temperature estimated from heart rate and that measured directly during repeated work bouts while wearing explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) protective clothing and during recovery.MethodsEight males completed three work and recovery periods across two separate days. Work consisted of treadmill walking on a 1% incline at 2.5, 4.0, or 5.5km/h, in a random order, wearing EOD protective clothing. Ambient temperature and relative humidity were maintained at 24 degrees C and 50% [Wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) (20.91.2) degrees C] or 32 degrees C and 60% [WBGT (29.00.2) degrees C] on the separate days, respectively. Heart rate and gastrointestinal temperature (T-GI) were monitored continuously, and deep body temperature was also estimated from heart rate (ECTemp).Results The overall systematic bias between T-GI and ECTemp was 0.01 degrees C with 95% limits of agreement (LoA) of +/- 0.64 degrees C and a root mean square error of 0.32 degrees C. The average error statistics among participants showed no significant differences in error between the exercise and recovery periods or the environmental conditions. At T-GI levels of (37.0-37.5) degrees C, (37.5-38.0) degrees C, (38.0-38.5) degrees C, and>38.5 degrees C, the systematic bias and +/- 95% LoA were (0.08 +/- 0.58) degrees C, (-0.02 +/- 0.69) degrees C, (-0.07 +/- 0.63) degrees C, and (-0.32 +/- 0.56) degrees C, respectively.Conclusions The findings demonstrate acceptable validity of the ECTemp up to 38.5 degrees C. Conducting work within an ECTemp limit of 38.4 degrees C, in conditions similar to the present study, would protect the majority of personnel from an excessive elevation in deep body temperature (>39.0 degrees C).

AB  - Organic matter quantity and type are important parameters in conventional source rock evaluation and unconventional shale oil/gas reservoir characterization. Understanding the stratigraphic distribution of organic matter content and type in black shale successions is critical for identifying potentially productive intervals, because organic matter can adsorb large amounts of oil and gas. Detailed examination of total organic carbon content, organic petrographic composition, and high-resolution (8 cm spacing) geochemical proxies in a sequence stratigraphic framework were conducted on an early mature (0.55% R-o) New Albany Shale core of the Illinois Basin to study the influence of relative sea-level fluctuations on paleoproductivity, clastic supply, bottom-water redox conditions, and their combined control on total organic carbon distribution pattern and organic maceral variation.
   Marine organic matter including amorphous organic matter and alginite (mainly derived from Tasmanites cysts) is the dominant organic matter in the New Albany Shale. Terrestrial organic matter accounts for <10% of total organic matter. Within a sequence stratigraphic context, total organic carbon content increases in transgressive systems tracts, reaches a maximum before the maximum flooding surface, and shows relatively low values in highstand systems tracts. Comparatively, low total organic carbon contents at maximum flooding surfaces reflect a combination of low sedimentation rates, elevated bottom-water oxygenation, and high biogenic silica dilution. Stratigraphically, amorphous organic matter content increases in transgressive systems tracts, reaches a maximum near the maximum flooding surface, and decreases in highstand systems tracts. Enrichment of broken Tasmanites cysts and their detrital infills are an indicator of high-energy environments and could possibly indicate lowstand systems tracts. The stratigraphic distribution of organic matter content and type may result in cyclic stratigraphic variations of hydrocarbon generation potential and oil saturation, and influence the development of secondary organic pores when the New Albany Shale is within the oil and gas windows.

AB  - CO2-based transcritical Rankine cycle (CTRC) can be used for the waste heat recovery due to its safety and environment-friendly characteristics, and also fits for the high temperature of exhaust gas and satisfy the miniaturization demand of recovery systems. It can provide a reasonable pathway toward thermal energy management of engine. This work proposes novel configurations selection maps of four CTRC configurations for waste heat recovery of engines. Except for considering a regenerator added to traditional CTRC (basic CTRC) recovering exhaust waste heat, a preheater driven by engine coolant will be also taken into account in this paper. Thus, the four configurations include the basic CTRC (B-CTRC), the CTRC with a pre heater (P-CTRC), the CTRC with a regenerator (R-CTRC) and the CTRC with both of the preheater and the regenerator (PR-CTRC). As different CTRC configurations have advantage of performance indicators under different conditions, and the focused indicators may also be various with applications, this paper focuses on proposing a kind of selection maps, which is used for the selection of the four CTRC configurations in the field of engine waste heat recovery. Comprehensive performance comparison are researched in this paper from three aspects, net power output based on the first law of thermodynamics, exergy efficiency based on the second law of thermodynamics and electricity production cost (EPC) as an indicator of the economic performance. After the comparative analysis, three selection maps separately based on the three performance indicators are proposed to give the selection reference of the CTRC configurations under different design conditions, which refer to turbine inlet pressure and temperature in this paper. It is meaningful for the design and operating of the CTRC configuration used for waste heat recovery of engines. Besides, it can also be a new method that can be expanded to other recovery system selection (e.g. ORCs) in engine field or other fields (e.g. solar, geothermal). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Many studies have confirmed that size distributions of framboidal pyrite can be an effective indicator of bottom water redox conditions in modern as well as ancient sedimentary environments. However, one environment in which production of framboidal pyrite has not been sufficiently studied to date is the sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ), in which anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is coupled with microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) to enhance iron sulfide mineral precipitation (e.g., FeS2, FeS, and Fe3S4). Here, we document for the first time size distributions for pyrite framboids from the SMTZ, based on data from two sites in the methane hydrate-beating region of the northern South China Sea. On the basis of framboid size, pyrite concentration, and sulfur isotope data, we propose new insights into the formation process of authigenic pyrite framboids within the SMTZ. We conclude that (1) Enhanced anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) not only plays a dominant role in the accumulation of S-34-enriched pyrite but also is responsible for formation of highly variable and sometimes exceptionally large pyrite framboids in the SMTZ; (2) Most framboids occur in 'framboid clusters' which commonly exhibit rod-like shapes, secondary overgrowths, heavier delta S-34 values, and unusual size distributions (e.g., mean size > 20 mu m and standard deviation > 3.0 mu m) in the SMTZ; (3) Pyrite framboids formed in the SMTZ, which have characteristics different from those formed in the sulfate reduction zone (SRZ), do not comment on redox conditions of the overlying water column; and (4) Framboid occurrences with similar characteristics in ancient marine deposits may be considered indicators of enhanced AOM and mark the former position of the SMTZ in the paleo-marine system. In addition, significant quantities of elemental sulfur were observed in the SMTZ, possibly related to anaerobic oxidation of hydrogen sulfide and fluctuations of the SMTZ. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Although experimental work on environmental enrichment has answered many important questions, it is not yet known whether beneficial effects of enrichment are more strongly influenced by regular provision of novel objects, or by the diversity of objects present at any one time. In a five-replicate study, 80 newly weaned male Wistar rats were housed in groups of four in: a 'novelty' condition (NC) in which five copies of the same object were provided in the home cage during the first week of the study followed by five copies of a different, novel, object over each of the next 4 weeks; a 'complexity' condition (CC) in which one example of each of the five objects used in NC was always present in the cage across the 5-week study period. Behaviour was collected in two 2-h sessions every week, once during the light phase of the light/dark cycle and once during the dark phase. Body weight and weight gain were measured over the five weeks and organ weights were recorded post-mortem. Rats in the CC displayed elevated levels of measures suggestive of improved welfare such as sleep, enrichment directed behaviour, enrichment contact, weight gain and relative thymus weight, and decreased levels of indicators denoting poor welfare including aggression, awake-non active and audible vocalizations. It appears that CC may have the potential to increase the frequency and diversity of behaviours, to express different types of behaviour when desired, and to augment the ability of the animals to exert some control over their environment, findings that may improve their welfare. Provision of novelty per se in the absence of diversity of objects at any one time seems to be less beneficial. Order (replicate) effects in the NC group indicated that responses of the animals towards the enrichment regimen appeared to depend on the type of object supplied, thus drawing attention to the importance of object characteristics when designing enrichment protocols for laboratory animals.

AB  - Controlled tile drainage (CTD) has environmental and crop production benefits, but the effects of cm on crop growth under varying weather conditions is not well-documented. This study evaluates the responsiveness of field-scale corn and soybean growth from CTD and uncontrolled tile drainage (UCTD) under varying seasonal temperature and rainfall in eastern Ontario, Canada. Leaf area index (LAI) and total above-ground dry biomass were used as crop growth indicators and were estimated from in situ data and satellite imagery between 2005 to 2013. Corn LAI from CTD fields was maintained or significantly higher relative to the LAI from UCTD fields, in 92% of all site-years; corn biomass from CTD fields was also maintained or significantly higher in all site-years of the study in which it was determined. For soybean, LAI from CTD fields was maintained or significantly higher in 67% of the site-years; biomass from CTD fields was maintained in all site years in which it was determined. Higher water tables and soil water contents, and slightly higher groundwater nitrogen concentrations in CID fields, may explain these responses. Cohen's d effect size of satellite derived LAI ([Mean CTD LAI - mean UCTD LAI]/pooled standard deviation) for corn was negatively related to total May-August precipitation indicating a stronger CTD effect with a decrease in precipitation. In contrast to the corn results, Cohen's d of satellite-derived LAI for soybeans was positively related to total May-August (and especially May-July) precipitation, indicating a stronger CTD effect with an increase in precipitation. Results herein could be used to help inform how to optimize the use of growing season CTD for different crops in order to enhance crop growth properties.

AB  - Despite consistently implemented remedial measures in a Bavarian Simmental herd with herdwide increased incidence of acute and subclinical mastitis (predominant pathogen S. uberis) goals set by a monthly clinical mastitis rate < 2% and an average herd somatic cell count of < 150,000/ml could not be achieved.
   The evaluation of MLP data showed evidence of a lack of energy and fat mobilization in early lactation and lack of fiber in high lactation period. beta-BHB measurements in the first four weeks postpartum confirmed the suspicion of a Ketosis-related problem on herd level. Essentially responsible for an over-conditioning of dry cows was an excessively high energy density in the dry cow ration. Clinical but also subclinical ketosis have negative impact on the immune system and thus increases the risk of mastitis. In order to improve udder health stabilization of the metabolic health of the herd was necessary in addition to the already practiced recovery plan.
   The concept was implemented using a multi-step action plan. The basis for better metabolic health (level 1) was an adaption of feeding, to ensure adequate nutrition during all phases of lactation. Controlling measures (level 2) like regular analysis of MLP data, condition assessment by backfat measurement, daily health check and beta-BHB levels help to monitor supply situation and metabolic health of the herd. So feeding mistakes, but also metabolically vulnerable or already diseased animals can be detected on time. Specific measures (e.g., targeted use of propylene glycol) can reduce risk of disease in compromised animals (level 3). Already treating subclinically infected animals further reduces incidence of clinical ketosis and negative impact on animal health (level 4).
   Following this approach the rate of clinical ketosis was reduced significantly within 6 months. At the same time the udder figures clearly improved: the average herd somatic cell count dropped to 145.000/ml within six months and the monthly mastitis rate declined to an average of 1.3 %.

AB  - Question: How does floodplain forest vegetation react to a changed hydrological regime induced by a restoration project? Is it possible to model the Ellenberg moisture value (mF) using variables representing site moisture conditions? Does mF help predict changes in vegetation composition and thus help in validating restoration success?
   Location: Danube floodplain, Neuburg a. d. Donau, Bavaria, Germany.
   Methods: A Generalized additive model (GAM) and a generalized linear model (GLM) were used for spatial prediction of mF using groundwater, relief and soil variables as predictors. Vegetation response to a changed hydrological regime was tested through replacing the old groundwater model with a new model representing the new water regime. With the help of a GIS, a spatial distribution and a scenario map of mF was produced. Model validation was done by cross-validation and comparison between predicted and observed data from repeated vegetation sampling on permanent plots.
   Results: Groundwater level (minima of 2009) and soil thickness entered the final model as significant predictors of mF. The GAM of mF showed good predictive power, with more than 57% of deviance explained. The corresponding GLM had slightly lower accuracy, with 51% of deviance explained. Using the new groundwater model (minima of 2011) it was possible to forecast mF after restoration. Changes in mF are to be expected in areas directly affected by restoration measures. The model validation has proven that the quality of model prediction is good and represents the reality fairly well.
   Conclusions: The study has shown that mF is a useful indicator for a summary prediction of ecological change. It can be expected that restoration will turn overall conditions wetter, and vegetation will respond to these changes with an increase of wetland plant species. With the help of the model, it is possible to measure the success of the restoration project. It is demonstrated that GAM can be used for intensive data exploration, after which a less complex and easily computable GLM can be parameterized.

AB  - Mounting evidence from satellite observations of a re-greening across much of the Sahel and Sudan zones over the past three decades has raised questions about the extent and reversibility of desertification. Historical ground data that could help in interpreting the re-greening are scarce. To fill that void, we tapped into the collective memories of local land users from central and western Senegal in 39 focus groups and assessed the spatial association between their perceptions of vegetation changes over time and remote sensing-derived trends. To provide context to the vegetation changes, we also explored the land users' perspective on the evolution of other environmental and human variables that are potentially related to the greening, using participatory research methods. While increases in vegetation were confirmed by the study participants for certain areas, which spatially corresponded to satellite-observed re-greening, vegetation degradation dominated their perceptions of change. This degradation, although spatially extensive according to land users, flies under the radar of coarse-resolution remote sensing data because it is not necessarily associated with a decrease in biomass but rather with undesired changes in species composition. Few significant differences were found in the perceived trends of population pressure, environmental, and livelihood variables between communities that have greened up according to satellite data and those that have not. Our findings challenge the prevailing chain of assumptions of the satellite-observed greening trend indicating an improvement of environmental conditions in the sense of a rehabilitation of the vegetation cover after the great droughts of the 1970s and 1980s, and the improvement of environmental conditions possibly translating into more stable livelihoods and greater well-being of the populations. For monitoring desertification and rehabilitation, there is a need to develop remote sensing-based indicators that better reflect the changes in the biophysical environment that matter most to the land users.

AB  - Although Escherichia coli is an indicator of fecal contamination in aquifers, limited research has been devoted to understanding the biological processes involved in the initial attachment of E. coli transported in abiotic porous media. The roles of the various surface structures of E. coli, like lipopolysaccharides (LPS), autotransporter proteins, and fimbriae are unknown. The objective of this research was to establish the effects of variations in surface characteristics of the outer membrane of E. coli on the attachment efficiency of 54 E. coli strains upon transport in saturated quartz sand under identical flow conditions. We used column experiments to assess retention of the E. coli strains, and we determined sphericity, motility, zeta-potential, and aggregation of all strains. LPS composition was determined based on known serotypes, and the presence/absence of 22 genes encoding surface characteristics was deter-mined with qualitative PCR. The results indicated that under identical flow conditions, there was a variation of two orders of magnitude in the maximum breakthrough concentrations of the 54 E. coli strains. Of all factors we investigated, no single factor was able to explain attachment efficiency variations statistically significantly. However, low attachment efficiencies were associated (p=0.13) with LPS containing saccharides with phosphate and/or carboxyl groups. These saccharide groups are acidic and likely charged with a negative O-atom, which reduced attachment to the negatively charged quartz surface. In addition, of the 22 genes tested, Afa was most associated (p=0.21) with attachment efficiency. The work presented here bridges knowledge on colloid transport and molecular microbiology, and tries to offer a more holistic view on the attachment of planktonic E. coli bacteria to (abiotic) quartz grain surfaces. Future research should involve the use of microbiological techniques in order to be able to map the unique or grouped characteristics of E. coli in aquifers, and to assess the usefulness of E. coli as a fecal indicator in aquifers.

AB  - Air pollution predictions for environmental impact assessments are usually generated by Gaussian plume/puff models driven by observationally-based meteorological inputs. An alternative approach is to use prognostic meteorological and air pollution models, which are better founded than the Gaussian approach, but tend to require much expertise and time to set up and large computing resources to run. This paper provides an overview of the science and verification of The Air Pollution Model (TAPM), which was designed to apply the best science in an easy-to-use and fast-to-run model. TAPM is a PC-based, nestable, prognostic meteorological and air pollution model (with photochemistry) driven by a Graphical User Interface, and is a viable tool for year-long simulations. Datasets of the important inputs needed for meteorological simulations (such as terrain and land-use data and synoptic analyses) accompany the model, allowing quick GUI configuration of the model for any region. We present results from the application of TAPM for urban and coastal areas in Australia, for two United States tracer experiments (Kincaid and Indianapolis) used for international model inter-comparison, and for point source dispersion in wind-tunnel building wakes. The meteorological results show that TAPM performs well in coastal, inland, and complex terrain, in sub-tropical to mid-latitude conditions, for both case studies and year-long simulations. The pollution results show that TAPM performs well for a range of important phenomena such as nocturnal inversion break-up fumigation, convective dispersion, shoreline fumigation, building wakes, and general dispersion in complex rural and urban conditions. In particular, the TAPM performance is very good for the prediction of extreme pollution statistics, important for environmental impact assessments, for both non-reactive (tracer) and reactive (nitrogen dioxide, ozone and particulate) pollutants for a variety of sources (e.g. industrial stacks and surface or urban emissions).

AB  - In order to quantify the effect of the percentage of cows in milking oil the total milk yield of the herd. the global monthly controls of 19 dairy units (total of 1640 females) between 2001 and 2002 were studied in the conditions of a cattle enterprise in Havana province. The data were studied according to different mixed linear models in which the year and the natural month were considered as fixed effects, while the cattle unit was taken as representative out of a group. Thus, it was incorporated as random effect. The total monthly milk yield. the total monthly yield per hectare (total monthly milk yield/the area of the cattle unit) and the total daily milk yield (total monthly milk yield/day of the natural month) were studied as dependent variables. The effect of the percentage of cows in milking [(total of cows in milking/total of cows in the cattle unit) x 100] and the stocking rate (number of heads per hectare) were estimated by the inclusion of these factors as covariables or classes. The results of all the models indicated highly significant (P < 0.001) effects oil the three dependent variables. The coefficients of determination ranged from 80.2 to 82.6%. In the conditions of this study, every cattle unit produced monthly 6837 kg of total monthly milk yield, 102.0 kg of total monthly milk yield per hectare and 224 kg of total daily milk yield. These results were obtained with a stocking rate of 1.29 animals/ha and 49.5% of cows in milking. For every 1% increase in the percentage of cows in milking, there was increase in 138.3 kgr 2.16 kg and 4.54 kg for total monthly milk yield, total monthly milk yield per hectare and total daily milk yield, respectively. Throughout the year. the effects of the percentage of cows in milking oil the productive indicators differed significantly. The factors that allowed these variations kind their effect on the total milk yield of the herd were identified.

AB  - Stability of grain yield performance is an important characteristic in the selection of new crop cultivars. Information from cultivar trials, however, is seldom fully analysed for genotype by environment interactions and, therefore, information on stability of current crop cultivars is lacking. The objectives of this study were to investigate the stability of agronomic traits among genotypes of barley (Hordeum vulgare) across 17 environments (location-years) in Maryland (USA) from 1994 through 1997 and to examine the effect of locations and years of testing on grain yield performance in this region. Significant differences were observed among barley cultivars and experimental lines for grain yield, plant height, and heading date. Grain yield was positively correlated with plant height and negatively correlated with heading date. Genotype x environment interactions measured through regression analysis were significant for grain yield, heading date and plant height, with the environmental component having the largest effect. Most barley genotypes tested (90%) had regression slopes for grain yield that did not differ from 1.0, indicating good potential for yield response under improving environmental conditions. The most widely grown cultivar in the mid-Atlantic region, 'Nomini', had a regression slope that was higher than 1.0 for grain yield. This indicates that it tends to respond with increasingly higher yields under favorable conditions. In this study, the slope and the standard error of the slope were moderately correlated with grain yield, The genotype's coefficient of variation was not a good indicator of stability for this region. Grain yields of genotype entries common to all years and locations were correlated with corresponding yields at each of the locations and years to assess the relative performance of each location and year. Correlation coefficients across locations were relatively high (r=0.64) within each year of testing. Correlations between years for the same and across locations were generally much lower. The data presented here supports a testing program over more years rather than increased locations to fully characterise the performance of new cultivars.

AB  - Heavy metal pollution of marine sediments has attracted a great deal of attention because of its persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity. To evaluate the effects of mega-tsunami, anthropogenic activities, and redox conditions on heavy metal accumulation in coastal areas, sediments from Matsushima Bay, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan, were sampled to test variations in heavy metal spatial distribution on the bay floor during 4 years following the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake tsunami. Cluster analysis and principal component analysis were performed to assess the influencing factors and potential sources of heavy metal enrichment in the sediments of the bay. Additionally, the sediment enrichment levels of heavy metals were assessed on the basis of the enrichment factor (EF). The results of multivariate statistical analyses showed that the Ti, Fe, V, Pb, and Zn contents in Matsushima Bay sediments, which were transported mainly from Sendai Bay, depended on the mud content. The value of EF < 2 for Fe, V, Pb, and Zn indicated that these elements were not enriched. The value of EF > 7 for Cu suggested that the contamination levels in western Matsushima Bay were moderate to severe in every sampling year from 2012 to 2016 by anthropogenic activities. From the values of EF > 5 for U and Mo during 2012 and 2014, the severe enrichment of both elements in these periods may be explained by contamination with 2011 tsunami deposits; the improvement in 2015-2016 suggests that there was recovery of the tsunami-affected sediment composition to its original state. The values of EF > 3 for Mn and As indicated moderate to severe contamination with these heavy metals in the bay mouth area during 2015. This was likely explained by more oxic bottom conditions in the mouth of Matsushima Bay during that year. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Comprehensive bioassessment multiple stressor field studies were conducted in five waterbodies in the Central Valley, San Francisco and Central Coast areas of California between 2006 and 2017. Samples were collected over multiple years in Pleasant Grove Creek (PGC - 8 years), Kirker Creek (KC - 2 years), Arcade Creek (ARC - 3 years), Salinas streams (SAL - 3 years) and the lower Santa Maria River watershed (SM - 3 years). In each watershed, metrics indicative of physical habitat quality and the relative health of benthic communities were collected, along with measurements of various potential toxicants in sediment (metals and pyrethroids), total organic carbon (TOC) and sediment grain size characteristics. For all waterbodies, pyrethroids have been reported at concentrations suspected to be toxic based on single-species laboratory toxicity tests. The data from all of these studies were assembled into a single data base which was analyzed by a series of univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. These analyses were designed to examine overall relationships between benthic community health and environmental quality conditions across the watersheds, as well as to address the following two key questions: (1) Which benthic metrics (response indicators) were the most important to relationships with environmental quality conditions and how do these metrics rank from most to least important? and (2) Which environmental variables (stressors) were the most important in terms of relationships to benthic metrics indicative of community health and how do the stressors rank from most to least important? Consensus ranking of 14 benthic metrics showed that stress tolerant (% Tolerant taxa, Tolerance value and Collectors/gatherers) and stress sensitive (EPT taxa and taxa richness) were the most important. The consensus ranking of 38 environmental variables from most to least important showed that habitat metrics, metals and grain size characteristics were most important for shaping benthic communities while pyrethroids were not reported to be an important stressor across the geographic scope of the watersheds.

AB  - This paper explores the traditional indicators that small-scale farmers in Gaza province in southern Mozambique use to predict drought events on their rain-fed farms. It analyzes the contextual situation regarding the accuracy and reliability of the traditional prediction methods under the current weather and conditions of climate uncertainty and variability, and the opportunities that their prediction methods can bring to reduce their current and future exposure and vulnerabilities to drought. Farmers use a total of 11 traditional environmental indicators to predict drought, either individually or combined, as required to increase their prediction certainty. However, the farmers perceive that current unpredictability, variability, and changes in weather and climate have negatively affected the interpretation, accuracy, and reliability of most of their prediction indicators, and thus their farming activities and their ability to predict and respond to drought. This, associated with the reduced number of elders in the community, is causing a decline in the diversity, and complexity of interpretation of indicators. Nonetheless, these difficulties have not impeded farmers from continuing to use their preferred prediction methods, as on some occasions they continue to be useful for their farming-related decisions and are also the main, or sometimes only, source of forecast. Considering the role these methods play in farmers' activities, and the limited access to meteorological forecasts in most rural areas of Mozambique, and the fact that the weather and climate is expected to continually change, this paper concludes that it is important to enhance the use of traditional prediction methods. However, the increase of the accuracy and reliability, and continued existence of the methods depends on the farmers' own abilities to enhance, preserve, and validate them by tailoring the traditional methods used to work with the new environmental, weather, and climatic conditions, or through the development of new methods.

AB  - Life cycle assessment (LCA) has not been widely applied in the building design process because it is perceived to be complex and time-consuming. There is a high demand for simplified approaches that architects can use without detailed knowledge of LCA. This paper presents a parametric LCA approach, which allows architects to efficiently reduce the environmental impact of building designs.
   First, the requirements for design-integrated LCA are analyzed. Then, assumptions to simplify the required data input are made and a parametric model is established. The model parametrizes all input, including building geometry, materials, and boundary conditions, and calculates the LCA in real time. The parametric approach possesses the advantage that input parameters can be adjusted easily and quickly. The architect has two options to improve the design: either through manually changing geometry, building materials, and building services, or through the use of an optimization solver. The parametric model was implemented in a parametric design software and applied using two cases: (a) the design of a new multi-residential building, and (b) retrofitting of a single-family house.
   We have successfully demonstrated the capability of the approach to find a solution with minimum environmental impact for both examples. In the first example, the parametric method is used to manually compare geometric design variants. The LCA is calculated based on assumptions for materials and building services. In the second example, evolutionary algorithms are employed to find the optimum combination of insulation material, heating system, and windows for retrofitting. We find that there is not one optimum insulation thickness, but many optima, depending on the individual boundary conditions and the chosen environmental indicator.
   By incorporating a simplified LCA into the design process, the additional effort of performing LCA is minimized. The parametric approach allows the architect to focus on his main task of designing the building and finally makes LCA practically useful for design optimization. In the future, further performance analysis capabilities such as life cycle costing can also be integrated.

AB  - Soil quality (SQ) is a multidimensional concept based on the use of indicators. Indicators integrated assessment gives much more information than individual data and a select set of parameters; solve operational and economic aspects of measurement and monitoring. One of the most important effects of Land Use Change (LUC) is the alteration of original properties of native forest soil. Chaco province has no previous published studies on soil quality (SQ) for cleared lands. In Argentina between 1956 and 2000s the most significant changes occurred in West Subhumid Chaco, where crops expansion and deforestation were the highest of the country. The objectives of this study were: (1) to select SQI in native forest soils cleared for agricultural use in an area of Chaco province under LUC without available information; (2) to obtain values from these indicators for this environment, in order to increase,current knowledge about LUC effects. Results show that LUC caused a significant degradation in these parameters compared with soil of pristine condition, affecting physical and chemical quality in a relatively short time. TOC was the most sensitive indicator and decreased between 40 and 11% in cleared sites at surface. The selection by mixed models in a first step and then by multivariate techniques was effective because some variables were more consistent to discriminate in the complete dataset the unaltered condition (NF) of the disturbed (CL), taking into account the inherent variability of sampling sites and depths. Selected indicators were: total organic carbon (TOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), total nitrogen (N), bulk density (Bd), and EF (erodible fraction); high correlation between some of them would allow performing an even tight selection. These indicators varied in performance between studied depths. This SQI set is feasible to recommend as a tool for soil health diagnostic and monitoring, prior to granting management plans currently submitted within the legal framework of native forests.

AB  - The invasive non-native gastropod Crepidula fornicata is well established in the Milford Haven Waterway (MHW) in south-west Wales, UK, since its first introduction to this ria in 1953. Whilst it reaches high densities within the MHW and has extended its range to the south of this ria, there has been very little northward expansion. Here, we report findings of a series of intertidal and subtidal surveys in 2009 and 2010 where we monitored the population density and the vertical distribution of C. fornicata at its northern range limit in Wales (the MHW). We also characterised the composition of the surface substrata of the seabed in the MHW to provide some insight into how the availability of certain settlement substrata may limit its distribution along the west coast of Britain. We found locally very dense aggregations (maximum 2748 +/- A 3859 individuals m(-2), mean +/- A SD) in the shallow subtidal and low intertidal of the MHW. Subtidally, highest densities were found in areas of high gravel content (grain sizes similar to 16-256 mm), suggesting that the availability of this substrata type is beneficial for its establishment at a site. In the intertidal, on the other hand, high gravel content was indicative of low C. fornicata abundance, possibly because gravelly shores are an indicator of very exposed conditions that, at least in the intertidal, may result in high levels of early post-settlement mortality and low recruitment. C. fornicata was absent from the entrance of the MHW, possibly due to the lack of suitable settlement substrata. The presence of substantial populations in the MHW suggests that C. fornicata's population growth and potential expansion in Welsh coastal waters is not fully limited by prevailing environmental conditions in the region, but that other processes may affect its local distribution.

In this study, hydrodynamic modeling study has been conducted to investigate the effects of sea-level rise on hurricane-induced salinity in Apalachicola Bay. By using the dataset for the Hurricane Dennis occurred in July, 2005, model simulations were conducted under different sea-level rise scenarios. Results from model simulations show the effects of sea-level rise on the estuarine salinity transport during different phases of the storm surge. Generally, the increase of water level by either storm surge or sea-level rise results in the intrusion of majority saline sea water from the east to the west through East Pass. Salinity at two oyster bars responds to the storm surge and sea-level rise differently because Cat Point is located in the east and Dry Bar is in the west of the river mouth. In Cat Point, sea-level rise can cause substantial increase of salinity because it is located between the river mouth and East Pass. Salinity at the peak of the storm surge reaches 30 ppt even without sea-level rise. While salinity at the end of the storm surge reduces to about 20 ppt under no sea-level rise condition at Cat Point, it substantially increases to 30 ppt in response to a sea-level rise of 0.2 m. However, in Dry Bar, salinity is less sensitive to the sea-level rise and the storm surge. At the peak of the storm surge, salinity in Dry Bar is 30 ppt, 28 ppt, 30 ppt., under SLR 0.2 m, 0.5 m, and 1.2 m, respectively. However, near the end of the storm surge, salinity is 22 ppt, 22 ppt, and 27 ppt under 0.2 m, 0.5 m, and 1.2 m SLR conditions, respectively. This indicates that, after the storm surge, salinity in Dry Bar can recover to the normal range (below 26 ppt) if sea-level rise is less or equal to 0.5 m.

AB  - During the years 2008-2009, studies were conducted on PM10 in the atmosphere over Gdynia. The basic chemical composition of PM10 aerosols (inorganic species, organic and elemental carbon) was measured during periods of heightened health risk. As the quality of air depends on natural as well as anthropogenic factors, it was important to specify which of these factors prevail under different synoptic conditions and at different times, and which have the greatest influence on human health.
   In the course of the 24-month research period, the daily PM10 limit value (50 mu g.m(-3)) in the coastal zone of the Gulf of Gdansk, was exceeded 25 times. High concentration episodes invariably occurred in the cold months of the year. The first kind of episode was related to sea activity and the highest share of sea salt in aerosols (NaCl=46.5%). A second type of high PM10 concentration occurred at south-eastern advection when secondary aerosols, aging on the way from the source, were carried over Gdynia. In the spring of 2009, as a result of biomass combustion (fires and grass burning) in Ukraine and Southern Russia, the PM10 mass concentration climbed to 117.1 mu g.m(-3) and was accompanied by substantial increases in nitrogen, sulfur and carbon compounds (reaching 32.5 mu g.m(-3), 20.0 mu g.m(-3), and 6.0 mu g.m(-3), respectively). The third kind of high PM10 concentration was related to local sources, mostly within the communal sector, the harbor area and the transshipment base, and was the consequence of low dispersion of pollution at a wind speed of 1 m s(-1). At such times there was a rapid increase of carbon compound concentrations (53.8%). Elemental carbon, an air pollution indicator which originates from means of transport, had the highest proportion in such instances, reaching 15.8% of the total PM10 mass concentration.

AB  - Cost-benefit analysis was performed to determine the profitability of producing wine grapes under different irrigation regimes. Vines irrigated by regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) and partial root-zone drying (PRD) were compared with vines grown under full irrigation in a typical vineyard in a semiarid environment with scarce water resources (south-eastern Spain) during three consecutive years. Five irrigation treatments were applied. The Control treatment irrigated at 60% of the ETc (Crop evapotranspiration) throughout the orchard cycle. PRD-1 and RDI-1 provided deficit irrigation from fruit set to harvest (irrigated 30% ETc) and post-harvest (45% ETc). PRD-2 and RDI-2 provided deficit irrigation from fruit set to harvest (irrigated 15% ETc) and post-harvest (45% ETc). From an economic point of view, only the Control, PRD-1 and RDI-1 treatments were economically viable since their profitability indicators were positive, although low, especially PRD-1. The more severe deficit irrigated treatments (PRD-2 and RDI-2) were unviable. The most profitable treatment was the Control which had a Net Margin/total cost ratio (NM/C) (representing the overall profitability of the vineyard) of 25.37% compared with the 1.90% of RDI-1 and 0.57% of PRD-1. The threshold price of water indicates that only the Control remains profitable with higher water prices of up to 0.46 a,not sign m(-3). When the cost-benefit analysis took into account the extra quality achieved in PRD-2 and RDI-2, it indicated that these treatments, which were otherwise economically unviable, achieved high returns (17 and 16%, respectively) and were close to the Control treatment. Thus, a low or moderate bonus that encourages extra berry quality for premium wine production would make deficit irrigation practices profitable. Moreover, the financial indices estimated suggest that in the present situation, and with our soil and climatic conditions, PRD is less economically profitable (higher installation cost, lower NM/C, and threshold price of water) than RDI under the same conditions.

AB  - Background: Emerging evidence indicates an association between mental illness and poor quality of physical health care. To test this, we compared mental health clients (MHCs) with non-MHCs on potentially preventable hospitalisations (PPHs) as an indicator of the quality of primary care received.
   Methods: Population-based retrospective cohort study of 139,208 MHCs and 294,180 matched non-MHCs in Western Australia from 1990 to 2006, using linked data from electoral roll registrations, mental health registry (MHR) records, hospital inpatient discharges and deaths. We used the electoral roll data as the sampling frame for both cohorts to enhance internal validity of the study, and the MHR to separate MHCs from non-MHCs. Rates of PPHs (overall and by PPH category and medical condition) were compared between MHCs, category of mental disorders and non-MHCs. Multivariate negative binomial regression analyses adjusted for socio-demographic factors, case mix and the year at the start of follow up due to dynamic nature of study cohorts.
   Results: PPHs accounted for more than 10% of all hospital admissions in MHCs, with diabetes and its complications, adverse drug events (ADEs), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), convulsions and epilepsy, and congestive heart failure being the most common causes. Compared with non-MHCs, MHCs with any mental disorders were more likely to experience a PPH than non-MHCs (overall adjusted rate ratio (ARR) 2.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.03-2.09). ARRs of PPHs were highest for convulsions and epilepsy, nutritional deficiencies, COPD and ADEs. The ARR of a PPH was highest in MHCs with alcohol/drug disorders, affective psychoses, other psychoses and schizophrenia.
   Conclusions: MHCs have a significantly higher rate of PPHs than non-MHCs. Improving primary and secondary prevention is warranted in MHCs, especially at the primary care level, despite there may be different thresholds for admission in people with established physical disease that is influenced by whether or not they have comorbid mental illness.

AB  - Despite large variation among crop genotypes in response to Fe fertilization, there is no reliable indicator for identifying Fe-deficiency tolerant wheat genotypes with high grain yield. The aim of this investigation was to compare the grain yield response of 20 spring and 30 winter bread wheat genotypes to Fe fertilization under field conditions and to select high grain yield Fe-deficiency tolerant genotypes using a stress tolerance indicator (STI). Two individual trials, each one consisting two field plot experiments, were conducted during 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 growing seasons. Spring wheat genotypes (Trial 1) and winter wheat genotypes (Trial 2) were planted at two different locations. Two Fe rates (0 and 20 kg Fe ha(-1) as Fe-EDTA) were applied. Spring and winter wheat genotypes differed significantly (P<0.01) in the grain yield both with and without added Fe treatments. Application of Fe fertilizer increased grain yield of spring wheat genotypes by an average of 211 and 551 kg ha(-1) in Karaj and Isfahan locations, respectively. By Fe application, the mean grain yield of winter wheat genotypes increased 532 and 798 kg ha(-1) in Karaj and Isfahan sites, respectively. Iron efficiency (Fe-EF) significantly differed among wheat genotypes and ranged from 65% to 113% for spring wheat and from 69% to 125% for winter wheat genotypes. No significant correlation was found between Fe-EF and grain yield of spring wheat genotypes under Fe deficient conditions. For winter wheat genotypes grown in Mashhad, Fe-efficiency was not significantly correlated with the grain yield produced without added Fe treatment. The STI was significantly (P<0.01) varied among spring and winter wheat genotypes. The interaction between location and genotype had no significant effect on the STI. According to these results, the STI should be considered as an effective criterion for screening programs, if a high potential grain yield together with more stable response to Fe fertilization in different environments is desired.

AB  - The oil source rocks of the Chang 7 member of the Yanchang Formation in the Erdos Basin were deposited during maximum lake extension during the Late Triassic and show a remarkable positive uranium anomaly, with an average uranium content as high as 51.1 mu g/g. Uranium is enriched together with organic matter and elements such as Fe, S, Cu, V and Mo in the rocks. The detailed biological markers determined in the Chang 7 member indicate that the lake water column was oxidizing during deposition of the Chang 7 member. However, redox indicators for sediments such as S2- content, V/Sc and V/(V + Ni) ratios demonstrate that it was a typical anoxic diagenetic setting. The contrasted redox conditions between the water column and the sediment with a very high content of organic matter provided favorable physical and chemical conditions for syngenetic uranium enrichment in the oil source rocks of the Chang 7 member. Possible uranium sources may be the extensive U-rich volcanic ash that resulted from contemporaneous volcanic eruption and uranium material transported by hydrothermal conduits into the basin. The uranium from terrestrial clastics was unlike because uranium concentration was not higher in the margin area of basin where the terrestrial material input was high. As indicated by correlative analysis, the oil source rocks of the Chang 7 member show high gamma-ray values for radioactive well log data that reflect a positive uranium anomaly and are characterized by high resistance, low electric potential and low density. As a result, well log data can be used to identify positive uranium anomalies and spatial distribution of the oil source rocks in the Erdos Basin. The estimation of the total uranium reserves in the Chang 7 member attain 0.8 x 10(8) t. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ozone (O-3) is considered to be a major air pollutant that affects the yield of several sensitive crop species. Its concentration may reach phytotoxic levels several times during the growing season in Eastern Canada. This study was initiated to evaluate the O-3 effects on alfalfa, a major crop species. The objective was to compare the yield and growth parameters of the main alfalfa cultivar used in Quebec, Apica, to a cultivar more tolerant to O-3, Team. Effects on root starch concentrations were also examined as this parameter is an important indicator of alfalfa perennity. The results obtained have shown that the forage yield of Apica was more reduced by O-3 during two growing seasons than the yield of Team. For O-3 concentrations of 20 to 40 nl liter(-1), yield reductions were 14-26% for Apica and 0-20% for Team. Whereas Apica could be considered more susceptible to O-3 than Team, the latter has shown contrasting responses from year to year. This fact suggests that the mechanisms involved in O-3-tolerance could be modulated by environmental conditions. At low O-3 levels, Apica has shown reduced root growth in terms of dry matter and length. However, contrary to the current hypothesis that O-3 would affect more root than shoot growth, we were unable to show a consistent alteration of the biomass allocation between the two. Ozone seems to reduce globally the growth of the whole plants. The greater O-3-tolerance of Team could partly be associated to its capacity to maintain more leaves, to delay their senescence, or to keep a larger leaf:stem ratio under increasing levels of O-3. At the end of the two growing seasons, the amount of starch reserves stored below ground was shown to be reduced by the current O-3 levels. This reduction was mainly associated with a decrease in root biomass under O-3 stress. This result support the hypothesis that O-3 may accelerate alfalfa decline under field conditions.

AB  - The variability in space and in time of gases (He, Rn-222, CO2) in soils might be used for volcano or seismic fault surveillance or in search of hidden mineral deposits, The gases measured in soils or in the weathered layer of the substratum can, however, be strongly altered by environmental conditions, such as atmospheric pressure, soil temperature, or moisture, An accurate knowledge of the influence of environmental conditions is required to decipher information from deeper phenomena in the earth, Variations in radon concentration, used as a gas flow tracer, are modeled using a new approach based on signal processing techniques in order to express impulse responses from multivariable time series, A general formulation is proposed and the inverse problem is solved by calculating the impulse responses of the parameter to be explained versus the variables responsible for the variability of the parameter, Such problems are generally ill posed and regularization methods must be used to develop the pattern, Due to the block-Toeplitz structure of the correlation matrix, large orders can be used, enabling signal processing of time series controlled by the superposition of fast and slow phenomena, Two examples are processed to illustrate this approach. In the first example (Rn-222 in soil gas monitoring over a hidden sulphide deposit), radon concentration is controlled only by moisture and temperature, not by atmospheric pressure, The result seems to reveal a diffusive behavior. The impulse response of Rn-222 concentration versus rainfall exhibits a great variability, possibly due to the opening of cracks in the surface, the effect being still noticeable 20 days after the rainfall, In the second example (Rn-222 in a thermal anomaly at summit of Etna volcano), where radon concentration is controlled by soil temperature and atmospheric pressure, the result indicates a convective/advective flow. Radon flux collapsed for 1 day probably due to a break in the rising gas column, In 1993, dramatic increases of signal were recorded for a few hours; such increases are interpreted as gas pulses not related with local seismicity.

AB  - Freshwater lakes provide many important ecosystem functions and services to support biodiversity and human well-being. Proximal and remote sensing methods represent an efficient approach to derive water quality indicators such as optically active substances (OAS). Measurements of above-ground remote and in situ proximal sensors, however, are limited to observations of the uppermost water layer. We tested a hyperspectral imaging system, customized for underwater applications, with the aim to assess concentrations of chlorophyll a (CHLa) and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the water columns of four freshwater lakes with different trophic conditions in Central Germany. We established a measurement protocol that allowed consistent reflectance retrievals at multiple depths within the water column independent of ambient illumination conditions. Imaging information from the camera proved beneficial for an optimized extraction of spectral information since low signal areas in the sensor's field of view, e.g., due to non-uniform illumination, and other interfering elements, could be removed from the measured reflectance signal for each layer. Predictive hyperspectral models, based on the 470 nm-850 nm reflectance signal, yielded estimates of both water quality parameters (R-2 = 0.94, RMSE = 8.9 mu g L-1 for CHLa; R-2 = 0.75, RMSE = 0.22 m(-1) for CDOM) that were more accurate than commonly applied waveband indices (R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 13.2 mu g L-1 for CHLa; R-2 = 0.66, RMSE = 0.25 m(-1) for CDOM). Underwater hyperspectral imaging could thus facilitate future water monitoring efforts through the acquisition of consistent spectral reflectance measurements or derived water quality parameters along the water column, which has the potential to improve the link between above-surface proximal and remote sensing observations and in situ point-based water probe measurements for ground truthing or to resolve the vertical distribution of OAS.

AB  - Coral reefs are declining globally as climate change and local water quality press environmental conditions beyond the physiological tolerances of holobionts-the collective of the host and its microbial symbionts. To assess the relationship between symbiont composition and holobiont stress tolerance, community diversity metrics were quantified for dinoflagellate endosymbionts (Family: Symbiodiniaceae) from eight Acropora millepora genets that thrived under or responded poorly to various stressors. These eight selected genets represent the upper and lower tails of the response distribution of 40 coral genets that were exposed to four stress treatments (and control conditions) in a 10-day experiment. Specifically, four 'best performer' coral genets were analyzed at the end of the experiment because they survived high temperature, high pCO(2), bacterial exposure, or combined stressors, whereas four 'worst performer' genets were characterized because they experienced substantial mortality under these stressors. At the end of the experiment, seven of eight coral genets mainly hosted Cladocopium symbionts, whereas the eighth genet was dominated by both Cladocopium and Durusdinium symbionts. Symbiodiniaceae alpha and beta diversity were higher in worst performing genets than in best performing genets. Symbiont communities in worst performers also differed more after stress exposure relative to their controls (based on normalized proportional differences in beta diversity), than did best performers. A generalized joint attribute model estimated the influence of host genet and treatment on Symbiodiniaceae community composition and identified strong associations among particular symbionts and host genet performance, as well as weaker associations with treatment. Although dominant symbiont physiology and function contribute to host performance, these findings emphasize the importance of symbiont community diversity and stochasticity as components of host performance. Our findings also suggest that symbiont community diversity metrics may function as indicators of resilience and have potential applications in diverse disciplines from climate change adaptation to agriculture and medicine.

AB  - Global changes occurring under different environmental conditions have changed stand competition, as well as nutrient and light availability, which has resulted in changes in productivity. Therefore, in the present study, the characteristics of tree-ring width formation of the prevailing Lithuanian tree species, Norway spruce, Scots pine and silver and downy birch, and key factors resulting in their differences during the last 36-year period were investigated at forest sites located on poor mineral oligotrophic and on nutrient-rich organic mesoeutrophic soils. The aim of the study was as follows: first, to separately detect the maximum possible seasonal effect of three groups of variables - meteorology, acidifying pollutants and surface ozone on the stem basal area increment (BAI) of the evaluated tree species; second, to assess the significance of each group of variables affecting the BAI of these tree species integrally with the remaining groups of variables. Norway spruce was found to be well adapted to recent environmental changes, which makes it one of the most favourable tree species for silviculture in the northeastern part of Europe. The rapid increases recorded in growth intensity since 1980 were attributed to the increase in air temperature, precipitation amount, nitrogen deposition during the vegetative stage and reductions in SO2 concentrations and S deposition. Scots pine demonstrated the highest level of resilience and capacity to adapt to recent global changes because its reaction to both negative and favourable environmental factors was best expressed. Silver and downy birch tree reactions to the effects of air concentrations of acidifying compounds, their deposition and surface ozone concentrations were the least expressed; however, a significant decline in growth intensity indicated that these tree species experienced a reduced resistance to recent changes in environmental conditions in the mature and over-mature age groups.

AB  - This review provides a comparative analysis on the unenriched and alternative cage systems used in commercial egg production as required by the directive (99/74/EC) of the EU Council on animal welfare in terms of technical performance indicators, distribution of cost items, egg sales revenue, and profitability. Unenriched (conventional) cages are commonly used in Turkey. However these cages don't provide for the laying hens natural needs. The comparison was taken from data regarding Lohmann Brown Classic and Lohmann LSL Classic laying hybrids kept in two caging systems. The rearing period was composed of 399 days starting when 16-week-old commercial pullets were put into unenriched and alternative cage systems and ending at the end of their 73rd weeks of age when laying hens were removed from production. The average shares of the some important cost items in the total cost in the production period were calculated to be as follows for unenriched and alternative cage systems, respectively: pullet 22.17% and 21.17%; feed 61.31% and 58.29%; labour 2.67% and 2.55%; veterinary and health 0.74% and 0.98%; egg packaging 3.23% and 3.48%; maintenance and repair expenses 1.50% and 2.29%; and depreciation costs 5.48% and 8.35%. The average cost of producing one egg was found to be 0.094 US$ and 0.097 US $, respectively. It was determined that investment costs in alternative cage systems was 14.93% higher and the production cost per hen was 2.03% higher than that in unenriched cage systems. In Turkey, on January 1, 2023, all systems will be converted to alternative cages. Investment amounts and production costs for the alternative cage systems are very important in this transformation process. Therefore the present review is to examine the available information on the production data of laying hens reared in the unenriched and alternative cages and to make economic feasibility conclusions under Turkey conditions.

AB  - Many parks in the city of Sao Paulo contain remnants of Atlantic Forest. Of the 30 municipal parks in the South of the city, we investigated two in this study (Santo Dias Park and Shangrila Park) in order to survey their mosquito fauna and investigate the presence of potential bioindicators of environmental conditions and vectors of human pathogens. Mosquitoes were collected monthly between March 2011 and February 2012 using aspirators, Shannon and CDC traps for adult mosquitoes and larval dippers and suction samplers for immature forms. Sampling effort was evaluated by plotting a species accumulation curve, and total richness was estimated using the first-order jackknife. To compare the diversity between the two parks Shannon and Simpson diversity indexes were calculated. Species similarity was compared by the Sorensen similarity index. In all, 8,850 specimens were sampled in both parks. Collections in Santo Dias Park yielded 1,577 adult mosquitoes and 658 immature individuals distributed in seven genera (Aedes, Anopheles, Culex, Limatus, Mansonia, Toxorhynchites and Wyeomyia) and 27 taxonomic units. Among the adult mosquitoes collected, Culex nigripalpus. and Aedes fluviatilis were the most abundant, while the most abundant immature forms were Cx. imitator, Wy. davisi, Wy. galvaoi and Ae. albopictus. Collections in Shangrila Park yielded 4,952 adult specimens and 1,663 immature forms distributed in eight genera (Aedes, Anopheles, Culex, Limatus, Mansonia, Toxorhynchites, Uranotaenia and Wyeomyia) and 36 taxonomic units. Species accumulation curves in both parks were close to the asymptote, and the total richness estimate was close to the observed richness. Although the observed species richness was higher in the Shangrila Park, there was no statistically significant difference between the diversity indexes measured. Regarding species composition, the two sites shared 16 species, including those of epidemiological importance such as Culex nigripalpus, Cx. quinquefasciatus, Aedes albopictus and Ae. aegypti. As some of the mosquito taxa found are bioindicators of environmental conditions and have epidemiological potential to carry pathogens, we recommend that urban parks should be included in official mosquito surveillance programs, and regular surveys carried out to detect circulating arboviruses.

Szczecin, Poland, ISNN 0749-0208
   The aim of this study was to show the use of computer modeling as an assessment tool of sanitary sewage pollution in the Estuarine Complex of Paranagua, Brazil, thereby contributing to the solution of environmental problems. Computer modeling enables the monitoring of water quality parameters in the rivers and the bay and seeks solutions to serious problems related to the quality of life and environmental health in regions subjected to sanitary sewage contamination. The study presents a simulation of dissolved oxygen (DO) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) concentrations, according to SisBAHIA (R), used as indicators of organic matter in a body of water, applied to the western portion of the Paranagua Estuarine Complex, an area with high pollution potential. The simulations were carried out for the current situation, considering as boundary condition the concentrations measured in the rivers and the values estimated from the resident population and for a situation projected for the year 2015, taking into account the population increase and its implications in pollution loads. These simulations allow an assessment of the environmental impacts that the discharge of sanitary waste in the rivers has on the bay, a study of the best treatment solutions or elimination strategies and the development of specific monitoring levels for future situations, such as the best location for establishing measuring stations. The results show that sewage released into rivers and channels reach the bay, accumulate in the regions near the estuaries and compromise the water quality of Paranagua Bay; in other regions the damage is less. For the year 2015, the conditions are aggravated, with a worsening of water quality in the western part of the Paranagua Estuarine Complex.

AB  - To determine the extent of successful restoration of native savanna vegetation at The Sandhi Ils, an unusual and biodiversityrich habitat in the Ottawa Valley, we gathered information from quadrats along transects so as to compare a restored clearing with the surrounding plantation. We provide an indication of success with respect to amount of effort and provide an example of some considerations and procedures for estimating success. With a minimum effort of tree cutting and bulldozing, removal of pine duff and litter, that is estimated to have required five people over a period of less than two weeks, a hectare was successfully restored to pre-settlement savannah vegetation. Apart from a limited seeding effort following the removal of planted trees, the re-establishment of native vegetation proceeded naturally, and it was likely aided by dispersal of seed from adjacent remnant vegetation along paths and firebreaks in the vicinity. Biodiversity, based on number of species and various indices, was substantially greater in the restored clearing than in the adjacent Red Pine p1 station. The semi-open Jack Pine plantation accommodated species of both shaded and open habitats and diversity approached that of the clearing. However, some species such as blueberry were in poor condition in the plantation, generally not producing flowers or fruit. In addition the non-dominant vegetation was much less of the cover. In the restored area there were more regionally rare species and much greater development of flowering herbaceous species and shrubs. Orthopteran insects, a useful indicator group of plant feeding species, had much higher diversity and abundance in the restored area. Savannah and natural sand barren that have been largely destroyed by plantation forestry can be restored successfully and inexpensively, and there is thus no reason why such restorations should not include large areas and be implemented widely. Among the tools for evaluating success are historical descriptions and various measures of biodiversity and vegetation condition.

AB  - Knowing which environmental characteristics constrain forest understory species' distribution and reproduction can inform conservation decisions about habitat management and locations for reintroduction efforts. Differential plant performance is common in varying environmental conditions, such as levels of canopy closure. Actaea elata (tall bugbane) is a rare, perennial, forest understory herb found from Oregon to British Columbia. Populations throughout this species' range commonly occur in managed forests. We assessed the importance of environmental variation on the distribution and flowering of A. elato at both microhabitat and site-level scales. At four sites encompassing a variety of forest types, we measured several biotic and abiotic variables at vegetative and reproductive plants, as well as at random points. We measured these same variables at three sites where A. elata has been extirpated. Within occupied sites, reproductive plants were more likely to be located in canopy gaps than were vegetative plants. Both vegetative and reproductive plants were more likely to be found in areas of high herb cover compared to random points. These results indicate that gaps in the canopy may be critical for this species' ability to reproduce, but survival may be possible in a broader range of forest understory conditions (similar to other co-occurring herb species). Random points at extirpated and occupied sites both tended to be located in areas of lower canopy openness and moisture availability than points in occupied sites where A. elata was present. Extirpated sites were either densely forested or clearcut, while occupied sites contained stands of intermediate density. Circaea alpina, Geranium robertianum, and Lactuca muralis were indicator species for A. elato and normally indicate moist soils, with Circaea alpina being a strong indicator of the presence of flowering A. elata. Taken together, our results suggest that maintenance of canopy gaps is important to promote flowering, and understory species that indicate moist sites, particularly Circaea alpina, can be used as aids to locate new populations of A. elata.

AB  - Aromatic biomarkers have been analysed for source, depositional environment, maturity and secondary migration in crude oils from different formations of Paleocene to Eocene age in the Ahmedabad-Mehsana Block of North Cambay Basin and the Broach Block of South Cambay Basin. North Cambay Basin oils are characterized by a high abundance of 1,2,5- and 1,2,7-trimethylnaphthalenes (TMN) and low to medium ratio of dibenzothiophene/phenanthrene and low ratio of pristane/phytane indicates that these oils have been derived from a source containing predominantly higher plants, and that the organic matter was deposited in restricted marine or lacustrine environments in anoxic to suboxic conditions. The relative abundance of 1,2,7-TMN suggests that it was derived from the structural degradation of oleanane type triterpenoids present in angiosperms. South Cambay Basin oils are less abundant in 1,2,5- and 1,2,7-TMNs and low ratio of dibenzothiophene/phenanthrene and high ratio of pristane/phytane indicating that the oils were derived from higher plant source organic matter deposited under marine or fluvial deltaic environment in oxic conditions. Maturity sensitive ratios based on phenanthrene, naphthalene, dibenzothiophene and their alkyl substituted isomers have been used to calculate the equivalent vitrinite reflectance. These parameters indicate a wide range of thermal maturity of the oils ranging from 0.60% to 0.93% VRc. Methylphenanthrene index and methyldibenzothiophene ratios indicate that the maturity of North and South Cambay Basin oils are different. The North Cambay Basin oils are less mature than South Cambay Basin oils. Pyrrolic nitrogen distribution indicates that the alkylated carbazoles and benzocarbazoles are more abundant in South Cambay Basin oils as compared to North Cambay Basin oils. These data indicate that North Cambay Basin oils are less migrated compared to South Cambay Basin oils. This systematic investigation of the aromatic biomarkers in oils of Cambay Basin has resulted in a new generation, migration, and entrapment model that has led to the development of new exploration leads.

AB  - Banana monocultures (Musa spp., AAA, Cavendish sub-group cv. Grande Naine) can have a detrimental impact on the environment. In these agro-systems, pesticide treatments can lead to surface and groundwater pollution, as is the case in the tropical insular conditions of the French West Indies. Using models to design alternative cropping systems is of growing interest but most of the research work has been concentrated on annual crops and most often in temperate climate. A specific model called SIMBA was built to assess environmental risks under a large range of cropping techniques and to help design more sustainable cropping systems. SIMBA simulates banana-cropping systems at field level over several cropping cycles. It includes sub-models that simulate soil structure, water balance, root nematode populations, yield, and economic outputs with a sound balance between representing the major phenomena well and keeping the model simple to reduce the parameterization costs in a large range of conditions. Agro-environmental indicators generated by the model make it possible to assess the major potential environmental impacts. The model has been developed and calibrated in Guadeloupe and Martinique and is used to draw up practical recommendations for farmers and for virtual experiments of agro-technological innovations or field management strategies. The structure of SIMBA is presented and a methodology is proposed for designing sustainable banana-based cropping systems using the model. SIMBA has been evaluated in a broad range of cropping systems in Guadeloupe by comparing model estimates to data collected in field experiments and surveys. Simulations lead to trends in rotation-based cropping systems characterized by systems that can be considered as intensive for profit evaluation, and combinations of frequent replanting, low nematicide application, no ploughing, and low fertilization level, for environmental evaluation. Simulations performed to optimize the replanting decision rule showed that relatively frequent replanting is good for profit while low frequency replantations (over four banana cycles) give a better environmental evaluation.

AB  - Age-related decline in glucose processing and the associated progressively higher circulating glucose levels are considered well-established biological aging phenomena. However, their occurrence in non-Westernized populations characterized by less mechanization and dietary processing has not been well-studied. This research extends evaluation of lifestyle conditions of diet and physical activity beyond those of Westernized areas and examines aging patterns in blood glucose among rural Yucatec Maya. The purpose is to investigate whether deteriorating glucose processing is intrinsic to human aging, while controlling for body composition in a non-Westernized setting. Data were gathered from 60 nondiabetic Maya women, 40-85 years of age, living in 16 rural villages around Merida, Yucatan. Information regarding personal history, diet, and physical activity was collected through inter-views. Body composition was assessed through anthropometric and derived indicators of body size, fat distribution, body mass index, intra-abdominal fat, and total fat and fat-free masses. Glycemia was measured through microvenous samples analyzed for glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and fructosamine, to demonstrate average circulating glucose under customary living conditions. As indicated by glycation, average glycemia is not higher in older Maya females (age group F for HbA(1c) = 0.88, P > 0.05; age group F for fructosamine = 0.38, P > 0.05). Further, correlations between age and HbA(1c) (r = -0.13, P > 0.05) and fructosamine (r = -0.10, P > 0.05) are negative and not significant. The absence of significant, positive age associations with HbA(1c) and fructosamine persists when effects of body composition are taken into account. Thus, decline in glucose regulation does not appear to be a feature of aging in this non-Westernized sample, suggesting that age-related deterioration in glucose processing is not universal among human populations. Results suggest that relationships of age with glycemia are linked to lifestyle differences. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - This review aims to describe the nutritional and non-nutritional factors that may affect parturition and dystocia in sheep. Dystocia is associated with fetopelvic disproportion, uterine inertia, failure of the cervix to fully dilate, malpresentation and disease or congenital defects in lambs. Dystocia can result in lambs that are born dead, or lambs that survive parturition but sustain birth injury including central nervous system damage. Dystocia risk is increased with high or low birthweight lambs, high (fat) or low liveweight ewes, and small first parity ewes. Other factors implicated include low muscle glycogen, pregnancy toxaemia, mineral imbalance causing hypocalcaemia, and a lack of antioxidant nutrients. Addressing these risks requires differential nutritional management for single and multiple bearing ewes. There is also evidence for stress and environmentally related dystocia. The stress related hormones cortisol, adrenaline and ACTH play a major role in the initiation and control of parturition in the sheep indicating a need for adequate supervision during lambing, provision of adequate feed and shelter at the lambing site, and small flock size to reduce physical and environmental stress. Hormonal control of parturition can be further disrupted by xenoestrogens or phytoestrogens in clovers and medics. Oestrogenic plants are still widely grown in mixed pastures but should be not be grazed by pregnant ewes. There is clearly a genetic component to dystocia. This is partly explained by incompatibility in physical size and dimensions of the ram, ewe and lamb. A rapid reduction in dystocia through direct genetic selection is problematic with low heritability of dystocia and some of its indicator traits such as lambing ease. This review provides broad interpretation of the literature, but conclusions are not definitive with widespread inconsistency in reported results. Further research is required to investigate dystocia under commercial production conditions, and this should be complemented by focussed studies under controlled conditions. Priorities include defining the fitness of the ewe to lamb, the role of stress and environment on parturition and the use of indicator traits to select for ease of birth.

AB  - This paper presents the modelling and subsequent validation of the thermal buoyancy characteristics for an experimental mixed-mode natural convection solar crop dryer (MNCSCDBH) for three plenum inlet opening to vent outlet opening ratios of 1:1, 1:1.3 and 1:1.5 selected for the purpose of this study. The simulation follows the authors' experimental study on the effect of varying the plenum inlet width and vent outlet width on thermal buoyancy performance of the MNCSCDBH for three different heating scenarios namely; solar heating, back up heating and hybrid heating. Mathematical models, capable of predicting the thermal buoyancy performance of the MNCSCDBH for the three selected heating modes were formulated by coupling energy balance equations on the components of the air-heater with energy balance for the air. The models were based on a one-dimensional steady-state operation of the dryer. A MATLAB code was developed and used to predict the performance of the dryer under no load conditions. The temperature predictions were observed to be accurate within 0.03% to 9.3% for solar heating mode, 0.20% to 7.49% for backup heating mode, and 0.03% to 12.8% for hybrid heating modes, respectively. Even though some discrepancies were found between the experimental performance indicators and their corresponding values predicted by the model as presented in this study, the code can be used in predicting the ventilation performance of the dryer under no load conditions with a general prediction to within 0.03% to 12.8% relative difference of the observed outlet velocity and critical system temperature values. The validation results show that the simulation code can serve as an effective tool for comparing and refining the designs of the MNCSCDBH for optimum drying performance. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms of groundwater recharge and flow in periglacial environments remains enigmatic. Methane releases from melting permafrost in a warming world are a hot topic in contemporary climate research. Noble gas analyses have been proposed to study methane-driven degassing in lakes as well as in permafrost terrains. The Ledo-Paniselian aquifer is shown to provide an analogue for such processes, from the last period of global warming after the LGM. It is postulated that recharge from methane bubbling thermokarst lakes to groundwater took place, and can be recognized by a specific signature in the groundwater. The Ledo-Paniselian aquifer offers unique opportunities to study periglacial groundwater recharge during the LGM, as it was located in the permanent permafrost area to the south of the ice sheet at that time. It contains Holocene and Pleistocene groundwaters, which are separated by a recharge gap, referring to permafrost during the LGM. This is confirmed by noble gas temperature (NGT) data. In the samples immediately upstream of this gap, several potential indicators for the specific methanogenic recharge conditions from thawing permafrost are being put forward, based on noble gases, chemical and isotopic data.
   Immediately upstream of the age gap, groundwaters show strikingly deviating HCO3-, SO42-, delta C-13, delta O-18 and delta H-2 compared to the regional trend, while their C-14 model ages are too young, and NGTs seem too high. These samples are affected by degassing, which is not an artefact of sampling, and which, according to their radiogenic helium concentrations, occurred early on, during recharge or shortly thereafter. The origin of these samples could be explained by the conditions prevailing as the permafrost thawed, and groundwater recharge could resume. It is inferred that the degassed samples were infiltrated during or shortly after the LGM, when recharge from methane bubbling thermokarst lakes to groundwater took place, associated to the melting permafrost.

AB  - An extended assumption in maize breeding is that potential yield (Upsilon(max)) predicts yield (Upsilon) under stress conditions (here, Upsilon(min)) justifying genotypic selection under moderately high-yielding environments. Moreover, it has been postulated that Upsilon tolerance to stress is relatively independent on the main stress factor involved in Upsilon reduction (cross-tolerance). We carried out an analysis of four datasets from Argentine Federated Farmers network (2010/11, 2011/12 and 2012/13, 11 locations and >20 hybrids) and the National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA) (12 locations, 13 hybrids). No consistent relation was detected between Upsilon(max) and Upsilon(min) (r(2) < 0.14) in each dataset. Upsilon stability assessed by the coefficient of variation positively related to Upsilon (r(2) > 0.68 across datasets) but not to Upsilon(max). Depending on the dataset, 40-70% of the hybrids had a varying Upsilon performance (from worse to better) compared with the average of all hybrids, with no consistent advantage of hybrids with high Upsilon(max) within the environmental range explored in the dataset. In order to assess the existence of cross-tolerance, INTA environments were divided into two groups: water-limited environments and environments exposed to other(s) type(s) of stress. While a relation was found between average yields (r(2) = 0.64) of each hybrid in both environments, there was no relation for ratability (r(2) = 0.07). Taken together, our results suggest that: (i) a high Upsilon(max) is not a good indicator of high Upsilon tolerance under stressful conditions; (ii) Upsilon tolerance is related to high rstability, which may or may not involve a Upsilon penalty under high-yielding environments; (iii) around 50% of the genotypes have Upsilon performance that is not consistently worse or better than the average throughout the range of environments explored and (iv) cross-tolerance to stress is a peculiar trait of some hybrids, but most of the hybrids analysed here do not show cross-tolerance.

AB  - After the ban of battery cages in 1988, a welfare control programme for laying hens was developed in Sweden. Its goal was to monitor and ensure that animal welfare was not negatively affected by the new housing systems. The present observational study provides an overview of the current welfare status of commercial layer flocks in Sweden and explores the complexity of welfare aspects by investigating and interpreting the inter-relationships between housing system, production type (i.e. organic or conventional), facilities, management and animal welfare indicators. For this purpose, a machine learning procedure referred to as structure discovery was applied to data collected through the welfare programme during 2010-2014 in 397 flocks housed in 193 different farms. Seventeen variables were fitted to an Additive Bayesian Network model. The optimal model was identified by an exhaustive search of the data iterated across incremental parent limits, accounting for prior knowledge about causality, potential over-dispersion and clustering. The resulting Directed Acyclic Graph shows the inter-relationships among the variables. The animal-based welfare indicators included in this study - flock mortality, feather condition and mite infestation - were indirectly associated with each other. Of these, severe mite infestations were rare (4% of inspected flocks) and mortality was below the acceptable threshold (< 0.6%). Feather condition scored unsatisfactory in 21% of the inspected flocks; however, it seemed to be only associated to the age of the flock, ruling out any direct connection with managerial and housing variables. The environment-based welfare indicators - lighting and air quality - were an issue in 5 and 8% of the flocks, respectively, and showed a complex inter-relationship with several managerial and housing variables leaving room for several options for intervention. Additive Bayesian Network modelling outlined graphically the underlying process that generated the observed data. In contrast to ordinary regression, it aimed at accounting for conditional independency among variables, facilitating causal interpretation.

AB  - Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) were determined in activated sludge, which was exposed to endogenous conditions for 36 days and contained a wide diversity of organisms across several trophic levels. The aim of this study was to elucidate the fluctuation of delta N-13 and delta N-15 through trophic transfer in the microbial consortia. The sludge was evaluated in view of sludge mass, bacterial community, higher trophic organisms, sludge delta C-13 and delta N-15, and delta N-15 and delta O-18 of nitrate. The results show that the activated sludge became more enriched with N-15 as degradation proceeded. Eventually, the mixed liquor volatile suspended solid concentrations in the activated sludge decreased from 1610 to 710 mg/L and the delta N-15 of the sludge increased from 8.3%o to 10.8%0. In contrast, the delta C-13 values of the sludge were stable. Microscope observations confirmed that consumers such as Rotifera, Tardigrada and Annelida (Aelosoma sp.) were present in the activated sludge for the entire operational period. The abundance of those organisms drastically changed during the operational periods, and the diversity in bacterial community also changed, resulting in community succession. Changes in biotic community, reduction in sludge mass, and increase in delta N-15 of the sludge occurred during the sludge degradation processes. This implies that the sludge degradation was partly caused by the trophic conversion of the sludge-derived nitrogen in the food web. The delta N-15 of the sludge can be used as an indicator of the sludge degradation through trophic transfer in wastewater treatment reactors. These findings provide new insights into understanding trophic transfer during microbial community succession and the effects of the feeding process on sludge degradation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Zinc is an essential element for maintaining proper functions of animal bodies. It is a component of many hormones and enzymes and a participant in the metabolism of carbohydrates or the synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins. Animal tissues typically contain 10-200 mg of zinc kg(-1). Most of this amount (98%) can be found inside the cells. Zinc toxicity is associated mainly with the secondary copper deficit. The aim of the present investigation has been to assess zinc contamination of the environment with coats of domestic and feral cats being the indicator. Urban feral cats are synantrophic animals, living in an urbanized environment and scavenging on human food waste. Thus, they can be treated as a bioinclicator of the presence of certain elements in the environment. Analyses of the zinc content in cats' hair have been performed to check whether the zinc level is connected with cats' coat colour, living conditions and gender. The coat samples were collected from the middle abdominal region. Then they were degreased and mineralized in a microwave apparatus, in concentrated nitric acid under increased pressure. The zinc content was determined by the ICP-OES method. The mean zinc content in the investigated coat samples was 238.9 mg kg(-1). The lowest zinc content was observed in white hair and the highest - in tortoiseshell hair. The results have confirmed that the content of zinc depends on the hair saturation with melanin. Statistical analysis has shown significant differences between the group of female cats living in the wild (268.09 mg kg(-1)) and the group of breeding female cats (214.49 rag kg(-1)) at p=0.05. A higher zinc content was observed in the group of older cats. The mean values did not differ from mean values of the zinc content in the coat and hair of other mammals. Considering the living conditions of the animals, the highest zinc content was noted in the group of animals living in the wild (feral ones).

AB  - Seasonal behaviour of NO3- in surface water is often used as an indicator on a catchment's ability to retain N from atmospheric deposition. In this paper, we classify 12 pristine sites (five streams and seven lakes) in southernmost Norway according to the N saturation stage concept. All examined sites were acid-sensitive and had annual mean NO3- concentrations in the range 6-36 mueq L-1. At lake sites with relatively long water residence times, hydrology will have a damping effect on the seasonal NO3- oscillations in the outlet streams. Under given runoff conditions (1.0-2.2 m yr(-1)), the seasonal NO3- pattern was clearly affected when lake: catchment area ratios exceeded 0.15 and the total residence time of lakes in the catchments exceeded 0.3 yr. In such cases, annual mean NO3- concentration rather than seasonal variations may be the better indicator of N saturation. To account for this we propose a set of supplementary criteria for such lake systems, defining limit values for annual mean NO3- concentrations within each stage class. Before being applied on a broader scale, however, we recommend an examination of additional lake-dominated catchments representing a larger gradient in ecosystem types, N deposition levels and hydrologic regimes. When applying the supplementary criteria on the Norwegian sites, two were classified as stage 0 (no saturation), five as stage 1 (early stage of saturation) and five as stage 2 (saturated - moderate N loss). No sites were showing symptoms of stage 3, which characterises watersheds that are net sources of N, rather than sinks. The results indicate a great variability in N retention capacity in the study region, despite the fact that many of the catchments experience relatively uniform N deposition amounts and climatic conditions. This suggests that much of this variability must be due to specific catchment characteristics as e.g. soil type, soil depth, and vegetation cover.

AB  - Soil testing for metal contaminants is a continually evolving process aimed at improving the assessment of environmental and human health hazards associated with heavy metals in soils and plants. A number of challenges present themselves before accurate, reliable and precise contaminant hazard assessment criteria for soils and plants can be made. These include: sampling, extraction and analytical obstacles associated with the determination of trace levels of metals in environmental media; quality assurance and quality control issues associated with both extraction and analytical procedures (especially for metals where non-compliance with regulatory standards may be penalised); and confounding environmental effects (e.g. rooting depth, soil salinity, Eh, pH, plant species, metal species) which limit the usefulness of the relationship between the current tests and actual hazards. These difficulties have combined to produce soil tests for heavy metals often poorly correlated with hazardwhether this be crop uptake of a contaminant (e.g. Cd), or the adverse effects of metals or metalloids on human or environmental health (e.g. As, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Se, Pb, Zn). Assessment of an "available" fraction of a particular soil nutrient is the accepted norm of soil testing for crop nutrition. In many countries, assessment of metal hazard is still inappropriately based on the total soil metal concentration, despite increasing recognition that the concept of elemental availability is just as relevant for environmental hazard as for crop nutrition. Tests that aim to assess metal "bioavailability" are now gaining widespread acceptance by regulators as a means to characterise hazards from contaminants in soil. While a significant advance on the use of total metal concentrations, the concept raises difficulties in providing an adequate assessment of potential risk, due to changes in environmental conditions which affect bioavailability, e.g. soil pH, soil organic matter content. This chapter summarises current soil testing methodologies for metal contaminants and examines new concepts and procedures for assessing hazards from metal contamination of soils.

AB  - Sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) has been proven to serve as a proxy of photosynthesis activity and therefore, as an early indicator of physiological alterations for global monitoring of vegetation. However, the interpretation of SIF over different spatial resolutions is critical to bridge the existing gap between local and global scales. This study provides insight into the influence of scene components, and forest structure and composition on the quantification of the red and far-red fluorescence signal as an early indicator of forest decline. The experiments were conducted over an oak forest (Quercus ilex) affected by water stress and Phytophthora infection in the southwest of Spain. SIF retrievals through the Fraunhofer Line Depth (FLD) principle with three spectral bands F (FLD3) was assessed using high resolution (60 cm) hyperspectral imagery extracting sunlit crown, full crown and aggregated pixels. Results showed the link between F (FLD3) extracted from sunlit crown pixels and the tree physiological condition in this context of disease infection, yielding significant relationships (r(2) = 0.57, p < 0.01) for midday xylem water potential NO, (r(2) = 0.63, p < 0.001) for the de-epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle (DEPS), and (r(2) = 0.74, p < 0.001) for leaf-level measurements of steady-state fluorescence yield (F-s). In contrast, a poor relationship was obtained when using aggregated pixels at 30 m spatial resolution, where the relationship between the image-based F (FLD3) and F-s yielded a non-significant relationship (r(2) = 025, p > 0.05). These results demonstrate the need for methods to accurately retrieve crown SIF from aggregated pixels in heterogeneous forest canopies with large physiological variability among individual trees. This aspect is critical where structural canopy variations and the direct influence of background and shadows affect the SIF amplitude masking the natural variations caused by physiological condition. FluorFLIGHT, a modified version of the three dimensional (3-D) radiative transfer model FLIGHT was developed for this work, enabling the simulation of canopy radiance and reflectance including fluorescence at different spatial resolutions, such as may be derived from proposed satellite missions such as FLEX, and accounting for canopy structure and varying percentage cover. The 3-D modelling approach proposed here significantly improved the relationship between F-s and F (FLD3) extracted from aggregated pixels (r2 = 0.70, p < 0.001), performing better than when aggregation effects were not considered (r2 = 0.42, p < 0.01). The FluorFLIGHT model used in this study improved the retrieval of SIF from aggregated pixels as a function of fractional cover, Leaf Area Index and chlorophyll content yielding significant relationships between F-s ground-data measurements and fluorescence quantum yield estimated with FluorFLIGHT at p < 0.01 (r(2) = 0.79). The methodology presented here using FluorFLIGHT also demonstrated its capabilities for mapping SIF at the tree level for single tree assessment of forest physiological condition in the context of early disease detection.

AB  - The effects of climate and topography on soil physico-chemical and microbial parameters were studied along an extensive latitudinal climate gradient in the Coastal Cordillera of Chile (26 degrees-38 degrees S). The study sites encompass arid (Pan de Azucar), semiarid (Santa Gracia), mediterranean (La Campana) and humid (Nahuelbuta) climates and vegetation, ranging from arid desert, dominated by biological soil crusts (biocrusts), semiarid shrubland and mediterranean sclerophyllous forest, where biocrusts are present but do have a seasonal pattern to temperate-mixed forest, where biocrusts only occur as an early pioneering development stage after disturbance. All soils originate from granitic parent materials and show very strong differences in pedogenesis intensity and soil depth.
   Most of the investigated physical, chemical and microbiological soil properties showed distinct trends along the climate gradient. Further, abrupt changes between the arid northernmost study site and the other semi-arid to humid sites can be shown, which indicate non-linearity and thresholds along the climate gradient. Clay and total organic carbon contents (TOC) as well as Ah horizons and solum depths increased from arid to humid climates, whereas bulk density (BD), pH values and base saturation (BS) decreased. These properties demonstrate the accumulation of organic matter, clay formation and element leaching as key-pedogenic processes with increasing humidity. However, the soils in the northern arid climate do not follow this overall latitudinal trend, because texture and BD are largely controlled by aeolian input of dust and sea salts spray followed by the formation of secondary evaporate minerals. Total soil DNA concentrations and TOC increased from arid to humid sites, while areal coverage by biocrusts exhibited an opposite trend. Relative bacterial and archaeal abundances were lower in the arid site, but for the other sites the local variability exceeds the variability along the climate gradient. Differences in soil properties between topographic positions were most pronounced at the study sites with the mediterranean and humid climate, whereas microbial abundances were independent on topography across all study sites. In general, the regional climate is the strongest controlling factor for pedogenesis and microbial parameters in soils developed from the same parent material. Topographic position along individual slopes of limited length augmented this effect only under humid conditions, where water erosion likely relocated particles and elements downward. The change from alkaline to neutral soil pH between the arid and the semi-arid site coincided with qualitative differences in soil formation as well as microbial habitats. This also reflects non-linear relationships of pedogenic and microbial processes in soils depending on climate with a sharp threshold between arid and semi-arid conditions. Therefore, the soils on the transition between arid and semi-arid conditions are especially sensitive and may be well used as indicators of long and medium-term climate changes. Concluding, the unique latitudinal precipitation gradient in the Coastal Cordillera of Chile is predestined to investigate the effects of the main soil forming factor - climate - on pedogenic processes.

This study performed biometric analysis and assessed reproductive dynamics of the blue land crab Cardisoma guanhumi in Acau-Goiana Extractive Reserve, a coastal marine protected area in northeast Brazil. From January 2019 to December 2020, biometric data were evaluated from 539 captured individuals by an artisanal trap. In addition, male gonads and hepatopancreas were removed and fixed in formalin solution to analyse morphological reproductive indicators by gonadal (GSI) and hepatosomatic (HSI) index calculation. In summary, the population of blue land crab showed 322 males and 217 females. We observed a difference in variation of mean seasonal carapace width (54.73-56.67 mm). The condition factor ranged from 0.97 to 1.07, showing significant differences between the years and the seasons with high values observed in the dry season in 2019 and 2020. The weight-length relationships showed negative allometric growth for males (b = 2.586, a = 0.010) and females (b = 2.229, a = 0.291). The monthly distribution of the hepatosomatic (HSI) index did not show a clear annual pattern, but GSI differed between the months, indicating two seasonal groupings of Jan-Feb and May-August-Nov. The reproductive indicators of C. guanhumi evaluated here may indicate that the environmental influence and fishing pressure are the main factors that drive its reproductive seasons. Thus, it is noteworthy to indicate conservation efforts from January to April, when should be considered the breeding season for the species. In addition, long-term monitoring in the Extractive Reserve Acau-Goiana must be considered for studies of population structure and gene flow of Cardisoma guanhumi, prioritizing the preservation of their habitats.

AB  - Habitat disturbance of native forests is currently the major threat to biodiversity conservation. Plant species can be negatively affected as a result of landscape conversion; thus, it is essential to detect the potential effects of environmental stress on plant performance using reliable bioindicators of quick, cheap diagnosis. Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) describes the degree of the random differences in shape and size among two sides of a bilateral trait of the organisms and reflects the developmental instability of an organism, so we can use it to predict the effects on plant fitness. We evaluated the land-use change stress on seed FA levels, seed germination, and the subsequent seedling development of seed produced by trees that occur in an anthropized and a preserved area of seasonally tropical dry forests (STDF) in Brazil. We sampled 10 ten reproductive trees of Enterolobium contortisiliquum of each landscape condition, and then, 100 seeds per each tree were collected. Additionally, 50 seeds were randomly selected for each tree to determine plant fitness. Despite, we found no true FA in the community, the anthropized area had a lower seed nutritional quality and percentage of germination, and higher germination time of seeds produced than in preserved areas. The dry weight of the aerial part of seedlings did not differ between areas. However, root dry weight and total dry weight were higher in seedlings developed from seeds of anthropized than in preserved areas. Our findings show that seeds of E. contortisiliquum are not a sensitive biomarker to detect full stress conditions of habitat disturbance. However, we demonstrate that habitat disturbance negatively affects plant fitness, decreasing germination percentage, and nutritional quality, and increasing germination time. This fact has potential consequences on recruitment, establishment and survival of E. contortisiliquum in regenerating areas of STDF?s in Brazil.

AB  - The use of drought-tolerant cultivars is the most effective approach to cope with the drought stress in chili pepper production. The objectives of the present research were to assess the tolerance indices, and to identify the drought tolerance in 55 curly pepper genotypes. The performance of 55 chili pepper genotypes was screened and compared under drought stressed and non-stress environments using randomized complete blocks design (RCBD) with four replications during 2016 at Sultan Syarif Kasim State Islamic University, Riau, Indonesia. Based on the yield under stress (Y-s) and non-stress environment (Y-NS), fourteen indices of the drought tolerance were formulated. Correlation analysis revealed that yield under stress condition had no significant correlation with the yield under non-stress environment indicating high stress intensity. Therefore, the STI (Stress Tolerance Index), GMP (Geometric Mean Productivity), HM (Harmonic Mean), and MP (Mean productivity) indices could not be used as indicator to screen the drought tolerance in curly pepper genotypes. The principal component analysis showed that SSI and SDI indices were found more reliable as tolerance indicators for selection of droughttolerant genotypes in chili pepper genotypes. Subsequently, bi-plot and cluster analyses separated the 55 chili pepper genotypes into three groups, the first cluster (tolerant group) consisted of the three genotypes i.e. UIN-RFC010, UIN-GM107, and UIN-RFC006, second cluster (semi-tolerant or semi-sensitive genotypes) comprising 11 genotypes i.e. UIN-RFC011, UIN-RFC015, UIN-GKO65M, UIN-RFC002, UIN-GM102, UIN-GK073, UIN-GKO71, UIN-RFC019, UIN-RFC014, UIN-GK072, and UIN-GK098, while the rest of the genotypes were classified into the third cluster (susceptible group). Results further revealed that SSI and SDI indices could be used as selection indicators in curly pepper if the stress conditions are severe. The drought tolerant genotypes identified in this research could be utilized in future breeding program for further improvement in curly pepper.

AB  - Glucose is an important metabolic fuel and circulating levels are tightly regulated in most mammals, but can drop when body fuel reserves become critically low. Glucose is mobilized rapidly from liver and muscle during stress in response to increased circulating cortisol. Blood glucose levels can thus be of value in conservation as an indicator of nutritional status and may be a useful, rapid assessment marker for acute or chronic stress. However, seals show unusual glucose regulation: circulating levels are high and insulin sensitivity is limited. Accurate blood glucose measurement is therefore vital to enable meaningful health and physiological assessments in captive, wild or rehabilitated seals and to explore its utility as a marker of conservation relevance in these animals. Point-of-care devices are simple, portable, relatively cheap and use less blood compared with traditional sampling approaches, making them useful in conservation-related monitoring. We investigated the accuracy of a hand-held glucometer for 'instant' field measurement of blood glucose, compared with blood drawing followed by laboratory testing, in wild grey seals (Halichoerus grypus), a species used as an indicator for Good Environmental Status in European waters. The glucometer showed high precision, but low accuracy, relative to laboratory measurements, and was least accurate at extreme values. It did not provide a reliable alternative to plasma analysis. Poor correlation between methods may be due to suboptimal field conditions, greater and more variable haematocrit, faster erythrocyte settling rate and/or lipaemia in seals. Glucometers must therefore be rigorously tested before use in new species and demographic groups. Sampling, processing and glucose determination methods have major implications for conclusions regarding glucose regulation, and health assessment in seals generally, which is important in species of conservation concern and in development of circulating glucose as a marker of stress or nutritional state for use in management and monitoring.

AB  - To extend our previous research on preservation in situ of organic archaeological remains in wetland soils, physicochemical variables and extracellular enzyme activities (beta-D-glucosidase, phosphatase, and leucine aminopeptidase) were measured in two archaeological wetland soils in northern England, from the soil surface down to 100 cm during two years. These two locations, with a proven potential to contain and preserve archaeo-environmental remains, were of interest because they had different hydrological and land-management history. In addition, for one of the sampling years, the structure of soil bacterial communities was monitored using polymerase chain reaction followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) of 16S rRNA gene-coding fragments amplified from soil DNA, using primers specific for eu bacteria, actinomycetes, and alpha-proteobacteria. The physicochemical monitoring data indicated that at Sutton Common the buried conditions were less stable and more heterogeneous throughout the soil profile than at Hatfield Moor. Extracellular enzyme activities decreased with depth at both sites and higher average enzyme activity was found at Hatfield Moor than at Sutton Common. Phosphatase and leucine aminopeptidase were the most active enzymes throughout the soil profile. Our results indicated that the enzymatic potential for organic matter (OM) degradation at both sites was strongly correlated to pH and OM content in the soil. DGGE patterns for eubacterial, alpha-proteobacteria, and actinomycete populations indicated intra-site changes in community structure with time of sampling and depth. The sampling site with a high and stable water table, Hatfield Moor, showed higher enzyme activities above 50 cm depth and as a consequence had more potential for OM degradation than the site with fluctuating hydrological conditions. These trends provide insight into the potential for biodegradation over time and with depth at these two sites, information that is relevant to the in situ preservation of buried organic archaeological artefacts in wetland soils.

AB  - Ancient braided fluvial systems were affected by a lack of binding vegetation, under variable paleoclimatic conditions, and possibly characterized by unique fluvial styles during the Precambrian. Thus, the paleohydrological investigations are important in interpreting ancient fluvial systems and a comparison of different fluvial styles/systems. This study reports new paleohydrological and sedimentological data from the ca. 1.17 Ga-old fluvial deposits (Svinsaga Formation) in the Fennoscandian Shield, which is a part of the East European Craton. The Mesoproterozoic Svinsaga Formation overlies a major unconformity (sub-Svinsaga unconformity) in the Telemark Supracrustal rocks (southern Norway). The unconformity corresponding to a ca. 170-Ma hiatus (ca. 1347-1170 Ma) and carry evidence for ancient periglacial climatic conditions.
   Eleven different sedimentary lithofacies and five lithofacies associations were recognized from the Svinsaga Formation. The lithofacies assemblages indicate that the formation represents a relatively high-energy braided fluvial environment. Massive breccias, massive and inversely to normally graded conglomerates, stratified sandstones and laminated and rippled mudstones, were transported by traction currents, sediment gravity flows and by suspension. The proximal part of the formation contains blockfield/blockslope accumulations and waning flood-flow cycles. These are overlain by hyperconcentrated and debris flow deposits, and ephemeral high-energy bedforms. The distal part of the formation contains dune bedforms and channel lag deposits, which indicate waning discharge fluctuations.
   The paleohydrological calculations from the channel-fill conglomerates and sandstone bedforms correlate with lithofacies assemblages. The estimation of paleoslope and discharge values supports the presence of a fluvial stream rather than an alluvial fan environment. The stream power and water velocity systematically decreases towards the distal parts of the formation.
   The abundance of the waning flood-flow cycles, ephemeral high-energy sedimentary deposits, and hyperconcentrated and debris flow deposits is a possible indicator of periglacial melt waters in basin margin strike-slip fault evolution. This melt water combined with abundantly available debris from the non-vegetated high-topographic landscape. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent times, trace levels of pharmaceuticals detected in wastewater effluents and surface waters have raised the level of attention around the ultimate fate and the potential persistence of pharmaceuticals in the environment. We have seen the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicines (EMEA) recently include more rigorous environmental fate testing in European Union (EU) Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) guidance to assess the ultimate fate in water/sediment systems. Yet to date, there is little data available that covers the fate of pharmaceuticals in the water/sediment compartment, and little that assess whether current aerobic and anaerobic methods are appropriate for pharmaceuticals. In this study, the biodegradation profiles of 3 Pfizer products were investigated following the latest ERA guidance and its recommendation for OECD 308 water/sediment biodegradation testing. Experiments included C-14-labeled exemestane, azithromycin, and varenicline representing neutral and cationic pharmaceuticals with average K-oc values of 3704, 49 400, and 10 483 respectively. Specific HPLC/radioactive monitoring (RAM) methods were used to profile water and sediment samples for biotransformation products. Binding to sediment, as "non -extractables", was considerable for all three pharmaceuticals, though most notable for the cationic pharmaceuticals varenicline and azithromycin ranging from 52% to 94% at study termination, respectively. In general, for all 3 pharmaceuticals studied, the anaerobic conditions demonstrated less biotransformation and mineralization than the aerobic; though their biotransformation profile (number of metabolites) and amount bound to sediment were similar. Based on these findings and our current understanding of anaerobic biodegradation, we would recommend a tiered approach to the OECD 308 water/sedimenttest: with default testing just for aerobic conditions; and then if needed, anaerobic testing only for those compounds potentially amenable to typical anaerobic processes. We suggest that as a simulation test would be better suited in later tier testing under EU ERA guidance. Inherent biodegradation or die-away tests seem better suited to derive biodegradation rate constants for subsequent environmental modeling of water and sediment compartments.

AB  - Waterborne diseases are still common in developing countries as drinking water sources are contaminated and feasible means to reliably treat and disinfect these waters are not available. Many of these developing countries are in the tropical regions of the world where sunlight is plentiful. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of combining solar radiation and solar heating to disinfect contaminated water using a modified Family Sol*Saver System (FSP). The non-UV transmittable cover sheet of the former FSP system was replaced with an UV transmittable plastic cover sheet to enable more wavelengths of sunlight to treat the water. Disinfection efficiency of both systems was evaluated based on reduction of the natural populations of faecal coliform, E. coli, enterococci, C. perfringens, total heterotrophic bacteria, hydrogen sulphide producing bacteria and FRNA virus. The results showed that under sunny and partly sunny conditions, water was heated to critical temperature (60 degreesC) in both the FSP systems inactivating more than 3 log (99.9%) of the concentrations of faecal coliform and E. colt to undetectable levels of <1 CFU/100mL within 2-5 h exposure to sunlight. However, under cloudy conditions, the two FSP systems did not reduce the concentrations of faecal indicator bacteria to levels of < 1 CFU/100mL. Nonetheless, sufficient evidence was obtained to show that UV radiation of sunlight plus heat worked synergistically to enhance the inactivation of faecal indicator bacteria. The relative log removal of indicator microorganism in the FSP treated water was total heterotrophic bacteria < C. perfringens < F RNA virus < enterococci < E. coli < faecal coliform. In summary, time of exposure to heat and radiation effects of sunlight were important in disinfecting water by solar units. The data indicated that direct radiation of sunlight worked synergistically with solar heating of the water to disinfect the water. Thus, effective disinfection was observed even when the water temperature did not reach 60<degrees>C. Finally, the hydrogen sulphide test is a simple and reliable test that householders can use to determine whether their water had been sufficiently disinfected.

AB  - Simple Summary Behavioural problems, such as injurious pecking, are major welfare concerns in laying hen husbandry. To take adequate measures at the right time, useful information about the occurrence of these problems in a flock can be obtained by examining the hens for feather loss and skin injuries. Although feather loss and injuries can also result from mechanical abrasion or health issues, they provide strong evidence of behavioural problems in a flock, particularly when observed on the back and the tail of the animals. In our study, the behaviour of two genetic strains of laying hens (conventional layers and dual-purpose breeds) was evaluated by means of two different methods for assessing the feathers and the skin on distinct body parts of the animals. One method was a mere visual inspection of the flocks, whereas the other included the capture and handling of individual hens. Damaging behaviour, which resulted in severe feather loss and skin injuries, only occurred in the conventional layers. Both of the methods provided similar results for feather loss and injuries for most of the tested body regions and weeks. Therefore, the mere visual method was sufficient to detect injurious behaviour in laying hens.
   Abstract The assessment of plumage and integument condition in laying hens provides useful information about the occurrence of feather pecking and cannibalism. Although feather loss and skin injuries can result from mechanical abrasion or clinical diseases, they are valid animal-based indicators for behavioural disorders. This particularly applies to damage on the back and tail region of the hens. The aim was to evaluate the behaviour of dual-purpose breeds (Lohmann Dual, LD) and conventional layer hybrids (Lohmann Brown plus, LB+), and to compare a mere visual assessment (Visual Scoring, VSc), with a method involving the handling of individual animals (Hands-on Scoring, HSc). During weekly VSc, the hens' plumage and integument were scored on five body parts. HSc was carried out on seven study days applying the same scoring scale as for VSc. In LB+ hens, minor plumage damage started at 25 weeks and increased to the 71st week. With 99.5% of LB+ showing feather loss to a different extent, the back was the most severely affected body part. In contrast, only between 4.5% and 7% of LD showed minor feather loss at the end of the study. Integument damage reached a peak, with 6% affected LB+ in week 66. Injuries were found only sporadically in LD hens. Spearman's rho for the comparison of plumages scores given in VSc and HSc was >0.90 (p < 0.01) in both hybrids for most of the tested body regions and weeks, except for the breast/belly region. However, VSc and HSc were equally valid for detecting skin injuries of all of the body regions (r(s) > 0.86, p < 0.01). Damaging behaviour only occurred in the LB+ flocks, though both of the genetic strains were kept under the same conditions. The visual scoring method was suitable for detecting both plumage and integument damage.

AB  - Urbanisation can affect mating opportunities and thereby alter inter- and intra-sexual selection pressures on sexual traits. Biotic and abiotic urban conditions can influence an individual's success in pre- and post-copulatory mating, for example through impacts on mate attraction and mate preference, fertilisation success, resource competition or rival interactions. Divergent sexual selection pressures can lead to differences in behavioural, physiological, morphological or life-history traits between urban and non-urban populations, ultimately driving adaptation and speciation. Most studies on urban sexual selection and mating interactions report differences between urban and non-urban populations or correlations between sexual traits and factors associated with increased urbanisation, such as pollution, food availability and risk of predation and parasitism. Here we review the literature on sexual selection and sexual traits in relation to urbanisation or urban-associated conditions. We provide an extensive list of abiotic and biotic factors that can influence processes involved in mating interactions, such as signal production and transmission, mate choice and mating opportunities. We discuss all relevant data through the lens of two, non-mutually exclusive theories on sexual selection, namely indicator and sensory models. Where possible, we indicate whether these models provide the same or different predictions regarding urban-adapted sexual signals and describe different experimental designs that can be useful for the different models as well as to investigate the drivers of sexual selection. We argue that we lack a good understanding of: (i) the factors driving urban sexual selection; (ii) whether reported changes in traits result in adaptive benefits; and (iii) whether these changes reflect a short-term ecological, or long-term evolutionary response. We highlight that urbanisation provides a unique opportunity to study the process and outcomes of sexual selection, but that this requires a highly integrative approach combining experimental and observational work.

AB  - Benthic foraminiferal assemblage distribution and paleoecology were analyzed in two previously studied well-cores (2-MU-1-RJ-ranging from 64.35 to 1.85 m; 2-BG-1-RJ-from 40.50 to 10.50 m) drilled in the central sector of Paraiba do Sul Deltaic Complex (PSDC), RJ, SE Brazil. The assemblages allowed to identify periods of higher and lower marine/continental influence in the study area and to infer events of marine ingressions or regressions during the late Pleistocene, associated with the penultimate marine transgression (123,000 years before the Present). Foraminifera were found in the upper part of both well-cores but they are more abundant in one of the studied well-core. Based on biofacies, the paleoenvironmental conditions and the complex dynamic estuarine evolution were analyzed. Seven foraminiferal biofacies associated with sea-level oscillations were determined throughout cluster analysis, as well as dominant and indicator species in the two well-cores. In the well-core (2-MU-1-RJ) with a higher abundance of foraminifera was identified the following environmental succession: (i) an inner shelf evolving to an estuarine environment; (ii) a return to marine shelf conditions; (iii) followed by the establishment of a lagoon system towards the well-core top. On the other well-core (2-BG-1-RJ), it can be observed the change of estuarine environment under the strong fluvial influence at the bottom of the studied interval; followed by an increase of marine influence from the middle toward the upper part of the well-core. The benthic foraminiferal absence in the samples at the top of the well-cores suggests an abrupt change from marine to the non-marine environment. The two well-cores were compared and the results contribute to the understanding of the estuarine complex dynamics of PSDC in late Pleistocene based on benthic foraminifera biofacies and their paleoecology in marine sediments of the upper portion of the well-cores. It recognized different environments due to the different location of the analyzed cores in the estuary and the neotectonic movements.

AB  - Air pollution has been identified as a major cause of environmental and human health damage. O-3 is an oxidative pollutant that causes leaf symptoms in sensitive plants. This study aims to adjust a multilinear model for the monitoring of O-3 in subtropical climatic conditions by associating O-3 concentrations with measurements of morphological leaf traits in tobacco plants and different environmental variables. The plants were distributed into five areas (residential, urban or industrial) in the southern region of Brazil and exposed during 14 periods, of 14 days each, during the years of 2014 and 2015. The environmental variables and leaf traits during the exposure periods were described by mean, median, standard deviation and minimum and maximum values. Spearman correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were applied on data from exposure periods. Leaf injury index, leaf area, leaf dry mass, temperature, relative humidity, global solar radiation and accumulated rainfall were used in the regression analyses to select the best models for predicting O-3 concentrations. Leaf injury characteristically caused by O-3 was verified in all areas and periods of plant exposure. Higher values of leaf injury (24.5% and 27.7%) were registered in the 13th and 12th exposure periods during spring and in areas influenced by urban and industrial clutches. The VPD, temperature, global solar radiation and O-3 were correlated to leaf injury. Environmental variables [leaf area, leaf dry mass, global solar radiation and accumulated rainfall] and primarily the VPD were fundamental to improve the adjustments done in the bioindicator model (R-2 >= 0.73). Our research shows that biomonitoring employing the tobacco "Bel-W3" can be improved by measuring morphological leaf traits and meteorological parameters. Additionally, O-3 fumigation experiment should be performed with biomonitoring as conducted in this study, which are useful in understanding the role of other environmental factors.

AB  - QuestionsHow do species richness and composition of fern assemblages change with elevation and, within elevational belts, in differently impacted forest habitats? Is there a relationship between fern assemblages and microclimate, both along gradients of elevation and disturbance? Which species are most sensitive to habitat disturbance and microclimatic changes?
   LocationFrom sea level close to the Gulf of Mexico 81km away in a direct line on the eastern slopes of the Cofre de Perote at 3500m, central Veracruz, Mexico.
   MethodsWe studied the richness and composition of fern assemblages in 120 study plots at eight elevations from 20-3500m in three forest types: natural forest (NF), disturbed forest (DF) subjected to timber extraction and grazing, and secondary forest (SF) regrown after total clearance 15-20yr ago. In addition, we measured microclimatic conditions in the three forest types at five elevations over a year.
   ResultsFern richness peaked in humid montane forests at mid-elevations and was low in the drier habitats at the ends of the gradient. Humid montane forests were most sensitive to disturbance, showing increases in mean annual temperatures by about 1 degrees C and reduction in relative air humidity by about 20% in DF and SF compared to NF. This was together with a reduction in fern species richness of 5-60% and marked changes in species composition. In contrast, drought-deciduous forests at low elevations and coniferous forests at high elevations already had low humidity and high light intensity in NF and were less affected by human impact: their microclimatic conditions and fern assemblages did not change markedly in DF and SF.
   ConclusionsThe conservation of much of the humidity-dependent biota (ferns and presumably also groups such as bryophytes and amphibians) in humid montane forests depends on the protection of natural fragments without human disturbance. In contrast, the naturally open forests at the ends of the gradient can be subjected to some exploitation while conserving much of their fern flora as long as a general forest structure is maintained.

AB  - This paper summarizes the evolution of consequence modeling for a repository for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste at Yucca Mountain in southern Nevada. The discussion includes four early performance assessments (PAs) conducted between 1982 and 1995 to support selection and to evaluate feasibility and three major PAs conducted between 1998 and 2008 to evaluate viability, recommend the site, and assess compliance. Modeling efforts in 1982 estimated dose to individuals 18 km from the site caused by volcanic eruption through the repository. Modeling in 1984 estimated releases via the groundwater pathway because of container corrosion. In combination, this early analysis supported the first environmental assessment Analysts in 1991 evaluated cumulative release, as specified in the 1985 US radiation protection standards, via the groundwater pathway over 10(4) yr at a 5-km boundary by modeling waste degradation and flow/transport in the saturated and unsaturated zones. By 1992, however, the US Congress mandated a change to a dose measure. Thus, the 1993 and 1995 performance assessments improved modeling of waste container degradation to provide better estimates of radionuclide release rates out to 10(6) yr. The 1998 viability assessment was a major step in modeling complexity. Dose at a 20-km boundary from the repository was evaluated through 10(6) yr for undisturbed conditions using more elaborate modeling of flow and the addition of modules for modeling infiltration, drift seepage, the chemical environment, and biosphere transport. The 2000 assessment for the site recommendation refined the analysis. Seepage modeling was greatly improved and waste form degradation modeling included more chemical dependence. The 2008 compliance assessment for the license application incorporated the influence of the seismicity on waste package performance to evaluate dose at an similar to 18-km boundary.

FX  - Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) is a multi-program laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the DOE National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000. The authors wish to thank L.A. Connolly, SNL, for help with references, and S.K. Best, Raytheon, for illustration support. The historical perspective and opinions presented are those of the authors and are not necessarily those held by reviewers, SNL, or DOE. As a historical perspective, the authors are reporting on the work of others; however, any interpretative errors of documentation are those of the authors alone. Each performance assessment discussed in this paper required numerous participants with expertise in many areas of science and technology. The most complete listing of these participants is made by examining the extensive reference list. However, many of references are corporate documents without authors. Also, the extensive time some scientists and engineers devoted to PA modeling and the handoff between different scientists and engineers as YMP transitioned through four study phases (site identification, feasibility analysis, suitability analysis, and compliance analysis [3, Table 1]) is more evident if some of the organizations and persons are acknowledged here in somewhat chronological order. SNL had a prominent role in the PA methodology in the 1980s and early 1990s and contributors to the progression of PA modeling include Y.T. Lin, SNL and J.P. Brannen, SNL (development of SAMPLE and transport modeling for PA-EA [12]); R. R. Peters (transport comparisons for PA-EA [23] and TOSPAC development for PA-91 [24]); M.S.

Barnard (PA-91 [14], PA-93 [15], and disruptive events for PA-VA); M.L. Wilson, SNL (design of PA-91 [40] and PA-93 [15], seepage for PA-VA and PA-SR). PNNL contributors included PW Eslinger (preliminary PAs in late 1980s [28] and PA-PNNL-91 [45]); and P.G. Doctor (preliminary PAs [46]). By the mid 1990s, the M&O Contractor to DOE had responsibility for the PA and contributors included S.D. Sevougian, Intera/Duke/Areva/SNL (RIP programming lead for PA-95 [16] and technical lead for PA modeling for PA-VA [17], PA-SR [59], and PA-LA [2]); J.A. McNeish, Intera/Duke/Areva/SNL (technical lead for PA-M&O-93 [51] and PA-95 [16], and managerial oversight for PA-VA [17], PA-SR [59], and PA-LA [2]). Implementers of these later PAs were V. Vallikat, Intera/Duke (RIP programming lead for PA-VA), E. Devenoc, Duke (simulation run management for PA-VA); P. Mattie, Intera/SNL (Goldsim programming lead for PA-SR [60]); D. Kalinich, Areva now at SNL (Goldsim programming for SR seepage, lead for SSPA [65] and PA-EIS [66]); K.P. Lee, Areva (Goldsim programming lead for PA-LA); S.

Additional contributors for PA-LA include J.C. Helton, ASU (design of PA-LA [2, App. J; 70]); C.J. Sallaberry, SNL (implementation and sensitivity analysis of PA-LA [2, App. K; 70]); and C.W. Hansen, SNL (design and implementation of PA-LA analysis [2, App. K; 70]). PA managerial oversight during the iterations were S. Sinnock, SNL (PA-EA); F.W. Bingham, SNL (SCP, PA-91, and PA-93); A.E. Van Luik, PNNL/Intera now DOE (preliminary PAs in late 19805 [28], and PA-M & O-93); H.A. Dockery, SNL (PA-93 and PA-VA); R.W. Andrews, Intera/Duke/BSC now Intera (PA-95, PA-VA, and PA-SR); M.K. Knowles, SNL (PA-LA). Many of these contributors were also involved with the analysis of results and are also acknowledged along with others in a companion paper [50]. Furthermore, contributors to the development of specific PA modules such as igneous intrusion, UZ flow, waste containear, waste form, and transport have been acknowledged in those companion papers [5,7-10]. Because so many scientists and engineers were involved in conducting the PAs at YMP, the authors recognize that this list is unavoidably incomplete, and we apologize for omissions and oversights.

AB  - Coral health indices are important components of the management assessments of coral reefs, providing insight into local variation in reef condition, as well as tools for comparisons between reefs and across various time scales. Understanding how such health indices vary in space and time is critical to their successful implementation as management tools. Here we compare autotrophic and heterotrophic coral health indices, examining specifically the temporal variation driven by the local environmental variation, at three scales (diel, daily and seasonal). We compared metabolic indices (RNA/DNA ratio, protein concentration) and autotrophic indices (Chlorophyll a (Chl a), zooxanthellae density, effective quantum yield (yield) and relative electron transport rate (rETR)) for two dominant Acropora species, A. digitifera and A. spicifera at Ningaloo Reef (north-western Australia) in August 2010 (austral winter) and February 2011 (austral summer). Clear seasonal patterns were documented for metabolic indices, zooxanthellae density and rETR, while cyclic diel patterns only occurred for yield and rETR, and RNA/DNA ratio. Significant daily variation was observed for RNA/DNA ratio, Chl a concentration, yield and rETR. Results suggest that zooxanthellae density and protein concentrations are good long-term indicators of coral health whose variance is largely seasonal, while RNA/DNA ratio and rETR can be used for both long-term (seasonal) and short-term (diel) coral monitoring. Chl a can be used to describe changes between days and yield for both diel and daily variations. Correlations between health indices and light history showed that short-term changes in irradiance had the strongest impact on all health indices except zooxanthellae density for A. digitifera; for A. spicifera no correlation was observed at all. However, cumulative irradiance over the several days before sampling showed significant correlations with most health indices suggesting that a time-lag effect has to be taken into account when interpreting diel variations in coral condition.

AB  - The objective of this study was to define production environments by grouping different environmental factors and, consequently, to assess genotype by production environment interactions on weaning weight (WW) in the Angus populations of Brazil and Uruguay. Climatic conditions were represented by monthly temperature means (degrees C), minimum and maximum temperatures in winter and summer respectively and accumulated rainfall (mm/year). Mode in month of birth and weaning, and calf weight (kg) and age (days) at weaning were used as indicators of management conditions of 33 and 161 herds in 13 and 34 regions in Uruguay and Brazil, respectively. Two approaches were developed: (a) a bi-character analysis of extreme sub-datasets within each environmental factor (bottom and top 33% of regions), (b) three different production environments (including farms from both countries) were defined in a cluster analysis using standardized environmental factors. To identify the variables that influenced the cluster formation, a discriminant analysis was previously carried out. Management (month, age and weight at weaning) and climatic factors (accumulated rainfalls and winter and summer temperatures) were the most important factors in the clustering of farms. Bi or trivariate analyses were performed to estimate heritability and genetic correlations for WW in extreme sub-datasets within environmental factor or between clusters, using MTDFREML software. Heritability estimates of WW in the first approach ranged from 0.27 to 0.54, and genetic correlations between top and bottom sub-datasets within environmental factors, from -0.29 to 0.70. In the cluster approach, heritabilities were 0.58 +/- 0.04 for cluster 1, 0.31 +/- 0.01 for Cluster 2 and 0.40 +/- 0.02 for Cluster 3. Genetic correlations were 0.27 +/- 0.08, 0.32 +/- 0.09 and 0.33 +/- 0.09, between clusters 1 and 2, 1 and 3, and 2 and 3, respectively. Both approaches suggest the existence of genotype x environment interaction for weaning weight in Angus breed of Brazil and Uruguay. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Organic delta C-13 and C/N analyses of estuarine deposits provide proxies for changes in the source of organic matter, which can be driven by fluctuations in relative sea level, river discharge, and catchment disturbance. Here we present the results of a comprehensive vegetation and sediment delta C-13 and C/N survey of Welwich Marsh (outer Humber Estuary, UK), together with high-resolution delta C-13 and C/N analyses of Holocene cores collected nine years previously from the Humber Estuary and the Lincolnshire Marshes, Eastern England, UK. The contemporary intertidal delta C-13 and C/N dataset shows a gradual increase in surface sediment delta C-13 with decreasing marsh height and suggests that delta C-13 is controlled by the degree of tidal inundation and thus reflects organic matter source. However, sediment C/N ratios are less sensitive to tidal changes and the recent introduction Of C-4 salt-marsh species complicates the contemporary analogue. The Holocene delta C-13 and C/N records are in general agreement with existing microfossil data and provide additional palacoenvironmental information. This includes support for an estuary-wide expansion of marine conditions from c. 3.3 ka cal. yr BP, followed by a contraction of marine conditions after c. 2.7 ka cal. yr BP, and evidence for an increase in delivery of terrigenous organic matter to the inner estuary in the late Holocene. Bulk organic delta C-13 and C/N analysis is shown to be a reliable and independent indicator of coastal environmental change and is therefore a complementary technique to the more commonly used microfossil approach. However, this study also shows that in some circumstances the technique may be compromised when applied to sediments from cores that have been stored for a period of time.

AB  - This study aims at assessment the water quality condition in the rivers of Lake Chaohu Basin (LCB), and exploring the crucial parameters affecting its water quality. Four sampling activities were conducted seasonally from April to December in 2018 at 83 sites covering main rivers of LCB. We measured 15 physicochemical parameters, such as turbidity (tur), dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonium (NH4-N), nitrate (NO3-N), and permanganate index (CODmn ). There were significant differences of the 15 environmental parameters (except T) on spatial level, and three significant groups (i.e., Group I, II, and III) were divided according to cluster analysis. Water quality was evaluated by a water quality index (WQI) based on these parameters, which are commonly used in WQI calculation. Generally, the water quality state was classified as "moderate" in LCB (mean value of 69.1). Meanwhile, the state varied obviously among the three groups, with "good" in Group I and "moderate" in Group II and III. Seasonally, WQI in autumn was highest, which was significantly different from that in the other seasons. The distribution of water quality was consistent with other studies regardless of some typical rivers and the whole basin. Moreover, a minimum water quality index (WQI(min)) consisted of 5 crucial parameters (i.e., tur, DO, NH4-N, NO3-N, and CODmn ) was not significantly different with the WQI based on all the 15 parameters, and its percentage error was relatively low (6.02%). With the excellent application in Lake Taihu Basin (LTB) nearby LCB, this WQI(min) was robust and potentially universal in determining river water quality assessment in both basins. This finding is probably beneficial to low-cost and quick water quality evaluation in adjacent basins. In addition, TN maybe not suitable for WQI(min) development in rivers, especially in the area with relatively high concentration, which probably resulted in an underestimation of water quality condition.

AB  - Increased greenhouse gas emissions have caused rapid ocean warming (OW) and reduced ocean pH via acidification (OA). Both OW and OA will likely impact marine crustaceans, but they are often examined in isolation. We conducted an environmental-stressor experiment to understand how exposure to current summer conditions (16 degrees C, pH 8.0), OW only (20 degrees C, pH 8.0), OA only (16 degrees C, pH 7.6), or both acidification and warming, OAW (20 degrees C, pH 7.6), differentially influence thermal physiology and immune response of female subadults of the American lobster, Homarus americanus H. . Following a 42 d exposure, cardiac performance was assessed during an acute thermal stress, and lobsters were subjected to a subsequent 21 d pathogen challenge with the bacterium Aerococcus viridans var. homari, the causative agent of gaffkemia. Lobsters under OAW had significantly lower (P <= 0.02) Arrhenius break temperatures (ABT), an indicator of thermal limits of capacity, compared to lobsters exposed to all other treatments, suggesting these stressors act synergistically to reduce physiological performance. Individuals from the OW and OAW treatments also had significantly lower (P <= 0.035) total hemocyte counts (THCs), an indicator of immune response, and showed a reduced median time to death (by up to 5 d sooner) post A. viridans injection compared to lobsters exposed to current summer conditions. Moreover, nearly twice as many lobsters exposed to OAW lost at least one claw during the pathogen challenge compared to all other treatment groups, potentially increasing the risk of mortality due to secondary infection. Together, these results suggest that OAW will impact the physiology and immune response of subadult H. americanus, potentially influencing successful recruitment to the fishery.

AB  - Background
   For 88 years (1931-present), the Mohonk Preserve's Daniel Smiley Research Center has been collecting data on occupancy and reproductive success of amphibian species, as well as associated water quality of 11 vernal pools each spring (February to May). Though sampling effort has varied over the dataset range, the size of the dataset is unprecedented within the field of amphibian ecology. With more than 2,480 individual species sampling dates and more than 151,701 recorded individual occurrences of the nine amphibian species, the described dataset represents the longest and largest time-series of herpetological sampling with paired water quality data.
   New information
   We describe the novel publication of a paired dataset of amphibian occurrence with environmental indicators spanning nearly 90 years of data collection. As of February 2020, the dataset includes 2,480 sampling dates across eleven vernal pools and 151,701 unique occurrences of egg masses or individuals recorded across nine species of amphibian. The dataset also includes environmental conditions associated with the species occurrences with complete coverage for air temperature and precipitation records and partial coverage for a variety of other weather and water quality measures. Data collection has included species, egg mass and tadpole counts; weather conditions including precipitation, sky and wind codes; water quality measurements including water temperature and pH; and vernal pool assessment including depth and surface vegetation coverage. Collection of data was sporadic from 1931-1991, but data have been collected consistently from 1991 to present. We also began monitoring dissolved oxygen, nitrate concentrations and conductivity of the vernal pools using a YSI Sonde Professional Plus Instrument and turbidity using a turbidity tube in February 2018. The dataset (and periodic updates), as well as metadata in the EML format, are available in the Environmental Data Initiative Repository under package edi.398

AB  - Forest recreation can be successfully conducted for the purpose of psychological relaxation, as has been proven in previous scientific studies. During the winter in many countries, when snow cover occurs frequently, forest recreation (walking, relaxation, photography, etc.) is common. Nevertheless, whether forest therapy conducted in a forest environment with a snow cover will also have a positive effect on psychological indicators remains unknown. Furthermore, male subjects frequently participate in forest therapy experiments, whereas females are rarely involved. Thus, in this study, the effectuality of forest recreation during winter and with snow cover was tested on 32 young females. For these reasons, the experiment involved 15 min periods of relaxation in a forest environment or in an urban street environment, in addition to a pre-test under indoor conditions (randomized controlled study). Four psychological questionnaires Profile of Mood States (POMS), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), Restorative Outcome Scale (ROS), Subjective Vitality Scale (SVS)) were administered to participants before and after interventions. Results showed that participants' levels of negative mood, as measured by different aspects of the POMS questionnaire (tension/anxiety, anger/hostility, depression/dejection, confusion, and fatigue), decreased after exposure to the forest environment. In contrast, both tension/anxiety and anger/hostility increased in the urban street environment. The indicator of negative affect from the PANAS questionnaire also increased after exposure to the urban street environment, whereas the indicator of positive affect based on PANAS was higher in the forest environment than in the urban street environment. Restorativeness and subjective vitality exhibited higher values after exposure to the forest environment in comparison to those from the control and pre-test. The changes in these indicators demonstrate that forest recreation in the snow during winter can significantly increase psychological relaxation in females, as well as show that recreation can be successfully conducted under these winter conditions.

AB  - Plant community structure studies on derelict sites are providing significant insights into vegetation dynamics to ensure the success of future revegetation projects in such areas. Therefore, the present study was conducted to evaluate the changes in soil physico-chemical and biological properties at abandoned red mud dumps (RMD) compared to residential (RS) and forest (FS) sites, coupled with their consequent impacts on the plant community structure. An attempt was also made to identify the indicator species that thrive only under unfavourable red mud conditions. Soil at RMD showed relatively high bulk density, alkalinity, salinity and exchangeable sodium percentage along with poor nutrient status and low microbial activity. Though toxic metals (Cd, Cr and Pb) were higher at RMD, their phytoavailabilities were lower compared to FS site. Number of herb-, shrub- and woody species at RMD were although low, but a significant number of species were acclimatized to the unfavourable soil conditions. Shrub species were maximally affected at RMD, followed by woody- and herbaceous species. Important value index of sensitive species was low while that of tolerant species was higher, and was accredited to altered soil properties. Presence of invasive species such as Acacia nilotica, Caesalpinia bonduc, Stylasanthes scabra and Urena lobata at only RMD may be used as an indication for high toxic metal contamination along with high alkalinity, salinity and poor nutrient contents. Principal component and canonical correspondence analyses revealed that woody and herbaceous species were mainly affected by soil alkalinity, salinity, exchangeable cations, bulk density, porosity, moisture content and phytoavailable metals. Shrub species were primarily influenced by soil organic carbon, nitrogen, available phosphorus, bulk density, porosity, moisture content, soil biological parameters, total (Fe, Mg, Cd, Cr and Pb) and phytoavailable metals. Domination of herbaceous species in the plant community indicated their tendency towards a definite selection strategy in response to altered soil properties. The identified tolerant herbaceous species may be suitable candidates for future red mud reclamation strategies.

AB  - Degree of oxygenation in intermediate water modulates the downward transferring efficiency of primary productivity (PP) from surface water to deep water for carbon sequestration, consequently, the storage of nutrients versus the delivery and sedimentary burial fluxes of organic matter and associated biomarkers. To better decipher the PP history of the South China Sea (SCS), appreciation about the glacial-interglacial variation of the Luzon Strait (LS) throughflow, which determines the mean residence time and oxygenation of water mass in the SCS interior, is required. Based on a well-established physical model, we conducted a 3-D modeling exercise to quantify the effects of sea level drop and monsoon wind intensity on glacial circulation pattern, thus, to evaluate effects of productivity and circulation-induced oxygenation on the burial of organic matter. Under modern climatology wind conditions, a 135 m sea-level drop results in a greater basin closeness and a 24% of reduction in the LS intermediate westward through flow, consequently, an increase in the mean water residence time (from 19.0 to 23.0 years). However, when the wind intensity was doubled during glacial low sea-level conditon, the throughflow restored largely to reach a similar residence time (18.4 years) as today regardless its closeness. Comparing with present day SCS, surface circulation pattern in glacial model exhibits (1) stronger upwelling at the west off Luzon Island, and (2) an intensified southwestward jet current along the western boundary of the SCS basin. Superimposed hypothetically by stronger monsoon wind, the glacial SCS conditions facilitate greater primary productivity in the northern part. Manganese, a redox sensitive indicator, in IMAGES core MD972142 at southeastern SCS revealed a relatively reducing environment in glacial periods. Considering the similarity in the mean water residence time between modern and glacial cases, the reducing environment of the glacial southeastern SCS was thus ascribed to a productivity-induced rather than ventilation-induced consequence.

AB  - The recovery of forests following stand-replacing disturbance is of widespread interest; however, there is both a lack of definitional clarity for the term "recovery" and a dearth of empirical data on the rates of forest recovery associated with different disturbance types. We conducted a quantitative review of literature to determine recovery times following wildfire and timber harvest and to evaluate variation in recovery rates across Canada's diverse forest ecosystems. Recovery was assessed according to the rate of change associated with certain forest structural attributes that have traditionally been used as indicators of forest growth and productivity. The recovery of forest canopy cover, tree height, and stand basal area varied at rates that depended on disturbance type, forest biome, and ecozone. We found that, on average, it took 5-10 years, depending on factors such as location and species, for most forest ecosystems of Canada to attain a benchmark canopy cover of 10% after wildfire or harvest. Similarly, regenerating stands in Canada's boreal forests were capable of attaining average heights of 5 m within five to ten years after wildfire or harvest. Stands in the Boreal Plains ecozone post-harvest reached stand basal area, benchmarked at 10 m(2) ha(-1), faster than those in the Boreal Shield, attributable to differences in tree species composition and the rich mineral deposits of the Boreal Plains. Overall, recovery of canopy cover, tree height, and stand basal area was similar or more rapid following wildfire than harvest. Our review provides temporal benchmarks for gauging recovery times after disturbance. Building upon these temporal benchmarks, and conditioned by disturbance type, site conditions, and location, we present opportunities for using dense time series of remotely sensed data to inform on regional and national trends in forest recovery following disturbance.

AB  - Soil, an essential component of agricultural ecosystems, has high spatial variability. Plant growth reflects this variability in complex interactions with other factors such as rainfall and temperature. In the Mediterranean-type dryland cropping region of South Australia, water is the main driver of crop growth variability. Plant Available Water-holding Capacity of soil (PAWC) is the soil property that measures the maximum amount of plant extractable water which can be held in the soil. It interacts with weather conditions, governing crop growth. Thus understanding spatial variability of PAWC is crucial for farm and regional agricultural management. However, the physical measurement of PAWC is costly and time consuming.
   Crop phenology, the timing of plant growth and development, is influenced by climatic, soil, and management factors. We hypothesised that by keeping management and climate constant by focusing on a small geographic area, the dynamic response of plants is largely due to soil functions. The objective was to use remote sensing derived phenology to understand the complex climate soil interactions. We compared phenologic metrics of annual winter-growing crops from adjacent high and low PAWC soils at two farms (Whariminda and Minnipa) in the Eyre Peninsula, South Australia. The phenologic metrics were derived for 13 seasons from time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI data, at 250 m spatial resolution and 16 days temporal resolution. Wilcoxon signed rank tests were applied to assess differences in phenologic metrics for crops growing on low and high PAWC soils. This allowed us to rank phenologic metrics for use as indicators of soil PAWC.
   The results show a significantly higher GreenUpSlope (p<0.00008) and maximum NDVI (p<0.0004) in low PAWC soils. This indicates that crop phenology derived from MODIS satellite imagery may provide useful information about soil water conditions, which would allow improvements to the spatial detail in soil maps.

AB  - Pollution may lead to the development of pollution-induced community tolerance (PICT) in a stressed community. We studied the presence of PICT in soil food webs using soil microcosms, Soil microcosms containing soil invertebrates and microbes were collected from polluted and unpolluted areas and exposed to a range of soil zinc concentrations. A pine seedling was planted in each microcosm to measure the effects of the origin of the community and Zn pollution on above-ground plant production. The effects of the treatments on nutrient content in the soil were also measured. The diversity of soil microarthropods and the soil's mineral nutrient content were low at the Zn-polluted site. We did not observe an increasing Zn tolerance among the soil organisms in the polluted soil. However, low population growth rates of soil invertebrates from the polluted site may indicate the deleterious effects on fitness of long-lasting pollution. In the soil from the nonpolluted site, Zn additions caused changes in the invertebrate food web structure. These changes were explained by the good physiological condition of the animals and their insensitivity to Zn. The fact that the food web structure in soil from the polluted site did not change can be used as a rough indicator of PICT. Structural stability is presumed by the lack of Zn-sensitive species at this site and the inability of populations to acclimate by altering their growth or reproduction patterns in response to changing soil conditions. Although microbial-based soil decomposer systems may have a high functional redundancy, our results indicate that metal stress at the polluted site exceeds the tolerance limits of the system. As a consequence, ecosystem function at this site is endangered. This study also shows that the evolution of metal tolerance by soil decomposer organisms may not be a common reaction to soil pollution, although changes of population and community structure indicated severe metal stress on organisms.

AB  - The early signs of vibration effects on the human body are microcirculation and transcapillary metabolism disorders, accompanied by disruption of the supply to and utilization of oxygen in the tissues and organs. However, there are few experimental studies aimed at finding targets of vibration in cells and determining the action mechanism of vibration. In in vitro experiments, human erythrocytes in buffer solution were exposed to low-frequency vibration (frequency range 8-32 Hz, amplitudes 0.5-0.9 mm) for 3 hours. The dynamics of the accumulation of membrane-bound catalase and hemoglobin and the distribution of ligand hemoglobin in the membrane-bound fraction were studied as the indicators of functional activity of cells. The choice of these indicators is justified by the participation of catalase and hemoglobin in O-2-dependent cellular reactions as a part of protein complexes. Since pO(2) is a trigger of conformational transitions in the hemoglobin molecule, simultaneously with oxygen transport, hemoglobin signals to different metabolic systems about oxygen conditions in the environment. The studies revealed that in the conditions of vibration, the activity of membrane-associated catalase increased by 40-50% in the frequency range of 12-24 Hz (amplitude 0.5 +/- 0.04 mm), by 20-30% in the amplitude of 0.9 mm, but after about 100-120 min exposure the enzyme activity decreased even below the control level. There was a dose-dependent accumulation of membrane-bound hemoglobin during exposure to vibration. In the membrane-bound fraction of hemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin had the highest content (60-80%), while the content of methemoglobin varied 5-20%. During vibrations in the frequency range 12-28 Hz, 0.5 mm, we recorded 10-30% increase in oxyhemoglobin. With increase in the vibration amplitude (0.9 mm) in the frequency range of 16-32 Hz, constant content of oxyhemoglobin was noted at the beginning of the experiment, which tended to decrease during the last exposure time. Frequency of 32 Hz caused increase in the deoxyhemoglobin content in the membrane-bound fraction. The content of methemoglobin (metHb) in erythrocytes significantly increased during exposure to the frequency range of 12-24 Hz, with the amplitude of 0.5 mm (1.3-2.4 times). During the exposure to frequencies of 28 and 32 Hz, we observed the transition of methemoglobin to hemichrome. The content of methemoglobin in the cells was lower and decreased at the end of the experiment when the vibration amplitude was 0.9 mm. In these experimental conditions, no increase in hemichrome content in the membrane-bound fraction was recorded. Therefore, the degree of binding of catalase and hemoglobin with the membrane of erythrocytes that were exposed to vibration and the changes in the content of ligand forms in the composition of membrane-bound hemoglobin are dose-dependent. Low-frequency vibration initiates O2-dependent processes in erythrocytes. Targets of such an influence are nanobubbles of dissolved air (babstons), retained on the surface of erythrocytes due to Coulomb interactions, capable of coagulation and increase in size under the action of vibration. At first, the consequences of these processes are increase in oxygen content in the surface of erythrocytes, and then decrease as a result of degassing. Thus, increase in oxygen content on the surface initiates redox reactions, whereas decrease in oxygen content leads to reconstruction of metabolic processes oriented at overcoming hypoxia.

AB  - Spray drift buffers are often required on herbicide labels to prevent potential drift effects to nontarget plants. Buffers are typically derived by determining the distance at which predicted exposure from spray drift equals the ecotoxicology threshold for sensitive plant species determined in greenhouse tests. Field studies performed under realistic conditions have demonstrated, however, that this approach is far more conservative than necessary. In 2016, the US Environmental Protection Agency estimated that isoxaflutole (IFT), a herbicide used to control grass and broadleaf weeds, could adversely affect downwind nontarget dicot plants at distances of >= 304 m from the edge of the treated field due to spray drift. This prediction implies that a buffer of at least 304 m is required to protect nontarget plants. To refine the predicted buffer distance for IFT, we conducted a field study in which sensitive nontarget plants (lettuce and navy bean, two to four leaf stage) were placed at various distances downwind from previously harvested soybean fields sprayed with Balance (R) Flexx Herbicide. The test plants were then transported to a greenhouse for grow out following the standard vegetative vigor test protocol. There were three trials. One had vegetation in the downwind deposition area (i.e., test plants placed in mowed grass; typical exposure scenario) and two had bare ground deposition areas (worst-case exposure scenario). For both plant species in bare ground deposition areas, effects on shoot height and weight were observed at 1.52 m but not at downwind distances of >= 9.14 m from the edge of the treated area. No effects were observed at any distance for plants placed in the vegetated deposition area. The field study demonstrated that a buffer of 9.14 m protects nontarget terrestrial plants exposed to IFT via spray drift even under worst-case conditions. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2021;00:1-13.

   Materials and methods. The work based on a single examination of 225 patients with bronchial asthma. Criteria for inclusion in the study are following: the presence of a verified diagnosis of bronchial asthma, the phase of clinical remission. The patients have been divided into 4 groups, taking into account the type of comorbid diseases: the 1 group (53 patients) - bronchial asthma was combined with lesions of the upper gastrointestinal tract; the 2 group (73 patients) - with allergic rhinitis; the 3 group (76 patients) - with hypertension; the 4 group (23 patients) comparison group: the patients without comorbid pathology. According to the clinical blood analysis, 10 leukocyte indices were calculated for each group of patients and their values were analyzed taking into account the frequency and severity of deviations from the reference values. Mathematical processing of the material was carried out using the statistical software package SPSS13.0 for Windows.

Using leukocyte indices, it has been revealed that even during the period of clinical remission, almost all examined patients with BA have endogenous intoxication, the severity of which increases in comorbid diseases. Intoxication was inflammatory in nature and, according to the data of leukocyte indices, was due to the presence of persistent inflammation (local and systemic) and during clinical remission. Violation of immunological reactivity has been revealed in most of the examined patients. The presence of correlation relationships of leukocyte indices with a number of biochemical and immunological indicators allows one to exclude the latter from the plan of examination of patients without reducing the quality of their examination: for example, in the conditions of polyclinics, small hospitals, and resorts. Eight leukocyte indices that are the most informative at BA have been selected.
   Conclusion. Additional information about the condition of BA patients who have comorbid diseases during clinical remission can be used to develop programs for their comprehensive treatment and rehabilitation.

AB  - Background A Voluntary Human Approach Test (VHAT) was performed in pig pens, and relationships between environmental conditions and welfare indicators were investigated. Five variables were measured in 1668 pens in 214 fattening pig herds in Germany: time until the first contact (touching) between a pig and the person in the pen (TUFC), time until the observer was surrounded by pigs within a radius of approximately two meters, percentage of pigs relative to group size [%] surrounding the observer after 1 min (PPSO), percentage of pigs relative to group size [%] that completely avoided contact with the observer during the entire test period, and how the pigs contacted the observer (Score 0 [no touching] - 3 [biting]). Furthermore, variables indicative of the pigs' environment (e.g., feeding system, ventilation system), management (e.g., number of usable drinkers, number of usable manipulatable materials), and welfare (e.g., tail lesions, ear lesions) were documented. Results Pigs engaging in more forceful means of contact (nibbling, biting) approached the observer faster than those exhibiting more gentle types of contact (touching). A lower TUFC was associated with more manipulatable materials present, a higher number of drinkers, and with the control position of the caretaker located inside the pen. Pigs kept in larger groups showed a lower TUFC than those in smaller groups (P = 0.0191). However, PPSO was lower in pigs kept in smaller groups (1-12 pigs per pen) with more manipulatable materials available. In groups with low PPSOs, more tail lesions were observed (P = 0.0296). No relationship between contact type and tail or ear injuries was detected. In younger pigs, PPSO was higher (49.9 +/- 23.2%) than for animals in the second half of the fattening period (45.1 +/- 19.9%). Conclusions In this on-farm study, the relationships between VHAT behavior and environmental factors revealed that external factors (e.g., management practices, housing conditions) impact animals' responses to this behavioral test. Therefore, using the VHAT as an animal welfare indicator is valid only if these variables are studied as well.

AB  - The objective of this study is to assess the occurrence, spatial, and temporal distribution of forty-eight multiclass pesticides in surface and groundwater samples of the Abou Ali River, located in the North of Lebanon. A 3-year monitoring program (six batches from August 2015 to March 2017) was implemented, and thirty sampling points were selected along the river for analysis. The analysis was executed using a previously developed and optimized solid-phase micro-extraction (SPME) gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Statistical analysis, using Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Kruskal-Wallis, and Dunnet T3 multiple comparison tests, was applied to compare mean concentrations of pesticides between the different sampling sites and the batches taken. The pesticides that had the highest frequency of detection in the surface and groundwater samples were alachlor, alpha-endosulfan, and methomyl. For surface water samples, high mean concentrations were perceived for two stations in the upper stream (S5 and S7), two stations (S11 and S14) in the middle stream, and one station (S16) in the lower stream of the river. The highest mean concentrations were observed in October 2015 and August 2016, the time of the year which correlates with the period of pesticide application. Considering groundwater samples, high mean concentrations of pesticides were detected in sites G4, G9, G10, and G12 and during October 2015 and March 2016, following the rainy season. Ecotoxicological risk assessment using the risk quotient (RQ) methodology revealed high risk for five pesticides under average conditions and fourteen under extreme conditions. This study presents, for the first time, a statistical analysis showing the quantification of pesticides in the water resources of the Abou Ali River. In conclusion, it reveals the need to apply a complete pesticide monitoring program, not only for the Abou Ali River but for all the water resources in Lebanon.

AB  - Objectives The purpose of this study was to develop a replicable methodology of mobile ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) to capture prospective physical activity (PA) within free-living social and physical contexts by leveraging citizen-owned smartphones running on both Android and iOS systems.
   Design Data were obtained from the cross-sectional pilots of the SMART Platform, a citizen science and mobile health initiative.
   Setting The cities of Regina and Saskatoon, Canada.
   Participants 538 citizen scientists (>= 18 years) provided PA data during eight consecutive days using a custom-built smartphone application, and after applying a rigid inclusion criteria, 89 were included in the final analysis.
   Outcome measures EMAs enabled reporting of light, moderate, and vigorous PA, as well as physical and social contexts of PA. Retrospective PA was reported using International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). For both measures, PA intensities were categorised into mean minutes of light and moderate-to-vigorous PA per day. Wilcoxon signed ranks tests and Spearman correlation procedures were conducted to compare PA intensities reported via EMAs and IPAQ.
   Results Using EMAs, citizen scientists reported 140.91, 87.16 and 70.38 mean min/day of overall, light and moderate-to-vigorous PA, respectively, whereas using IPAQ they reported 194.39, 116.99 and 98.42 mean min/day of overall, light and moderate-to-vigorous PA, respectively. Overall (rho = 0.414, p<0.001), light (rho = 0.261, p=0.012) and moderate-to-vigorous PA (rho = 0.316, p = 0.009) were fairly correlated between EMA and IPAQ. In comparison with EMAs, using IPAQ, citizen scientists reported significantly greater overall PA in active transportation (p = 0.002) and recreation, sport and leisure-time domains (p = 0.003).
   Conclusions This digital epidemiological and citizen science methodology adapted mobile EMAs to capture not only prospective PA, but also important physical and social contexts within which individuals accumulate PA. Ubiquitous tools can be leveraged via citizen science to capture accurate active living patterns of large populations in free-living conditions through innovative EMAs.

AB  - Deep-water mudstones are often considered as background sediments, deposited by vertical suspension fallout, and the range of transport and depositional processes are poorly understood compared with their shallow-marine counterparts. This study presents a dataset from a 538.50 m thick cored succession through the Permian muddy lower Ecca Group of the Tanqua depocentre (south-west Karoo Basin, South Africa). This study aims to characterize the range of mudstone facies, transport and depositional processes, and stacking patterns recorded in deep-water environments prior to deposition of the Tanqua Karoo sandy basin-floor fans. A combination of macroscopic and microscopic description techniques and ichnological analysis has defined nine sedimentary facies that stack in a repeated pattern to produce 2 to 26 m thick depositional units. The lower part of each unit is characterized by bedded mudstone deposited by dilute, low-density turbidity currents with evidence for hyperpycnal-flow processes and sediment remobilization. The upper part of each unit is dominated by more organic-rich bedded mudstone with common mudstone intraclasts, deposited by debris flows and transitional flows, with scarce indicators of suspension fallout. The intensity of bioturbation and burrow size increases upward through each depositional unit, consistent with a decrease in physicochemically stressed conditions, linked to a lower sediment accumulation rate. This vertical facies transition in the single well dataset can be interpreted to represent relative sea-level variations; the hyperpycnal stressed conditions in the lower part of the units were driven by relative sea-level fall, and the more bioturbated upper part of the units represent backstepping, related to relative sea-level rise. Alternatively, this facies transition may represent autogenic compensational stacking. The prevalence of sediment density flow deposits, even in positions distal or lateral to the sediment entry point, challenges the idea that deep-water mudstones are primarily the deposits of passive rainout along continental margins.

AB  - Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) bound with biomolecules have emerged as suitable biosensors exploiting unique surface chemistries and optical properties. Many efforts have focused on antibody bioconjugation to AuNPs resulting in a sensitive bioconjugate to detect specific types of bacteria. Unfortunately, bacteria thrive under various harsh environments, and an understanding of bioconjugate stability is needed. Here, we show a method for optimizing Listeria monocytogenes polyclonal antibodies bioconjugation mechanisms to AuNPs via covalent binding at different pH values, from 2 to 11, and 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid, NaOH, HCl conditions. By fitting Lorentz curves to the amide I and II regions, we analyze the stability of the antibody secondary structure. This shows an increase in the apparent breakdown of the antibody secondary structure during bioconjugation as pH decreases from 7.9 to 2. We find variable adsorption efficiency, measured as the percentage of antibody adsorbed to the AuNP surface, from 17 to 27% as pH increases from 2 to 6 before decreasing to 8 and 13% at pH 7.9 and 11, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis reveals discrepancies between size and morphological changes due to the corona layer assembly from antibody binding to single nanoparticles versus aggregation or cluster self-assembly into large aggregates. The corona layer formation size increases from 3.9 to 5.1 nm from pH 2 to 6, at pH 7.9, there is incomplete corona formation, whereas at pH 11, there is a corona layer formed of 6.4 nm. These results indicate that the covalent binding process was more efficient at lower pH values; however, aggregation and deactivation of the antibodies were observed. We demonstrate that optimum bioconjugation condition was determined at pH 6 and MES buffer-type by indicators of covalent bonding and stability of the antibody secondary structure using Fourier transform-infrared, the morphological characteristics and corona layer formation using TEM, and low wavelength shifts of ultraviolet-visible after bioconjugation.

AB  - In the present study the model isopod, Cyathura carinata were exposed to four pH(NIST) treatments (control: 7.9; 7.5, 7, 6.5) in order to determine the tolerance and pH threshold value this estuarine species with stand under future acidification scenarios. Seawater acidification significantly affected the lifespan of C. carinata, where population density was remarkably reduced at the lowest pH treatment. The longevity, survivorship and swimming activity (related to the acquisition of energy) of these isopods decreased with decreasing pH. Furthermore, to determine the possible metabolic plasticity of this species, the swimming activity, the Na+/K + -ATPase activity (relevant for osmoregulation process), and the RNA: DNA ratio (an indicator of fitness) were measure from two populations of C. carinata, one inhabiting a stable environment (pH(NIST) 7.5-8.0) and one inhabiting a fluctuating pCO(2) regimes (pH 3.3-8.5) subjected to three pH treatments (7.9, 7.0 and 6.5). The population from high fluctuating pCO(2) conditions showed capacity to withstand to pH 6.5, as well as higher longevity and metabolic plasticity, when compared with the population from the habitat with slight pCO(2) variation. These results indicate that Cyathura population from stable environments could be vulnerable to ocean acidification because it could trigger detrimental effects on its survival energy budget, and growth. However, ocean acidification has limited effect on the energy budget and survival of C. carinata population from highly variable habitats, suggesting that they are able to cope with the elevated energy demand. The difference showed between populations is likely an indication of genetic differentiation in tolerance to ocean acidification, possibly attributable to local adaptations, which could provide the raw material necessary for adaptation to future conditions. In addition, our results suggest that when assessing marine crustacean responses to changing environments on a global scale, variability in population and metabolic responses need to be considered.

AB  - Climate change has intensified the frequency of heat waves in the world, thereby exposing farm animals to stressful conditions. For better productive performance it is important to identify the most resilient genotypes. Thus, our objective was to evaluate the thermoregulatory responses of rams of tropical indigenous (Morada Nova and Santa Ines) and exotic breeds (Dorper and Texel), by monitoring the environmental and physiological indicators related to heat tolerance. The experiment was carried out in a tropical climate region (Cwa), in Brazil, for twelve months, which comprised spring, summer, autumn and winter. Thirty-three rams were divided into groups: Morada Nova (MN; n=8, red-coat), Santa Ines (SI; n=9, black-coat), Dorper (DO; n=8, white-coat) and Texel (TX; n=8, white-coat). The microclimatic variables were monitored, and the THI and BGHI comfort indices were calculated. Coat thickness and body surface temperatures were measured monthly, and serum triiodothyronine-T3 measurements and complete blood tests were performed. The physiological variables were evaluated every fifteen days and skin micro-biopsies Were performed in the summer and winter for histological evaluation. During the warmer seasons, the THI and BGHI reached values that indicated thermal discomfort. TX showed higher coat thickness throughout the year, increased physiological variables related to thermolysis, and reduced T3 (P < 0.05). The internal temperature was permanently lower in the MN, SI and DO (P < 0.05). The body surface temperatures were affected by the coat characteristics and wool length. Hematological parameters varied in the seasons with the highest thermal conditions (P < 0.05). The MN showed larger sweat glands, while the area occupied by the sweat glands was higher in the SL The DO showed higher hair density in the summer and winter (P < 0.05). The results indicated that the MN, SI and DO breeds overcome the thermal challenge more easily throughout the seasons due to specific adaptive morphological and physiological characteristics.

AB  - The Food Safety Modernization Act attempts to reduce produce-related foodborne illness by using preventive rather than reactive measures. The goal of this research was to determine the persistence of manure-borne generic Escherichia coli under laboratory and field conditions. The population density of naturally occurring E. coli was similar to 7.2 and 5.4 log CFU/10 g in pre- and postscreened manures, respectively. Postscreened (i.e. after the liquid manure has passed through a screen) manure was applied at light, medium, and heavy rates to fields in Live Oak and Citra, FL, during the fall and summer. Laboratory microcosms of the manure-amended soils (comparable to the field's heavy application rate of manure) from both locations were maintained at 20 and 30 degrees C. Persistence of E. coli, moisture content, and pH were monitored until E. coli became unrecoverable. The longest E. coli persistence seen in field trails was during the summer and fall trials from Citra (heavy application) that terminated on day 112 and day 280, respectively. The rate of E. coli decay ranged from 0.02 to 0.04 log CFU per day across all manure application rates, seasons, and locations. In the microcosm studies, the E. coli became extinct on day 210 in the 30 degrees C, whereas they became unrecoverable on day 420 in the 20 degrees C microcosms. The relatively prolonged persistence of E. coli in the microcosms suggests that survival under laboratory conditions does not mimic real-world survival rates and may not be adequate for predicting E. coli persistence in the field. The persistence data also suggest that the risk from E. coli associated with new contamination events, such as wild life intrusion, runoff, or other vectors, may be greater than the risk associated with the long-term survival of manureborne E. coli, although more work is needed to confirm this hypothesis.

AB  - Transitions between liquid and gaseous phases of a fluid material are characterised by a jump in density and the coexistence of both phases during the phase change process. The jump occurs at the interface between the fluid phases and can be handled numerically by the introduction of a singular surface. This allows for a thermodynamically consistent description of mass transfer across the interface and the transition of the interfacial term towards the mass production term included in the mass balance equations. In the present article, a multicomponent and multiphasic porous aggregate is treated in a non-isothermal environment, while accounting for the thermodynamics of the fluid-phase transitions. Based on the Theory of Porous Media, this approach provides a well-founded continuum mechanical basis for the description of deformable, fluid-saturated porous solid aggregates. In particular, a bicomponent, triphasic model is proposed consisting of a thermoelastic porous solid, which is percolated by compressible gaseous and liquid fluid phases. The thermodynamical behaviour, i.e. the dependency of the fluid densities on temperature and pressure, is governed by the van der Waals equation of state and the Antoine equation for the vaporisation-condensation line. Moreover, the interface between the fluid phases is represented by a singular surface and results in jump conditions included in the balance relations of the components of the overall aggregate. The evaluation of the jump conditions leads to a formulation of the interfacial mass transfer, which basically relates the energy added to the system to the latent heat needed for the phase change in a certain amount of a substance. The mass transfer itself or the mass production, respectively, furthermore depends on interfacial areas introduced as a function of porosity and saturation. Thus, geometrical and fluid-flow-dependent parameters are included into the phase change process. Finally, this allows for the numerical simulation of evaporation or condensation of, for example, in a deformable porous solid with heat transfer.

AB  - The abundance and composition of total organic carbon, aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons including biomarkers, and the delta C-13 composition of total organic matter and individual compounds in core samples of the Nenjiang Formation from the SK-1 borehole of the Songliao Basin provide information on the paleoenvironmental conditions of lacustrine sediments formed during the Upper Cretaceous. The distribution of n-alkanes, and their delta C-13 composition, and 4-methylsteranes and dinosteranes in the first member of the Nenjiang Formation (K(2)n(1)) indicate that the organic matter largely originated from algal organisms and is dominated by types I and II kerogen. The occurrence of gammacerane, aryl isoprenoids isorenieratane and low pristane/phytane and diasterane/sterane ratios further suggest a salinity stratified water column associated with anoxic bottom waters, as well as possible photic zone oxygen depletion conditions during major source rock deposition of the K(2)n(1). The organic geochemical data also indicate significantly different depositional environments for the second member of the Nenjiang Formation (K(2)n(2)) sediments, which are interpreted to have been deposited under a uniform salinity (non-stratified) oxic water column. Consequently, although the organic matter in the K(2)n(2) sediments was largely derived from algal and bacterial sources, the kerogen types are dominantly lib and III due to the oxidative degradation of organic matter, combined with a gradual increase in land-plant input Furthermore, the occurrence and shift of two saw-toothed distribution patterns of the delta C-13 composition of C-29 to C-33 n-alkanes, with "W" and "M" patterns being isotopically heavy odd- and even-numbered alkanes, respectively, is suggestive of organic input shift or an unknown mechanism of carbon uptake or isotopic fractionation. In particular, the heavy even carbon numbered high molecular weight n-alkanes is rare and needs further investigation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In humid regions, the timing and quantity of a complementary irrigation regime is challenging because of the irregularity of rainfalls events. In this study, we tested the use of a thermal infrared derived empirical crop water stress index (CWSIe) as an in situ measurement of the water status of sugarcane, to better monitor the irrigation scheduling. To do this, we set up a 2-year experiment in Reunion Island, on a trial with plots under different water conditions (rainfed and irrigated). Crop surface temperature was measured daily with infrared radiometers (Apogee Instruments) installed above the canopy, and soil moisture and drainage measurements were used to derive the ratio between actual and maximum evapotranspiration (AET/MET) values that were then averaged on "hydrically homogeneous" time periods (between 7 and 25 days). Only the thermal data acquired on clear days and 1 h after noon in 2007 were used to define the empirical lower and upper baselines required for the calculation of empirical CWSI The data set acquired in 2008 was used to test the robustness of the method as we used the upper and lower baselines defined in 2007 to calculate CWSIe. The linear regression between AET/MET and (1 - CWSIe) averaged on the same periods (values ranging between 0.4 and 1) showed a significant correlation for both experimental years (global R-2 = 0.75 and RMSE = 0.12). This result indicates the effectiveness of the CWSIe to measure the water status of the sugarcane crop, even in humid conditions with a vapor pressure deficit (VPD) between 0.5 and 2.1. We conclude the study by discussing the complementarity of this remote water stress index (CWSIe) with OSIRI water balance modelling tool currently used in Reunion Island for monitoring sugarcane crop irrigation.

AB  - Plasma cortisol levels have been used to evaluate the stress response in a variety of cultured fish species. However, little is known about the stress response of zebrafish, Danio rerio, despite its extensive use as a laboratory research organism. Due to its small size, evaluation of whole-body cortisol has provided a means to assess zebrafish stress levels Understanding the role of crowding on zebrafish whole-body cortisol would allow researchers to optimize various rearing procedures. The aim of this study was to determine the zebrafish whole-body cortisol response to crowding stress. Baseline cortisol values have not been established for zebrafish; therefore, we compared specific treatment groups acclimated to similar conditions. We crowded zebrafish at a high density (40 fish/L) for 3 h (acute stress), or 5 days (chronic stress). Crowding resulted in a four-fold increase in mean whole-body cortisol level in both groups compared to zebrafish maintained at a much lower density (0.25 fish/L). Additional experiments demonstrated that the cortisol response to crowding was modulated by fasting, feeding and density. In large glass aquaria (76 L), fasted, crowded fish (40 fish/L) had significantly higher cortisol compared to fasted, control fish (0.2 fish/L). Furthermore, weight was inversely related to cortisol level in fasted, crowded fish held in large glass aquaria. For fed fish, crowding did not significantly increase cortisol level, suggesting an interaction between feeding and crowding. In small tanks (4 L), crowding (40 fish/L) did not significantly increase cortisol compared to control fish held at 4 fish/L. Our results suggest that whole-body cortisol is a useful indicator of crowding stress in fasted, adult zebrafish. Understanding how crowding and other environmental conditions affect zebrafish fitness could aid in optimizing zebrafish growth, health and reproduction as well as improving the consistency and reproducibility of in vivo studies that use this popular vertebrate model.

AB  - Species richness is one of the best indicators of biodiversity. However, there are few investigations on concordance of diversity patterns and environmental settings for marine regions. The objectives of this study were to correlate species richness of shallow water (< 200 m deep) sea stars with key oceanographic factors in the Gulf of California, Mexico, and to predict species richness of Asteroidea using multiple regressions. In these analyses the Gulf was divided into nine sections of one degree in latitude (from 23 - 3 1 degrees N), at each section we recorded: continental shelf area (at 100 and 200 m depth), temperature mean and range at three depth levels (0, 60 and 120 m), thermocline depth, surface nutrient concentrations (nitrates, phosphates and silicates), surface photosynthetic pigment concentration, and integrated productivity. Sea star species richness at each latitudinal section was estimated from literature data, new collections and museum records. Species were assigned to one of the following feeding guilds: predators of small mobile invertebrates (1), detritivores (D), predators of colonial organisms (C), generalist carnivores (G), and planktivores (P). There are 47 shallow water asteroid species in the Gulf of California (16 I, 15 D, eight C, six G, one P and one not assigned). Total species richness and guild species richness showed strong latitudinal attenuation patterns and were higher in the southernmost Gulf, an area characterized by a narrow shelf, high temperature, and low nutrient concentrations. Species diversity for each guild was correlated to a set of oceanographic parameters: temperature, nitrate concentration, and integrated productivity were linked to richness in must cases. We detected that nutrients and surface pigments always presented negative relationships with species richness, indicating that productive environments limit asteroid diversity in the study area. Finally, the postulated regression models to estimate species richness from oceanographic data were significant and highly precise. We conclude that species richness of Asteroidea in the Gulf of California is related to oceanographic conditions and can be estimated from regional oceanographic information.

AB  - Many of the rhyolites of the Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ), North Island, New Zealand, have been interpreted as representing primary magmas from the melting of crustal sources, especially the greywackes of the TVZ Mesozoic basement.  High-silica (approximately 75% SiO2) rhyolites of the Okataina caldera complex which carry cummingtonite phenocrysts have been considered as products of low-temperature (approximately 750-degrees-C) crustal magmas formed under conditions close to saturation in water (a(H2O) approximately 1).  Experimental crystallization studies on contrasted metaluminous (2.6% Di) and peraluminous (1.5% C) Okataina rhyolites confirm that cummingtonite could have crystallized only at pressures less-than-or-equal-to 3 kb (depths less-than-or-equal-to 10 km), probably in the roof zone of a shallow crustal magma chamber, and that these rhyolites are more likely to represent fractionated magmas.  This view is supported by comparison of their major element compositions with those of experimental silicic liquids from the melting of model metaluminous (TVZ dacite) and peraluminous (TVZ "Western Basement" greywacke) crustal compositions.  The Okataina rhyolites, and also less silicic average TVZ rhyolite compositions, are notably poorer in the An-component of normative feldspar than the experimental melts, particularly those produced under conditions of a(H2O) approximately 1 (which contain up to 18% An).  This suggests that they were derived from more primitive magmas (probably the end products of complex processes involving magma sources in both the crust and mantle) by crystal fractionation or assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) dominated by plagioclase-rich extract assemblages.
   In assessing the nature of magmatic processes involved in internal differentiation of the continental crust, it should be noted that primary crustal magmas are likely to be appreciably richer in plagioclase, more mafic and less silicic, than those represented by voluminous rhyolitic extrusive rocks.  Normative An and Pl contents may be used as an indicator of primitive character for rhyolitic crustal melts in the same way as normative Fo and Ol for picritic-basaltic melts derived from the mantle.

AB  - The recently constructed Lokoja-Abuja highway and a quarry which cut through the Patti Formation, provided opportunity for the field study and sampling of the exposed ironstone interbeds within the carbonaceous shales and clays in Ahoko-Idu axis of the southern Bida Basin, Nigeria. The origin and paleoenvironmental significance of the ferruginous intervals were examined in this paper. Investigation reveals that the ferruginous bands occur as three lithofacies comprising of laminated, bioturbated and spheroidal concretionary facies. The primary components and depositional features of the host shales (detrital minerals, wood and herbaceous fragments, laminations) are largely preserved in the ironstones indicating compositional similarity and therefore a diagenetic origin for the ironstones. Results of XRD reveal substantial amount of siderite and illite but minor amounts of kaolinite, hematite, calcite and magnetite. Major elements such as Fe2O3, SiO2, Al2O3, CaO, MgO and P2O5 range from 41.50 to 54.60%, 6.10-23.30%, 3.64-7.00%, 1.40-13.60%, 0.30-1.20% and 0.10-8.80% respectively. The current data is suggestive that kaolinite was diagenetically replaced by siderite at early stage of burial in a reducing environment. Migrating pore water, probably enriched with alkali metals like Ca and Mg, sourced from sea water in the depositional basin and abundance of organic matter in the primary sediments are interpreted to be part of the factors responsible for the siderite precipitation. Both the host shale and the ferruginous beds contain significant amount of MgO, CaO, relics of dissolved bioclasts and body fossils. The geochemical proxies combined with the presence of magnesian siderite in the ironstones indicate that the host shales were deposited in marine environment with occasional freshwater influence. The study concludes that the ironstones are marine to non-marine, sideritic and diagenetic. The laminated and fossiliferous ironstone facies was deposited at the peak of marine transgression during the Upper Cretaceous time and represents maximum flooding surface. Shallowing up and regression into fresh water swamp condition was marked by the occurrence of freshwater sideritic ironstone.

AB  - Feed withdrawal is a widespread practice in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture to empty the gut prior to major farming operations, while certain pathogens and suboptimal environmental conditions in production cages are known to induce prolonged fasting. However, these fasting periods may be in conflict with ethical and legal obligations to farm animals. Presently, science-based recommendations on responsible fasting times that consider fish welfare are lacking. In this study, we measured the standard metabolic rate (SMR) and metabolic rate following acute handling and confinement stress in Atlantic salmon post smolts (similar to 575 g, similar to 38 cm) following 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks of feed withdrawal and 1 week of subsequent refeeding at 12 degrees C. The purpose was to identify when changes in metabolic mode occurred and assess whether the capacity to respond to stress eventually was compromised, since such observations could serve as potential welfare indicators. The SMR decreased significantly from 84.4 +/- 4.7 mg O-2 kg h(-1) in control fish to 71.0 +/- 1.8 mg O-2 kg h(-1) following 1 week of fasting. A further significant decrease to 65.0 +/- 3.7 mg O-2 kg h(-1) was measured after 3 weeks, while refeeding returned SMR to control levels. The increase in MO2 following acute stress was unaffected for the first three weeks of fasting. However, the 4 week group showed a reduced peak response compared to the preceding weeks (278 +/- 13 vs. 310 +/- 7 mg O-2 kg h(-1)). Weight, fork length and condition factor did not change significantly during the fasting period, and the fish immediately resumed eating upon refeeding. We conclude that up to 4 weeks of feed withdrawal had negligible effects on fish welfare. Moreover, an improved aerobic scope owing to a reduced SMR may be advantageous prior to certain farm operations.

AB  - Introduction: Benthos is an efficient indicator or environmental disturbances. biodiversity and trophic dynamics. In Cuba, benthic mollusks have been reported as the main food for the lobster Panulirus argus. Objectives: To estimate spatiotemporal variations in the soft-bottom benthic community of the Gulf of Batabano, and to infer, with emphasis on mollusks, the effect of such variations on the availability of food for spiny lobsters. Methods: A historical analysis of the variations in the density and biomass of megazoobenthos (organisms 4 mm) and particularly of megazoobenthic mollusks was carried out, taking as a reference the studies published in 1990 (with samples from 1983) and recent data (2007-2018) recorded on site using comparable methodologies based on sediment drags. Abundance was given as density (ind/m(2)) and biomass in g/m(2). Results: It was found that both the density and the biomass were significantly higher at the end of the last century and show a tendency to gradually decrease towards recent times. Regarding the values reported in 1983. the density of organisms showed a decrease of 73 %, however, the biomass experienced an even greater decrease (86 degrees A)). The areas with the highest density and biomass, both benthos and mollusks, have varied from 1983 and are currently located towards the center of the gull Despite this, bivalves continue to be better represented than gastropods. In general, mollusks showed a significant decrease (55 % and 88 % respectively). Conclusions: The deterioration of the benthic community in the fishing areas of the Gulf of Batabano was corroborated and it was demonstrated. based on megazoobenthos, that malacofauna can be used as a reliable indicator of the general parameters of the softbottom benthic community. The availability of food for lobsters have decreased 55.6 % compared to 1983. This could help to explain the current changes in the abundance, distribution and nutritional condition of lobsters, which could also be related to the recent megazoobenthos variations.

AB  - Tolerance and resistance to environmental stresses determine the invasion success of alien plants under disturbed conditions. Colonization time and enviromnental heterogeneity have been thought to contribute to the invasiveness of alien plants. However, few previous studies have synthesized disturbance, environmental heterogeneity and colonization time in the exploration of the invasion mechanisms of invasive clonal plants. In the present study, the performance of the invasive clonal wetland plant Alternartthera philoxeroides was compared under undisturbed (UD), homogeneous burial (HoD) and temporal heterogeneous burial (HeD) conditions at the early and late phases of colonization. Using functional traits including biomass allocation and plant physiology as indicators of invasive performance, we found that in the early phase A. philoxeroides showed phenotypic maintenance in stolon mass ratio (SMR), root mass ratio (RMR), root-shoot ratio and non-structural carbohydrate content of stolon (NSCCstolon) after either HoD or HeD; leaf mass ratio (LMR). specific leaf area (SLA), the maximal fluorescence (F-v/F-m), nitrogen content per leaf mass (N-mass) and leaf carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio after HoD; chlorophyll content (Ch(t)) and leaf construction cost per leaf area (CCU) after HeD. We found that CCarea varied HoD while LMR, SLA, F-v/F-m, N-mass and C/N ratio varied after HeD in the early phase. In the late phase, A. philoxeroides showed phenotypic maintenance in LMR, SMR, RMR. root-shoot ratio and F-v/F-m after either HoD or HeD; Ch(t) and NSSCstolon after HoD. Moreover, we found that SLA, N-mass, C/N ratio and varied after either HoD or HeD while Ch(t) and NSSCstolon after HeD in the late phase. Both tolerance (phenotypic maintenance) and resistance (phenotypic variation) to the burial disturbance are trait dependent and facilitate the invasion of A. philoxeroides. In addition, the heterogeneity of the disturbance exerted facilitative or insignificant impacts on its invasive performance. These mechanisms may explain the broad invasion of A. philoxeroides into diverse habitats.

AB  - Aim Understanding diversity patterns and identifying the environmental factors that shape these patterns are essential for ecology and conservation. The Afro-Arabian region comprises one of the most important biogeographic areas connecting continents. Yet, little emphasis has been put on understanding its endemic fauna in relation to its biogeographic realms. Our objective is to fill the gaps in knowledge on diversity patterns and biogeography that are essential for prioritizing the overdue conservation efforts. Location The study area covers mostly the hot desert climate region in North Africa and Arabia, and includes the Mediterranean, Sahel, and Ethiopian highlands (hereafter "Afro-Arabian region"). Methods We used distribution maps developed by IUCN and BirdLife for species endemic to the Afro-Arabian region belonging to the four tetrapod classes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, to identify the endemic richness hotspots. We then used multivariate analyses to delineate biogeographic regions and evaluate their relationship with the environmental factors. Results Our study reveals a complex map of the richness hotspots for the endemic tetrapod classes. The main hotspots of endemism were concentrated at the margins of the study area, along the Mediterranean coast, Ethiopian highlands, and along the Red Sea Mountains. We propose classifying the Afro-Arabian region into three discrete biogeographic realms for endemic amphibians, four for reptiles and birds, and five discrete biogeographic realms for endemic mammals. The identified realms are defined by their environmental conditions and the historical geological processes. Main conclusions Richness hotspots of endemic tetrapod classes were heterogeneously distributed in the Afro-Arabian region. Our results support the hypothesis that species diversity patterns and endemism have been shaped by the environmental conditions and the paleogeographic processes. Each of the identified bioregions is associated with a characteristic set of tetrapod species. Our results are a benchmark for assessing the effectiveness of the protected areas and for implementing conservation plans for biodiversity.

AB  - Air exposures occurring in indoor swimming pools are an important public health issue due to their popularity and regular use by the general population, including vulnerable groups such as children and elderly people. More comprehensive information on indoor air quality (IAQ) in swimming pools is thus needed in order to understand health risks, establish appropriate protective limits and provide evidence-based opportunities for improvement of IAQ in these facilities. In this context, twenty public indoor swimming pools located in the Northern Region of Portugal were examined in two sampling campaigns: January-March and May-July 2018. For each campaign, a comprehensive set of environmental parameters was monitored during the entire period of the facilities' operating hours of a weekday, both indoors and outdoors. In addition, four air (1-h samplings) and water samples were collected. Findings show that comfort conditions, ultrafine particles number concentrations and exposure to substances in the indoor air (concentration and composition) is likely to vary greatly from one public indoor swimming pool to another. Trihalomethanes (THM) and dichloroacetonitrile were the predominant disinfection by-products identified in the indoor air but other potentially hazardous volatile organic compounds, such as limonene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, 2,2,4,4,6,8,8-heptamethylnonane, 2- and 3-methylbutanenitrile, acetophenone, benzonitrile, and isobutyronitrile were found to have relevant putative emission sources in the environment of the swimming pools analyzed. Furthermore, indicators of poor ventilation conditions (namely carbon dioxide, relative humidity and existence of signs of condensation in windows) and some water-related parameters (THM levels, conductivity and salinity) were found to be determining factors of the measured airborne THM concentrations that appeared to significantly potentiate the exposure. In summary, this work provides evidence for the need to establish adequate standards for the comprehensive evaluation of IAQ in public swimming pools, in order to guide further development of evidence-based prevention/remediation strategies for promoting healthy environments in swimming pools.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the physiological effects on brain activity and autonomic nervous activity of forest-related visual, olfactory, and combined visual and olfactory stimuli. Twenty-one female Japanese university students (age, 21.1 +/- 1.0 years) participated. In a soundproofed chamber with an artificial climate, each participant was presented for 90 s with the following conditions: an image of a forest landscape of Hinoki cypress trees with no odor (visual stimulus), a gray image with Hinoki cypress leaf essential oil (olfactory stimulus), an image of a forest landscape of Hinoki cypress trees with Hinoki cypress leaf essential oil (combined stimulus), and a gray image with no odor (control). As an indicator of brain activity, oxyhemoglobin concentrations were measured in the left and right prefrontal cortices using near-infrared time-resolved spectroscopy. Heart rate variability and heart rate were used as indicators of autonomic nervous activity. The high-frequency component of heart rate variability, which reflects parasympathetic nervous activity, and the low-frequency/high-frequency ratio, which reflects sympathetic nervous activity, were evaluated. The following results were obtained in comparison with the control conditions: (1) the combined stimuli resulted in significantly decreased oxyhemoglobin concentrations in the left and right prefrontal cortices; (2) the olfactory stimulus resulted in significantly decreased oxyhemoglobin concentration in the right prefrontal cortex; and (3) the visual stimulus resulted in significantly decreased sympathetic nervous activity related to arousal or situations of stress. Results of a questionnaire indicated that these forest-related stimuli significantly increased the participant's feelings of "comfortable" and "relaxed," with the visual and combined stimuli significantly increasing feelings related to the terms "natural" and "realistic." In conclusion, forest-related visual, olfactory, and combined visual and olfactory stimuli induced physiological and psychological relaxation effects, and the combined visual and olfactory stimuli exhibited an additive effect.

AB  - Samples taken from the Upper and Lower members of the Bakken Formation in four wells that were drilled in a northeast- southwest trend along the eastern margin of the Williston Basin in central-western North Dakota were investigated in order to present an overview of source-rock quality and depositional environment conditions for the main purpose of establishing an organofacies model. Several techniques such as Rock-Eval 6 pyrolysis, X-Ray fluorescence elemental analysis, vitrinite reflectance, organic petrography and visual kerogen assessment using reflected and transmitted white light and UV light microscopy on whole-rock pellets were combined to draw the best possible conclusions. The results indicate that kerogen is mainly marine type II with increasing in maturity towards the central and SW portions of the basin. Detailed organic petrography of the samples showed that solid bitumen, amorphous matrix bituminite, granular bitumen, alginite, acritarchs, and liptodetrinite are the most abundant macerals. In order to properly determine the Bakken organofacies, the original hydrogen index (HIo) was restored using various mathematical models and empirical methods. The mathematically restored HIo from thermally mature samples (HIo-calculated) was then compared to the HI values from thermally immature samples (T-max < 430 C, here interpreted as HIo) for further verification. Although the agreement between the Rock-Eval pyrolysis HIo and the HIo-Calculated by the two mathematical equations was excellent, the VKA-derived HIo values were underestimated by about 125 mg HC/g TOC. In the next step, the above parameters were integrated to identify the organofacies based on three different models. It was found that organofacies B is the most abundant organofacies present in the Bakken source rock. Furthermore, elemental analysis reflected a high concentration of "strong euxinic affinity" trace elements such as Mo, V, and Zn, representing an anoxic/euxinic depositional environment condition for the Bakken Shale.

AB  - The current study aims at identifying and measuring components and factors affecting social and economic resilience in Rudbar, Iran. This applied research is using descriptive and analytical methods. The sample size in the study was estimated as 345 households using the Cochran's formula. Using library resources and experts, the components and factors affecting social and economic resilience were identified. Afterwards, the required date and information were collected using field method and household questionnaire. To analyze the data, descriptive and analytical statistical methods, including one-sample t-test, univariate and multiple linear regressions, were used. Awareness, knowledge, skill, attitude and social capital indices were considered as components of social resilience and the amount and severity of damage, compensation, and the possibility of returning to occupational and financial conditions were considered as the economic resilience components. Results of descriptive statistics showed that, in terms of social resilience (216.3 +/- 33.4) and economic resilience (30.6 +/- 7.3) (Mean +/- SD), households in Rudbar were in a relatively appropriate and inappropriate conditions, respectively. With respect to the factors affecting social and economic resilience, the results of multiple linear regression model showed that social resilience increases with the length of stay in neighborhood, the number of educated family members, higher education level of the head of the household, the employed heads of household compared to unemployed ones, having physically-mentally disabled persons in the family, owning the house compared to renting it. Moreover, it seems that economic resilience might increase with having employed family members (other than the head of the household), medical and accident insurance, higher approximate value of dwelling, and lower monthly expenses. Based on the findings, the study proposes some social and economic resilience components which could be used to improve the flexibility and resilience level of the communities at neighborhood level.

AB  - A sustainable and secure food supply within a low-carbon and resilient infrastructure is encapsulated in several of The United Nations' 17 sustainable development goals. The integration of urban agriculture in buildings can offer improved efficiencies; in recognition of this, the first south European example of a fully integrated rooftop greenhouse (iRTG) was designed and incorporated into the ICTA-ICP building by the Autonomous University of Barcelona. This design seeks to interchange heat, CO2 and rainwater between the building and its rooftop greenhouse. Average air temperatures for 2015 in the iRTG were 16.5 degrees C (winter) and 25.79 degrees C (summer), making the iRTG an ideal growing environment. Using detailed thermophysical fabric properties, 2015 site-specific weather data, exact control strategies and dynamic soil temperatures, the iRTG was modelled in EnergyPlus to assess the performance of an equivalent 'free-standing' greenhouse. The validated result shows that the thermal interchange between the iRTG and the ICTA-ICP building has considerable moderating effects on the iRTG's indoor climate; since average hourly temperatures in an equivalent freestanding greenhouse would have been 4.1 degrees C colder in winter and 4.4 degrees C warmer in summer under the 2015 climatic conditions. The simulation results demonstrate that the iRTG case study recycled 43.78 MWh of thermal energy (or 341.93 kWh/m(2)/yr) from the main building in 2015. Assuming 100% energy conversion efficiency, compared to freestanding greenhouses heated with oil, gas or biomass systems, the iRTG delivered an equivalent carbon savings of 113.8, 82.4 or 5.5 kg CO2(eq)/m(2)/yr, respectively, and economic savings of 19.63, 15.88 or 17.33 (sin)/m(2)/yr, respectively. Under similar climatic conditions, this symbiosis between buildings and urban agriculture makes an iRTG an efficient resource-management model and supports the promotion of a new typology or concept of buildings with a nexus or symbiosis between energy efficiency and food production.

AB  - Lake level change is an important indicator of changes in the hydrological status of lakes triggered by the influence of atmospheric circulation systems. Previous studies show that the interaction of the Indian monsoon and the Westerlies, and their influence on environmental changes in the Tibetan Plateau region, remain unclear. Here, we reconstruct the Holocene lake level history of a lake, Taro Co, in southwestern Tibet, based on the relationship between ostracod assemblages and water depth from 34 surface sediment samples spanning the depth range 0 to 125m. Measurement and analysis of multi-proxy data from a 310cm sediment core from Taro Co lead to the following conclusions: (1) From 10,200 to 9400 cal. a BP, the lake received large inflows of freshwater (mainly glacial melt water) resulting in a rapid rise in lake level. Following a cold and dry interval and low lake level from 9400 to 8800 cal. a BP, the lake maintained a high level between 8800 and 7500 cal. a BP. This was followed by a less warm and wet period until 6400 cal. a BP. From 6400 to 1200 cal. a BP, the lake probably overflowed after reaching a high level, and after 1200 cal. a BP, the lake level decreased and fluctuated around the modern depth of 60m at the coring site. (2) The region experienced warm and wet conditions from 10,200 to 6400 cal. a BP, with a cold event at around 9000 cal. a BP, which probably resulted from the influence of the Indian monsoon. However, the inferred wet conditions between 6400 and 1200 cal. a BP are not observed in other records from the monsoon region; they are consistent with numerous records from the regions under the influence of the Westerlies, which probably indicate an interval of Westerlies-domination in the Taro Co region.

AB  - The initial hypothesis assumed in our research was that an improvement in the water cycle in the river catchments chosen for analysis could be obtained using their natural basins without outlets to store rainwater from natural and urbanised areas. The chief goal of the research was to identify the types and conditions of retention in each of the catchments. Fieldwork was carried out in the catchments of the upper Parseta and the Potok Oliwski, rivers situated in the Baltic drainage area in the coastal zone of northern Poland.
   The upper Parseta catchment includes an abundance of depressions without outlets, where a total of 358 landforms with no surface runoff have been distinguished, or 4.84 per 1 km(2). Of this number 164 are absorptive basins and 194 are closed evapotranspiration basins. The distinguished closed basins take up a substantial proportion of the upper Parseta catchment at 8.33 km(2), or 11.26%. The Potok Oliwski catchment includes depressions without outlets, where a total of 35 landforms with no surface runoff have been distinguished, or 4.83 per 1 km(2). Of this number, 27 are absorptive basins. Closed basins occupy a total of 82,565 m(2), or 1.14% in the upper Potok Oliwski catchment.
   The total capacity of all the closed basins in the upper Parseta catchment amounted to 6,292,160.89 m(3). In turn, in the Potok Oliwski catchment the total volume of closed evapotranspiration basins was 1,677.1 m(3), and when filled with water, absorptive basins would have a total volume of 23,182.8 m(3).
   The result is considerable potential reservoirs in both catchments. Young glacial catchments, particularly areas with no outlet, can be a place of existing surplus drinking water. Water retention is a significant potential with more and more apparent water shortage in the world.

AB  - Clubroot (Plasmodiophora brassicae) was initially discovered on canola (Brassica napus) in western Canada near Edmonton, Alberta in 2003. Since then, the disease has spread rapidly but is still most common and most destructive on the heavy, slightly acidic soils in the region where the first infested fields were identified. However, there was (and is) concern that the pathogen might continue to spread and become a constraint to canola production across the Canadian prairies. To assess the risk of continued spread, the effect of factors such as temperature and soil type, pH and micronutrients on clubroot development were examined. Temperatures below 17 degrees C were shown to slow or inhibit the development of P. brassicae at all stages of its life cycle. Alkaline pH also reduced infection and symptom development in both controlled environment and field situations, but alkaline pH did not eliminate clubroot when other conditions were conducive for infection. Differences in the concentration of boron and other micronutrients in soil were shown to affect clubroot development on canola, but the effect of these differences was unlikely to limit the development of clubroot in situations where inoculum concentration was high. Soil moisture, especially in the rhizosphere during primary and secondary infection, had an important impact on clubroot development, but is a difficult factor for most growers to manipulate. Soil type had a small effect on clubroot severity in controlled environment studies, but a strong interaction of soil type with soil moisture is extremely likely under field conditions. Assessment of the interaction of environmental factors affecting infection success with the mechanisms of pathogen dispersal indicated that clubroot on canola has the potential to spread across large portions of the Canadian prairies.

AB  - Current methods to evaluate the potential risk of earthen dam and levee failures by internal erosion fail to consider appropriate failure criteria for the initiation, continuation, and progression phases and are often based on subjective assessment. Six different internal erosion failure modes may occur within a dam or levee, its abutments, or the foundation that are triggered or facilitated by different mechanisms and therefore have different failure criteria. In non-cohesive soils, suffusion, backward erosion, heave, or concentrated leak erosion (scour) are possible, although the physical mechanisms driving the failure criterion for each of these are very different. Currently, no credible failure criteria exist for evaluation of the initiation of backward erosion. This article presents derivation of a specific failure criterion for initiation of backward erosion in non-cohesive soils using the critical kinetic energy (E-kcrit) of initiation. Laboratory experiments conducted with different soils showed that E-kcrit is affected by the physical characteristics of the soil, effective stress conditions, and angle of the seepage path. In internally stable, non-cohesive soils (e.g., uniform medium sands) with up to 6 percent non-plastic fines, backward erosion initiated when the E-kcrit of seepage exceeded 0.075 Joules. In non-cohesive soils with 10 percent non-plastic fines, which are also prone to suffusion, the E-kcrit for backward erosion is reduced by a factor of as much as 100. Moreover, in soil with 20 percent plastic fines, initiation of backward erosion did not occur. Concentrated leak erosion along hydraulic-induced fractures was the dominant process of internal erosion in soils with plastic fines. A new backward erosion assessment methodology based on the factor of safety is proposed for initiation of backward erosion that relates the laboratory-derived E-kcrit and the anticipated maximum actual kinetic energy, as measured in the field or estimated during design. The advantage of this method is that laboratory-derived E-kcrit can take into account the natural factors that affect initiation of backward erosion. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the application of the factor of safety methodology under typical field conditions.

AB  - Fluoride bioaccumulation in the signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus (Dana) was examined through field and laboratory studies, considering in the latter the effects of several biotic and abiotic factors: water chloride content, developmental stage, sex, and tissue. The potential use of P. leniusculus as bioindicator of fluoride pollution in freshwater ecosystems was also assessed by testing the capability of juvenile crayfish to release fluoride during depuration periods. After discussing the obtained results, we concluded that: (1) fluoride pollution by industrial effluents may significantly increase the fluoride content in signal crayfish inhabiting polluted freshwater ecosystems; (2) although high chloride levels in the aquatic medium may significantly reduce the fluoride content in signal crayfish exposed to fluoride pollution conditions, fluoride bioaccumulation can still occur in significant amounts; (3) sex does not seem to be an important biotic factor affecting fluoride bioaccumulation in signal crayfish; (4) in contrast, the type of tissue is an important biotic factor affecting fluoride bioaccumulation in signal crayfish, with the exoskeleton accumulating more fluoride than the muscle, in absolute terms, but with the muscle accumulating more fluoride than the exoskeleton, in relative terms (in relation to pre-effluent/control values); (5) the developmental stage seems to be another important biotic factor affecting fluoride bioaccumulation in signal crayfish, with juveniles being able to accumulate fluoride more rapidly than adults under fluoride pollution conditions; (6) although, during deputation periods, signal crayfish may significantly release fluoride, they can still retain significant amounts of the fluoride previously bioaccumulated during exposure periods. We can overall conclude that fluoride bioaccumulation in signal crayfish may be used as suitable bioindicator of fluoride pollution in those freshwater ecosystems where it is already present. However, this notable capability to accumulate and retain fluoride poses a potential risk to human health when signal crayfish from fluoride polluted areas are consumed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Changes in mass and chemical composition of Pinus sylvestris senescent needles were studied over a 5 year period in Mediterranean (MF) and Continental forests (CF) in the Pyrenees under varying levels of thinning (P0: reference, no thinning; P20: removal of 20% basal area, P30: removal of 30% basal area). Decomposition rates were higher in MF (k = 0.423 year(-1)) than in CF (k = 0.245 year(-1)). However, the maximum decomposition limit was higher in MF (87.9%) compared to CF (78.1%). The relative importance and timing of rainfall, and cellulose and lignin abundance on the decomposition process was similar among both sites. However, air temperature and degree-days only affected CF (the colder site) during the initial stages of decomposition, while litter moisture was significant only in MF (the drier site) in the latter stages of decomposition. Nutrient and carbon dynamics showed temporal patterns similar to those reported in higher latitudes (except for Ca), however, indicators of N mineralization such as C/N and lignin/N at the study sites were lower than values reported in the literature. Decreases in decomposition rates after thinning were higher in MF than in CF, indicating that this ecosystem could, in the short term, be more sensitive to human intervention. Thinning had similar temporary qualitative effects at both sites, slowing decomposition, increasing N and P immobilization and decreasing Ca immobilization. However, quantitative effects of thinning were site dependent in that the magnitude of nutrient immobilization was higher in CF. A conceptual model is presented to explain effects of thinning on litter N dynamics. These temporary changes are not trivial as nutrient immobilization and accumulated organic matter losses over a thinning cycle may affect tree growth particularly during short rotations and intensive fast-growing plantations. Under similar nutrient availability conditions, sites where nutrient release occurs faster may show higher post-thinning tree growth rates.

AB  - Study of Late Cretaceous lacustrine sedimentary strata in the eastern Songliao Basin, China revealed that the paleoclimate was relatively arid and hot during sedimentation of the upper Santonian of the Yaojia Formation, but became relatively humid and warm during deposition of the lower Campanian Nenjiang Formation. The upper Yaojia Formation was deposited in a freshwater lake environment, while the lower Nenjiang Formation was deposited in a slightly brackish to brackish environment. The average total organic carbon content in the upper Yaojia Formation is 0.15%, while the hydrogen index is 36 mg(HC)/g(TOC), implying poor source rock for oil generation and the organic matter comprised of a mixture of woody and herbaceous organic matter. In contrast, the hydrogen index of oil shale and black shale of the lower Nenjiang Formation is 619 mg(HC)/g(TOC), and total organic carbon content on average is 3.37%, indicating a mixed algae and herbaceous source of kerogen and an increase in aquatic bioproductivity. The black shale and oil shale have low Pristane/Phytane and C(29) 5 alpha,14 alpha,17 alpha(H) - stigmastane 20R/(20R + 20S) ratios, with maximum concentration of n-alkanes at n-C(23), implying an anoxic depositional environment with algae, bacteria and higher plants providing most of the organic matter. Relatively abundant gammacerane and a higher Sr/Ba ratio in the oil shales suggest the presence of brackish water and development of salinity stratification in the lake. During sedimentation of the upper Yaojia through the lower Nenjiang Formations, the level of Songliao lake increased and a deep-lake environment was formed with bottom waters being oxygen depleted. Concomitantly, as the lake deepened bottom conditions were changing from oxic to anoxic, and the input of organic matter changed from predominantly higher plants to a mixture of bacteria, algae and higher plants providing favorable conditions for oil source rock accumulation.

AB  - The ability of microorganisms to adapt to changing environments challenges the prediction of their history-dependent behavior. Cellular biomarkers that are quantitatively correlated to stress adaptive behavior will facilitate our ability to predict the impact of these adaptive traits. Here, we present a framework for identifying cellular biomarkers for mild stress induced enhanced microbial robustness towards lethal stresses. Several candidate-biomarkers were selected by comparing the genome-wide transcriptome profiles of our model-organism Bacillus cereus upon exposure to four mild stress conditions (mild heat, acid, salt and oxidative stress). These candidate-biomarkers-a transcriptional regulator (activating general stress responses), enzymes (removing reactive oxygen species), and chaperones and proteases (maintaining protein quality)were quantitatively determined at transcript, protein and/or activity level upon exposure to mild heat, acid, salt and oxidative stress for various time intervals. Both unstressed and mild stress treated cells were also exposed to lethal stress conditions (severe heat, acid and oxidative stress) to quantify the robustness advantage provided by mild stress pretreatment. To evaluate whether the candidate-biomarkers could predict the robustness enhancement towards lethal stress elicited by mild stress pretreatment, the biomarker responses upon mild stress treatment were correlated to mild stress induced robustness towards lethal stress. Both short-and long-term biomarkers could be identified of which their induction levels were correlated to mild stress induced enhanced robustness towards lethal heat, acid and/ or oxidative stress, respectively, and are therefore predictive cellular indicators for mild stress induced enhanced robustness. The identified biomarkers are among the most consistently induced cellular components in stress responses and ubiquitous in biology, supporting extrapolation to other microorganisms than B. cereus. Our quantitative, systematic approach provides a framework to search for these biomarkers and to evaluate their predictive quality in order to select promising biomarkers that can serve to early detect and predict adaptive traits.

AB  - Information is lacking on the watershed scale effects of mining and reclaiming originally undisturbed watersheds for coal on surface water chemical concentrations and load rates for a variety of constituents. These effects were evaluated on three small, geologically dissimilar watersheds subjected to surface mining in Ohio. Comparisons were made between phases of land disturbances using ratios of average concentrations and load rates: Phase I (natural), subphases of Phase 2 (mining and reclamation), and subphases of Phase 3 (partial reclamation and final condition) using 4,485 laboratory analyses of 34 constituents. Average concentration and load rate ratios were categorized into three classes - minor, moderate, and substantial. Mining and reclamation (M/R) affected flow duration curves in different ways - baseflow changes were variable, but high flows generally increased. The average concentration ratios for all sites were classified as 15 percent "minor," 36 percent "moderate," and 49 percent "substantial" (average ratio of 2.4.) Generally load rate ratios increased due to mining and reclamation activities (average ratio of 3.3). Minor, moderate, and substantial impacts were found on average for 7 percent, 23 percent, and 70 percent, respectively, of load rate ratios. The impact of M/R on average load rates was not necessarily the same as on average concentrations due to changed hydrology and can be opposite in effect. The evaluation of the impacts of M/R requires knowledge of changing hydrologic conditions and changing supplies and rates of release of chemicals into streams. Median sediment concentration ratio is an indicator of average constituent load rate ratio of a wide variety of chemical constituents and is useful for development of best management practices to reduce chemical loads. The site at which diversion ditches were not removed during final reclamation sustained large chemical load rates, and removal of diversions at the other mined site reduced load rates. Revegetation of poorly reclaimed areas decreased chemical load rates. Chemical load rates were sensitive to geology, mining, and reclamation methods, diversions, and changing hydrology, concentration flow rate regressions, and watershed areas.

TI  - Salt dissolution and surface subsidence in central Kansas: A seismic investigation of the anthropogenic and natural origin models
T2  - GEOPHYSICS
LA  - English
KW  - EASTERN MARGIN
KW  - WESTERN CANADA
KW  - BASIN
AB  - Gradual subsidence in the Punkin Center study area, northeast Reno County, Kansas, has resulted in ponding of surface waters, abandonment of at least one oil well, and damage to county roads. Because the Punkin Center area is within the Burrton oil field and is underlain by the Hutchinson Salt Member, surface subsidence historically has been attributed to salt dissolution of anthropogenic origin. Subsidence that occurred significant distances from any known well sites has been attributed to unrecorded abandoned wells or complex asymmetric patterns of salt dissolution that originated at a drillhole.
   To ascertain the validity of the widely accepted anthropogenic salt-dissolution model, a 4-km seismic reflection profile was acquired along an east-west-oriented county road adjacent to an abandoned oil well. The expectation was that the residual Hutchinson Salt Member would be anomalously thin where maximum recorded surface subsidence occurred and thicker elsewhere. Contrary to expectations, the residual Hutchinson Salt Member is relatively thick (20-30 m) below areas of significant recent surface subsidence. There is no evidence of recent surface subsidence at those locations along the seismic profile where the rock salt has been totally leached. At these sites dissolution and subsidence is interpreted to predate European settlement in Kansas and to be of natural origin.
   The presence of dissolution and subsidence features related to natural processes has implications for developing an understanding of the potentially complex relationship between anthropogenic activities and pre-existing geologic conditions. Sinkhole development is apparently a natural and expected process along an irregular salt dissolution front. The geometry of this front may be influenced strongly by geologic factors (e.g., fracture patterns and facies distribution). The results are that not all modern sinkhole development has a clear-cut anthropogenic cause, and the potential for adverse impact resulting from anthropogenic activities will be influenced strongly by pre-existing geologic conditions. Efficient management decisions along the dissolution front related to well location and well-site practices should take into account natural processes that previously have and will continue to have an effect on salt dissolution and surface subsidence.

AB  - Snow is Earth's most climatically sensitive land cover type. Traditional snow metrics may not be able to adequately capture the changing nature of snow cover. For example, April 1 snow water equivalent (SWE) has been an effective index for streamflow forecasting, but it cannot express the effects of midwinter melt events, now expected in warming snow climates, nor can we assume that station-based measurements will be representative of snow conditions in future decades. Remote sensing and climate model data provide capacity for a suite of multi-use snow metrics from local to global scales. Such indicators need to be simple enough to "tell the story" of snowpack changes over space and time, but not overly simplistic or overly complicated in their interpretation. We describe a suite of spatially explicit, multi-temporal snow metrics based on global satellite data from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and downscaled climate model output for the U.S. We describe and provide examples for Snow Cover Frequency (SCF), Snow Disappearance Date (SDD), At-Risk Snow (ARS), and Frequency of a Warm Winter (FWW). Using these retrospective and prospective snow metrics, we assess the current and future snow-related conditions in three hydroclimatically different U.S. watersheds: the Truckee, Colorado Headwaters, and Upper Connecticut. In the two western U.S. watersheds, SCF and SDD show greater sensitivity to annual differences in snow cover compared with data from the ground-based Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) network. The eastern U.S. watershed does not have a ground-based network of data, so these MODIS-derived metrics provide uniquely valuable snow information. The ARS and FWW metrics show that the Truckee Watershed is highly vulnerable to conversion from snowfall to rainfall (ARS) and midwinter melt events (FWW) throughout the seasonal snow zone. In comparison, the Colorado Headwaters and Upper Connecticut Watersheds are colder and much less vulnerable through mid- and late-century.

AB  - The grapevine vegetative cycle, which is morphologically described by its phenological stages, is strongly determined by weather conditions. Phenological models are widely applied in viticulture and are based on the assumption that air temperature is the preponderant environmental factor which determines vine development. In this study, phenological development models (PDMs) were calibrated and validated to simulate several intermediate stages between budbreak and veraison for cv. Touriga Nacional (TN) and cv. Encruzado (EN) winegrape varieties, which are widely grown in the Dao Wine Region, Portugal. These are thermal models, with which the daily sum of the rate of forcing (R) was calculated using a sigmoid function. For this purpose, a high-quality and comprehensive dataset was used which combines phenology data and weather station data in several vineyard sites spread over the region. The model showed an overall high performance (global RMSE of 5.4 days for EN and 5.0 days for TN), although it depended on the phenological stage and variety. The RMSE ranged from 3.2 to 6.2 for TN, and from 3.9 to 6.8 for EN. For both varieties and in all phenological stages, the RMSE was significantly lower than the standard deviation of the phenological observations. For TN, the model efficiency was greater than 0.71 for all phenological stages. In future studies, these models will be combined with specific models that simulate the evolution of winegrape berry quality indicators commonly used for harvest decision support. The relatively low complexity of the selected PDMs enables their use as a crop management and decision support tool. To our knowledge, no previous studies have been carried out on either of these two varieties and their intermediate phenological timings. The present study is an illustration of conceivable model development under diverse environmental conditions, thus allowing similar approaches to be adopted in other wine regions on a worldwide scale.

AB  - The studies were carried out in forest communities of two formations (pine and spruce) in northwestern Russia (Republic of Karelia) on stationary test plots during 20 years. Two methodological approaches were used: direct observation and describing forest communities in similar conditions but with different time-since-disturbance (method of ecological-dynamic series). It has been established that the basic characteristics of lichen cover, such as: species diversity, projective cover (indirect biomass indicator), species structure (cover proportion of different species), as well as the population structure of lichen species, are determined by time-since-disturbance (position of the community in the succession row), species and the age structure of the stand, the ratio of trees belonging to before- and after-fire generations. Relative stabilization (recovery) of most of studied characteristics of lichen cover in the spruce tree communities is observed 250 years after the disturbance (clear cutting, fire), in the pine forests - in 50-150 years (depending on the preservation of the tree layer as a result of the last fire). The total number of lichen species in spruce forests increases with increase time-since-disturbance and stabilizes at the level of 100 species per ha in 250 years after last disturbance. According to analysis of the dynamics of lichens coverage 4 groups of species can be distinguished: 1) with a pronounced maximum coverage for a certain time-since-disturbance; 2) the coverage increases with increasing time-since-disturbance; 3) the coverage decreases with increasing time-since-disturbance; 4) the coverage is stabilized at a certain time-sincedisturbance. Among the studied lichens species of early, middle, and late succession stages were identified, that can be used as indicators of certain phases of forest development. Time since the last disturbance is a fundamental characteristic of the epiphytic lichens habitat which determines the presence and quality of the substrate, habitat conditions, and the time required for the development of these organisms.

AB  - The effects of stocking density and environmental conditions on performance, economic profit, carcase characteristics, immunity, and blood plasma parameters of Cobb 500 strain of broiler chickens were evaluated. The 4 climate regions (mild and humid, semi-arid, alpine, hot and dry) and 4 densities (10, 15, 17 and 20 chicks/m(2)) were carried out as a completely randomised design with 4 x 4 factorial arrangement of treatments. The corn and soybean based diets were formulated according to the nutrition requirements guide of the Cobb 500 for starter and grower periods. The amount and the composition of the diet were the same for all experimental groups. Growth performance and feed intake were measured weekly. After the injection of sheep red blood cell at 15 and 35 days, blood samples were taken at 24 and 42 days, respectively, to study the immunity of broiler chickens. At the end of the experiment, 3 birds were slaughtered from each experimental unit for measuring the weights of carcase, abdominal fat, gastrointestinal organs (the total weight of gastrointestinal tract and caeca, and liver) and blood parameters. The interaction effects of stocking density and climate region on feed conversion ratio (in starter period), survival rate, cost, profit, cholesterol, triglyceride, high density lipoproteins (HDL), HDL/low density lipoproteins (LDL) ratio, and liver enzymes aspartate aminotranferases (AST), also known as serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), and alanine aminotranferase (ALT) were significant (p < .05). Climate and density each had a significant effect on production index (p < .05). The highest production index was obtained in alpine climate. Moreover, the density of 10 chicks/m(2) showed the highest production index. The results showed that rearing Cobb strain chickens in hot and dry climate and at the density of 17 chicks/m(2) had the most economic benefit. Based on the results of this study to achieve the highest profit in different climates, a density of 17 chicks/m(2) (0.633 ft(2) per bird) is recommended for Cobb 500 strain chickens.

AB  - The analysis of minor/microelements in anthropogenic soils resulting from past settlement activities in different environmental conditions and geographical regions is not well-known. The study aimed to determine whether minor/microelements are suitable proxy indicators of past human activities of Archaeological Dark Earth (ADE) soils from two past hilltop settlements-Ziavi-Galenkuito in Ghana and Dreviie hillfort, Czech Republic. Total and plant-available (Mehlich 3) contents of minor/microelements were determined using portable X-Ray Fluorescence spectrometry and Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, respectively. The black color of the soils from Ziavi-Galenkuito and Drevie hillfort contrasted the brownish Ferric Acrisol and greyish Luvic Cambisol control, respectively. The contents of total and plant-available Cu, Zn, Mn, Sr, and total Rb was substantially higher in both sites compared to their control of the same geological substrates. The highest total and plant-available Mn content in Ziavi-Galenkuito may indicate specific intensive settlement activities in a comparatively shorter duration. The highest total Cu, Zn, Sr, and Rb content in the soil from Dieviie hillfort compared to Ziavi-Galenkuito related to longevity and intensity of the past human activities. Total Cu, Zn, Mn, and Sr can well reflect past human activities from different geographical regions according to their significant correlations from both studied sites. Except for Mn and Sr, total and plant-available content of Cu and Zn were not well correlated. Except for Mn and Sr, total and plant-available content of Cu and Zn were not well correlated. In the calculation of enrichment factors in ADE soils for geoarchaeological purposes, total Mn, Cu, Zn, and Sr are more suitable. Enrichment by minor/microelements can be reliable enough in predicting past human activities in ADE soils of different geology and climatic conditions, even after hundreds of years.

AB  - During herbicide spray application, nontarget terrestrial plants (NTTPs) growing in the off-field area need to be protected from unacceptable effects of herbicide drift. The risk of such unintended effects is assessed in order to establish whether a particular use can be approved, possibly in combination with mitigation measures. In Europe, the risk of herbicide treatment to NTTPs is assessed on the basis of tier 2 studies done under controlled conditions in greenhouses. Following the concept of a tiered testing approach, higher tier field studies under more realistic conditions could be used to refine the risk assessment. No current guideline for conducting higher tier NTTP field studies is available. We developed an NTTP higher tier field study method done on an experimental plant community established by sowing of a seed mixture. The setup was optimized in 3 pilot field studies and subsequently used for a definitive study testing effects of the herbicide iofensulfuron-sodium. Results show that the method can be regarded as a suitable higher tier option for assessing effects of herbicides on NTTPs. Growth of species from the soil seed bank cannot be avoided and has to be carefully considered when evaluating results. Adaptations of the study design may be necessary when testing different herbicides. Community-level endpoints were at the same level as single-species endpoints. Results of the field study were compared to standard greenhouse study results for the same herbicide. No observed effect rates (NOERs) in the field were about a factor of 10 higher and show that the current tier 2 risk assessment for NTTPs can be regarded as protective in this case. Whether the present field study design and the assessed endpoints can be used in higher tier risk assessment of NTTPs depends on selection of the specific protection goal and requires further discussion.Integr Environ Assess Manag2020;16:691-705.

AB  - Amazonian ecosystems are major biodiversity hotspots and carbon sinks that may lose species to extinction and become carbon sources due to extreme dry or warm conditions. We investigated the seasonal patterns of high-resolution solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) measured by the satellite Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) across the Amazonian ecoregions to assess the area ' s phenology and extreme drought vulnerability. SIF is an indicator of the photosynthetic activity of chlorophyll molecules and is assumed to be directly related to gross primary production (GPP). We analyzed SIF variability in the Amazon basin during the period between September 2014 and December 2018. In particular, we focused on the SIF drought response under the extreme drought period during the strong El Nino in 2015-2016, as well as the 6-month drought peak period. During the drought ' s peak months, the SIF decreased and increased with different intensities across the ecoregions of the Amazonian moist broadleaf forest (MBF) biome. Under a high temperature, a high vapor pressure deficit, and extreme drought conditions, the SIF presented differences from -31.1% to +17.6%. Such chlorophyll activity variations have been observed in plant-level measurements of active fluorescence in plants undergoing physiological responses to water or heat stress. Thus, it is plausible that the SIF variations in the ecoregions' ecosystems occurred as a result of water and heat stress, and arguably because of drought-driven vegetation mortality and collateral effects in their species composition and community structures. The SIF responses to drought at the ecoregional scale indicate that there are different levels of resilience to drought across MBF ecosystems that the currently used climate- and biome-region scales do not capture. Finally, we identified monthly SIF values of 32 ecoregions, including non-MBF biomes, which may give the first insights into the photosynthetic activity dynamics of Amazonian ecoregions.

AB  - Accurate estimation of gross primary production (GPP) is of significance for understanding the changes of carbon uptake and its responses to extreme climate events like droughts. Emerging new GPP products with higher spatial and temporal resolutions (500-1000 m, 8-day) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Photosynthesis (MOD17), the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), the Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS), and the Penman-Monteith-Leuning (PML) models, provided unprecedented opportunities to understand the spatial and temporal variations of GPP. However, their performances under drought conditions remain obscure. Here we evaluated the performance of these four state-of-the-art GPP products in grasslands, using FLUXNET data as reference. The results showed that all the four models have reasonable accuracies under non-drought years. In drought years, the VPM performed best, followed by the MOD17, PML and BESS, with the RMSEs of 1.67, 1.69, 1.72 and 1.77 gC m(-2) day(-1), respectively. The VPM, BESS and PML overestimated annual GPP by 2%, 13% and 21%, respectively, while MOD17 underestimated annual GPP by 10% in drought years. This varied model performances under drought years could be partially attributed to the differences in quantifying the water stress effects. The water constraint factor in the VPM, which is derived from the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and directly indicates the overall water content of leaf, plant stand and soil background, could better capture the vegetation response to water content variation than that in MOD17, PML and BESS, all of which used an atmospheric moisture related indicator (the Vapor Pressure Deficit for MOD17 and PML, and the relative humidity for BESS). This study suggests that water stress factors, which reflect the physiological and ecological characteristics of vegetation itself (e.g., LSWI) rather than atmospheric moisture (e.g., VPD) or other meteorological surrogates, should be further considered in GPP models when applied in drought conditions

AB  - Urban decision-makers in South Africa face growing challenges related to rapidly expanding populations and a changing climate. To help target limited resources, municipalities have begun to conduct climate change vulnerability assessments. Many of these assessments take a holistic approach that combines both physical hazard exposure and the underlying socio-economic conditions that predispose populations to harm (i.e., social vulnerability). Given the increasing use of socio-economic conditions in climate change vulnerability analyses, this paper seeks to explore two key research questions: 1) can the spatial distribution of relative social vulnerability be estimated in six mostly urban South African municipalities, and if so, 2) how sensitive are the results to a range of subjective methodological choices often required when implementing this type of analysis. Here, social vulnerability is estimated using socio-economic and demographic data from the 2001 and 2011 South African censuses. In all six municipalities, social vulnerability varies spatially, driven primarily by differences in income, assets, wealth, employment and education, and secondarily by differences in access to services and demographics. Even though social vulnerability is estimated from a wide array of population characteristics, the spatial distribution is surprising similar to that of the percent of working-age individuals making less than 800 rand per month. Areas with high percentages of previously disadvantaged, extended family, and informal households tend to display relatively higher levels of social vulnerability. In fact, demographics (e.g., race, language, age) are often highly correlated with other characteristics that have direct ties to social vulnerability (e.g., income, employment, education). The spatial patterns of relative social vulnerability are similar in 2001 and 2011. However, there is some evidence social vulnerability is relatively lower in 2011. While the choice of input data and aggregation method can affect the spatial distribution of social vulnerability, the general spatial patterns appear to be fairly robust across a number of subjective choices related to methodological and aggregation approach, spatial resolution, and input data.

AB  - In the conditions of a system-wide economic crisis and destabilization of the external environment, the economy of the Russian Federation and its regions is experiencing structural limitations, which are associated with its imbalance. As a result, domestic demand for manufactured products is reducing; such a situation does not encourage enterprises to increase their output. This makes it necessary to search for the ways to eliminate structural disproportions and provide economic growth in modern economic conditions. One of such ways is to promote sectoral drivers of growth, that is, those industries and sectors of the national economy, the increase in demand for products in which has a significant positive impact on the economy. In this regard, the goal of this article is to identify and scientifically substantiate the need to stimulate the production of goods and services in economic sectors so as to promote structural changes in the economy at the national and regional levels. In this study, we consider mechanical engineering, information and communication technologies and tourism as drivers, which have a large multiplier effect and contribute to economic growth. The article assesses the consequences of stimulating the selected sectors of the economy in the context of structural changes both at the nationwide level and in the territorial context; this provision forms the scientific novelty of the study. The findings of the study reveal problems in development of mechanical engineering, information and communication technologies and tourism, confirm the importance of their development for the economy; the importance is expressed in a significant increase in the main economic indicators due to the increase in the production of goods and services. We use general scientific methods such as analysis, synthesis, comparison, generalization, and the tools based on the input-output methodology. In the future, we plan to continue our work aimed at determining the correspondence of the parameters of development of these sectors contained in the strategic documents and the results obtained in the study for a deeper understanding of the problems of structural adjustment of the economy.

AB  - The rapid urbanization and the constant expansion of urban areas during the last decades have locally led to increasing water shortage. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems have the potential to be an important contributor to urban water self-sufficiency. The goal of this study was to select an environmentally optimal RWH strategy in newly constructed residential buildings linked to rainwater demand for laundry under Mediterranean climatic conditions, without accounting for water from the mains.
   Different strategies were environmentally assessed for the design and use of RWH infrastructures in residential apartment blocks in Mediterranean climates. The harvested rainwater was used for laundry in all strategies. These strategies accounted for (i) tank location (i.e., tank distributed over the roof and underground tank), (ii) building height considering the number of stories (i.e., 6, 9, 12, and 15), and (iii) distribution strategy (i.e., shared laundry, supply to the nearest apartments, and distribution throughout the building). The RWH systems consisted of the catchment, storage, and distribution stages, and the structural and hydraulic calculations were based on Mediterranean conditions. The quantification of the environmental performance of each strategy (e.g., CO(2)eq. emissions) was performed in accordance with the life cycle assessment methodology.
   According to the environmental assessment, the tank location and distribution strategy chosen were the most important variables in the optimization of RWH systems. Roof tank strategies present fewer impacts than their underground tank equivalents because they enhance energy and material savings, and their reinforcement requirements can be accounted for within the safety factors of the building structure without the tank. Among roof tanks and depending on the height, a distribution strategy that concentrates demand in a laundry room was the preferable option, resulting in reductions from 25 to 54 % in most of the selected impact categories compared to distribution throughout the building.
   These results may set new urban planning standards for the design and construction of buildings from the perspective of sustainable water management. In this sense, a behavioral change regarding demand should be promoted in compact, dense urban settlements.

AB  - Background: Traditional climate knowledge is a comprehensive system of insights, experiences and practices used by peasant communities to deal with the uncertainties of climate conditions affecting their livelihood. This knowledge is today as relevant in the Mesoamerican and Andean regions as it is in Europe and Asia. Our research sought to analyze the traditional knowledge about the weather and climate in a rural village of the state of Tlaxcala, Mexico, and its importance in decision-making in agriculture.
   Methods: Through 30 interviews and participant observation in the community during 2013, information was gathered about traditional climate and weather indicators and prediction tools, as well as rituals and agronomic and agroforestry strategies. This information allowed for the reconstruction of the community's agro-festive calendar. Data analysis was carried out with the help of the qualitative analysis software Atlas.ti (version 7).
   Results: The socio-ecological importance of traditional knowledge about the climate lies in its ability to forecast local weather conditions and recognize climate variations, so vital to the food security of rural families. Knowledge about climate predictors is exchanged and passed on from generation to generation, contributing to the preservation and promotion of biodiversity. By observing the behavior of 16 animals and 12 plant species (both domestic and wild) as well as seven astronomical indicators, villagers are able to predict rain, dry weather and frosts. However, the continuity of this traditional knowledge in the community under study is now compromised by the little interest in agriculture characteristic of the younger generations, the ensuing abandonment of the countryside, the widespread economic crisis and the disappearance of animal and plant species.
   Conclusions: Traditional climate knowledge includes the understanding of weather events and weather changes at different time scales (hours, days, weeks, and seasons). The ability to interpret weather events thanks to the accumulated knowledge about the climate through generations may prove today a relevant tool for improving agricultural practices and dealing with local and global socio-ecological changes.

AB  - Despite the abundance of Fe and its significance in Earth history, there are no established robust biosignatures for Fe(II)-oxidizing micro-organisms. This limits our ability to piece together the history of Fe biogeochemical cycling and, in particular, to determine whether Fe(II)-oxidizers played a role in depositing ancient iron formations. A promising candidate for Fe(II)-oxidizer biosignatures is the distinctive morphology and texture of extracellular Fe(III)-oxyhydroxide stalks produced by mat-forming microaerophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing micro-organisms. To establish the stalk morphology as a biosignature, morphologic parameters must be quantified and linked to the microaerophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing metabolism and environmental conditions. Toward this end, we studied an extant model organism, the marine stalk-forming Fe(II)-oxidizing bacterium, Mariprofundus ferrooxydans PV-1. We grew cultures in flat glass microslide chambers, with FeS substrate, creating opposing oxygen/Fe(II) concentration gradients. We used solid-state voltammetric microelectrodes to measure chemical gradients in situ while using light microscopy to image microbial growth, motility, and mineral formation. In low-oxygen (2.7-28m) zones of redox gradients, the bacteria converge into a narrow (100m-1mm) growth band. As cells oxidize Fe(II), they deposit Fe(III)-oxyhydroxide stalks in this band; the stalks orient directionally, elongating toward higher oxygen concentrations. M.ferrooxydans stalks display a narrow range of widths and uniquely biogenic branching patterns, which result from cell division. Together with filament composition, these features (width, branching, and directional orientation) form a physical record unique to microaerophilic Fe(II)-oxidizer physiology; therefore, stalk morphology is a biosignature, as well as an indicator of local oxygen concentration at the time of formation. Observations of filamentous Fe(III)-oxyhydroxide microfossils from a similar to 170Ma marine Fe-Si hydrothermal deposit show that these morphological characteristics can be preserved in the microfossil record. This study demonstrates the potential of morphological biosignatures to reveal microbiology and environmental chemistry associated with geologic iron formation depositional processes.

AB  - Maximum daily trunk shrinkage is a common measurement in irrigation scheduling of fruit trees. But the strong relationship between these measurements and the environment severely limit field applications. Reference baselines are the solution for understanding the influence of environmental conditions. Nevertheless, the extrapolation out of the original conditions is not clear. The aim of this study was to compare several approaches to estimate a reference baseline in an olive orchard where there were no previous data from other seasons. Two orchards, separated 60 m, with different tree density were used. Orchard I had greater tree density than orchard 2, though the age and the cultivar were the same. Trunk diameters of both orchards were similar but the crown volume of orchard 2 was slightly lower than orchard 1. The current reference baselines of maximum daily trunk diameter in both orchards were not significantly different between them (p < 0.05). In orchard 1, the previous reference baseline was calculated in a 5-year study (the so called multi-seasons approach). The multi-seasons approach was not significantly different in slope but it was in the y-interception to the current reference baselines in both orchards (p < 0.05). This approach over-estimated the values in both orchards. Two additional approaches were tested. These latter approaches used data before massive pit hardening to estimate the current reference baseline. One of them used the early data to estimate a complete reference baseline (the so-called early approach). The other (the so-called y-early approach) used the same data only to estimate the y-interception and assumed that the slope was the same as in the multi-seasons approach. The early approach under-estimated the value of maximum daily trunk shrinkage. The early-y approach provided a satisfactory estimation of the reference baseline and improved those obtained with the multi-seasons approach. The limitations and uses in irrigation scheduling are also discussed. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Generation of secondary biogenic methane in coal beds is likely controlled by a combination of factors such as the bioavailability, of coal carbon, the presence of a microbial community to convert coal carbon to methane, and an environment supporting microbial growth and methanogenesis. A set of treatments and controls was developed to bioassay the bioavailability, of coal for conversion to methane under defined laboratory conditions. Treatments included adding a well-characterized consortium of bacteria and methanogens (enriched from modern wetland sediments) and providing conditions to support endemic microbial activity. The contribution of desorbed methane in the bioassays was determined in treatments with bromoethane sulfonic acid, an inhibitor of microbial methanogenesis. The bioassay compared 16 subbituminous coal samples collected from beds in Texas (TX), Wyoming (WY), and Alaska (AK), and two bituminous coal samples from Pennsylvania (PA). New biogenic methane was observed in several samples of subbituminous coal with the microbial consortium added, but endemic activity was less commonly observed. The highest methane generation [80 mu mol methane/g coal (56 scf/ton or 1.75 cm(3)/g)] was from a south TX coal sample that was collected from a non-gas-producing well. Subbituminous coals from the Powder River Basin, WY and North Slope Borough, AK contained more sorbed (original) methane than the TX coal sample and generated 0-23 mu mol/g (up to 16 scf/ton or 0.5 cm(3)/g) new biogenic methane in the bioassay. Standard indicators of thermal maturity such as burial depth, nitrogen content, and calorific value did not explain differences in biogenic methane among subbituminous coal samples. No original methane was observed in two bituminous samples from PA, nor was any new methane generated in bioassays of these samples. The bioassay offers a new tool for assessing the potential of coal for biogenic methane generation, and provides a platform for studying the mechanisms involved in this economically important activity.

AB  - Monitoring of estuarine condition depends on water quality parameters that have significant and interpretable ecological effects and can be assessed either in situ or via rapid laboratory techniques. Two commonly measured parameters are water column turbidity (NTU) and total suspended solids (TSS). Under certain conditions, either of these measures could represent a proxy for runoff and provide rapid, in situ measures to improve protection of the public by decreasing the time required to detect and monitor associated effects (e.g., reduced water clarity and eutrophication). The Neuse River Estuary (NRE) has experienced a decline in water quality due to anthropogenic inputs, including stormwater containing nutrient and particle loads. Water samples were collected from the NRE, during both dry weather and storm events over 16 mo across the entire estuarine gradient. Particle size distributions, ratio of particulate organic carbon to nitrogen, chlorophyll a (chi a), TSS, and NTU were measured in each of these samples, with the data separated into regions based on salinity and depth of sample collection. Particle analyses were directed at identifying suspensions dominated by phytoplankton, runoff particles, or resuspended sediments. Particle size distributions for suspensions in Region I (all samples with salinity less than 2) varied little during sampling, resulting in a robust NTU-TSS relationship. This relationship confirmed the usefulness of turbidity as a measure of runoff and resuspension of recently deposited runoff in the upper NRE. Phytoplankton cells represented a majority of the particles in Region II (surface samples with salinity greater than 2), based on the close relationship between chl a and total particle volume in these samples. Suspensions of large, nearly uniform diameter particles, which are likely aggregates and resuspended sediment, were observed in Region III (bottom samples with salinity greater than 2). Using these techniques as part of routine monitoring, particle suspension measures in different hydrographic regions of an estuary provide evidence useful for identifying the source and water quality consequences of particle suspensions (e.g., microbial contamination and algal blooms).

AB  - Realistic atmospheric, runoff, throughflow, and tidal forcing (in some cases) functions are used to drive a numerical simulation, using the Princeton Ocean Model (POM), of the seasonal cycle for Prince William Sound (PWS), Alaska circulation during 1996. Physical observations from the Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) Program are used to provide initial conditions and open (lateral) boundary conditions, and, above all, for model validation. This study is the first comprehensive model validation effort for PWS using realistic model attributes and a variety of observations.
   Considering the uncertainties in the forcing functions, the seasonal cycles of upper ocean heating and salinification exhibit substantial agreement between simulations and observations. The flow fields exhibit characteristic patterns associated with both seasonal variations and wind transients ("weather cycle"). Contrasting results of two extreme cases, one with daily velocity profiles given at the Hinchinbrook Entrance (HE) open boundary and the other with only the monthly transport given there, clearly demonstrates the importance of detailed temporal/spatial flow structures at the HE open boundary on the estimation of circulation and stratification in PWS. For example, hourly wind forcing alone is not capable of reproducing synoptic variations in the observed temperature and velocity, indicative of the importance of horizontal advection from outside PWS.
   However, discrepancies in thermohaline and velocity structure indicate the need for future refinements, especially in the forcing functions and domain selection prior to detailed diagnostic studies. For example, the interactions between PWS and the adjacent continental shelf were prescribed at open boundaries from incomplete information, and, thus, did not admit the full range of dynamical interchange between PWS and the shelf. Furthermore, substantially more time-depth observations of the flow and mass fields are needed for validating the present generation of comprehensive numerical circulation models for PWS so they can be more widely used in applications.

AB  - Uptake, assimilation and compartmentation of phosphate were studied in the opportunist green macroalga Ulva lactuca and the estuarine red algal epiphyte Catenella nipae. The Michaelis - Menten model was used to describe uptake rates of inorganic phosphate (P-i) at different concentrations. Maximum uptake rates (V-max) of P-starved material exceeded V-max of P-enriched material; this difference was greater for C. nipae. Uptake and allocation of phosphorus ( P) to internal pools was measured using trichloroacetic acid ( TCA) extracts and P-32. Both species demonstrated similar assimilation paths: when P-enriched, most P-32 accumulated as free phosphate. When unenriched, P-32 was rapidly assimilated into the TCA-insoluble pool. C. nipae consistently assimilated more P-32 into this pool than U. lactuca, indicating C. nipae has a greater P-storage capacity. In both species, P-32 release data showed two internal compartments with very different biological half-lives. The rapidly exchanging compartment had a short half-life of approximate to 2 to 12 min, while the slowly exchanging compartment had a much longer half-life of 12 days in P-starved C. nipae or 4 days in P-starved U. lactuca. In both species, the slowly exchanging compartment accounted for more than 90% of total tissue. U. lactuca and C. nipae responded differently to high external Pi. U. lactuca rapidly took up P-i, transferring this P-i into tissue phosphate and TCA-soluble P in a few hours (approximate to90% of total P). C. nipae took up P-i at lower rates and stored much of this P in less mobile TCA-insoluble forms. Long-term storage of refractory forms of P makes C. nipae a useful bioindicator of the prevailing conditions of Pi availability over at least the previous 7 days, whereas the P-status of U. lactuca may reflect conditions over no more than the previous few hours or days. C. nipae is a more useful bioindicator for P status of estuarine and marine waters than U. lactuca.

AB  - Mineral accumulation in vegetative giant parts and in mature kernels has been proposed as an indirect selection criterion, either in addition to, or in substitution of, carbon isotope discrimination (Delta), to assess grain yield of temperate cereals in Mediterranean areas. However, the association between mineral concentration, in different plant parts, and grain yield is not yet fully understood. In order to study these relationships, four rain-fed trials were established in northeastern Spain involving 10 two-rowed barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivars. Carbon isotope discrimination and total ash concentration were measured at maturity in kernels and straw. As expected, the Delta values of kernels (Delta-K) and straw (Delta-S) were positively correlated within environments. By contrast, Delta-K and ash concentration in kernels were often negatively related within environments, which suggests that mineral accumulation in kernels is not associated with the transpiration efficiency of the plants during grain filling. The lack of a positive relationship between ash concentration in the straw and either Delta-K or Delta-S indicates that ash concentration in vegetative tissues sampled at maturity may be of limited value as a surrogate of Delta. Grain yield correlated positively with either Delta-K or Delta-S, and negatively with ash concentration in kernels, especially in the poorest rain-fed environments. However, the ash concentration in the straw was not consistently associated with grain yield. While our results confirm that Delta traits are valid indicators of grain yield under Mediterranean conditions, the use of ash concentration in kernels for screening purposes is not warranted at this time due to the lack of a more accurate understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying mineral accumulation in kernels. Prediction of grain yield through multiple linear regression has shown, however, that ash concentration in kernels could be used as a complementary criterion to Delta in poor rain-fed environments.

AB  - Production of irrigated rice (Oryza sativa L.) without conventional soil submergence may increase water use efficiency but risk a decline in rice yield. Spatial variability in rice yield and relationships among yield and soil properties were examined across a 3.3-ha experimental site after uniform crop management. The site was initially consolidated from small, previously puddled parcels of land into eight laser-leveled plots across a 2.1-m elevation gradient in the Philippines. Six crops of rice in rotation with three crops of mungbean (Vigna radiates (L.) R. Wilczek) were then grown from January 2012 to March 2015. The four rice crops in the dry season (crops 1, 2, 4, and 6) were irrigated using an overhead sprinkler system to maintain soil water potential greater than -10 kPa without soil submergence. Soil was puddled and flooded with irrigation for only rice crop 5 grown in the wet season. Mean rice yield with full fertilization was 6.1 Mg ha(-1) for crop 2 but only 3.6 Mg ha(-1) for crop 6. Yield for rice crop 6 ranged from 1.6 to 5.4 Mg ha(-1) across 36 locations in the 3.3-ha site. Rice yield for crop 6 was inversely related to soil bulk density (r = -0.72 and -0.80, P < 0.001), log(10) saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) (r =-0.71, P < 0.001), and sand content (r =-0.63, P < 0.001). Yield was directly related to water-filled pore space of soil (r = 0.61, P < 0.001). Field locations with large downward water movement and the correspondingly most aerobic soil conditions were most prone to low rice yields and large yield decline. Rice yield was directly related to anaerobic N mineralization (r = 0.72, P < 0.001) and soil ammonium-N (r = 0.54, P < 0.001) at 16 days after transplanting and to indigenous N supply (r = 0.83, P < 0.001), as determined from rice yield without application of fertilizer N. These relationships suggested lower net N mineralization at locations with the most aerobic soil conditions, as determined by water-filled pore space. Rice yield was, however, not limited by insufficient fertilizer N. Anaerobic N mineralization and indigenous N supply were unrelated to optimum fertilizer N rate calculated from yield gain with fertilizer N, which was determined at 36 locations using paired plots with and without added N. The long rainy season and clayey soil at the site limited triple-cropping systems to two rice crops and only one non-rice crop per year. In such environments where crop rotation is not an option to prevent yield decline for rice grown without soil submergence, periodic soil submergence to increase anaerobic soil conditions would be required to sustain rice yield. Our study suggested that soil bulk density and K-sat, which can increase for successive rice crops grown without puddling and soil submergence, could serve as indicators of field locations prone to yield decline from factors other than water-deficit stress and requiring a period of soil submergence to sustain large rice yields.

AB  - When climate shifts abruptly changes occur so rapidly and unexpectedly that human and natural systems have difficulty adapting to, or coping wilt, them. By using palaeoclimatic indicators such as tree and coral growth rings, ice cores and deep sea sediments, climate scientists have uncovered mans' instances of abrupt and relatively short-lived climate changes in the past. These abrupt changes (some taking place within several 50 years) are especially evident over the last 100,000 tears when the planet, under longer-term Mlilankovitch and other forcings, was slipping into and then out of an ice age. Relatively short-term thermohaline (temperature and salt) driven changes ire the vigour and distribution of ocean currents are believed to lie at the heart of the abrupt climate shifts. In particular: thermohaline driven changes between three `modes' of the North Atlantic Conveyor (incorporating the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift) are held to be the key factor explaining abrupt climate shifts over the North Atlantic and adjacent regions. By switching from `on' mode (maximum beat advection) to a `half-on')node (moderate heat advection) to all 'off' mode (little heat advection) and back again, the Northern Conveyor is thought to drive the main pattern in abrupt climate change in the North Atlantic region during the last ice age, This pattern involves multiple sequences of rapid switching from relatively warm periods (interstadials), to cold periods (Dansgaard-Oeschger events) to very cold episodes (Heinrich events) and then back to warm interstadial periods.
   By, currently releasing massive quantities of fresh water into the North Atlantic through ice melt global warming today is seen us a powerful mechanism able to switch the present 'on' state of the Northern Conveyor to the 'half-on' and even the 'off' mode condition, Global warming paridoxically has the potential to plunge the northern Atlantic region into new glacial conditions Because some scientists and others lit the media believe lit the return or near return of an ice age, this possibility is addressed ire our article. Using modern high quality palaeoclimate data (ice cores and deep sea sediments a comparison of the last four interglacials, including MIS 11 (430,000 years ago), shows its that natural factors alone are unlikely to cause it quick return to ice age conditions, lit addition, theoretical and empirical fndings together with modelling studies of the Northern Conveyor reveal theft although there is likely to be a significant weakening; lit the Gulf Stream/North Atlantic Drift by the end of the present century, a total collapse of the system is not expected. lit to ruts of our future climate, therefore, we should expect continued warming as a result of anthropogenic release of greenhouse gases rather than cooling over the next 50-80 years. One favourite climate scenario suggests that cooling by a shut-down of the Cuff Stream at the end of tire present century is more than likely to he balanced by global warming. In the final analysis, however, there are trio many uncertainties in the science of climate change for us to be confident of what the climate will be like on the future. What we do know with a better level of authority is that abrupt climate chande was a feature of the past, and it could well be one the future.

AB  - We studied the interaction between the indicators of lipid exchange and thyroid status among the inhabitants of radiation contaminated territories under additional psycho-emotional load. We observed 170 students aged between 18-24 and divided them into a control group of students who were from areas unaffected by radiation (70 people) and the main experimental group of students from territories of increased radio-ecological load (IV radiation zone, 100 people). We determined the content of thyrotropic hormone (TTH), triiodothyronine (T-3), thyroxin (T-4), total cholesterin (TC), triglycerides (TG), cholesterin of lipoproteins of high density (Ch-LPHD) and cholesterin of lipoproteins of low density (Ch-LPLD). We found that people who had lived since birth in territories which were contaminated with radionuclides and were affected by prolonged influence of small doses of ionizing radiation had significant fluctuations of indicators of concentrations of TTH, T-3 and T-4, forming manifestations of hypothyroidism and hyperthyrosis among some of those tested. Independently from hyperthyrosis, the effect was accompanied by growth in the level of TH, TG, Ch-LPHD and Ch-LPLD. Persons with manifestations of hypothyroidism had the content of TH above the upper limit of the homeostatic norm and the level of Ch-LPLD was higher than the norm in sub-groups with features of hypo-and hyperthyrosis. All those tested from the main group showed a significant positive correlation connection between the level of TTH and levels of TH and Ch-LPLD. The subgroup with manifestations of hyperthyrosis had a positive correlation between the levels of TTH and TG, the subgroups with manifestations of euthyroidism and hyperthyrosis had a negative correlation between the levels of TTH and Ch-LPHD. The hyperthyrosis subgroup had a significant positive correlation connection between T-3 and TH and Ch-LPLD. The euthyroidism and hypothyroidism subgroups had a significant negative correlation between T-3 concentration and Ch-LPLD. The cortisol indicator positively correlated with levels of TH and Ch-LPLD in all subgroups divided according to thyroid status. In the conditions of additional psycho-emotional load (examinations), those tested had an increased level of TP (higher than the norm in the subgroups of hyperthyrosis and hypothyroidism) caused by the increase in cortisol level and a tendency of decrease in TTH. At the same time, the level of Ch-LPLD increased (higher than the upper norm) as a result of decrease in the content of Ch-LPHL. The coefficient of correlation between the level of TTH and levels of TH and Ch-LPLD lost statistical significance in all subgroups divided according to thyroid status. In the hyperthyrosis subgroup, the effect of loss of correlation with TH and Ch-LPLD was also observed for T-3. Thus, the individuals tested from territories polluted by radionuclides, had proaterogenic changes dependant on thyroid status, which can become a precondition for the development of metabolic syndrome. The risk of dyslipidemia increases in the conditions of additional psychoemotional load, when the regulatory effect of the thyroid gland's hormones is reduced.

AB  - Control of walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) recruitment in the Eastern Bering Sea involves complex interactions between bottom-up and top-down processes, although the mechanisms are poorly understood. We used statistical models to test the leading hypotheses linking recruitment variability to biotic and abiotic factors. Consistent with a "cold-pool hypothesis", recruitment of pollock was significantly stronger if winters preceding the larval (age-0) and juvenile stages (age-1) were mild. However, our results did not support the proposed top-down mechanism (cannibalism) underlying this hypothesis. Several empirical relationships support an "oscillating control hypothesis". As predicted by it, the effect of ice conditions on survival during the larval and early juvenile stages was modified by the abundance of adult pollock, implying stronger bottom-up control when adult abundance (hence cannibalism) was low. The proposed bottom-up mechanism predicts that the survival of pelagic-feeding walleye pollock (benthic-feeding yellowfin sole), should be higher during years with an early (late) ice retreat, which was confirmed by our analysis. Our results also provide additional evidence for a "larval transport hypothesis", which states that cannibalism of larval and juvenile pollock is reduced in years when strong northward advection separates juveniles from cannibalistic adults.
   In addition to testing existing hypotheses, we identified new relationships between spawner-to-recruit survival rates of walleye pollock and several indicators of mixed layer dynamics during the spring and summer. Survival rates and recruitment were significantly reduced when larval or early juvenile stages experienced a delay in the (non-ice-associated) spring bloom as a result of stormy spring conditions, suggesting that the timing of the spring bloom is critical to both first-feeding larvae and age-1 juveniles. Furthermore, a dome-shaped relationship between pollock survival and summer wind mixing at the early juvenile stage is consistent with modeling and laboratory studies showing an increase in survival at low to moderate levels of wind mixing, but a decrease in feeding success at high levels of wind mixing.
   Top-down controls also regulate recruitment of walleye pollock. At least one-third of the variability in spawner-to-recruit survival could be accounted for by predation mortality at the early juvenile stage (age-1). Predation of juvenile pollock can be attributed largely to cannibalism, which varies with the abundance of adult pollock and with the availability of juveniles to adult predators. A simple index reflecting the spatial overlap between juvenile and adult pollock explained 30-50%, of the overall variability in recruitment, similar to the variability explained by the best environmental predictors. Although environmental effects are difficult to separate from the effects of predation, we conclude that bottom-up and top-down processes are equally important in controlling the survival of pollock from spawning to recruitment at age 2. However, the magnitude of top-down control is itself modified by environmental factors that control the availability of juvenile pollock to adults (through impacts on spatial distribution) and the abundance of adult predators (through effects on productivity and carrying capacity).

AB  - This experimental investigation examines the processes that control the grain-size sorting and geometry of cross strata in dunes and unit bars, in particular the effects of bedform superimposition and flow unsteadiness. Cross stratification formed by dunes and unit bars is the most common sedimentary structure in river-channel deposits, and is common in many other depositional environments. Previous work by Reesink and Bridge (2007) shows that the grain-size variation that allows cross strata to be recognized is determined by three main factors: (1) pre-sorting by superimposed bedforms and flow unsteadiness; (2) sorting during deposition on the lee slope, and; (3) reworking of the slope by currents in the lee of the bedform. Differences in the relative importance of these three factors cause cross strata to be more varied in their geometry, grain-size sorting and permeability than commonly realized, and provide information for detailed quantitative interpretation of river-channel deposits.
   The experiments presented in this paper cover a wide range of steady and unsteady flow conditions with different combinations of host and superimposed bedforms. Lee-side deposition was highly variable at the time required for the buildup of cross strata, but systematic variations related to bed morphology provided good indicators of flow conditions. Water currents in the lee-side flow separation zone affect initial deposition on the lee slope and can re-distribute sediment on the lee slope. Centimeter-scale turbulent eddies were observed to increase the tangential shape, decrease the (vertical) grain-size separation, and reduce the thickness of the cross strata. These effects of turbulent eddies were found to increase with increasing flow velocity, decreasing grain size, and decreasing bedform height.
   Flow unsteadiness was primarily expressed in a change of host and/or superimposed bedform type. The pre-sorting pattern formed by the superimposed bedforms is lost if the pre-sorting involves less sediment than the processes that re-sort the sediment on the lee slope (e.g. grainflows). If the pre-sorting pattern of the superimposed bedforms can be identified, the cross strata they form can be used to interpret host and superimposed bedform geometries. The presence of reactivation surfaces indicates that superimposed bedform heights (Hs) exceed 25% of the host bedform height (H; Hs/H>0.25). Pre-sorting by superimposed bedforms is recognizable as cross stratification where Hs/H<0.25, and comprises: (i) drapes of fine-grained sediment that settles from suspension during the passage of the superimposed trough, and; (ii) a body of coarse-grained bedload with a cross-sectional area that equals the cross-sectional area of the formative superimposed bedform. The distinctiveness and lateral extent of fine-grained drapes represent the distinctiveness and lateral extent of their formative superimposed troughs. The lateral extent and internal grain-size sorting of the thick, coarser-grained body represents the lateral extent and internal grain-size sorting of the body of the superimposed bedform. The plan view shape of the host lee slope controls the cross-stream geometry of cross strata. Thus, cross strata can be used to interpret type, size. and geometry of the host and superimposed bedforms, hence flow and sediment transport condition on the back of the host bedform.

AB  - Mankind has struggled with many diseases throughout history and this struggle still continues today. It can be seen that epidemics generally have more negative effects on social life in social, political, cultural and educational areas, especially the economy. State administrators have also taken various measures to prevent such epidemic diseases according to the conditions of the period. Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), which first appeared in Wuhan city of People's Republic of China in December 2019 and began to threaten the whole world from here, is spreading very quickly. As a result of this situation, World Health Organization (WHO) declared this disease as pandemic (global epidemic) on March 11, 2020. Nations are collaborating against this disease which is seen in almost all countries of the world and they are taking some precautions. It is stated by the authorities that the measures taken alone by countries cannot be enough to prevent such global epidemics and that nations should act as a global whole. In addition, it is clear that societies' activating their internal dynamics social, political, religious, cultural, etc.- can be effective at the point of preventing/taking under control this global epidemic. Variables that may occur regionally, locally or globally have a significant role in the spread or prevention of diseases. Minstrels, who have undertaken the duty to express the pain, problems, happiness, love, fears and enthusiasm of the people in every period and who have thus become their spokesperson in a sense, were not indifferent to this novel virus and they expressed the existing situation and the conditions brought about by this condition in their poems. This study discusses how minstrels addressed and expressed their views about how the society perceived the situation with the emergence of the virus in the poems in their social media accounts and various platforms. In this way, the study aims to understand in which direction minstrels manipulate the society and what kind of social responsibility they undertake on the issue. It can be stated that during the global epidemic, minstrels created poems on many issues such as curfew, coronavirus opportunists, opposing spiritual values, the effects of the virus on economic and social life, holy places being empty, social media posts, abiding by the rules of cleaning, taking a break from education, praising healthcare workers, call to stay at home, reproach to the source of the virus, persecution to East Turkistan, and reaction to world leaders and thus interpreted the feelings of the people. In addition, it was found that all the stakeholders fulfilled their duty in the continuation of tradition in the face of this global epidemic. Bringing many elements of the tradition minstrel act, minstrel call-and-response, telling stories and fairy tales, etc.- to the viewers/listeners especially by making use of social media can be evaluated as the most important indicator that the tradition is continued in the liveliest way. Despite the views of minstrels on making use of folk medicine in the face of epidemic diseases in previous centuries, it is quite remarkable that today's minstrels stand in favour of modern medicine and this should be considered as a change of mentality.

AB  - The heat produced by animal cells in culture can be used as the primary indicator of the kinetics of their metabolism because the scalar flux of it is a function of the metabolic flux. The validity of the relationship between heat and metabolism was demonstrated theoretically through the concept of thermal advancement and in experiments by the use of continuous cultures. This validation permitted the application of heat flux as a probe of the metabolic state of cells in culture. It consisted of an on-line heat conduction microcalorimeter that measures the instantaneous heat flow and dividing the smoothed signal with one obtained simultaneously using a dielectric spectrometer that records the change in capacitance as an estimate of the amount of viable biomass. In this mini-review, it is shown with Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO320) genetically engineered to produce interferon-gamma IFN-gamma) that heat flux is an early signal of deteriorating metabolism in cultures that produce considerable amounts of toxic lactate under fully aerobic conditions. The early detection favours the use of heat flux as the control variable in fed-batch cultures. This is a particularly useful finding in the context of the pharmaceutical industry because it will help to ensure the high fidelity of the cytokines, antibodies and vaccines produced in large-scale cultures. The monotonic relationship between the fluxes for heat and metabolism means that the enthalpy balance method can be employed to test the validity of the growth reaction for cells in culture. This showed that the crucial ratio between the substrates, glucose and glutamine, in the culture medium was incorrect at 5.5:1 instead of about 3:1, depending on the phase of the culture. Together with other changes to the medium composition, an improved formulation was made that ensured faster cell growth and greater specific rate (flux) of IFN-gamma constitutive secretion while decreasing glucose utilisation and, most importantly, halving the excretion of lactate, that is toxic to the cells and harmful to the fidelity of their secondary products. Indirect calorimetry (oxygen uptake rate, OUR) is often favoured over the direct technique, but the former only measures aerobic metabolism. The environmental conditions in cultures favours lactate production even under fully aerobic conditions. Developments in measuring OUR mean that the stationary liquid phase balance can be used successfully to make the calorimetric:respirometric (CR) ratio a valuable tool in optimising cell culture to grow cells that synthesise the maximum amounts of the high fidelity secondary products.
   Besides the value of heat flux in improving the cultures of animal cells producing heterologous products, three different techniques are examined that should be valuable in the testing the many compounds that are produced on a speculative basis as potential drugs. They are: (i) a thin-film thermopile transducer as an immunosensor; (ii) infra-red imaging of cells cultured in multi-well microtitre plates and (iii) integrated circuit (IC) calorimetry for small samples and low detection limit. One or more of these methods could well find favour with industry in the near future. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper tests the hypothesis that human population and city function are key drivers of biochemical burden in an inter-city system, which can be used to inform One Health actions as it enables a holistic understanding of city's metabolism encompassing all of the activities of a city in a single model: from lifestyle choices, through to health status and exposure to harmful chemicals as well as effectiveness of implemented management strategies. Chemical mining of wastewater for biophysico-chemical indicators (BCIs) was undertaken to understand speciation of BCIs in the context of geographical as well as community-wide socioeconomic factors. Spatiotemporal variabilities in chemical and biological target groups in the studied inter-city system were observed. A linear relationship (R-2 > 0.99) and a strong positive correlation between most BCIs and population size (r > 0.998, p < 0.001) were observed which provides a strong evidence for the population size as a driver of BCI burden. BCI groups that are strongly correlated with population size and are intrinsic to humans' function include mostly high usage pharmaceuticals that are linked with long term non-communicable conditions (NSAIDs, analgesics, cardiovascular, mental health and antiepileptics) and lifestyle chemicals. These BCIs can be used as population size markers. BCIs groups that are produced as a result of a specific city's function (e.g. industry presence and occupational exposure or agriculture) and as such are not correlated with population size include: pesticides, PCPs and industrial chemicals. These BCIs can be used to assess city's function, such as occupational exposure, environmental or food exposure, and as a proxy of community-wide health. This study confirmed a strong positive correlation between antibiotics (ABs), population size and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This confirms the population size and AB usage as the main driver of AB and ARG levels and provides an opportunity for interventions aimed at the reduction of AB usage to reduce AMR. Holistic evaluation of biophysicochemical fingerprints (BCI burden) of the environment and data triangulation with socioeconomic fingerprints (indices) of tested communities are required to fully embrace One Health concept.

AB  - Sustainability is a complex theorem driven through the optimisation of interconnected economic, social and environmental parameters. Balancing trade-offs between these three parameters is used to define a sustainable system, and while economic and, to a degree, environmental parameters can be numericised, making optimisation more defined, social parameters are often more complex. In livestock systems, animal welfare is held as a central pillar of sustainability, but due to its complex nature, indicators of welfare are in practice often restricted to negative nutritional/environmental/health domains (e.g. poor food quality, injuries/diseases) rather than the wider more complex 'behavioural' or 'mental state' domain indicators (e.g. expression of rewarding behaviours). This perspective discusses the potential synergies and trade-offs between animal welfare and economic, societal and environmental pillars of sustainability for grazing ruminant systems. Grazing is often considered more animal welfare-friendly than housed or feedlot type systems, especially in relation to the behavioural and mental state domains (BMSD) within a more 'natural' environment, as it may provide a positive experience to the animal. However, the welfare status of grazing ruminants can differ with factors such as management practices and environmental conditions greatly influencing nutritional/environmental/health domains of welfare, where a more 'controlled environment' can be efficacious. Animals that are not maintained at a good level of welfare will not express their productive potential, although improving welfare standards may lead to higher costs of production and therefore an economic break, as a critical component of sustainability, is often applied to what can be achieved on farm. Increasing animal performance is seen as an effective approach to reducing emissions intensity, which has been borne out by the lower methane intensity of high-yielding dairy housed herds, although there are important ethical concerns regarding BMSD of animal welfare and the marked restriction in environmental choices and in foraging behaviour (negative effect on behavioural interactions). However, consumers need to understand that implementing more 'natural' production systems with higher animal welfare standards can incur extra costs for producers, leading to higher output prices and also higher emissions per unit of product, which will require a reduction in consumption to reduce overall emissions.

AB  - Ship-based time series, some now approaching over 3 decades long, are critical climate records that have dramatically improved our ability to characterize natural and anthropogenic drivers of ocean carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake and biogeochemical processes. Advancements in autonomous marine carbon sensors and technologies over the last 2 decades have led to the expansion of observations at fixed time series sites, thereby improving the capability of characterizing sub-seasonal variability in the ocean. Here, we present a data product of 40 individual autonomous moored surface ocean pCO(2) (partial pressure of CO2) time series established between 2004 and 2013, 17 also include autonomous pH measurements. These time series characterize a wide range of surface ocean carbonate conditions in different oceanic (17 sites), coastal (13 sites), and coral reef (10 sites) regimes. A time of trend emergence (ToE) methodology applied to the time series that exhibit well-constrained daily to interannual variability and an estimate of decadal variability indicates that the length of sustained observations necessary to detect statistically significant anthropogenic trends varies by marine environment. The ToE estimates for seawater pCO(2) and pH range from 8 to 15 years at the open ocean sites, 16 to 41 years at the coastal sites, and 9 to 22 years at the coral reef sites. Only two open ocean pCO(2) time series, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Hawaii Ocean Time-series Station (WHOTS) in the subtropical North Pacific and Stratus in the South Pacific gyre, have been deployed longer than the estimated trend detection time and, for these, deseasoned monthly means show estimated anthropogenic trends of 1.9 +/- 0.3 and 1.6 +/- 0.3 mu atm yr(-1), respectively. In the future, it is possible that updates to this product will allow for the estimation of anthropogenic trends at more sites; however, the product currently provides a valuable tool in an accessible format for evaluating climatology and natural variability of surface ocean carbonate chemistry in a variety of regions.

AB  - Phenology has become a good indicator for illustrating the long-term changes in the natural resources of the Yangtze River Delta. However, two issues can be observed from previous studies. On the one hand, existing time-series classification methods mainly using a single classifier, the discrimination power, can become deteriorated due to fluctuations characterizing the time series. On the other hand, previous work on the Yangtze River Delta was limited in the spatial domain (usually to 16 cities) and in the temporal domain (usually 2000-2010). To address these issues, this study attempts to analyze the spatiotemporal variation in phenology in the Yangtze River Delta (with 26 cities, enlarged by the state council in June 2016), facilitated by classifying the land cover types and extracting the phenological metrics based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series collected from 2001 to 2015. First, ensemble learning (EL)-based classifiers are used for land cover classification, where the training samples (a total of 201,597) derived from visual interpretation based on GlobelLand30 are further screened using vertex component analysis (VCA), resulting in 600 samples for training and the remainder for validating. Then, eleven phenological metrics are extracted by TIMESAT (a package name) based on the time series, where a seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on loess (STL-decomposition) is used to remove spikes and a Savitzky-Golay filter is used for filtering. Finally, the spatio-temporal phenology variation is analyzed by considering the classification maps and the phenological metrics. The experimental results indicate that: 1) random forest (RF) obtains the most accurate classification map (with an overall accuracy higher than 96%); 2) different land cover types illustrate the various seasonalities; 3) the Yangtze River Delta has two obvious regions, i.e., the north and the south parts, resulting from different rainfall, temperature, and ecosystem conditions; 4) the phenology variation over time is not significant in the study area; 5) the correlation between gross spring greenness (GSG) and gross primary productivity (GPP) is very high, indicating the potential use of GSG for assessing the carbon flux.

AB  - The relevance. One of the most effective methods of vvastewater treatment is the biochemical one, which makes it possible to remove almost completely various dissolved organic substances from wastewater. To improve the oxidative power of aeration tanks and control the biochemical process of vvastewater treatment, it was necessary to determine experimentally the variability of the biocenosis under the influence of the environment and other factors. The main aim of the research is to intensify biological wastewater treatment by means of direct effect upon the metabolism of activated sludge microorganisms Objects: species and quantitative composition of microorganisms as a result of treatment of domestic wastewater in aeration tanks; structure and composition of enzymes formed at purification. Methods: research of biocenosis, methods of hydrobiological control of activated sludge and microscopy of activated sludge. During microscopy of activated sludge, the functional state of organisms, especially indicator ones, is determined, organisms are counted by one or another method of quantitative accounting, they are classified by indicator groups, then the type of biocenosis and its characteristic features are determined. To study microorganisms of activated sludge using microscopy, the method of live drops under a coverslip is used. Results. Based on the carried out research it was identified that the removal of ammonium nitrogen and phosphorus pollution to standard allowable value in continuous -flow aerotanks without anaerobic zones is unattainable. Organic matters in aquatic medium oppress nitrifying bacteria development, therefore nitrification begins only after oxidation of carboniferous organic compounds under the conditions of the first stage of nitrification. Nitrobacteria are also capable to accumulate polyphosphates in their cells. Normally, considering superficial nitrification and phosphates demand of bacteria, biological treatment removes from 10 to 30 % of the dissolved phosphorus compounds. For developing nitrobacteria in retrofit designed aerotanks, it is possible to apply the attached micro flora by means of various loadings and creation of anaerobic zones in one of the corridors, with the mixer and recycling of sludge mix in the construction head. The research of activated sludge biocenosis on its development stages helps determine the dominating forms of organisms in aerotanks working with different sludge loads. Smooth aerotank operating in activated sludge allows the constant biocenosis corresponding to a particular developmental stage. Biocenosis change demonstrates the change of aerotank operating mode.

AB  - The Adelie Basin, located offshore of the Wilkes Land margin, experiences unusually high sedimentation rates (-2 cm yr(-1)) for the Antarctic coast. This study sought to compare depthwise changes in organic matter (OM) quantity and quality with changes in microbial biomass with depth at this high-deposition site and an offshore continental margin site. Sediments from both sites were collected during the International Ocean Drilling (IODP) Program Expedition 318. Viable microbial biomass was estimated from concentrations of bacterial-derived phospholipid fatty acids, while OM quality was assessed using four different amino acid degradation proxies. Concentrations of total hydrolysable amino acids (THAA) measured from the continental margin suggest an oligotrophic environment, with THAA concentrations representing only 2% of total organic carbon with relative proportions of non-protein amino acids p-alanine and gamma-aminobutyric acid as high as 40%. In contrast, THAA concentrations from the near-shore Adelie Basin represent 40%-60% of total organic carbon. Concentrations of p-alanine and gamma-aminobutyric acid were often below the detection limit and suggest that the OM of the basin as labile. DI values in surface sediments at the Adelie and margin sites were measured to be +0.78 and-0.76, reflecting labile and more recalcitrant OM, respectively. Greater DI values in deeper and more anoxic portions of both cores correlated positively with increased relative concentrations of phenylalanine plus tyrosine and may represent a change of redox conditions, rather than OM quality. This suggests that DI values calculated along chemical profiles should be interpreted with caution. THAA concentrations, the percentage of organic carbon (C-AA%) and total nitrogen (N-AA%) represented by amino acids at both sites demonstrated a significant positive correlation with bacterial abundance estimates. These data suggest that the selective degradation of amino acids, as indicated by THAA concentrations, C-AA% or N-AA% values may be a better proxy for describing the general changes in sedimentary bacterial abundances than total organic matter or bulk sedimentation rates.

AB  - The OSPAR convention signed in 1992 by 15 European states including Belgium and France pledged to reduce the nutrient (nitrogen N and phosphorus P) loads from land-based sources to the Channel and the North Sea to half of what they were in 1985. In this paper, we use a river basin-coastal sea chain model to describe the evolution of nutrient loads to the Belgian Costal Zone originating from the Seine, Somme and Scheldt watersheds from 1984 to 2007 in order to assess the N and P reduction with respect to the OSPAR goals and the resulting effect on coastal eutrophication, especially Phaeocystis blooms. Since the early 1990s, most nutrient reduction actions have been devoted to domestic and industrial wastewater treatment, resulting in a sharp P decrease between 1984 and 2007: from 260 to 90 kgP km(-2) for the Seine River and from 215 to 110 kgP km(-2) for the Scheldt River. In spite of improved N treatment of wastewater, there is no clear decrease of N loads, which mostly originate from leaching intensively cultivated arable lands. N fluxes at the outlet of the Seine and Scheldt rivers were, respectively, 1990 and 2210 kgN km(-2) in 1984 and 1830 and 1390 kgN km(-2) in 2007. However, this relatively low decrease appears to be more influenced by hydrological conditions than by better efficiency of N use in agriculture. We conclude from this analysis that the OSPAR objectives for P have been achieved, whereas for N radical changes in agricultural practices are still required. The P reduction achieved allows, for the period of concern, a 50% decrease of Phaeocystis colony blooms in the Belgian Coastal Zone, both in magnitude and duration. However, the simulated decrease, of maximum abundance, i.e., from 60 . 10(6) in 1984 to 30 . 10(6) cells 1(-1) in 2007, is still insufficient when compared to the ecological-quality indicator of 4 . 10(6) cells l(-1). A further decrease of nutrients is still necessary to decrease undesirable blooms more satisfactorily. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The microcalorimetric technique was used to analyse the influence of successive reforestations with Eucalyptus globulus Labill, a fast growing species, on the microbial activity in soil. With this aim, samples of similar origin soils, humic-eutrophic Cambisol, were collected from two adjacent land plots. One of the plots, to be taken as the reference, was not subjected to man activities for the last 100 years. The other plot was subjected to two reforestations in the last 20 years. For collection of the two samples, 100 m 2 homogeneous and perfectly defined zones were chosen in each of the adjacent land plots to obtain final representative bulk samples of 400 g each.
   The study was carried out using the microbial population as a bioindicator of the productive potential in soil. The experiments were carried out using I g soil samples that were treated with 1.25 mg glucose and stored at 4 degrees C for 3 months. The analysis was complemented by the determination of physical, chemical, and biological properties and environmental parameters.
   The study was performed over I year and samples were seasonally collected (spring, summer, autumn and winter) in the same zone situated in Viveiro (Galicia, NW Spain) with the objective of checking the influence of environmental conditions on the microbial activity in the two soils studied.
   From the measured results, it can be observed that soils subjected to reforestations suffer not only important changes in physical structure, such as an increase in bulk density, from 600 to 660 kg m(-3), a reduction in hydraulic conductivity, from 8.85 x 10(-3) to 4.4 x 10(-3) m s(-1), or a decrease in the C-to-N ratio, from 13 to 8, but also they have lower microbial activity, for example 2.84 J g(-1) in the reforested soil versus 6.14 J g-1 in the reference soil, in spring, thus presenting a lower productive potential that suggests the use of both amendments and adequate management techniques to ensure a sustainable exploitation, thus avoiding future degradation of soil.

AB  - This study analyzes the concentrations and variations of Cu, Mn, Zn, Al, Cd, Ag, As and Se among different size classes of Modiolus capax, from Punta Estrella, Bahia de las Angeles and Santa Rosalia in the Gulf of California, and of Modiolus modiolus and Mytilus californianus, from Bahia Tortugas in the Pacific. During November 1988, mussels of these species were collected and 45 organisms were selected (three replicates of 15 organisms each). Their biometric variables were measured: large size (88-98 mm), medium size (70-87 mm) and small size (56-66 mm). The reference standards and procedural blanks were analyzed for each group of 15 samples. The results indicate that the geographic distribution and accumulation of metals in the different sizes are mainly influenced by the sources of input, bioavailability in each place and the biological condition of the organisms. The mussels presented Cu levels independent of size in the region, except at Santa Rosalia. Zn, Cd and Se showed strong regional variability, but no clear trend with respect to the size of the organisms. Al showed high regional variability and a tendency to accumulate in small organisms; As and Se presented higher concentrations in the large to medium mussels, regardless of the sampling site. Mn tended to accumulate in large and medium mussels and was dependent on the sampling site. In Bahia Tortugas, M. californianus accumulates Cu, Mn and Cd at a rate three times lower than M. modiolus at the same level of exposure. Within the Gulf of California, the geographic distribution of Mn, Al and Zn was similar, with higher concentrations in the northern part. This is probably because the mussels are exposed to these metals through the sedimentary material resuspended in the Colorado River Delta. Cd presented levels of 70 and 27 mu g g(-1) at Bahia Tortugas and Bahia de las Angeles, respectively; both sites are exposed to coastal upwelling. Cu presented relatively low levels (<35 mu g g(-1)), except at Santa Rosalia (89 mu g g(-1)), where Cu is mined. As, Se and Ag presented low variability in the study area, with low levels that reflect natural levels at the sites studied.

AB  - Background Based on world experience, first, a modern assessment of the flora is needed to develop strategies for the conservation of ecosystems of rare and endangered plant species. A regional and global biodiversity strategy should focus on assessing the current state of bioresources. To preserve the biodiversity of the species and its habitat, we evaluated botanical features, ontogenetic phases, the ecological and phytocenotic structure of the rare and endangered of Rhodiola rosea L. (golden rose root) populations from the highlands of Eastern Kazakhstan. Results R. rosea in the study region lives on damp mossy rocks, rocky slopes, overgrown moraines and along the banks of mountain rivers in the upper limit of cedar-larch forests, subalpine and alpine belts, in the altitude limit of 1700-2400 m. In the studied region, R. rosea begins to vegetate in May-June, blooms in June-July, the fruits ripen in August. The species is encountered in the high mountain ranges of the Kazakh Altai and Saur-Tarabagatai. Unfavorable habitat conditions for the species are overgrown by sedge-grass and birch-moss communities. The most common species at sites with R. rosea are: Schulzia crinita, Achillea ledebourii, Doronicum altaicum, Macropodium nivale, Hylotelephium telephium, Rhodiola algida, Carex capillaris, C. aterrima. Ontogenetic study revealed that all age-related phases were present, with the exception of the senile states. Individual life expectancy shown to be 50-55 years. The analysis of the species composition in the communities with R. rosea showed that the leading families in terms of the number of accompanying species are Poaceae, Ranunculaceae, Asteraceae, Rosaceae and Caryophyllaceae, Apiaceae, Fabaceae; while the most dominant genera are: Carex, Aconitum, Dracocephalum, Festuca, Pedicularis, Poa, Salix; the ecological groups are dominated by psychrophytes, mesophytes mesopsychrophytes; the Asian, Eurasian, and Holarctic groups are the most represented groups. Dominant life forms according to Serebyakov were rod-rooted, brush-rooted, short-rooted and long-rooted grasses, while based on Raunkiaer's groups the overwhelming majority consisted of Hemincryptophytes (74%). Conclusions The R. rosea populations of Kazakhstan represent an important gene stock of the species. Our study provides new insights into the species' biology thus contributes to the conservation of biodiversity on a wide spatial scale.

AB  - In the Eastern Africa highlands, the gradual transformation of natural ecosystems to smallholding coffee-based agrosystems has resulted in more fragmented landscapes. Major pests of coffee find appropriate living conditions leading to high infestation rates and the need for smallholder farmers to implement pest control measures. This study aims to understand the influence of landscapes on the ecology of three major coffee pests: the coffee berry borer (CBB), Hypothenemus hampei, and the Antestia bugs Antestiopsis thunbergii (ABT) and A. facetoides (ABF). The study was conducted on a typical smallholder coffee-based landscape in central Kenya. The pest abundance was assessed monthly for two years in a network of 30 coffee plots spread across the coffee agroecological subzones (AEsZ), namely upper midland UM1 and UM2, and the transition zones between UM1 and UM2 and between UM2 and UM3, herein referred to as TZ1 and TZ2, respectively. Landscape metrics, viz. patch density, Euclidean nearest neighbour distance, proximity index, contagion index, interspersion and juxtaposition index were derived from a spatially explicit land cover map, based on 10 m Sentinel 2 data for nine buffer zones of radius ranging from 50 m to 1000 m around each sampled plot. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to establish the relationships between the observed pest abundances and landscape metrics, elevation, and AEsZ. Landscape indicators achieved the highest correlation with the pest abundances within a 300 m radius (Adjusted R2 0.5). Whereas beyond 300 m landscape scale, the predictor variables resulted in weak relationships (Adjusted R2 < 0.5) between the pests abundance and landscape metrics. We noted a strong influence of elevation and adjacency to cropland on Antestia bug populations. Specifically, ABF populations were negatively correlated with low elevation, whereas ABT's were positively correlated with high elevation zone. On the other hand, CBB was strongly influenced by contiguous coffee patches, especially in UM1 and UM2. Therefore, we recommend reducing connectivity between coffee patches for the management of CBB, whereas further studies should be conducted to identify secondary hosts of Antestia bugs that should not be adjacent or within coffee stands.

AB  - The paper reflects the dynamics of changes in standard of living in the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania during the post-Soviet period. Background. The more than twenty years that have passed since perestroika failed to lead to the expected positive shifts in economy in RNO-Alania. In ratings of regions by population living standards, the republic was consistently among the last places. Aim. To show the discrepancy between the modern level of economic development and the standard of life in the RNO-Alania. Method. The work uses comparative analysis of indicators of living standard and indicators reflecting the structural and dynamic characteristics of economic processes. Results. Official statistics show growth in almost all socio-economic indicators in RNO-Alania. This apparent increase in living standards does not correspond to the low ranking of RNO-Alania, which is consistently in the bottom ten of the rating of Russian regions. The analysis of other indicators determining the population's quality of life, such as: the ecological condition of the territory, the developmental level of health and education institutions, life expectancy, and availability of transport, information and communication networks all correlated weakly with the real socio-economic situation in the region. The study of the republic's districts showed a high unemployment rate due to the lack of industrial and agricultural production, the underdevelopment of small and medium-sized businesses, and low wages. There is an outflow of working-age population to the city of Vladikavkaz and from the districts to outside the republic. Conclusions. The deficit in the republic's budget persisted during the research period, despite the apparent growth in the gross product and revenue part of the budget, but the volume of expenditures is growing at a faster rate. The main reason for this is the sharp decline in industrial production, and the influence of loss-making enterprises that do not generate income in the budget. Living standards are rising only thanks to grants from the federal centre. Recommendation. In order to remove the republic from its depressed state it is necessary to increase the fixed capital, to control the process of effective use of the available production capacities, and to invest in a recreational industry that uses natural resources and does not require significant investment.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Understanding the transmission of disease is a key aspect to unravel the epidemiology of a disease. Multiple bee species face a global decline caused by an interplay of several factors, one of which is disease-causing parasites. Laboratory studies have identified that most of these parasites have an oral-fecal transmission route and that flowers may serve as a transmission spot between bee species. Within this study, we look if the transmission of parasites via flowers is actually occurring in the field under natural conditions. Furthermore, we look at plant-pollinator interactions, which can be represented as a network, and show that the centrality of a flower in the plant-pollinator network, weighted by visitation frequency, is a good predictor of the presence of parasites on the flower. In other words, we provide evidence to support the transmission mechanism via flowers in the field and show that flowers that are more central in the plant-pollinator network are most likely to contain parasites. Furthermore, we also explore the mechanism of external vectoring, where parasites hitchhike on the exterior of bees and are deposited on the flowers. This study further paves the path to epidemiological studies using the plant-pollinator network as a tool to assess the transmission of bee parasites.
   Parasites are important actors within ecosystems. However, a key aspect to unraveling parasite epidemiology is understanding transmission. The bee pollinator community harbors several multihost parasites, which have been shown to be able to spread between species via flowers. Hence the plant-pollinator network can provide valuable information on the transmission of these parasites between species. Although several controlled experiments have shown that flowers function as a transmission hub for parasites, the link with the plant-pollinator network has rarely been addressed in the field. Here, one can hypothesize that the most central flowers in the network are more likely to enable parasite transmission between species. In this study, we test this hypothesis in three local plant-pollinator networks and show that the centrality of a plant in a weighted plant-pollinator network is a good predictor of the presence of multihost pollinator parasites on the plant's flowers.

AB  - Natural river flow provides the conditions required to sustain freshwater ecosystems, and the greater the departure from the natural regime, the greater the loss of those ecosystems. In South America, new hydropower dams are continuously being constructed and planned in regions within and around the Amazon basin and in the Upper Paraguay river basin, a region notable for the Pantanal, a huge wetland ecosystem that is largely dependent on the flow regime of the Paraguay river and its tributaries. In this context, it is meaningful to examine the hydrological changes caused by the major Manso dam, that is operating since 2001 at the headwaters of one of the major tributaries of the Paraguay river. This was done for the same case study by other authors in previous studies using only gauging stations data. However, those previous assessments were limited due to the confounding effects of climate variability and the necessity of relatively long term observed time series. Here, we applied a modeling approach to evaluate the changes in hydrological regime caused by Manso dam operation. Our modeling approach was based on the combination of the MGB large-scale hydrologic model with the SIRIPLAN large-scale wetland model. The models were applied, using river reaches from 2 to 10 km, in two scenarios during the period from 2003 to 2015. In the first scenario we used naturalized streamflow at the dam site as input to the hydrological model. In the second scenario we used observed reservoir outflow time series as input to the hydrological model. Our results show that Manso dam has a regulation effect that decreases high flows, increases low flows and reduces lateral connectivity. The decrease in high flows is more pronounced in the region upstream of the Pantanal floodplain, but not limited to, while increase in low flows extends into Pantanal. Timing of maximum and minimum flows is less affected, except for the river reach immediately downstream of the dam. Our results improve the assessment of spatial patterns of hydrologic alteration, giving more confidence in the assessment of magnitude and spatial extension of the effects of Manso dam in the Pantanal region.

AB  - The aim of this study was to provide baseline radioecological data for the temperate forest ecosystem in Plitvice Lakes National Park. Emphasis was placed on the determination of naturally occurring radionuclides since there is an acknowledged lack of data for these radionuclides in non-accident conditions in wildlife, even for bioindicator organisms. Activity concentrations of U-238, Ra-226, Pb-210, Th-232, K-40, Cs-134, and Cs-137 were measured by gamma spectrometry in soil and bioindicators: earthworms, conifer needles, mosses, and lichens. From the measured activity concentrations, concentration ratios were calculated to quantify the transfer of these radionuclides from soil to bioindicators. Our results show that soil activity concentrations are biased toward results from other studies conducted within the Dinaric mountain region. However, in moss and lichen samples, we measured higher activity concentrations of Ra-226 and lower activity concentrations of K-40 and Cs-137 in comparison to similar studies. Also, we estimated lower concentration ratios for all radionuclides from soil to these organisms, except for Pb-210, in comparison to generic values. The transfer of U-238 was generally low for all of the bioindicator organisms. For conifer needles, a correlation was found between activity concentrations of Ra-226 and Cs-137 in soil and related concentration ratios. Correlation was also found between the activity concentration of K-40 in soil and transfer of K-40 and Cs-137 to mosses and lichens. A comparison with literature data highlighted the lack of Ra-226 related concentration ratios for conifer trees and especially for earthworms. Therefore, the results of this study could supplement the sparse data currently available on radionuclide background data in similar ecosystems and related soil-to-wildlife transfer of radionuclides. Dose rate assessments, performed by the ERICA Tool, estimated that 96% of the overall exposure of wildlife in the Park area is due to the background dose rates, while 0.06 mu Gy h(-1) on average can be attributed as an incremental dose rate from Cs-134 and Cs-137.

AB  - In NW of the Iberian Peninsula, the incidence of anthropogenic fires is very high and, due to the climatologic and topographical conditions, burnt soils are prone to high erosion risks. In recent years several environmental management techniques (BAER: burnt area emergency response) have been applied after some wildfires, but there are still few field studies about their effects on soils (the foundations of terrestrial ecosystems) and most of them are short-term. Aiming to fill this gap of knowledge, sixteen properties useful as soil quality indices (pH, WHC, total N, delta N-15, NH4+-N, NO3--N, and NH4Ac-DTPA extractable Na, K, Ca, Mg, P, Al, Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn) were studied four years after BAER application in a severely burnt area in the 0-2 and 2-5 cm depth layers of unburnt soil (US), burnt soil untreated (BS), and burnt soil treated with two BAERs techniques: rye seeding (BSS) and straw mulching (BSM). The effects of fire on soil WHC, total N, Mg, Na, P, Zn, NO3--N, Cu and K were mitigated in both BSS and BSM, but especially in the latter. The highest values for Ca and Mn were recorded in BSM. The BAER treatments affect NO3--N, Cu and K only in the top layer, but no clear effects were found for soil pH, delta N-15, NH4+-N, Al and Fe. Soil samples were quite similarly grouped by the hierarchical cluster and the principal component analyses (PCA): a) 0-2 cm layers of US plots; b) 0-2 cm layers of BSM plots; c) 2-5 cm layers of US plots; d) most of top layers of BS and BSS plots; and e) most of the 2-5 cm layers of BS, BSM and BSS plots. The distribution of soil samples in the PCA showed that straw mulching and, to a lesser extent, rye seeding reduced the distance between burnt and unbumt topsoil along Factor 1, but not along Factor 2 (explaining 56% and 29% of the variance, respectively). Consequently, these BAER treatments mitigated, but not wiped out, the effects of fire on soil quality after four years.

AB  - As the higher trophic guilds in marine food chains, top predators such as larger fishes and reptiles are important indicators that a marine ecosystem has recovered following a crisis. Early Triassic marine fishes and reptiles therefore are key proxies in reconstructing the ecosystem recovery process after the end-Permian mass extinction. In South China, the Early Triassic Jurong fish fauna is the earliest marine vertebrate assemblage in the recovery period. It is constrained as mid-late Smithian in age based on both conodont biostratigraphy and carbon isotopic correlations. The Jurong fishes are all preserved in calcareous nodules embedded in black shale of the Lower Triassic Lower Qinglong Formation, and the fauna comprises at least three genera of Paraseminotidae and Perleididae. The phosphatic fish bodies often show exceptionally preserved interior structures, including network structures of possible organ walls and cartilages. Microanalysis reveals the well-preserved micro-structures (i.e. collagen layers) of teleost scales and fish fins. Abundant small pyrite framboids, 2-5 mu m in diameter, are detected from the nodules and fish body surfaces, indicating a calm, euxinic burial environment. Coccoid-like microspheroids are also very abundant in the host rocks and near the fish fossil surfaces, implying that microbes may have participated in the burial process of the fishes. Taphonomic analysis uncovers the four-step formation process of the fish nodules. (1) Fishes lived in the oxic seawater in the upper ocean, and (2) their bodies sank to the anoxic seabed after death, with the body surface being wrapped by bacteria. (3) Microbial biofihns sealed body surfaces to prevent or delay the decay of the fleshy body. The decomposition of the body cavity and interior organs produced some CO2 and H2S gases. The former formed bicarbonate ions in seawater and attracted calcium ions to facilitate the precipitation of calcium carbonate, while the H2S combined with iron ions in seawater to form pyrite framboids. (4) The fish nodule gradually grew by precipitation of calcium carbonate in layers and embedding with pyrite framboids, and later the fish fossil nodule was compacted during diagenesis. Global faunal correlations indicate that the Jurong fishes are closely related to the Early Triassic fish faunas from Chaohu, Anhui Province and Madagascar.

AB  - The article presents a method to standardize the administrative costs of forest districts using the management difficulty level index (STG). The scope of the study included the development of a revised structure of the STG for forest districts, comparison of the substantive and statistical factors that shape the level of administrative costs being incurred by forest districts with partial indicators that form the STG index, the development of the methods for determining the standard administrative costs of forest districts using the STG, and the selection of a method to be applied in the financial and economic practice of the State Forests. The source data for the administrative costs incurred by forest districts, as well as the data on the natural-forest conditions and annual economic tasks of the forest districts were obtained from the State Forests Information System databases for all the forests districts in Poland and from the Bureau for Forest Management and Geodesy. Information about the social environment of the forest districts was obtained from the Local Data Bank of the Central Statistical Office in Poland. In the methodological assumptions concerning the development of a method for shaping the level of administrative costs of the forest districts, two variants were adopted. The structuring of the STG for forest districts, as a tool to standardize administrative costs of forest districts, adopts the 'sum of relative values' method, where relative values of individual partial indicators (six simple and five complex ones) are obtained by dividing the absolute values of a specific indicator by the maximum value of this indicator for the whole population The obtained results of calculating the level of standard administrative costs of forest districts in two variants were similar. For the sake of clarity, simple mathematical formulas, and the ease of use by organizational units of the State Forests, the administrative cost standardization method based on the calculated average value of 1 item of the STG for forest districts per a given administrative cost group in the State Forests was used to build a makeshift of the State Forests plan for 2014-2016.

AB  - It remains poorly understood how sea level drives environmental change and hydrographic development in coastal karst basins (underwater caves, sinkholes, blueholes, etc.) over millennial timescales. It was previously hypothesized that coastal karst basins (CKBs) transition from vadose, to littoral, then anchialine, and finally submarine environments as sea-level rise inundates coastal karst landscapes, but the initial flooding event of CKBs remains challenging to sample. Runway Sinkhole hosts a modern anchialine ecosystem located similar to 225 m from Great Abaco Island coastline in The Bahamas, and its shallow water depth (similar to 1.8 mbsl) permits an investigation into the early environmental evolution and hydrographic development in a CKBs after inundation by sea-level rise. Four sediment cores were collected from Runway Sinkhole, and late Holocene environmental change was reconstructed with benthic foraminiferal paleoecology, organic matter geochemistry (OM%, delta C-13(org), and C:N), X-radiography, and radiocarbon dating. Despite some uncertainties associated with the chronology, it appears that Holocene sea-level rise initially flooded Runway Sinkhole and created a littoral environment at least by similar to 3.9 ka, whereafter a detrital peat deposit accumulated in the sinkhole. This detrital peat had a high organic matter content (mean 88%), a delta C-13(org) value indicative of organic matter derived from C-3 plants including mangroves (-28 parts per thousand), and an unknown calcareous microfossil suggestive of a non-marine habitat in the sinkhole. A shift to carbonate sand deposition, organic matter with more marine-influenced delta C-13(org) values (-23 parts per thousand,), and expansion of euryhaline (Bolivina striatula, Elphidium poeyanum, and Triloculina bermudezi) and anchialine (Physalidia simplex and Conicospirillina exleyi) benthic foraminifera at similar to 1.2 ka marks the onset of modern anchialine environmental conditions at the sediment-water interface (similar to 1.8 mbsl). These results suggest that relative sea-level rise in the Bahamas forced environmental change in Runway sinkhole at similar to 1.2 ka, and indicate that peat deposits in coastal sinkholes must be verified as in-situ before being utilized as sea-level indicators.

AB  - Background: Copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) can pose serious threats to environmental health because they tend to bioaccumulate in terrestrial ecosystems. We investigated under field conditions the transfer of these heavy metals in a soil-plant-snail food chain in Banat area, Romania. The main goal of this paper was to assess the Roman snail (Helix pomatia) usefulness in environmental monitoring as bioindicator of heavy metal accumulation. Eight sampling sites, selected by different history of heavy metal (HM) exposure, were chosen to be sampled for soil, nettle leaves, and newly matured snails. This study also aimed to identify the putative effects of HM accumulation in the environment on phenotypic variability in selected shell features, which included shell height (SH), relative shell height (RSH), and whorl number (WN).
   Results: Significantly higher amounts of HMs were accumulated in snail hepatopancreas and not in foot. Cu, Zn, and Cd have biomagnified in the snail body, particularly in the hepatopancreas. In contrast, Pb decreased when going up into the food chain. Zn, Cd, and Pb correlated highly with each other at all levels of the investigated food chain. Zn and Pb exhibited an effective soil-plant transfer, whereas in the snail body only foot Cu concentration was correlated with that in soil. There were significant differences among sampling sites for WN, SH, and RSH when compared with reference snails. WN was strongly correlated with Cd and Pb concentrations in nettle leaves but not with Cu and Zn. SH was independent of HM concentrations in soil, snail hepatopancreas, and foot. However, SH correlated negatively with nettle leaves concentrations for each HM except Cu. In contrast, RSH correlated significantly only with Pb concentration in hepatopancreas.
   Conclusions: The snail hepatopancreas accumulates high amounts of HMs, and therefore, this organ can function as a reliable biomarker for tracking HM bioavailability in soil. Long-term exposure to HMs via contaminated food might influence the variability of shell traits in snail populations. Therefore, our results highlight the Roman snail (Helix pomatia) potential to be used in environmental monitoring studies as bioindicator of HM pollution.

AB  - The acute toxicity (96 h) of pyrene (PY) to European seabass (Dicentrachus labrax) juveniles assessed in a semi-static bioassay (SSB) with medium renewal at each 12 h, and in a static bioassay (SB) without medium renewal was compared in laboratorial conditions (water PY concentrations: 0.07-10 mg L-1). Main findings in the SSB that assessed mainly the toxicity of PY and its metabolites were: increased levels of bile PY metabolites in good agreement with the profile of lipid peroxidation levels (LPO) in exposed fish relating PY exposure and oxidative damage; increased levels of PY-type compounds in the brain indicating their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier; increased levels of these substances in liver and muscle which are edible tissues for humans thus raising concern on potential adverse effects on consumers of fish from PY contaminated areas; a significant inhibition of glutathione S-transferase activity suggesting its involvement in PY detoxication as toxicant scavenger: finally, an almost complete impairment of the swimming velocity at all the PY concentrations linking sub-individual to higher population level effects. In the SB, where the overall toxicity of PY, its metabolites and environmental degradation products was evaluated, 19% and 79% of PY decay in test media was found at 12 and 96 h, respectively. In general, the effects were similar to those of SSB but with significant effects being induced at higher PY concentrations indicating that the parental compound is more toxic than its environmental degradation products. The other main differences relatively to the SSB were: increased levels of PY-type substances in the liver suggesting more accumulation in this organ. Therefore, these findings highlight the need of carefully considering experimental design options when assessing the toxicity of readily degradable substances to marine fish, and stress the importance of taking into consideration the toxicity of environmental degradation products in addition to toxic effects of the parental substance and its metabolites for marine ecological risk assessment.

AB  - Ozonation is an emerging technology for the removal of micropollutants from treated wastewater. Aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of ozone treatment on genotoxic and acute toxic effects of tertiary treated municipal wastewater. It is known that DNA-damaging chemicals cause adverse effects in the environment and that exposure to humans leads to cancer and other diseases. Toxicity was tested in organisms from three trophic levels namely in bacteria (Salmonella/microsome assays) which enable the detection of gene mutations, in a plant bioassay (micronucleus assay with root tip cells of Allium cepa) which reflects clastogenic and aneugenic effects and in single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) tests with mammalian cells which detect DNA migration caused by single-, double strand breaks and alkali labile sites. In the bacterial tests negative results were obtained with untreated samples but after concentration with C-18 cartridges a positive result was found in strains TA1537 and TA98 which are sensitive to frameshift mutagens while no mutations were induced in other tester strains (TA100, TA102 and YG1024). Ozone treatment led to a decrease of the mutagenic activity of the samples. In the SCGE experiments, DNA migration was detected with the unconcentrated effluent of the treatment plant and ozonation led to a substantial decrease of this effect. In the plant bioassays, negative results were obtained with the effluent and ozone treatment did not cause an alteration of the micronucleus frequencies. Also acute toxic effects were monitored in the different indicator organisms under all experimental conditions. The bacteriocida/bacteriostatic effects which were seen with the concentrated samples were reduced by ozonation. In the experiments with the eukaryotic (plant and animal) cells no acute toxicity was seen with the effluents and ozonation had no impact on their viability. In conclusion findings of this study indicate that zonation of tertiary effluents of a municipal treatment plant reduces the adverse effects caused by release of mutagens in aquatic ecosystems and does not decrease the viability of bacteria and eukaryotic cells. However, future research is required to find out if, and to which extent these findings can be generalized and which mechanisms account for the detoxification of the wastewater.

AB  - This paper discusses origin and charging directions of oil fields on the Shaleitian Uplift, Bohai Bay basin. The Shaleitian Uplift is a footwall uplift surrounded by three sags containing mature source rocks. The origins of the four oil fields on the Shaleitian Uplift, both in terms of source rock intervals and in terms of generative kitchens, were studied using biomarker distributions for 61 source rock samples and 27 oil samples. Hierarchical cluster analysis using 12 parameters known to be effective indicators of organic matter input and/or depositional conditions allowed the identification of six oil types or classes. These six oil classes could then be linked to three distinct source rock intervals ranging in age from 43.0 Ma to 30.3 Ma. The third member (43.0-38.0 Ma in age) and first member (35.8-32.8 Ma) of the Eocene Shahejie Formation, and the third member of the Oligocene Dongying Formation (32.8-30.3 Ma) each sourced one class of oil. The other three classes represent mixtures of oil generated from multiple source rock intervals. Traps on the Shaleitian Uplift were charged in the east by oil generated from the Eocene Shahejie Formation in the Bozhong Sag, in the southeast by oil generated from the Eocene Shahejie and then Oligocene Dongying formations in the southwestern part of the Bozhong Sag and/or in the eastern part of the Shanan Sag, and in the southwest by oil generated from the Eocene Shahejie Formation in the western part of the Shanan Sag. The estimated migration distances range from less than 5 km to about 20 km. The compositional heterogeneity within fields and multiple-parameter comparisons between oils from nearby wells in different fields have proven to be a powerful tool to determine the in-filling histories of oil fields in cases where multiple source rock intervals and multiple generative kitchens exist.

AB  - There is an increasing trend for interconnections between all nations of the world owing to the widespread globalization of industrial production, inputs sourcing and outputs marketing. A further reason is the raised awareness of global consequences, resulting from natural resources depletion and apparently localized environmental degradation activities by industries. Much of this ever-growing and complex interdependence has been possible as a result of a host of unprecedented technological achievements in the past few decades, which have enabled industrial enterprises in developed countries to accomplish an increased degree of flexibility, through automated manufacturing, to combine economies of scale, through process standardization, with economies of scope, through product differentiation, and to achieve quicker response times to customers' preferences and market demands. Simultaneously, in most developing countries, there is also an observable undercurrent of deregulation, privatization or corporatization, and open international market competition for industrial development. In this present era of new internationalism, technology management has become one of the main strategic priorities, because it provides the vital factor underpinning the survival and prosperity of industrial enterprises everywhere. Hence, given the recognition that the key competitive advantage in the international market-place nowadays is the ability of an enterprise continuously to introduce technological innovations faster than others, the need for endogenous technology capacity building can hardly be overemphasized. This paper presents a general framework for the development of a set of technology indicators which could be useful for assessing industrial investment projects funded by an international or national development finance institution. The framework attempts to integrate business and technology strategies particularly in the context of developing countries. Starting with consideration of the unique characteristics of technology at the firm level, and using a systems analysis approach to the market structure, possible strategic mixes are determined by considering four business strategies-price, value, niche and green leadership-and four technology strategies-technology leader follower, exploiter and extender. The necessary considerations for a technological capability enhancement and plausible technology strategy progression path are also discussed for different development conditions. The analytical measures presented in this paper are focused on such important aspects as the degree of technology component sophistication, the level of technology capability advancement, the status of technology infrastructure building, and the dynamism of technology climate, all of which could be used for investment project review and appraisal undertaken by international and national development finance institutions.

AB  - Great efforts have been made to manage and restore native prairies to protect native species, enrich biodiversity, protect ecological resilience, and maintain ecosystem services. Much of this has been focused on preventing degradation from overgrazing and crop conversion. Understanding the consequences of management polices is important to identify best practices. Previous research has compared restoration outcomes from variable intensity grazing, prescribed fire, and grazing removal. However, few studies have explored the optimal durations of management practices and variation in restoration outcomes among vegetation communities. This study evaluates whether the impact of grazing cessation and reintroduction varies among native vegetation communities and measures the effective time periods of grazing cessation and reintroduction. Restoration outcomes were evaluated using four biophysical indicators (fresh biomass, soil organic matter, green cover, and litter cover) and two vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI)) measured from Landsat images using seasonal Kalman filter and raster time series analysis. The results show that: (i) Grazing cessation increased soil organic matter and green cover while decreasing fresh biomass compared to moderate grazing management, while grazing reintroduction influences those indicators in an opposite direction; (ii) The effective time period for prairie conservation is about 11-14 years and varies among vegetation communities and biophysical indicators; (iii) The effective intensity of grazing cessation is highest in valley grassland, moderate in upland grassland, and mildest in sloped grassland; (iv) Grazing reintroduction returned the three native vegetation communities to the initial condition (i.e., the stage in 1985 before large grazers were removed), with less time than the time consumed for grazing cessation to restore the prairie ecosystem to the maximum changes; (v) Grazing reintroduction effectively influences upland and valley grasslands for 7 to 9 years, varying from different indicators, while it continuously affected sloped grassland with no clear time lag; (vi) The intensity of grazing reintroduction was strongest in sloped grassland, moderate in upland grassland, and mildest in valley grassland. The results of this study suggest expected time periods for prairie management methods to achieve results.

AB  - Forest disturbance regimes are intensifying in many parts of the globe. In order to mitigate disturbance impacts a number of management responses have been proposed, yet their effectiveness in addressing changing disturbance regimes remains largely unknown. The strong positive relationship between forest age and the vulnerability to disturbances such as windthrows and bark beetle infestations suggests that a reduced rotation length can be a potent means for mitigating the impacts of natural disturbances. However, disturbance mitigation measures such as shortened rotation lengths (SRL) can also have undesired consequences on ecosystem services and biodiversity, which need to be considered in their application.
   Here, we used the process-based landscape and disturbance model iLand to investigate the effects of SRL on the vulnerability of a 16,000 ha forest landscape in Central Europe to wind and bark beetle disturbances. We experimentally reduced the current rotation length (between 100 and 115 years) by up to -40% in 10% increments, and studied effects on disturbance dynamics under current and future climate conditions over a 200-year simulation period. Simultaneously, we quantified the collateral effects of SRL on forest carbon stocks and indicators of biodiversity. Shortening the rotation length by 40% decreased disturbances by 14%. This effect was strongly diminished under future climate change, reducing the mitigating effect of shortened rotation to <6%. Collateral effects were severe in the initial decades after implementation: Reducing the rotation length by 40% caused a spike in harvested timber volume (+92%), decreased total forest carbon storage by 6% and reduced the number of large trees on the landscape by 20%. The long-term effects of SRL were less pronounced. At the same time, SRL caused an increase in tree species diversity. Shortening rotation length can reduce the impact of wind and bark beetle disturbances, but the overall efficiency of the measure is limited and decreases under climate change. Given the potential for undesired collateral effects we conclude that a reduction of the rotation length is no panacea for managing increasing disturbances, and should be applied in combination with other management measures reducing risks and fostering resilience.

AB  - The spatial organization of a population can influence the spread of information, behaviour and pathogens. Group territory size and territory overlap and components of spatial organization, provide key information as these metrics may be indicators of habitat quality, resource dispersion, contact rates and environmental risk (e.g. indirectly transmitted pathogens). Furthermore, sociality and behaviour can also shape space use, and subsequently, how space use and habitat quality together impact demography. Our study aims to identify factors shaping the spatial organization of wildlife populations and assess the impact of epizootics on space use. We further aim to explore the mechanisms by which disease perturbations could cause changes in spatial organization. Here we assessed the seasonal spatial organization of Serengeti lions and Yellowstone wolves at the group level. We use network analysis to describe spatial organization and connectivity of social groups. We then examine the factors predicting mean territory size and mean territory overlap for each population using generalized additive models. We demonstrate that lions and wolves were similar in that group-level factors, such as number of groups and shaped spatial organization more than population-level factors, such as population density. Factors shaping territory size were slightly different than factors shaping territory overlap; for example, wolf pack size was an important predictor of territory overlap, but not territory size. Lion spatial networks were more highly connected, while wolf spatial networks varied seasonally. We found that resource dispersion may be more important for driving territory size and overlap for wolves than for lions. Additionally, canine distemper epizootics may have altered lion spatial organization, highlighting the importance of including infectious disease epizootics in studies of behavioural and movement ecology. We provide insight about when we might expect to observe the impacts of resource dispersion, disease perturbations, and other ecological factors on spatial organization. Our work highlights the importance of monitoring and managing social carnivore populations at the group level. Future research should elucidate the complex relationships between demographics, social and spatial structure, abiotic and biotic conditions and pathogen infections.

AB  - Phosphate mining in southeastern Idaho has historically resulted in the release of dissolved metals and inorganics to groundwater and surface water, primarily due to leachate from waste rock in backfilled pits and overburden storage piles. Selenium (Se) is of particular concern due to its high concentration in leachate and its limited attenuation downgradient of source zones under oxic conditions. Assessments of potential groundwater/surface water impacts from waste rock typically involve laboratory characterization using saturated and unsaturated flow columns packed with waste rock. In this study, we compare the results of saturated and unsaturated column tests with groundwater quality data from the Mountain Fuel, Champ, South and Central Rasmussen Ridge Area (SCRRA), Smoky Canyon, Ballard, Henry, and Enoch Valley Mines, to understand the release and attenuation of Se in different geochemical environments. Column studies and field results demonstrate that the ratio of aqueous Se to aqueous sulfate (Se:SO4 ratio) is a useful metric for understanding Se release and attenuation, where the extent of sulfate reduction is much less than Se reduction. Comparison of dissolved Se and sulfate results suggests that the net leachability of Se from unsaturated waste rock is variable. Overall, Se concentrations in groundwater directly beneath waste rock dumps is not as high as would be predicted from unsaturated columns. Lower Se:SO4 ratios are observed immediately beneath waste rock dumps and backfilled pits relative to areas receiving shallow waste rock runoff. It is hypothesized that Se released in the oxic upper portions of the waste rock is subsequently attenuated via reductive precipitation at depth in unsaturated, low-oxygen portions of the waste rock. This highlights an important mechanism by which Se may be naturally attenuated within waste rock piles prior to discharge to groundwater and surface water. These results have important implications for mining practices in the region. A better understanding of Se dynamics can help drive waste rock management during active mining and capping/water management options during post-mining reclamation. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Water quality indicators can be used to characterize the status and quantify and qualify the change of aquatic ecosystems under different disturbance regimes. Although many studies have been done to develop and assess indicators and discuss interactions among them, few studies have focused on how to improve the predicted indicators and explore their variations in receiving water bodies. Accurate and effective predictions of ecological indictors are critical to better understand changes of water quality in aquatic ecosystems, especially for the real-time forecasting. Process-based water quality models can predict the spatiotemporal variations of the water quality indicators and provide useful information for policy-makers on sound management of water resources. Given their inherent constraints, however, such process models alone cannot actually guarantee perfect results since water quality models generally have a large number of parameters and involve many processes which are too complex to be efficiently calibrated. To overcome these limitations and explore a fast and efficient forecasting method for the change of water quality indictors, we proposed a new framework which combines the process-based models and data assimilation technique. Unlike most traditional approaches in which only the model parameters or initial conditions are updated or corrected and the models are run online, this framework allows the information extracted from observations and outputs of process models to be directly used in a data-driven local/modified local model. The results from the data-driven model are then assimilated into the original process model to further improve its forecasting ability. This approach can be efficiently run offline to directly correct and update the output of water quality models. We applied this framework in a real case study in Singapore. Two of the water quality indicators, namely salinity and oxygen were selected and tested against the observations, suggesting that a good performance of improving the model results and reducing computation time can be obtained. This approach is simple and efficient, especially suitable for real-time forecasting systems. Thus, it can enhance forecasting of water quality indictors and thereby facilitate the effective management of water resources. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many studies have established that birds may provide a pest removal service on farms, although few studies have taken place in temperate row crop agriculture. Wildlife-friendly agricultural practices such as organic farming and the use of hedgerows can in turn provide needed habitat for birds in developed landscapes. In this study, we examined how pest removal provided by birds varies within and between "wildlife-friendly" organic row-crop farms in northern California, USA. We used point counts to assess bird diversity on 29 small organic farms and simulated lepidopteran pest outbreaks on each farm using sentinel pest experiments. We measured how the probability of pest removal varied with local habitat characteristics within the farm, and with bird diversity parameters between farms. We also used exclosure experiments to determine whether birds provide a significant pest removal service in organic row-crop agriculture. In the sentinel pest experiments, birds depredated between 0 and 80% of caterpillar presentation stations within 7 h, with a mean of 24% depredation per farm; the probability of pest removal was higher in areas close to uncultivated shrubby field margins ("hedgerows"). There was only weak evidence that the probability of pest removal was higher on farms with higher avian insectivore richness, and no evidence that pest removal varied with species diversity or abundance. Exclosure experiments on kale crops showed no significant effects of bird exclosure treatment on arthropod abundance or crop yield. However, natural caterpillar densities were relatively low during the exclosure experiment (approximately one caterpillar/m(2)). These results suggest that birds may be more helpful in responding to pest outbreaks than in controlling pests at non-irruptive densities on organic row crop farms in this study system. The prevention of pest outbreaks is an essential ecosystem service on any farm, and the rapid response of birds to pest outbreak conditions is an indicator of resiliency in the agroecosystem. Therefore, the retention of uncultivated shrubby field margins in this system may benefit both birds and farmers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) deposition exceeds the critical loads for this element in most parts of Switzerland apart from the Alps. At 17 sites (8 broadleaved stands, 8 coniferous stands, and 1 mixed stand) of the Swiss Long-term Forest Ecosystem Research network, we are investigating whether N deposition is associated with the N status of the forest ecosystems. N deposition, assessed from throughfall measurements, was related to the following indicators: (1) nitrate leaching below the rooting zone (measured on a subset of 9 sites); (2) the N nutrition of the forest stand based on foliar analyses (16 sites); and (3) crown defoliation, a non specific indicator of tree vitality (all 17 sites). Nitrate leaching ranging from about 2 to 16 kg N ha(-1) a(-1) was observed at sites subjected to moderate to high total N deposition (> 10 kg ha(-1) a(-1)). The C/N ratio of the soil organic layer, or, when it was not present, of the upper 5 cm of the mineral soil, together with the pool of organic carbon in the soil, played a critical role, as previous studies have also found. In addition, the humus type may need to be considered as well. For instance, little nitrate leaching (< 2 kg N ha(-1) a(-1)) was recorded at the Novaggio site, which is subjected to high total N deposition (> 30 kg ha(-1) a(-1)) but characterized by a C/N ratio of 24, large organic C stocks, and a moder humus type. Foliar N concentrations correlated with N deposition in both broadleaved and coniferous stands. In half of the coniferous stands, foliar N concentrations were in the deficiency range. Crown defoliation tended to be negatively correlated with N concentrations in the needles. In the majority of the broadleaved stands, foliar N concentrations were in the optimum nutritional range or, on one beech plot with high total N deposition (> 25 kg ha(-1) a(-1)), above the optimum values. There was no correlation between the crown defoliation of broadleaved trees and foliar concentrations.

AB  - Understanding how urban land-use structure contributes to the abundance and diversity of riparian woody species can inform management and conservation efforts. Yet, previous studies have focused on broad-scale (e.g., urban to exurban) land-use types and have not examined more local-scale changes in land use (e.g., the variation within "urban"), which could be important in urban areas. In this paper we examine how local-scale characteristics or fine-scale urban heterogeneity affect(s) the diversity, composition, and structure of temperate woody riparian vegetation communities in the highly urbanized area of Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. We use an information-theoretic approach to compare vegetation models and canonical correspondence analyses to compare species responses to urban variables. We found that urban riparian areas can harbor a high diversity of native canopy and shrub species (38 and 41, respectively); however, native and exotic woody plant species responded differently to urbanization. Exotic canopy species increased with the level of urbanization while native canopy and understory species declined. Understory species diversity displayed a greater response to urbanization than did canopy diversity, suggesting temporal lags in canopy response to disturbances associated with present and recent land-use changes. Certain native and exotic woody species represent ecological indicators of different levels of urbanization. Native species characteristic of pre-European settlement conditions were restricted to the wide riparian forests with little urban encroachment. Several native early-successional species appear tolerant to urbanization. Two exotic species, the tree Ailanthus altissima and the shrub Lonicera maackii, were the most abundant and ubiquitous woody species and appear to exploit urban disturbances. These exotic species invasions have the potential to modify forest composition and ecological function of urban riparian systems. In addition, altered hydrology may be a contributing factor as canopy and understory stem density of high-moisture-requiring species decreased with an increase in impervious surface and grass cover and with proximity to roads and railroads. In the face of urbanization, maintaining wide riparian forests and limiting building, road and railroad development within these areas may help reduce the invasion of exotic species and benefit hydrological function in temperate riparian areas.

AB  - There is now evidence that naturally occurring acid-water is more abundant than previously thought and that it has been important in the geologic past. Understanding the processes leading to the formation of such systems is required to appreciate the role of acid systems in geologic processes and to develop indicators for recognizing the geologic/environmental importance of these systems in the past. This paper characterizes the hydrogeology, hydrogeochemistry, microbial biogeochemistry and landscape attributes of acid-groundwater surface water systems in Australia with an emphasis on a well studied playa-lake system, Lake Tyrrell, Murray Valley. A model for the origin of these acid brines is presented and the importance of acid-brine producing systems is speculated upon. Data include porewater and groundwater geochemical measurements (collected during a 10 day field campaign) and results from geochemical modeling and graphics (e.g., Piper diagrams and x-y plots of seawater evaporation trajectories). Key characteristics of the system are (1) aquifer materials have low acid buffering capacities, (2) saline groundwater flowing onto playa surfaces is an oxic, H2SO4 solution, (3) authigenic minerals include combinations of jarosite [KFe3(SO4)(2)(OH)(6)], alunite [KAl3(SO4)(2)(OH)(6)] and Fe oxides that can form as evaporite minerals, (4) a source for solutes can be marine aerosols and (5) the formation of ironstones. Groundwater acidification by various processes including sulfide oxidation and ferrolysis, and at many different times, are the unique aspects for evolution of these acid brines and they can be considered another end member of the Eugster-Jones-Hardie model for the evolution of brines in closed basins. Acid-hypersaline groundwater and playa systems such as Lake Tyrrell may be an example of expected changes in the hydrogeochemistry of terrestrial water during late-stage continental denudation under and conditions. Historically these systems may have been integral to the formation of opal, bauxite, some low temperature ore deposits, of authigenic K-feldspars, and continental redbeds. Natural acid saline systems, such as those in Australia, may also be representative of acid saline systems on Mars. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is a current worldwide interest for evaluating the potential reuse of municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) bottom ash as a sub-base in road construction and secondary building material. Yet, there is a need for exploration of the physicochemical features of the bottom ashes to ensure environmental sustainability. To this end, batchwise water extraction as promulgated by the European norm EN 12457 or the German DIN 38414-S4 tests is commonly utilized to ascertain the impact of leachable trace elements in bottom ashes on biota. However, the above extraction protocols are not properly simulating the dynamic extraction conditions occurring in the nature, whereby the analytical information provided for risk assessment is debatable.
   In this work, a downscaled flow-through extraction method is proposed for mimicking the leaching of hazardous trace elements (namely, Pb, Zn, Cd, Cu and Cr) in MSWI bottom ashes by runoff waters more accurately than the manual counterparts. The flow assembly facilitates the full automation of standard and regulatory leaching tests by packing of a suitable amount of solid material into a column, whereupon the leaching reagent is continuously pumped through, thus yielding an accurate assessment of the environmentally significant water-extraction fraction with no effect from readsorption phenomena.
   The flow-through column system is exploited as a screening tool for fast evaluation of the influence of natural bottom ash weathering on the immobilization of hazardous elements to dictate the potential reuse of the solid waste. The dependence of sorption sites for humic substances on trace element leachability is also discussed. As compared to the steady-state approach, the dynamic method features the substantial shortening of the analytical extraction protocol from 24 h to just 30 min, better precision, with relative standard deviations (R.S.D.) <11% versus >20% R.S.D. for batchwise extraction, improved accuracy because of the absence of metal redistribution phenomena and minimization of manual operations as well as straightforward investigation of leaching rates for the suite of target elements.

AB  - During Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 302 (Arctic Coring Expedition (ACEX)) a more than 200 m thick sequence of Paleogene organic carbon (OC)-rich (black shale type) sediments was drilled. Here we present new biomarker data determined in ACEX sediment samples to decipher processes controlling OC accumulation and their paleoenvironmental significance during periods of Paleogene global warmth and proposed increased freshwater discharge in the early Cenozoic. Specific source-related biomarkers including n-alkanes, fatty acids, isoprenoids, carotenoids, hopanes/hopenes, hopanoic acids, aromatic terpenoids, and long-chain alkenones show a high variability of components, derived from marine and terrestrial origin. The distribution of hopanoic acid isomers is dominated by compounds with the biological 17 beta(H), 21 beta(H) configuration indicating a low level of maturity. On the basis of the biomarker data the terrestrial OC supply was significantly enriched during the late Paleocene and part of the earliest Eocene, whereas increased aquatic contributions and euxinic conditions of variable intensity were determined for the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum and Eocene thermal maximum 2 events as well as the middle Eocene time interval. Furthermore, samples from the middle Eocene are characterized by the occurrence of long-chain alkenones, high proportions of lycopane, and high ratios (> 0.6) of (n-C-35 + lycopane)/n-C-31. The occurrence of C-37-alkenenones, which were first determined toward the end of the Azolla freshwater event, indicates that the OC becomes more marine in origin during the middle Eocene. Preliminary U(37)(K'-)based sea surface temperature (SST) values display a longterm temperature decrease of about 15 degrees C during the time interval 49-44.5 Ma (25 degrees to 10 degrees C), coinciding with the global benthic delta O-18 cooling trend after the early Eocene climatic optimum. At about 46 Ma, parallel with onset of ice-rafted debris, SST (interpreted as summer temperatures) decreased to values < 15 degrees C. For the late early Miocene a SST of 11 degrees-15 degrees C was determined. Most of the middle Eocene ACEX sediments are characterized by a smooth short-chain n-alkane distribution, which may point to natural oil-type hydrocarbons from leakage of petroleum reservoirs or erosion of related source rocks and redeposition.

AB  - In order to mitigate the threat that hydraulic engineering will have on the fish's living environment, fish migration can be accomplished by building fishway. This paper takes the Diversion Dahaerteng River to Danghe Reservoir project in Gansu, China as an example. Through field investigation and data analysis, it was found that the main fish in the study area was Triplophysa. Through the comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of the fishways, it is determined that the fishway and the nature-like fishway are suitable. By constructing the evaluation method, the 19 indicators of the fishway were scored from the aspects of ability to lure fish, ability to pass fish, fish adaptability, engineering quantity, operation and maintenance, and the nature-like fishway was determined to be the best choice. The surface runoff from March to August is calculated by the P-III curve to simulate the flow field of the Dahaerteng River under the conditions of maximum, minimum and average runoff. The flow velocity of the simulation results is suitable for the Triplophysa migration, and the right bank is suitable for building nature-like fishway. The fishway section is rectangular, with a slope of 1%, a width of 2 m, and a total length of 520 m. It is arranged with a staggered baffle, and the revetment is rough masonry stones. The inside of the fishway is inlaid with pebbles so that the roughness of the fishway is more than 0.03. Then, numerical simulation calculations were carried out for the fishways composed of the partitions of 10m and 5m apart. The comparison shows that the fishway with the partition gap 5m is closer to the right bank of the river, which is suitable for Triplophysa migration and survival. For later evaluation and adjustment, an observation room and a fish collection pool are provided near the entrance of the fishway, and an observation room is provided near the exit. This paper can provide reference for the planning, construction and post evaluation of fishways.

AB  - The number of studies assessing the downstream effects of multiple reservoirs on benthic communities over a large spatial scale has been disproportionally less compared with studies of the effects of a single reservoir, while even fewer studies have examined the responses of non-insect macroinvertebrates on the impact of river discontinuity. The main objective here is to present the effect of seven large reservoirs in a 364-km long stretch of the Vah River, which is the longest river in Slovakia. We assessed the longitudinal changes in environmental variables to identify their possible cumulative effect and recovery distance. Moreover, the spatial variability in the taxonomical and functional structure of the non-insect benthic invertebrate community was evaluated. We do not detect the true cumulative effect of any variable, because of the apparent recovery before reaching the next reservoir. Although the environmental variables closely match with the division of the river based on the river network development, the non-insect community indicates a more extensive disruption of the river environment. On the basis of species data clustering, three groups of sites (stretches) are found to reflect their longitudinal position in the river rather than their position relative to the reservoir (upstream, downstream and in-between sites). The difference between these groups also mirrors the functional structure of the benthic community. Water temperature, conductivity and chemical oxygen demand create a significant gradient causing shifts in taxonomical, as well as functional community composition. The canonical correspondence analysis shows that all reservoirs cause a shift in the structure of benthic communities as they are similar to communities at more distant sites downstream. Moreover, the reservoirs situated in the upper and middle stretch of the river were detected to have the most impact on the ecological attributes of the community. The multi-level pattern analysis reveals 31 non-insect taxa and four functional traits associated with one or two river stretches in a longitudinal profile of the Vah River. Of the indicator species, Stylaria lacustris, Nais christinae, Ophidonais serpentina and Limnodrilus claparedeianus are found to be associated with the severe downstream modification (potamalization) of the river environment induced by reservoirs.

AB  - In Slovenia, the Natura 2000 network covers more than 37% of the country. Forests dominate more than 70% of this area, and forest management is a significant driver of diversity. Depending on the options applied, forest management may enhance or decrease forest biodiversity. Dinaric fir-beech forests (part of Natura 2000 habitat type) with remarkable nature-conservation interest and timber production functions were selected for this study. With the aim of testing the effects of different silvicultural measures on plant diversity in these forests, and consequently on biodiversity in a broader sense, three sites in the Slovenian part of a Dinaric fir-beech forest range were studied. The plant species diversity was assessed before and after the implementation of silvicultural measures of three intensities: (1) control plots - no logging; (2) logging of 50% of the growing stock; and (3) logging of 100% of the growing stock. Before the implementation of the silvicultural measures, the mean number of plant species per 400 m(2) vegetation plots was 48.8, and the mean value of the Shannon's diversity index was 2.41. Two years after the measures were implemented, different magnitudes of plant species turnover were observed. There were no significant changes in plant diversity status and vegetation composition in the control plots. Two years after 50% of the growing stock was logged, the mean number of species was 73.3, and the mean value of the Shannon index was 3.21. In the plots where all the trees were removed, the mean number of species was 87.4, and the mean value of the Shannon index was 3.42. In parallel with the increases in the diversity parameters, the cover of the herbaceous layer increased significantly with an increase in the silvicultural intensity, indicating that short-term species turnover can mostly be attributed to herbaceous plant species. As a result of changed stand and ecological conditions, an increased plant diversity, a greater biodiversity in a broader sense and an improved habitat suitability for different animal species could be expected.

AB  - In temperate forest ecosystems, accelerated freeze-thaw cycles caused by winter climate change are expected to affect nitrogen (N) cycling in soils. Net N mineralization and nitrification rates were investigated via incubations of sieved soils transplanted from ten temperate forest ecosystems to two northern Japan sites with natural snowfall gradients. This was done to address: 1) how freeze-thaw cycles affect N mineralization and nitrification in temperate forest soils; 2) whether freeze-thaw cycles change the soil N transformation rates in the following growing season; and 3) which soil characteristics affect the response of the N transformation rates to freeze-thaw cycles. The effect of freeze-thaw cycles on inorganic N and dissolved organic carbon productions differed among soils, that is, some soils produced more inorganic N and dissolved organic carbon in the conditions imposed by freeze-thaw cycles than in the non-frozen treatment but the others did not. The response to the freeze(t)haw cycles was explained by soil microbial activity (gross N mineralization and nitrification rate) and soil fertility (inorganic N pools in the early spring and water soluble ions). Freeze-thaw cycles significantly increased N transformation rates in the following growing season, suggesting that winter climate change might also affect nutrient availability for vegetation and soil microbes in the growing season. The magnitude and frequency of freeze-thaw cycles were considered to be important indicators of N transformation rates during the growing season, suggesting that the higher intensity of freeze-thaw cycles in the original locations of soils changed the microbial communities and functions with high tolerance to freeze-thaw cycles; this resulted in greater N transformation rates in the following growing season. Microbial activity, soil fertility and climate patterns in the original locations of soils are believed to have an effect on the response to winter climate change and to cause large variability of soil response of N transformation rates to freeze-thaw cycles in both the dormant and growing seasons.

AB  - 1. Understanding the variation in population abundances requires accounting for the environmental variability and uncertainty on different scales. We developed and evaluated a Bayesian hierarchical model for the inter-annual variation in population abundance of the epixylic bryophyte Buxbaumia viridis. The model accounts for spatio-temporal variability on two spatial scales. We used data on population abundance and on the weather variables at regional level collected between 1996 and 2003, and data on dead wood amount collected between 1996 and 2008. We also provide a Bayesian estimate of the population viability, specifically the population stochastic growth rate (log lambda(S)), which accounts for natural variability and uncertainty.
   2. Previous estimates of population viability did not account for uncertainties in a satisfactory way. First, point estimates of log lambda(S) cannot, by definition, express variation. Second, the commonly used approach to estimate log lambda(S) and its confidence interval underestimates uncertainties. The approach aims to estimate the mean of log lambda(S), with the confidence interval representing the uncertainty in the estimate of this mean. The interval does not reflect the natural variation and uncertainty.
   3. We estimated a probability distribution of log lambda(S), where the probability distributions of the yearspecific growth rates (log lambda(y)) are accounted for. The species is likely to decline under current environmental conditions. Based on the probability distribution of log lambda(S), we estimated this risk to be 81%.
   4. We found support for the hypotheses that the population dynamics are driven by autumn frosts, by spring precipitation and temperature (regional variables), and by the preceding year's population abundance (local variable).
   5. Synthesis. Statements about the viability of populations should not be based on point estimates of log lambda(S). Instead, the full probability distribution of log lambda(S) should be used, which explicitly accounts for the hierarchically structured natural variability and uncertainty. This distribution allows estimating the risk for a population decline, or providing an estimate of the confidence in a statement about a decline. This quantitative information can be weighed against other interests. We expect this Bayesian approach to be especially useful in the viability analysis of natural populations experiencing environmental variability.

AB  - Background: Reference genes with stable expression are required to normalize expression differences of target genes in qPCR experiments. Several procedures and companion software have been proposed to find the most stable genes. Model based procedures are attractive because they provide a solid statistical framework. NormFinder, a widely used software, uses a model based method. The pairwise comparison procedure implemented in GeNorm is a simpler procedure but one of the most extensively used. In the present work a statistical approach based in Maximum Likelihood estimation under mixed models was tested and compared with NormFinder and geNorm softwares. Sixteen candidate genes were tested in whole blood samples from control and heat stressed sheep.
   Results: A model including gene and treatment as fixed effects, sample (animal), gene by treatment, gene by sample and treatment by sample interactions as random effects with heteroskedastic residual variance in gene by treatment levels was selected using goodness of fit and predictive ability criteria among a variety of models. Mean Square Error obtained under the selected model was used as indicator of gene expression stability. Genes top and bottom ranked by the three approaches were similar; however, notable differences for the best pair of genes selected for each method and the remaining genes of the rankings were shown. Differences among the expression values of normalized targets for each statistical approach were also found.
   Conclusions: Optimal statistical properties of Maximum Likelihood estimation joined to mixed model flexibility allow for more accurate estimation of expression stability of genes under many different situations. Accurate selection of reference genes has a direct impact over the normalized expression values of a given target gene. This may be critical when the aim of the study is to compare expression rate differences among samples under different environmental conditions, tissues, cell types or genotypes. To select reference genes not only statistical but also functional and biological criteria should be considered. Under the method here proposed SDHA/MDH1 have arisen as the best set of reference genes to be used in qPCR assays to study heat shock in ovine blood samples.

AB  - The application of lime or liming materials to acid-soil grasslands might help mitigate soil acidity, a major constraint to forage productivity in many temperate mountainous grasslands. Nowadays, in these mountainous grasslands, it is essential to promote agricultural practices to increase forage yield and nutritive value while preserving biodiversity and agroecosystem functioning. Two different field experiments were conducted in the Gorbeia Natural Park, northern Spain: (i) one in a calcareous mountainous grassland (Arraba) and (ii) the other in a siliceous mountainous grassland (Kurtzegan) to study the effects of a single application of two liming products, i.e. 2429 kg lime (164.3% CaCO3) ha(-1) and 4734 kg calcareous sand (84.3% CaCO3) ha(-1), applied one month before the beginning of the sheep grazing season (May October), on soil chemical (pH, organic C, total N, C/N ratio, %Al saturation, Olsen P. exchangeable K+ and Ca2+) and biological parameters (dehydrogenase, beta-glucosidase, urease, acid phosphatase and arylsulphatase activity) as well as on botanical diversity (graminoids, forbs, shrubs) and forage yield and nutritive value (crude protein, modified acid detergent fibre, digestibility). Untreated control plots were also included in the experiment. Soil sampling was carried out at the end of the sheep grazing season (6 months after liming treatment), while botanical composition was determined one year after treatments application. Although no increase in soil pH was observed in Arraba, liming significantly increased dehydrogenase activity (an indicator of soil microbial activity) by 30.4 and 86.7% at Arraba and Kurtzegan site, respectively. Liming treatments significantly improved forage yield and nutritive value in Arraba but not in Kurtzegan. Furthermore, no differences in soil biological quality, evaluated using the "treated-soil quality index" as proposed in this work, were observed between treated and untreated soils, and between the two different lime treatments (lime, calcareous sand). It was concluded that, in acid-soil temperate mountainous grasslands, moderate liming treatments have no negative short-term effects either on soil quality or botanical composition, while resulting in improvements in forage yield and nutritive value under some conditions.

AB  - This study deals with the colonisation of experimental Porites blocks by epilithic and endolithic algal community in two atoll lagoons and two high-island lagoons in French Polynesia, exposed to different environmental conditions during a 5-year period. A qualitative analysis of the community (cyanobacteria and micro-algae) was carried out, and the relationship between the epilithic and endolithic strata observed. HPLC analysis of chlorophyll pigments was used to quantitatively determine the plant biomass, which was then compared to that of the algal turf of neighbouring reefs. The results show that these blocks are colonised according to two factors: the reef structure (atoll or high-island) and the degree of human disturbance. The epilithic and endolithic population dynamics differ.
   The density of the epilithic algal community and the species diversity increase with the degree of eutrophication and the amount of borers (sea-urchins, parrotfish), while the proportion of endolithic species remains low (34 %-59 %). This is especially marked in the high-island lagoons, where leaching has caused enhanced nutrient levels. An extreme case is the station at Faaa, a highly polluted harbour, where increased sea-urchin levels (44 ind. m(-2)) meant that the blocks disappeared completely in less than five years due to bioerosion. In the oligotrophic waters of the atoll lagoons, the losses of CaCO3 by bioerosion do not exceed 35 % per block, and the algal community is made up mainly of endolithic species (66 %-85 %). The algal biomass is lowest in the Takapoto atolls (10-11 mu g cm(-2)) and maximum in Tikehau atoll (23 and 56 mu g cm(-2)). The first microborers to settle in the ecological succession of the community are the cyanobacteria. These are gradually replaced by Ostreobium (Chlorophyceae borers), which become dominant in the blocks exposed to the lowest bioerosion rate. The richness and the density of the algal turf reflect the convergence of many ecological factors: it seems that the covering of epilithic algae or the richness of endolithic flora could be used as a global indicator of the quality and the health of a reef.

AB  - Background and Aims Coastal wetlands have evolved to withstand stressful abiotic conditions through the maintenance of hydrologic feedbacks between vegetation production and flooding. However, disruption of these feedbacks can lead to ecosystem collapse, or a regime shift from vegetated wetland to open water. To prevent the loss of critical coastal wetland habitat, we must improve understanding of the abiotic-biotic linkages among flooding and wetland stability. The aim of this research was to identify characteristic landscape patterns and thresholds of wetland degradation that can be used to identify areas of vulnerability, reduce flooding threats and improve habitat quality.
   Methods We measured local- and landscape-scale responses of coastal wetland vegetation to flooding stress in healthy and degrading coastal wetlands. We hypothesized that conversion of Spartina patens wetlands to open water could be defined by a distinct change in landscape configuration pattern, and that this change would occur at a discrete elevation threshold.
   Key Results Despite similarities in total land and water cover, we observed differences in the landscape configuration of vegetated and open water pixels in healthy and degrading wetlands. Healthy wetlands were more aggregated, and degrading wetlands were more fragmented. Generally, greater aggregation was associated with higher wetland elevation and better drainage, compared with fragmented wetlands, which had lower elevation and poor drainage. The relationship between vegetation cover and elevation was non-linear, and the conversion from vegetated wetland to open water occurred beyond an elevation threshold of hydrologic stress.
   Conclusions The elevation threshold defined a transition zone where healthy, aggregated, wetland converted to a degrading, fragmented, wetland beyond an elevation threshold of 0.09 m [1988 North American Vertical Datum (NAVD88)] [0.27 m mean sea level (MSL)], and complete conversion to open water occurred beyond 0.03 m NAVD88 (0.21 m MSL). This work illustrates that changes in landscape configuration can be used as an indicator of wetland loss. Furthermore, in conjunction with specific elevation thresholds, these data can inform restoration and conservation planning to maximize wetland stability in anticipation of flooding threats.

AB  - BackgroundFraxinus hupehensis is an endangered tree species that is endemic to in China; the species has very high commercial value because of its intricate shape and potential to improve and protect the environment. Its seeds show very low germination rates in natural conditions. Preliminary experiments indicated that gibberellin (GA(3)) effectively stimulated the seed germination of F. hupehensis. However, little is known about the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of GA(3) on F. hupehensis seed germination.ResultsWe compared dormant seeds (CK group) and germinated seeds after treatment with water (W group) and GA(3) (G group) in terms of seed vigor and several other physiological indicators related to germination, hormone content, and transcriptomics. Results showed that GA(3) treatment increases seed vigor, energy requirements, and trans-Zetain (ZT) and GA(3) contents but decreases sugar and abscisic acid (ABA) contents. A total of 116,932 unigenes were obtained from F. hupehensis transcriptome. RNA-seq analysis identified 31,856, 33,188 and 2056 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the W and CK groups, the G and CK groups, and the G and W groups, respectively. Up-regulation of eight selected DEGs of the glycolytic pathway accelerated the oxidative decomposition of sugar to release energy for germination. Up-regulated genes involved in ZT (two genes) and GA(3) (one gene) biosynthesis, ABA degradation pathway (one gene), and ABA signal transduction (two genes) may contribute to seed germination. Two down-regulated genes associated with GA(3) signal transduction were also observed in the G group. GA(3)-regulated genes may alter hormone levels to facilitate germination. Candidate transcription factors played important roles in GA(3)-promoted F. hupehensis seed germination, and Quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis verified the expression patterns of these genes.ConclusionExogenous GA(3) increased the germination rate, vigor, and water absorption rate of F. hupehensis seeds. Our results provide novel insights into the transcriptional regulation mechanism of effect of exogenous GA(3) on F. hupehensis seed germination. The transcriptome data generated in this study may be used for further molecular research on this unique species.

AB  - Forest ecosystems provide a wide range of goods and services to society and host high levels of biodiversity. Nevertheless, forest ecosystem services (ES) are often quantified and assessed using simplified methodologies (e.g., proxy methods based exclusively on Land Use Land Cover maps) that introduce substantial uncertainty in the analysis by ignoring, for instance, the species composition and spatial configuration of the ecosystems studied. In this work we defined and calculated a set of 12 indicators of several ES for the forests of the highly populated region of Catalonia (North-eastern Iberian Peninsula). The indicators combined different sources of information such as forest surveys, ecological model predictions and official statistics, but also included additional land cover information. All ES indicators were aggregated at the municipality level to compare their values and distribution patterns. We assessed spatial trade-offs and synergies among ES, as well as their relationships with a set of socioeconomic, climatic and biodiversity variables using correlation analyses and mixed effects models. The results suggest a clustering of provisioning and regulating ES in mountainous zones towards the North of the study area. These two types of services showed a high degree of spatial similarity and presented high positive correlations. In contrast, cultural ES showed a more scattered pattern, which included lower elevation areas in the South of the study region. Climatic conditions were the main determinants of the spatial variability in the supply of the different ES, with most indicators being positively associated with precipitation and negatively associated with temperature. In addition, biodiversity (particularly woody species richness) showed positive relations with most of these ES, while socioeconomic variables (such as population density and the percentage employment in agriculture) showed negative associations with most of them. The combination of information from different data sources (including primary data) allowed for a detailed analysis of forest ES, likely removing some of the problems derived from approaches based only on proxy methods. In addition, the use of municipalities as study unit makes results directly relevant to management and planning strategies operating at this scale (e.g., forest management and planning).

AB  - In aquatic organisms inhabiting polluted waters genes are activated to build an adaptive/compensatory defence against the possible effects of pollutants. Such responses can be used as biomarkers of exposure to chemical compounds, outlining the molecular mechanisms activated under specific pollution scenarios. With the aim of exploiting such approach in environmental health assessment, toxicologically relevant gene fragments were sequenced in the thicklip grey mullet (Chelon labrosus) and a toxicologically tailored low-density (160 genes) oligonucleotide microarray was customised. The tool was validated comparing organ/sex specific gene expression profiles and characterising responses under laboratory exposure to model chemicals. Finally, juvenile mullets were caged in a polluted harbour and hepatic gene expression profiles analysed after 5 and 21 days of deployment. Cages were deployed in the inner (IH) and outer (OH) Pasaia harbour, Bay of Biscay. Mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were also caged as biological matrix for chemical bioaccumulation analysis and stress biomarkers measurements. Slightly higher concentrations of chemicals (metals, tributyltin, PAHs, phthalates) were quantified in IH than in OH, fish bile metabolites also revealing higher availability of PAHs in IH. Lysosome membrane stability in mussels was reduced, indicating stress condition in both sites. The developed microarray discriminated mullets showing distinctive expression profiles depending on site and deployment time. Genes related to immune and hypoxia responses were regulated comparing IH and OH at day 5. Phase I and II biotransformation genes, such as cyp2, cyp3 and ugt, were up-regulated in IH, together with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor 2 (ahr2) and the ahr repressor. Similarly, TBT-binding proteins and genes involved in lipid metabolism (ppar gamma, cyp7) were up-regulated with deployment time. Even if nowadays higher throughput approaches for gene expression analyses are available, the developed mullet tool constitutes a comprehensive tool to assess molecular responses of mullets exposed to pollutants, although it remains to be explored whether it can be applied to assess pollutant exposure in active pollution monitorings and in environmental health assessment.

In this study, we developed an easily implemented method for estimating the ISA percentage (ISA%) from vegetation index data obtained from a moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and nighttime light data obtained from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Line-scan System (DMSP-OLS). The proposed method consists of four major steps. First, a non-vegetation fraction map was generated from 16-day composited time-series MODIS normalized difference vegetation index data using the temporal mixture analysis method. Second, the enhanced-vegetation-index-adjusted nighttime light index (EANTLI) was used to overcome the saturation problem and blooming effects in the original DMSP-OLS data. Third, the relationship between ISA% and EANTLI was derived based on a statistical analysis of the non vegetation fraction image and the EANTLI image to obtain a preliminary ISA% map. Finally, the final ISA% map was obtained by selecting smaller values from the preliminary ISA% map and non vegetation fraction map for each pixel. The validation results showed that the developed method has promising accuracy for estimating the ISA% in our study area (mainly consisting of four Southeast Asian countries: Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam), with a root mean square error value of 0.111, a systematic error value of 0.061, and a determination coefficient of 0.87. Another important finding is that there are two relationships between ISA% and improved nighttime light (i.e., EANTLI): the natural logarithmic function is suitable for ISA% values between 0% and 50%, and the quadratic polynomial function should be used for ISA% values larger than 50%. The developed method has high potential for application to the generation of global ISA% maps with frequent updates due to its easy implementation and the ready availability of input data.

AB  - This study assesses the water quality of the Upper Santa Cruz Watershed in southern Arizona in terms of fecal coliform and Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria concentrations discharged as treated effluent and from nonpoint sources into the Santa Cruz River and surrounding tributaries. The objectives were to (1) assess the water quality in the Upper Santa Cruz Watershed in terms of fecal coliform and E. coli by comparing the available data to the water quality criteria established by Arizona, (2) to provide insights into fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) response to the hydrology of the watershed and (3) to identify if point sources or nonpoint sources are the major contributors of FIB in the stream. Assessment of the available wastewater treatment plant treated effluent data and in-stream sampling data indicate that water quality criteria for E. coli and fecal coliform in recreational waters are exceeded at all locations of the Santa Cruz River. For the wastewater discharge, 13%-15% of sample concentrations exceeded the 800 colony forming units (cfu) per 100 mL sample maximum for fecal coliform and 29% of samples exceeded the full body contact standard of 235 cfu/100 mL established for E. coli; while for the in-stream grab samples, 16%-34% of sample concentrations exceeded the 800 cfu/100 mL sample maximum for fecal coliforms and 34%-75% of samples exceeded the full body contact standard of 235 cfu/100 mL established for E. coli. Elevated fecal coliform and E. coli concentrations were positively correlated with periods of increased streamflow from rainfall. FIB concentrations observed in-stream are significantly greater (p-value < 0.0002) than wastewater treatment plants effluent concentrations; therefore, water quality managers should focus on nonpoint sources to reduce overall fecal indicator loads. Findings indicate that fecal coliform and E. coli concentrations are highly variable, especially along urban streams and generally increase with streamflow and precipitation events. Occurrences of peaks in FIB concentrations during baseflow conditions indicate that further assessment of ecological factors such as interaction with sediment, regrowth, and source tracking are important to watershed management.

AB  - Soils adjacent to oil facilities in Mexico could potentially be affected by crude-oil or oil-derivative spills or leaks. While the environmental legal framework sets forth, through Mexican official standards, the maximum allowable limits of hydrocarbons in soil and the remediation guidelines, the geochemical parameters used are no guarantee that the original conditions of soil are recovered. The functioning and resilience of the altered properties of remediated oil-polluted soil require measuring the efficiency of commercial remediation through parameters not included in NOM-138-SEMARNAT/SA1-2008. For this reason, the aim of this investigation was to identify the physical and chemical properties of remediated soil to prove the recovery of soil quality relative to the parameters of an adjacent and taxonomically similar soil. Parameters determined include total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), eight physical and 10 chemical properties of a remediated soil in an area of 0.85 ha and these were compared with figures obtained from samples collected in 0.377 ha of an adjacent control Fluvisol. Samples were collected at two depths (0-15 and 15-30 cm). Statistical differences (p < 0.01) were observed between both soil types for TPH, resistance to penetration (RP), bulk density (Bd), moisture at field capacity (MFC), water retention (WR), basic infiltration (Bi), clay and silt; also, on the following chemical properties: hydrogen potential (pH), electrical conductivity (EC), organic matter (OM), total nitrogen (N), usable phosphorus (P), exchangeable potassium (K), exchangeable calcium (Ca), exchangeable magnesium (Mg), exchangeable sodium (Na) and cation-exchange capacity (CEC). A negative correlation (p < 0.01) was identified beween TPH and 10 physical and chemical variables, among them Bi (-0.926) and MFC (-0.914), evidencing that remediated soil remains affected. A significant (p < 0.01) positive correlation was found between TPH and six physical and chemical variables, such as Bd (0.935) and RP (0.928), which reveals the origin of soil degradation. The data show that soil quality remains affected, and hence the physical and chemical remediation was ineffective, so that new remediation processes are required, preferably biological ones. This study provides information for selecting physical and chemical indicators of soil to enable a better follow-up of the remediation process until soil is deemed remediated.

AB  - Globally important carbon (C) stores in boreal peatlands are vulnerable to altered hydrology through changes in precipitation and runoff patterns, groundwater inputs, and a changing cryosphere. These changes can affect the extent of boreal wetlands and their ability to sequester and transform C and other nutrients. Variation in precipitation patterns has also been increasing, with greater occurrences of both flooding and drought periods. Recent work has pointed to the increasing role of algal production in regulating C cycling during flooded periods in fen peatlands, but exactly how this affects the C sink-strength of these ecosystems is poorly understood. We evaluated temporal trends in algal biomass, ecosystem C uptake and respiration (using static and floating chamber techniques), and spectroscopic indicators of DOM quality (absorbance and fluorescence) in a boreal rich-fen peatland in which water table position had been experimentally manipulated for 13 years. Superimposed on the water table treatments were natural variations in hydrology, including periods of flooding, which allowed us to examine the legacy effects of flooding on C cycling dynamics. We had a particular focus on understanding the role of algae in regulating C cycling, as the relative contribution of algal production was observed to significantly increase with flooding. Ecosystem measures of gross primary production (GPP) increased with algal biomass, with higher algal biomass and GPP measured in the lowered water table treatment two years after persistent flooding. Prior to flooding the lowered treatment was the weakest C sink (as CO2), but this treatment became the strongest sink after flooding. The lower degree of humification (lower humification index, HIX) and yet lower bioavailability (higher spectral slope ratio, Sr) of DOM observed in the raised treatment prior to flooding persisted after two years of flooding. An index of free or bound proteins (tyrosine index, TI) increased with algal biomass across all plots during flooding, and was lowest in the raised treatment. As such, antecedent drainage conditions determined the sink-strength of this rich fen-which was also reflected in DOM characteristics. These findings indicate that monitoring flooding history and its effects on algal production could become important to estimates of C balance in northern wetlands.

AB  - Ohud mountain is one of the main important historic sites in the Arab Peninsula, and it is distinguishable over the rest of the mountains in the region. No extensive floristic survey has been carried out on Ohud mountain because of the rugged topography of this mountain. The current study investigates the floristic diversity and the correspondence of environmental factors of the phytogeographical distribution of plants, based on the floristic analysis of the present region. The research question is about the relationships between the species diversity and the human impacts of populated area at lowlands around Ohud mountain. A total of 59 species belonging to 56 genera and 28 families were recorded. Asteraceae had the highest contribution, about 12% of the total plant species. The analysis of the life forms demonstrated the prevalence of therophytes (68%) followed by chamaephytes (24%), indicating the adaptation of these life forms to hyperarid conditions. The chorological analysis indicated the predominance of the bi-regional taxa over the other phytochoria. Most of the recorded plant species belong to Saharo-Arabian and Sudano-Zambezian (24%) phytochoria. TWINSPAN analysis was performed to detect the indicator species of different vegetation groups and confirmed by detrended correspondence analysis (DCA or DECORANA). It is concluded that species richness and diversity revealed clear variation along the mountain and among the studied sites. Plant species diversity and richness were more pronounced in the intermediate portion of the elevation gradients across the mountain, with a decrease in the high altitudinal belts. The decrease was also recorded at the lower altitudes, where human impacts clearly affected vegetation; leading to a decrease in alpha diversity. In addition, the beta diversity among moderately highlands and lowlands was considerably high indicating the heterogeneous species composition among the studied sites along mountain elevations. The general pattern of vegetation groups distribution is controlled by a number of environmental factors; such as latitude, longitude, elevation, organic matter and some anions and cations. A Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) ordination revealed that the vegetation structure has a strong association with the latitude of the mountain followed by organic matter and Magnesium. It is recommended that the populated area should be subjected to restoration of mountain ecosystem that might be degraded by human activities.

AB  - The contribution of rare taxa to aquatic bioassessments remains a subject of debate, and generates contrasting positions among researchers. Very little is known about the effect of low-abundance taxa (LAT) for calculating both single and multimetric macroinvertebrate-based indices, as well as the ecological status classification. In this study, we aimed to: i) identify the aquatic macroinvertebrates that need special attention during index applications given their low abundance; ii) analyse the effect of excluding LAT on single (IBMWP and IASPT) and multimetric (STAR_ICMi) biological indices; and iii) investigate the influence of LAT on river ecological status assessments. To this end, two different river basins in SE Spain and N Italy with contrasting climatic conditions and river types were selected. Our results showed that almost all the taxa at the family level can act as low-abundance taxa. In particular, the LAT belonged mainly to Diptera, Trichoptera, Coleoptera, Gastropoda and Hemiptera. The IndVal analysis stressed Tabanidae, Cordulegasteridae and Hydroptilidae as the most characteristic low-abundance families in the Spanish data set, while Dryopidae and Athericidae were identified mostly in N Italy. Excluding LAT affected the studied index values and the resulting bioassessment classification, except for the IASPT index. Loss of the entire LAT pool reduced the ecological status for 78% of the samples for the IBMWP index. Changing took place in 41% of the samples when considering the STAR_ICM index. Relevant changes were detected even when considering loss of 50% of the LAT, especially with the IBMWP index. Similar values and patterns were obtained in each considered quality class and river type. Our results provide useful information about controversial taxa and stress the significance of LAT in river biomonitoring. Excluding LAT is discouraged, although different responses according to the considered index were detected. The IBMWP index always obtained lower values (coupled mainly with an underestimation of ecological classes), while STAR_ICMi and, especially the IASPT index, were less affected by excluding LAT. Paying special attention to all the protocol application stages is recommended, with emphasis placed when using the IBMWP index.

AB  - The publication presents the results arising from the experimental and mathematical modelling studies, which mainly aimed to investigate the selection and optimization of the rational operation modes particular to diesel engines of freight locomotives in the possession of the JSC 'Lithuanian Railways' (AB 'Lietuvos geleinkeliai'). The goal of the optimization is to increase the energy efficiency, reduce fuel consumption and emissions of harmful air pollutants to the environment from diesel engines of locomotives during freight transportation via the main lines of the Lithuanian railway network. A complex energy efficiency and environmental pollution assessment criterion KE-E adjusted for diesel engines of freight locomotives has been suggested. The use of KE-E on the basis of the conducted complex experimental mathematical computer modelling studies has determined that the reserves reducing fuel consumption, harmful emissions and greenhouse gas (CO2) emissions constitute 6 divided by 15% on an average, and in the case of individual railway network lines they go up to 30%. The comparative emission of harmful components per fuel mass (NOx, CO, CH, PM) e'(NOx),e'(CO),e'(CH),e'(PM) when carrying freight via the main lines of the railway network by trains weighing 3000 divided by 7500 t has been singled out. The results constitute sufficient grounds to organise control of harmful emissions and provide an opportunity to solve practical tasks with a slight tolerance (3 divided by 7%) taking account of diesel engines of locomotives used for transportation. It has been proposed to measure the freight transportation efficiency according to the complex criterion KE-E, indicates the energy efficiency and the assessment of environmental pollution originating from diesel engine of locomotives. The reserves for increasing the efficiency of energy usage have been studied according to the variational mathematical computer modelling data. A methodology for measuring the freight transportation rationality and estimating the optimal indicators has been proposed, using the values of the KE-E criterion for the railways freight transportation, as well as the technology for controlling the traction characteristics as well as energy and ecology indicators of diesel engines of locomotives in operational conditions.

AB  - The present work aims to show that high throughput imaging systems can be useful to estimate mesozooplankton community size and taxonomic descriptors that can be the base for consistent large scale monitoring of plankton communities. Such monitoring is required by the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) in order to ensure the Good Environmental Status (GES) of European coastal and offshore marine ecosystems. Time and cost-effective, automatic, techniques are of high interest in this context. An imaging-based protocol has been applied to a high frequency time series (every second day between April 2003 to April 2004 on average) of zooplankton obtained in a coastal site of the NW Mediterranean Sea, Villefranche Bay. One hundred eighty four mesozooplankton net collected samples were analysed with a Zooscan and an associated semi-automatic classification technique. The constitution of a learning set designed to maximize copepod identification with more than 10,000 objects enabled the automatic sorting of copepods with an accuracy of 91% (true positives) and a contamination of 14% (false positives). Twenty seven samples were then chosen from the total copepod time series for detailed visual sorting of copepods after automatic identification. This method enabled the description of the dynamics of two well-known copepod species, Centropages typicus and Temora stylifera, and 7 other taxonomically broader copepod groups, in terms of size, biovolume and abundance-size distributions (size spectra). Also, total copepod size spectra underwent significant changes during the sampling period. These changes could be partially related to changes in the copepod assemblage taxonomic composition and size distributions. This study shows that the use of high throughput imaging systems is of great interest to extract relevant coarse (i.e. total abundance, size structure) and detailed (i.e. selected species dynamics) descriptors of zooplankton dynamics. Innovative zooplankton analyses are therefore proposed and open the way for further development of zooplankton community indicators of changes. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Nuphar pumila is a glacial relict, which is nowadays rare throughout Europe and red-listed in most European regions. In Switzerland only three autochthonous populations and one population of the hybrid with N. lutea (N. xspenneriana) have survived to date, one of them in the canton of Zurich. To protect this species regionally, the canton of Zurich has commissioned the ex situ propagation of specimens, which then had been introduced to 37 water bodies in protected areas, including one known former site. Since only about 10% of these introductions had been successful, there was a wish to identify causes of this lack of success. To this end, we compared the vegetation and physical-chemical parameters of the four natural sites in Switzerland with the successful and unsuccessful introduction sites. Additionally, for a subset of sites, we assessed diatom genus composition as a proxy of water quality. Moreover, we derived vegetation plots of N. pumila and N. lutea from across Europe from the European Vegetation Archive (EVA) to compare their site conditions, using mean ecological indicator values and bioclimatic variables of the localities. We found that inside Switzerland the main differences were between the natural sites and all introduction sites, while successful and unsuccessful introduction sites hardly differed in the determined parameters. Natural sites had cooler water with lower magnesium content, and according to mean ecological indicator values, also lower nutrient status. The diatom data, though limited in amount, point into the same direction. The EVA data demonstrate that stands of N. pumila are mainly more oligotrophic, but also cooler and more acidic than those of N. lutea. We could not find any factor that explains the success vs. lack of success of plantations of N. pumila in multiple sites in the canton of Zurich, but our results rather indicate that due to the relatively warm climate, the high atmogenic nitrogen input and the predominantly base-rich bedrock, the sites in the canton are generally not particularly well suited for N. pumila. We consider it therefore more promising to protect and possibly (re-) introduce N. pumila in other cantons with higher elevation, base-poor bedrock and lower atmogenic nitrogen input.

AB  - Studying the interdependence between vegetation and the buried depth of groundwater is key to revealing the ecological and hydrological processes affecting vegetation in arid and semi-arid areas. The study area, the Yushen coal mine district, is located in the Mu Us Desert, which is the typical arid and semi-arid transition zone in Western China. There are a large number of areas with shallow with shallow groundwater depths in the region, which provides favorable growing conditions for vegetation growth. Due to sparse precipitation and rapid evaporation of water in the region, vegetative growth is tied closely to the depth of groundwater table. Given the widespread and intensive exploitation of the region's abundant coal resources, the decline of groundwater table poses a threat to surface vegetation ecology health inevitably. Therefore, study of the ecological effects of large-scale changes to the depth of groundwater is of great significance for guiding exploitation of coal resources, eco-environmental conservation and future rehabilitation efforts. Using Yushen coal mine district as a study area, the quantitative relationship between groundwater buried depth and vegetation development is determined in different ecological and geological (eco-geological) environments by combining MODIS remote sensing with measured groundwater buried depth data as well as supplementing with other on-site investigations and collection of data. Using ArcGIS 10.5 and MATLAB R2018a, we divided the study area into 3 eco-geological environments: (1) phreatic water desert shallows oasis; (2) surface runoff (loess) gully; and (3) surface water river-valley oasis. The vegetation types, growth status, and diversity differed within the eco-geological environments. Based on the sensitivity of vegetation to the buried depth of groundwater in each of the three eco-geological environments, we further classified areas within the eco-geological environments as either type-1 sensitive, either type-2 sensitive or non-sensitive. We found that sensitivity class was related to the groundwater buried depth. Vegetative ecology improved with groundwater buried depth drawdown, while it deteriorated in type-2 sensitive areas. Vegetative ecology generally exhibited little dependence on groundwater buried depth in non-sensitive areas, where climate and soil moisture content were the predominant influences.

AB  - Livestock-caused rangeland degradation remains a major policy concern globally and the subject of widespread scientific study. This concern persists in part because it is difficult to isolate the effects of livestock from climate and other factors that influence ecosystem conditions. Further, degradation studies seldom use multiple plant and soil indicators linked to a clear definition of and ecologically grounded framework for degradation assessment that distinguishes different levels of degradation. Here, we integrate two globally applicable rangeland degradation frameworks and apply them to a broad-scale empirical data set for the country of Mongolia. We compare our assessment results with two other recent national rangeland degradation assessments in Mongolia to gauge consistency of findings across assessments and evaluate the utility of our framework. We measured livestock-use impacts across Mongolia's major ecological zones: mountain and forest steppe, eastern steppe, steppe, and desert steppe. At 143 sites in 36 counties, we measured livestock-use and degradation indicators at increasing distances from livestock corrals in winter-grazed pastures. At each site, we measured multiple indicators linked to our degradation framework, including plant cover, standing biomass, palatability, species richness, forage quality, vegetation gaps, and soil surface characteristics. Livestock use had no effect on soils, plant species richness, or standing crop biomass in any ecological zone, but subtly affected plant cover and palatable plant abundance. Livestock effects were strongest in the steppe zone, moderate in the desert steppe, and limited in the mountain/forest and eastern steppes. Our results aligned closely with those of two other recent country-wide assessments, suggesting that our framework may have widespread application. All three assessments found that very severe and irreversible degradation is rare in Mongolia (1-18% of land area), with most rangelands slightly (33-53%) or moderately (25-40%) degraded. We conclude that very severe livestock-induced rangeland degradation is overstated in Mongolia. However, targeted rangeland restoration coupled with monitoring, adaptive management and stronger rangeland governance are needed to prevent further degradation where heavy grazing could cause irreversible change. Given the broad applicability of our degradation framework for Mongolia, we suggest it be tested for application in other temperate grasslands throughout Central Asia and North America.

AB  - 1. Plants like mosses can be sensitive stress markers of subtle shifts in Arctic and Antarctic environmental conditions, including climate change. Traditional ground-based monitoring of fragile polar vegetation is, however, invasive, labour intensive and physically demanding. High-resolution multispectral satellite observations are an alternative, but even their recent highest achievable spatial resolution is still inadequate, resulting in a significant underestimation of plant health due to spectral mixing and associated reflectance impurities.
   2. To resolve these obstacles, we have developed a new method that uses low-altitude unmanned aircraft system (UAS) hyperspectral images of sub-decimeter spatial resolution. Machine-learning support vector regressions (SVR) were employed to infer Antarctic moss vigour from quantitative remote sensing maps of plant canopy chlorophyll content and leaf density. The same maps were derived for comparison purposes from the WorldView-2 high spatial resolution (2.2m) multispectral satellite data.
   3. We found SVR algorithms to be highly efficient in estimating plant health indicators with acceptable root mean square errors (RMSE). The systematic RMSEs for chlorophyll content and leaf density were 3.5-6.0 and 1.3-2.0 times smaller, respectively, than the unsystematic errors. However, application of correctly trained SVR machines on space-borne multispectral images considerably underestimated moss chlorophyll content, while stress indicators retrieved from UAS data were found to be comparable with independent field measurements, providing statistically significant regression coefficients of determination (median r(2)=.50, p(t test)=.0072).
   4. This study demonstrates the superior performance of a cost-efficient UAS mapping platform, which can be deployed even under the continuous cloud cover that often obscures optical high-altitude airborne and satellite observations. Antarctic moss vigour maps of appropriate resolution could provide timely and spatially explicit warnings of environmental stress events, including those triggered by climate change. Since our polar vegetation health assessment method is based on physical principles of quantitative spectroscopy, it could be adapted to other short-stature and fragmented plant communities (e.g. tundra grasslands), including alpine and desert regions. It therefore shows potential to become an operational component of any ecological monitoring sensor network.

AB  - This study compares three DEA approaches for environmental assessment, all of which are designed to examine the level of simultaneous achievement on economic prosperity and environmental protection, so measuring the degree of sustainability development. DEA, standing for Data Envelopment Analysis, has been widely applied for performance assessment in the past five decades. A new type of applications is referred to as "DEA environmental assessment" and it measures the performance of many organizations that utilize inputs to produce not only desirable outputs (e.g., electricity) but also undesirable outputs (e.g., CO2). In the previous studies, DEA-based performance evaluation for environment assessment is methodologically classified into radial or non-radial category. Recently, a new "intermediate" approach, analytically locating between the radial and non-radial measures, has been proposed as the third alternative. A use of the intermediate approach has several unique features, all of which cannot be found in the radial and non-radial ones. The new approach measures the degree of unified inefficiency on each production factor and determines the level of total unified inefficiency from the average of the sum of these inefficiency scores. This study discusses the analytical features by comparing the intermediate approach with the radial and non-radial ones. The methodological comparison attempts to convey a message that DEA is indeed an important methodology, but not perfect. Rather, it is an approximation approach to examine the performance of various organizations. Many DEA applications on energy and environment often suffer from a methodological bias, implying that different approaches produce different empirical results. Thus, in guiding a large policy issue such as the global warming and climate change, it is necessary for us to compare several different approaches (e.g., models and concepts) to derive a reliable empirical suggestion. The importance of such a message is applicable to not only DEA but also the other types of empirical research in natural and social sciences. Therefore, this study discusses the methodological bias issue from the practicality of the three DEA approaches in assessing various concerns on energy and environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - QuestionsThe forest herb layer provides a multitude of ecosystem services as a result of its species-rich character. Herb layer diversity and biomass are both influenced by tree layer composition and species richness through species-specific influences on environmental conditions. The results of observational studies on richness-biomass relationships between tree and herb layer have not been unequivocal. We examined tree species identity and richness effects on herb layer species richness, composition, biomass and nutrient concentrations in young experimental tree plantations.
   LocationBIOTREE tree diversity experiment, Kaltenborn, Germany.
   MethodsSixteen plots were planted in 2004, using a pool of four tree species (beech, oak, Douglas-fir, Norway spruce) and four richness levels, comprised of all possible species combinations. In this way, complete dilution was avoided, allowing separation of tree species identity and richness effects. Mixed plots consisted of a matrix of monospecific patches. One permanent vegetation quadrat of 1m(2) was established in the centre of four patches per plot. The herb layer was monitored in 2004 and 2010; in 2010 light measurements were performed in each quadrat, and in 2011 above-ground biomass was sampled on 0.25m(2) within the quadrat.
   ResultsCommunity composition shifted markedly between 2004 and 2010. Tree species identity did not yet influence temporal compositional turnover or herb layer species richness in 2004 and 2010. Ellenberg N indicated a temporal shift towards lower soil fertility under all tree species, whereas Ellenberg R indicated decreasing soil acidity under beech and Douglas-fir. Ellenberg L and F showed no shift from 2004 to 2010. Apart from the significantly lower Ellenberg N for beech, none of the Ellenberg indicators indicated interspecific differences. Douglas-fir, and especially Norway spruce, negatively influenced total above-ground herb layer biomass. Douglas-fir also induced lower relative light availability, higher potassium, magnesium and nitrogen concentrations and lower carbon:nitrogen ratios in the total biomass. Higher tree species richness positively affected graminoid and total biomass and also slightly increased plot-level herb layer species richness.
   ConclusionsDespite the young age of the experiment, tree species identity and richness effects on the herb layer could be discerned. We expect these relations to become stronger with time.

AB  - Eutrophication enhances organic C inputs to the sea bottom, so that the quantity and biochemical composition of sedimentary organic matter are expected to change under different trophic status conditions. In turn, changes in the trophic status are often associated with shifts in the abundance and community structure of the benthos. We investigated the quantity and biochemical composition (protein, carbohydrate, lipid and phytopigment) of sedimentary organic matter together with abundance and community structure of meiofauna in two regions of the Mediterranean Sea characterized by different levels of primary productivity. At each region, five transects were randomly selected along the coastline. At each transect, three stations located at increasing distance from the shore and different water depth were investigated. Uni- and multivariate analyses of variance revealed that the quantity and biochemical composition of sediment organic matter displayed the most relevant differences between stations, suggesting their potential use as descriptor of the benthic trophic state at the small spatial scale (i.e. <2 km). The correlation analyses, corroborated by nMDS dispersion plots and cluster analyses highlighted that the biopolymeric C content of the sediment and the algal fraction of sediment organic matter were inversely related and able to discriminate the trophic status at the scale of region, transect and station. Uni- and multivariate analyses on meiofaunal assemblages revealed that differences at different spatial scales were less evident in terms of abundance and richness of meiofaunal taxa but were more evident in terms of taxonomic composition. Furthermore, these differences were enhanced when the analyses were restricted using the meiofaunal rare taxa (i.e. those taxa representing <1% of the total meiofaunal abundance) as an input. The results of the multivariate multiple regression analyses revealed that the taxonomic composition of meiofaunal assemblages was driven mostly by protein, biopolymeric C and chlorophyll-a concentrations but also by the algal fraction of biopolymeric C. We conclude that, the study of the quantity and biochemical composition of sediment organic matter coupled with an analysis of the rare meiofaunal taxa allows an ecosystem-oriented assessment of the trophic status of marine benthic environments.

TI  - PEATLAND AS AN INDICATOR OF LOADING OF THE ENVIRONMENT WITH ATMOSPHERIC IMMISSIONS
T2  - ROSTLINNA VYROBA

AB  - Data on peatland contamination with heavy metals and other risk elements were collected in the contribution.  The research included important peatlands of the regions characterizing various degree of atmospheric immission loading.  The following peatlands were studied:  Borkovicka blata, Zofina Hut, Mrtvy luh, Rokytecka slat, Nova Hurka, Krasno, U Zlatokopecke cesty, Nove Mesto, Grunwald, Nacetin, Na piscinach, Jerabi louka, Pancicske raseliniste, V Eliscine udoli, Panske Pole, Rejviz, Karlovice, Rokytnice, Velke Darko.  Samples were taken from overall profiles of peatlands, including sapropel horizons and mineral parent rock, that is in layers of 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-50 and 50 cm in each layer.  The samples were analyzed for mobile and total contents of As, Be, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Li, Mo, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn.  In addition, the analyses were supplemented with another chemical composition, physical properties (to a depth of 1 m), biological activity (0-30, 30-50, 50-100 cm) and chemical analyses of major representatives of plant cover.  This part includes exclusively total contents of the studied elements.
   The results obtained were assessed to the relation of the type of the peatland, geomorphological unit, altitude.  Attention was paid to the limit values (minima and maxima), average values for all bearings, profiles and distribution in the profile.
   The results confirm that the peatlands (especially sphagnum-peat in the original conditions) are excellent indicators of loading of the environment with immissions.  They can be considered as indicators of accumulation of contaminants released to the biosphere.
   Contamination of individual peatlands is of various degrees.  Neither unambiguous relation of the degree of contamination to the type of peatland, nor to altitude (except Pb) was confirmed.  The degree of contamination of peatlands is associated with the region or with its atmospheric immisions.  The lowest values of studied risk elements were recorded in the Sumava Mountains, Trebocska panev and Slavkovsky les (forest).  The highest values were reported from Krusne hory, Jizerske hory (mountains), Krkonose and Jicinska pahorkatina (upland).
   Out of studied contents of risk elements, the immobilizing effect of human acids was recorded in Pb, Zn and Cd.  The content of these elements was reducing conspicuously with the depth of peatland profile.
   The maximum available contents of risk elements in peatland soils and peats were suggested in relation to the reduced bulk density.

AB  - Background: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have attracted worldwide attention due to their carcinogenic, teratogenic, and mutagenic effects, environmental persistence, and bioaccumulation characteristics. Therefore, the sensitive, reliable, and rapid detection of PAHs in sediment is of great importance.
   Objective: To develop a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence and ultraviolet detection after Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (QuEChERS) treatment for simultaneous determination of 16U.S. Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs in sediment samples.
   Method: The samples were ultrasonically extracted with acetone and then the supernatant was purified with a modified QuEChERS method. After centrifugation, the supernatant was injected into the HPLC system for analysis. The separation was accomplished on a ZORBAX Eclipse PAH column (150x4.6mm, 3.5 mu m) and the column temperature was set at 30 degrees C. The flow rate of the mobile phase consisting of water and acetonitrile in gradient elution mode was fixed at 0.9mL/min. Detection was conducted on an ultraviolet detector and a fluorescence detector simultaneously. The qualitative analysis was based on retention time and the quantification was based on standard curves.
   Results: Under the optimal conditions, this method showed good linearities in the range of 10-200 mu g/L with correlation coefficients greater than 0.9993. The method had LODs ranging from 0.00108 to 0.314ng/g. The mean recoveries ranged from 78.4 to 117% with intra-day and inter-day RSDs of 0.592-10.7% and 1.01-13.0%, respectively. The proposed method was successfully applied to the detection of 16 PAHs in sediment samples collected from the Funan River in Chengdu, China with total contents of 431-2143ng/g.dw.
   Conclusions: The established method is simple, rapid, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective. It can be applied to the analysis of 16 PAHs in sediment samples.
   Highlights: A method of QuEChERS with ultrasound-assisted extraction combined with HPLC has been established for the analysis of 16 PAHs in sediment samples and the proposed method has been successfully applied to the analysis PAHs in real sediment samples.

AB  - Urban streams are vulnerable to a range of impacts, leading to the impairment of ecosystem services. However, studies on phytoplankton growth in tropical lotic systems are still limited. Citizen science approaches use trained volunteers to collect environmental data. We combined data on urban streams collected by volunteers with data obtained by professional scientists to identify potential drivers of phytoplankton community and determine thresholds for Cyanobacteria development. We combined datasets (n = 117) on water quality and environmental observations in 64 Brazilian urban streams with paired data on phytoplankton. Sampling activities encompassed dry (July 2013 and July 2015) and warm (February and November 2014) seasons. Volunteers quantified phosphate (PO43-), nitrate (NO3-) and turbidity in each stream using colorimetric and optical methods and recorded environmental conditions in the immediate surroundings of the sites through visual observations. We used non-parametric statistics to identify correlations among nutrients, turbidity and phytoplankton. We also looked for thresholds with respect to high Cyanobacteria abundance (>50,000 cells/mL). The streams were characterized by relatively high nutrient concentrations (PO43- : 0.11 mg/L; NO3-: 2.6 mg/L) and turbidity (49 NTU). Phytoplanlcton densities reached 189,000 cells/mL, mainly potentially toxic Cyanobacteria species. Moderate but significant (p < 0.05) correlations were observed between phytoplankton density and turbidity (rho = 0.338, Spearman) and PO43- (rho = 0292), but not with NO3-. Other important variables (river flow, temperature and light) were not assessed. Volunteers' observations covaried with phytoplankton density (p < 0.05, Krusl<alWallis), positively with increasing number of pollution sources and negatively with presence of vegetation in the riparian zone. Our results indicate that thresholds for PO43- (0.11 mg/L) can be used to separate systems with high Cyanobacteria density. The number of pollution sources provided a good indicator of waterbodies with potential cyanobacteria problems. Our findings reinforced the need for nutrient abatement and restoration of local streams and highlighted the benefits of volunteer-based monitoring to support decision-making. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Instability in a rock slope is highly dependent on unfavorable orientations of the discontinuities in the rock mass. Therefore, kinematic analysis has been used to analyze the structural condition of unfavorably oriented discontinuities using the stereographic projection method. In this analysis, the orientation of a discontinuity is compared with the slope orientation and friction angle by plotting the orientation of a discontinuity onto a stereonet. This stereonet-based kinematic analysis assumes that a uniform slope orientation and a tightly clustered orientation of the discontinuities exist. However, the slope orientation, represented by the slope aspect and slope angle, cannot be uniform if the slope faces are rugged, as in many natural rock slopes, or if the slope was created by deficient blasting. Moreover, the orientation of discontinuities measured in the field is often scattered, even in a same discontinuity set. However, such variations cannot be included in traditional kinematic analysis and representative values of the slope orientation and mean orientation of a discontinuity are used, which creates uncertainties. To overcome these problems, a GIS-based methodology using grid-based data on the slope orientation data and a probabilistic approach is proposed. To take into account variations in the slope orientation, a digital elevation model (DEM) of the slope face was used and the topographic data of the slope face was derived from the DEM. The slope faces were divided into 2 x 2 m(2) pixels, and the orientation of the slope face was evaluated based on the grid cells. In addition, the orientation of a discontinuity was treated as a random variable, thereby accounting for natural variability, and a probabilistic analysis approach was adopted to deal with uncertainties and variability. Therefore, a grid-based probabilistic analysis module for the kinematic analysis was developed and used on a cell-by-cell basis to predict instability in spatially distributed slope faces. This probabilistic kinematic analysis was performed in a GIS environment because GIS provides an excellent platform for management and manipulation of raster-based spatial data. We applied this approach to the spatially distributed steep rock slopes in the Baehuryeong area, Korea, located along a tortuous mountain road. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Scleractinian corals harbor microorganisms that form dynamic associations with the coral host and exhibit substantial genetic and ecological diversity. Microbial associates may provide defense against pathogens and serve as bioindicators of changing environmental conditions. Here we describe the bacterial assemblages associated with two of the most common and phylogenetically divergent reef-building corals in the Caribbean, Montastraea faveolata and Porites astreoides. Contrasting life history strategies and disease susceptibilities indicate potential differences in their microbiota and immune function that may in part drive changes in the composition of coral reef communities. The ribotype structure and diversity of coral-associated bacteria within the surface mucosal layer (SML) of healthy corals were assessed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting and 454 bar-coded pyrosequencing. Corals were sampled at disparate Caribbean locations representing various levels of anthropogenic impact. We demonstrate here that M. faveolata and P. astreoides harbor distinct, host-specific bacteria but that specificity varies by species and site. P. astreoides generally hosts a bacterial assemblage of low diversity that is largely dominated by one bacterial genus, Endozoicomonas, within the order Oceanospirillales. The bacterial assemblages associated with M. faveolata are significantly more diverse and exhibit higher specificity at the family level than P. astreoides assemblages. Both corals have more bacterial diversity and higher abundances of disease-related bacteria at sites closer to the mainland than at those furthest away. The most diverse bacterial taxa and highest relative abundance of disease-associated bacteria were seen for corals near St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) (2.5 km from shore), and the least diverse taxa and lowest relative abundance were seen for corals near our most pristine site in Belize (20 km from shore). We conclude that the two coral species studied harbor distinct bacterial assemblages within the SML, but the degree to which each species maintains specific microbial associations varies both within each site and across large spatial scales. The taxonomic scale (i.e., phylum versus genus) at which scientists examine coral-microbe associations, in addition to host-elicited factors and environmental fluctuations, must be considered carefully in future studies of the coral holobiont.

AB  - Digitate shell morphologies have evolved repeatedly in planktonic foraminifera throughout the Cretaceous and Cenozoic. Digitate species are usually rare in fossil and modern assemblages but show increased abundance and diversity at times during the Cretaceous and middle Eocene. In this paper we discuss the morphology and stratigraphic distribution of digitate planktonic foraminifera and establish the isotopic depth ecology of fossil ones to draw parallels with modern counterparts. delta O-18 and delta C-13 values of six extinct and two modern digitate species, from six time slices (Cenomanian, Turonian, Eocene, Miocene, Pleistocene and Holocene) have similar isotopic depth ecologies, consistently registering the most negative delta C-13 and usually the most positive delta O-18 compared to coexisting species. These results indicate a similar deep, subthermocline (>150 m) habitat, characterized by lower temperatures, reduced oxygen, and enrichment of dissolved inorganic carbon. This is consistent with water-column plankton studies that provide insight into the depth preferences of the three modern digitate species; in over 70% of observations digitates occurred in nets below 150 m, and down to 2000 m. The correlation between digitate species and subsurface habitats across multiple epochs suggests that elongated chambers were advantageous for survival in a deep mesopelagic habitat, where food is usually scarce. Increased abundance and diversity of digitates in association with some early and mid-Cretaceous oceanic anoxic events, in middle Eocene regions of coastal and equatorial upwelling, and occasionally in some modern upwelling regions, suggests an additional link with episodes of enhanced ocean productivity associated with expansion of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). We suggest that the primary function of digitate chambers was as a feeding specialization that increased effective shell size and food gathering efficiency, for survival in a usually food-poor environment, close to the OMZ. Episodes of increased digitate abundance and diversity indicate expansion of the deep-water ecologic opportunity under conditions that were unfavorable to other planktonic species. Our results provide evidence of iterative evolution reflecting common functional constraints on planktonic foraminifera shell morphology within similar subsurface habitats. They also highlight the potential of digitate species to act as indicators of deep watermasses, especially where there was expansion of the OMZ.

AB  - The pH regulation of Leishmania major promastigotes was studied as a function of the ionic composition of the medium and in response to acid and alkali load. Intracellular pH (pH(i)) was monitored by on-line ratio fluorescence using the fluorescence dependent pH indicator 2',7'-bis-(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF). In Cl--based medium (pH 7.4, 30 degrees C), the steady state pH(i) was maintained at 6.75 +/- 0.01. Only a minor (less than or equal to 0.07 +/- 0.02 unit) decrease in steady state pH(i) was observed when parasites were treated with H+-ATPase inhibitors such as vanadate, N-ethylmaleimide, or bafilomycin. After treatment with the impermeantanion transport blocker DIDS, or in the presence of the reduced analog H2DIDS, pH(i) decreased by greater than or equal to 0.2 unit. In gluconate-based medium, however, pH(i) gradually decreased to 6.53 +/- 0.05 and showed a swift but time dependent recovery (alkalinization) when Cl- or other halides or nitrate were restored to the medium. That recovery was also inhibited by pretreating cells with DIDS or exposing them to H2DIDS. The findings provide evidence for Cl- transport mechanisms that support a pH, regulatory process which is operative in acidic-neutral cytoplasmic milieu. Under alkali load induced by weak base treatment, parasites undergo a rapid alkalinization which was followed first by a fast but limited acidification and subsequently by a slower but more robust acidification (recovery) to reach a pH(i) of 6.85 +/- 0.05. The recovery of pH(i) was markedly reduced in the presence of H2DIDS and/or in the absence of Cl- in the medium. Based on these results and on the fact that the natural parasite environment is both alkaline and rich in HCO3-CO32- ions, we propose (Cl-)(o) (HCO3-)(i) or (Cl-)(o)-(OH-)(i) exchange as the major mechanism of regulatory cell acidification which is operative upon cell alkalinization. The possibility that similar pH regulatory mechanisms are operative in Leishmania promastigotes in both acidic and alkaline conditions is considered. The putative pH regulatory mechanisms might serve as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Motivated by the UN Global Sustainable Development Goals on achieving sustainable freshwater ecosystem, this study was undertaken to examine two important water bodies in north central Nigeria (Baka Jeba and Penyan Rivers) protected locally by the rural community and serving as sources of water supply, for biodiversity conservation and protection. The status of macroinvertebrate biodiversity as important variable in assessing the environmental health and suitability of the water quality of the rivers was evaluated for a period of 8 months, between February and September 2017 using standard methods. The mean values of Physicochemical variables recorded during the study period revealed that the nutrient loads (nitrites and phosphates levels) was relatively low for both streams as well as conductivity levels (<82 mu S/cm). Dissolved oxygen values indicated that the water bodies were well aerated with values ranging between 5.21 and 7.83 mg/l in both the dry and wet seasons. A total of 65 invertebrate taxa from 34 families in 10 orders were recorded during the study, dominated by aquatic insects with a few representation of decapods and gastropods, and Arachnids were sporadically present. The overall abundance of macroinvertebrates was not significantly different (p > 0.05) among the sampling stations with number of individuals caught ranging between 1208 and 1728 per station. Of the major faunal groups, Ephemeroptera contributed the highest percentage of individuals (>29%) in both streams. Generally, Beka Jeba Stream contained more diverse taxa of macroinvertebrates compared to Penyan Stream. The Ephemeroptera-Trichoptera-Odonata (ETO) were the dominant groups collected in the river systems indicating fairly good water quality conditions. The Chironomids and other tolerant macroinvertebrate larvae were only sporadically present. Overall, the values of the physical and chemical parameters (low BOD, low nutrient levels and high dissolved oxygen) obtained for the two rivers and the wide diversity of sensitive macroinvertebrates portends the water body to be of good quality. Therefore utmost care should be taken to conserve and preserve these species as indicators of water quality by reducing the impact of key drivers of declines in macroinvertebrate biodiversity, including habitat degradation and pollution.

AB  - Immersive environments may restore relevant context during consumer sensory testing and hence, could yield better discrimination and reliability in acceptance tests compared to traditional methods. To date, no study has compared hedonic data from these settings to those obtained in an actual consumption environment. Presently, sixty-two red-wine consumers evaluated the same 4 wines in 3 environments-a traditional sensory booth, an immersive wine bar, and an actual wine bar. For each wine, subjects evaluated overall liking, future consumption habits, and price estimation. Interestingly, wine liking did not differ across the three environments (p = 0.076) nor was there a significant wine by environment interaction (p = 0.955). However, at the individual level, wine liking was less stable. For each subject, the magnitude of difference in liking scores for each wine was calculated between two environments. On average, the greatest difference in liking scores occurred between the traditional booths and the actual wine bar (1.7 +/- 0.1) and was significantly greater than the difference in liking scores between the booths and immersive wine bar (1.4 +/- 0.1, p = 0.008); the liking difference between the immersive and actual wine bar (1.6 +/- 0.1) was intermediate. Consumption behavior was also differentially impacted by environment. Subjects were more willing to order the wines at a wine bar when evaluating in the actual environment compared to the traditional booths (p = 0.035). However, environment did not influence the subject's willingness to purchase the wine to drink at home (p = 0.064). Generally, consumers were able to accurately differentiate price amongst the wines (p < 0.001) but estimated the wines at a higher price point in the actual environment compared to the traditional (p = 0.049). Overall, results suggest wine liking scores across environments were stable within the population, whereas greater variability was observed in individuals when comparing liking scores between traditional booths and the actual environment. Due to the marginal effect of the environment additional research is needed to evaluate the use of immersive technologies and better understand under which conditions context is important.

AB  - The growth of humankind has brought with it several environmental problems that have worsened over time, including the loss of insect biodiversity. The Odonata order have been indicated by several authors as relevant bioindicators for assessing and monitoring environmental conditions of specific locations. The main objective of this study was to conduct an inventory of the Odonata diversity in the Pampa Biome, of the Southern region of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The species survey was conducted between November 2014 and October 2015. Adult insects were collected in Capao do Leao, Pelotas and Rio Grande cities. Each location was visited nine times, totalizing 54 samplings. Entomological nets were used for capturing adult insects, which were then kept in entomological envelopes. The identification of the specimens was carried out with taxonomic keys of Lencioni and Heckman. In addition, Chao-1, the Shannon-Wiener and Jackknife indexes were associated with the sampling areas. During the species survey a total of 2 680 Odonata specimens were collected, representing 45 species encompassed in 22 genera and six families. The Libellulidae and Coenagrionidae families were registered in 60 and 30 % of the specimens sampled, followed of the Aeshnidae, Calopterygidae, Gomphidae and Lestidae, of reduced occurrence. The genera Erythrodiplax, Micrathyria and Ischnura were found at least once in all the visited sites. The study resulted in the registration for the first time of the following species: Progomphus complicatus Selys, Lestes minutus Selys, Homeoura ambigua Ris, and Tauriphila xiphea Ris. These species were not previously reported in any Odonata study of the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul. In regard to Odonata diversity in the Southern region of Rio Grande do Sul, Libellulidae and Coenagrionidae are the families more abundants. Erythrodiplax and Micrathyria are the most common genera. Miathyria marcella represented 9.6 % of all collected libellulidae and was the most abundant specie. Capao do Leao has the largest species diversity (wealth), the largest number of collected specimens and more diversity than Pelotas and Rio Grande. However, the results showed that the Odonatofauna in the State are still little known, and new studies are needed to better describe this group in other regions.

AB  - We present a 2.5-year-long sediment trap record of dinoflagellate cyst production in the Cariaco Basin, off Venezuela (southern Caribbean Sea). The site lies under the influence of wind-driven, seasonal upwelling which promotes high levels of primary productivity during boreal winter and spring. Changes in dinoflagellate cyst production is documented between November 1996 and May 1999 at similar to 14-day intervals and interpreted in the context of in situ observations of physico-chemical and biological parameters measured at the mooring site.& para;& para;Dinoflagellate cyst assemblages are diverse (57 taxa) and dominated by cyst taxa of heterotrophic affinity, primarily Brigantedinium spp. (51 % of the total trap assemblage). Average cyst fluxes to the trap are high (17.1 x 10(3) cysts m(-2) day(-1)) and show great seasonal and interannual variability. On seasonal timescales, dinoflagellate cyst production responds closely to variations in upwelling strength, with increases in cyst fluxes of several protoperidinioid taxa observed during active upwelling intervals, predominantly Brigantedinium spp. Cyst taxa produced by autotrophic dinoflagellates, in particular Bitectatodinium spongium, also respond positively to upwelling. Several "spiny brown" cysts contribute substantially to the assemblages, including Echinidinium delicatum (9.7 %) and Echinidinium granulatum (7.3 %), and show a closer affinity to weaker upwelling conditions. The strong El Nino event of 1997/98 appears to have negatively impacted cyst production in the basin with a 1-year lag, and may have contributed to the unusually high fluxes of cysts type "Cp" (possibly the cysts of the toxic dinoflagellate Cochlodinium polykrikoides sensu Li et al., 2015), with cyst type Cp fluxes up to 11.8 x 10(3) cysts m(-2) day(-1) observed during the weak upwelling event of February-May 1999.& para;& para;Possible trophic interactions between dinoflagellates and other major planktonic groups are also investigated by comparing the timing and magnitude of cyst production with proxies for phytoplanktonic communities (from photopigment data) and micro- to macrozooplankton abundance indicators (from palynological data) at the site. This work provides new, detailed insights into the ecology of cystproducing dinoflagellates and will allow for more detailed interpretations of fossil assemblages extracted from sedimentary records in the basin and elsewhere.

AB  - Differences in plant species composition between a community and its species pool are considered to reflect the effect of community filters. If we define the species pool as a set of species able to reach a site and form a viable population in a given abiotic environment (i.e. to pass the dispersal and abiotic filter), the difference in species composition should correspond to the effect of biotic interactions. However, most of the operational definitions of the species pool are based on co-occurrence patterns and thus also reflect the effect of biotic relationships, including definitions based on functional plant traits, Ellenberg indicator values or Beals index. We conducted two seed introduction experiments in an oligotrophic wet meadow with the aim of demonstrating that many species excluded, according to the above definitions, from a species pool are in fact able to establish there successfully if competition is removed. In sowing experiments, we studied the establishment and survival of species after the removal of competition (i.e. in artificial gaps) and in intact vegetation. We also investigated inter-annual variability of seed germination and seedling establishment and competitive exclusion of sown species. The investigated species also included those from very different habitats (i.e. species with very low corresponding Beals index or Ellenberg indicator values that were different from the target community weighted mean). Many of these species were able to grow in the focal wet meadow if competition was removed, but they did not establish and survive in the intact community. These species are thus not limited by abiotic conditions, but by the biotic filter. We also recorded a great inter-annual variability in seed germination and seedling establishment. Competitive exclusion of species with different ecological requirements could be quite fast (one and half seasons) in some species, but some non-resident species were able to survive several seasons; the resident species were able to persist in competition. Comparison of realized vegetation composition with the corresponding species pool greatly underestimates the potential impact of the biotic filter if the delimitation of the species pool is based on the realized niches of species and co-occurrence patterns.

AB  - The understanding of the impurities in natural snow is important in realizing its atmospheric quality, soil characteristics, and the pollution caused to the environment. Knowledge of the occurrence of major ions and trace metals in the snow in the megacity of Istanbul is very limited. This manuscript attempts to understand the origin of major soluble ions (fluoride, acetate, formate, chlorite, chloride, nitrite, chlorate, bromide, nitrate, sulfate, phosphate, and perchlorate) and some trace metals (Fe, Mn, Cd, Co, Ni, Pb, Zn, Cu) in winter surface snow, collected in Istanbul, Turkey. The sampling of the surface snow was conducted after each precipitation during the winter of 2015-2016 at three sites in the city. Besides the statistical evaluation of the major ions, and some trace metal concentrations, the chemical variations along with atmospheric circulations, which are important modification mechanisms that influence the concentrations, were investigated in the study. At examined locations and times, 12 major anions were investigated and in these anions fluoride, chlorite, chlorate, bromide, and perchlorate in the snow samples were below the detection limit; only SO42-, NO3-, and CI- were found to be in the range of 1.11-17.90, 0.75-4.52, and 0.19-3.01 mg/L. Also, according to the trace element determination, the concentration was found to be 29.2-53.7, 2.0-16.1, 1.0-2.2, 50.1-71.1, 24.2-35.2, ND-7.9, 43.2-106.6, and 3.0-17.7 mu g/L for Fe, Mn, Cd, Co, Ni, Pb, Zn, and Cu, respectively. The major anions and investigated trace elements here originated mainly from anthropogenic and atmospheric circulation and mainly influenced by northerly and southerly circulation patterns. While the main limitations in the present study may be the low number of samples that may not be entirely representative, accurately reflect identification, or support other previously observed local measurements, we believe that the type of data presented in this study has the potential to be used in the field of environmental risk assessment and, as result, for human health.

AB  - Background: Organisms can be conceptualized as systems in which input energy is allocated to competing needs and on which natural selection acts to maximize one particular need reproductive output. In large part, this is achieved by minimizing the energy required by other needs. Among the more important competing needs in most fish is the need to swim, and fish musculature, physiology, and shape have evolved to minimize swimming energy use in an environment- and lifestyle-dependent manner.
   Question: How have growth and swimming performance evolved during adaptation to different freshwater habitats in the threespine stickleback? Does variation in early life food rations affect performance?
   Hypotheses: Based on presumed lifestyles, we predict that oceanic stickleback will show the highest growth rate and swimming performance, and of the freshwater populations, we expect those representing the limnetic ecotype to show stronger swimming performance than populations of the benthic ecotype, but not stronger growth performance. Month-long periods of nutrient deprivation early in life will negatively affect all three ecotypes, with deprivation later in the first growing season (closer to the overwintering period) having the largest effect on both performance variables.
   Organism: Eighteen allopatric populations of threespine stickleback, including six ancestral oceanic, six benthic, and six limnetic populations.
   Methods: We used an acute swimming assay performed on sub-adult (9-month-old) fish that measures prolonged swimming ability as an indicator of aerobic muscle capacity. We also measured size achieved, because size itself affects swimming performance. We subjected juvenile stickleback to reduced rations (one-half normal) during either their second, third, or fourth month of life to simulate diet variability, which is known to affect growth trajectories and muscle development.
   Results: Oceanic stickleback grew faster than freshwater stickleback under control conditions, but comparative growth was more variable when dietary reductions were considered. Diet restriction late in the first fall produced the most significant change in growth. Variations in growth across populations within ecotypes were also observed. Swimming stamina showed strong variation across ecotypes, and also modest population-level variation. Dietary restriction had less effect on swimming stamina than on size.

AB  - The management of riparian vegetation which includes cutting operations of grass, reeds, bushes and trees, is very important to reduce hydrogeologic risk.
   In Tuscany, riparian biomass and residues are mainly left shredded along courses or disposed in landfills as special wastes: actually different laws prohibit that tree trunks are abandoned in areas naturally affected by flooding, because they can be moved contributing to increase the water level and to maximize the hydraulic risk of some other nearby areas. In some cases, it is also possible to store the logs in specified sites from where they can be taken and used as a fuel in fireplaces or domestic heating plants.
   This work studies the possibility of the reuse of riparian vegetation as biomass for energy production and evaluates benefits and drawbacks from the economical, environmental and managerial points of Particularly, a specific methodology has been developed for two hydrological districts of Tuscany, view. with different typologies and densities of vegetation. First, an estimation of biomass distribution on the land and an evaluation of annual wood availability have been carried out; then, different chains concerning harvesting operation, biomass transport, storage conditions and final utilisation, have been defined and compared by a specific multicriteria analysis (MCA): finally, for the most suitable bio-energy chains the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been implemented. Results of the LCA have also permitted to validate some environmental indicators used in the MCA, as mechanisation level of yards, energy efficiency of plants or transport distances.
   The decision making tool developed allows to compare costs and environmental benefits of the energy use of riparian vegetation, supporting local authorities involved in energy planning: in this way it is possible to confront different alternatives to match the energy demand and meet the energy saving and sustainability issues at the lowest cost for the community.
   In conclusion, the most interesting bio-energy chains, based on technology of direct combustion, are those that require a limited forestry mechanisation, the short transport distances and the medium sized plants. The LCA applied to these most suitable chains has also shown significant environmental benefits to promote the energetic use of riparian biomass instead of fossil fuels. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - delta(13)C values of C(3) plants are indicators of plant carbon-water relations that integrate plant responses to environmental conditions. However, few studies have quantified spatial variation in plant delta(13)C at the landscape scale. We determined variation in leaf delta(13)C, leaf nitrogen per leaf area (N(area)), and specific leaf area (SLA) in April and August 2005 for all individuals of three common woody species within a 308 x 12-m belt transect spanning an upland-lowland topoedaphic gradient in a subtropical savanna in southern Texas. Clay content, available soil moisture, and soil total N were all negatively correlated with elevation. The delta(13)C values of Prosopis glandulosa (deciduous N(2)-fixing tree legume), Condalia hookeri (evergreen shrub), and Zanthoxylum fagara (evergreen shrub) leaves increased 1-4 parts per thousand with decreasing elevation, with the delta(13)C value of P. glandulosa leaves being 1-3 parts per thousand higher than those of the two shrub species. Contrary to theory and results from previous studies, delta(13)C values were highest where soil water was most available, suggesting that some other variable was overriding or interacting with water availability. Leaf N(area) was positively correlated with leaf delta(13)C of all species (p < 0.01) and appeared to exert the strongest control over delta(13)C along this topoedaphic gradient. Since leaf N(area) is positively related to photosynthetic capacity, plants with high leaf N(area) are likely to have low p(I)/p(a) ratios and therefore higher delta(13)C values, assuming stomatal conductance is constant. Specific leaf area was not correlated significantly with leaf delta(13)C. Following a progressive growing season drought in July/August, leaf delta(13)C decreased. The lower delta(13)C in August may reflect the accumulation of 13C-depleted epicuticular leaf wax. We suggest control of leaf delta(13)C along this topoedaphic gradient is mediated by leaf N(area) rather than by stomatal conductance limitations associated with water availability.

AB  - Sites (n = 119) on drained mires located in the southern aapa mire zone in Finland were analysed by multivariate techniques. The compositional trends of the understorey vegetation were analysed by means of hybrid multidimensional scaling (HMDS). In addition to field classification, two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) and flexible unweighted paired group arithmetic average (FUPGMA) classifications were used.
   The 1st HMDS dimension primarily reflected variation along a gradient from spruce mire influence to hummock-level bog influence. Variation in nutrient status was also connected to this gradient. Factors underlying the 2nd dimension were variation in nutrient status and drainage succession (moisture). Some sample plots representing herb-rich or Molinia-rich types were separated along the 3rd dimension. The variation in understorey vegetation (i.e. the ordination space) showed high maximum correlation with stand volume r = 0.81, mean annual stand volume increment r = 0.76, and post-drainage dominant height r = 0.75. The covariation between the vegetation and peat bulk density in both the 0-10 and 10-20 cm peat layers was also strong: r = 0.55 and r = 0.80. The correlations for H-vpost were 0.64 and 0.81, respectively. Of the total macronutrient concentrations, phosphorus (r = 0.73, r = 0.75) and nitrogen (r = 0.59, r = 0.64) were the most strongly correlated with species composition. The environmental sample variables were also presented by the vegetation units of numerical classification. Most of the recorded variables, including nutrient amounts (kg ha(-1)), were examined in site quality (fertility) classes by succession phases as well. Border variants or transitional forms of the site types were common. Additional vegetation criteria (e.g. surface-water influence) more closely defined the ecology of the site. In addition to the site quality classes, a considerable amount of information about the tree stands, vegetation diversity and peat properties was associated with the separation of the succession phases, i.e. in this study transforming (phase II) vs. transformed (final phase III) sites. In conclusion, the actual vegetation appeared to well reflect various aspects of the ecological conditions, even in labile communities of commercial forests on drained peatlands.

AB  - The combined pollution, instead of single pollution, has become a widespread contamination phenomenon in aquatic environment. However, little information is now available about the joint effects of the combined pollution, especially co-existed pesticides and heavy metals, on aquatic plants. In the present study, using continuous excitation chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and the OJIP transient, comparisons of herbicide atrazine (ATZ) phytotoxicity on Iris pseudacorus between in the presence and absence of cadmium (Cd) were evaluated over an exposure period of three weeks under laboratory conditions. Results showed that both ATZ and Cd were toxic to I. pseudacorus. The ratio F-v/F-o, specific electron transport energy (ET0/RC), and photochemistry efficiency (PIabs and PItotal) of this emergent plant species at individual ATZ and Cd concentrations were significantly lower than those of the control. ATZ mainly inhibited electron transport beyond Q(A) at PSII acceptor side as indicated by the sharp rise of the J-step level of fluorescence rise kinetics. A pronounced K-step and the loss of I-step due to the damage on the OEC and PSI also occurred when ATZ was at or above 1.0 mg center dot L-1. In comparison to ATZ alone, ATZ combined with Cd resulted in a lower amplitude rise in J-step with apparent J-I and I-P phases; and significantly lower F-o with higher F-v/F-o, as well as greater ET0/RC with higher values of PIabs and PItotal. However, the adverse influences of ATZ combined with Cd on the above indicators were still significant as compared with the control. Therefore, the coexistence of Cd alleviated the individual phytotoxicities of ATZ, whereas combined pollution of ATZ and Cd still induced the decline in photosynthetic performance of I. pseudacorus, and its potential ecological impacts on the aquatic vegetation cannot be ignored. Our findings offer a better understanding of the joint effects of the pesticide and heavy metal on non-target aquatic plants, and provided valuable insights into the interaction of these pollutants in aquatic environment.

AB  - In modern conditions, the main task of agricultural producers should be the procurement of high-quality feed containing maximum nutrients used by the body of the animal to produce meat, fat, milk, etc. [1-9]. Currently, the need for animal feed is not fully satisfied. Production of feed per one conditional head of cattle had been 21.5 -23.5 cwt of feed units per year during the last twenty years, which was significantly lower than the normative indicator (35-40 cwt of feed units), and their consumption during this period was 71-80% of the norm. Therefore, special attention should be paid to the intensification of feed production [2, 4, 5, 7, 10]. However, at present not all farms have the necessary equipment and technologies [5-14], therefore, it is necessary to prepare appropriately the feed maintaining high level of vitamins. As a consequence, the cost of feed production per unit of the final product is increased by 1.5-2 or more times, as well as the cost of feed itself [5-9]. From studies carried out at different times [1-9], we know that vitamins play the role of unique biological catalysts in animals.
   The experience of livestock breeders in Holland, Switzerland, and other countries shows that grazing of dairy cows on grass is the cheapest method of producing milk. Farmers and researchers invest large amounts of money in the improvement of technologies for production and cultivation of crops [5-9]. Costs pay off with interest. Some farmers obtain even more milk in the winter than in the summer by feeding their livestock with roughage. Concentrates are used sparingly, especially since grain prices are quite high. The most used are green grass, haylage, silage, and hay obtained from cultivated land. In other words, today, it is possible to increase the production of milk and meat at least by a factor of 1.5, if a natural forage field is used. The potential of Russian meadows is very high. Russian lands are able to feed herds in the summer and significantly replenish feed supplies for the winter, but their rich potential is poorly used. [5-9].
   Therefore, the research was aimed at increasing the quality of feed preparation by improving the technological process and technical means of their drying in the farm [5-7, 9, 12, 13].

AB  - BackgroundIn mesocosms, the fate and effects of chemicals can be investigated under more realistic conditions than in laboratory-scale experiments and most mesocosm studies for higher-tier risk assessment are conducted in lentic test systems. However, particularly for the assessment of EPT taxa (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera) and gammarids (Amphipoda), which are considered to be ecologically vulnerable macroinvertebrates, lotic systems seem to be more appropriate. Within this pilot study, eight newly constructed stream mesocosms were tested for their suitability in the effect assessment of plant protection products (PPP). By using the insecticide carbaryl as an example test item, five concentrations without replicates were tested under a worst case exposure scenario and three stream mesocosms served as controls.Results15 out of the 51 invertebrate taxa found during the study belonged to EPT taxa, while the common lotic amphipod Gammarus sp. (G.pulex and G.roesili) was the most dominant taxa. Estimation of minimum detectable differences based on mean abundances and variance of taxa in the eight mesocosms before application indicate that for five arthropoda taxa and two non-arthropoda taxa, an analysis of effects would have probably would have been possible in a typical test design for a higher-tier study with more test units. Five of these taxa were typical stream taxa, i.e. mayflies, caddisflies and gammarids. With respect to the effects of carbaryl, multivariate analysis (principal response curve) indicates long-term effects on the macroinvertebrates community over several weeks for the highest carbaryl concentration (120 mu g a.i./L). Potential effects were observed for the amphipod Gammarus sp., the mayfly Ephemera danica and the caddisfly family Limnephilidae.ConclusionsThrough this study it was shown that the stream mesocosms provided suitable habitats for potential sensitive and vulnerable taxa, including those typical for lotic systems. To enable a reliable statistical analysis of the effects within the higher-tier ecological risk assessment, the number of stream mesocosms needs to be enhanced. In addition, colonisation and sampling should be improved to increase the number of taxa with sufficiently high abundances for evaluation.
