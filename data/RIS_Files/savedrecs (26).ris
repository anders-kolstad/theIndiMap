AB  - Since cuspate coastlines are especially sensitive to changes in wave climate, they serve as potential indicators of initial responses to changing wave conditions. Previous work demonstrates that Cape Hatteras and Cape Lookout, North Carolina, which are largely unaffected by shoreline stabilization efforts, have become increasingly asymmetric over the past 30years, consistent with model predictions for coastline response to increases in Atlantic Ocean summer wave heights and resulting changes in the distribution of wave-approach angles. Historic and recent shoreline change observations for Cape Fear, North Carolina, and model simulations of coastline response to an increasingly asymmetric wave climate in the presence of beach nourishment, produce comparable differences in shoreline change rates in response to changes in wave climate. Results suggest that the effect of beach nourishment is to compensate for - and therefore to mask - natural responses to wave climate change that might otherwise be discernible in patterns of shoreline change alone. Therefore, this case study suggests that the effects of wave climate change on human-modified coastlines may be detectable in the spatial and temporal patterns of shoreline stabilization activities. Similar analyses of cuspate features in areas where the change in wave climate is less pronounced (i.e. Fishing Point, Maryland/Virginia) and where local geology appears to exert control on coastline shape (i.e.Cape Canaveral, Florida), suggest that changes in shoreline configuration that may be arising from shifting wave climate are currently limited to sandy wave-dominated coastlines where the change in wave climate has been most pronounced. However, if hurricane-generated wave heights continue to increase, large-scale shifts in patterns of erosion and accretion will likely extend beyond sensitive cuspate features as the larger-scale coastline shape comes into equilibrium with changing wave conditions.

AB  - A freshwater invertebrate egg development and hatching toxicity test with an Indian freshwater pulmonate snail. Lymnaea luteola, comprising the following developmental endpoints was described: mortality, development, formation of eyes and foot structure, heart rate, duration of different larval stages, and hatching time. Developmental stages were morula, and at third, fifth, and eighth days; the trochophore, veliger, and hippo larvae, respectively. At the age of about 9th to 11th days after egg laying; more than 95% young snail hatched in control laboratory conditions. To evaluate effects on embryonic development, the pulmonate snail eggs of 24-h old were exposed to a series of nominal copper concentrations. The percentage survival of embryos treated in 10-32 mu gl(-1) of Cu after 240 h of exposure drops sharply at veliger and hippo stages. All embryos died at 100-320 mu gl(-1) of Cu within 168 h of exposure at trochophore and early veliger stages. The detected abnormalities were malformation of foot, eyes, thinness and incomplete formation of shell, growth retardation, and slow rotation of embryo within the egg capsule as compared to control embryos. Lethal and sublethal effects in terms of mortality and significant delay in hatching could be found in the 3.2, 5.6 and 10 mu gl(-1) of Cu concentrations. This species is widely distributed in the Indian subcontinent freshwater reservoirs and more sensitive to Cu than other tested aquatic test organisms; therefore, could be used as a test model of Cu and possibly other pollutants for rapid risk assessment of environmental pollutants. The snail egg embryo bioassay is simple, rapid, highly sensitive, cost-effective, and easy to test under standardized laboratory conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Males that are successful in intra-sexual competition are often assumed to be of superior quality. In the mating system of most salmonid species, intensive dominance fights are common and the winners monopolise most mates and sire most offspring. We drew a random sample of mature male brown trout (Salmo trutta) from two wild populations and determined their dominance hierarchy or traits linked to dominance. The fish were then stripped and their sperm was used for in vitro fertilisations in two full-factorial breeding designs. We recorded embryo viability until hatching in both experiments, and juvenile survival during 20 months after release into a natural streamlet in the second experiment. Since offspring of brown trout get only genes from their fathers, we used offspring survival as a quality measure to test (i) whether males differ in their genetic quality, and if so, (ii) whether dominance or traits linked to dominance reveal 'good genes'.
   Results: We found significant additive genetic variance on embryo survival, i. e. males differed in their genetic quality. Older, heavier and larger males were more successful in intra-sexual selection. However, neither dominance nor dominance indicators like body length, weight or age were significantly linked to genetic quality measured as embryo or juvenile survival.
   Conclusion: We found no evidence that females can improve their offspring's genetic viability by mating with large and dominant males. If there still were advantages of mating with dominant males, they may be linked to non-genetic benefits or to genetic advantages that are context dependent and therefore possibly not revealed under our experimental conditions - even if we found significant additive genetic variation for embryo viability under such conditions.

AB  - Sediment cores near a cold methane seep and gas hydrates in the Gulf of Mexico were analyzed for bacterial membrane phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) and isoprenoid quinones. Nearby non-seep marine sediments were also analyzed for the purpose of comparison. Our goal was to use these biomarkers as proxies for microbial community structure and redox indicators. Total PLFA varied from core to core and were significantly less abundant in non-seep marine sediments than those near the cold seep or gas hydrates. In general, saturated straight chain, terminal branched and mid-chain branched, and monounsaturated fatty acids contributed > 98% of the total PLFA. The branched fatty acids (i.e., aC15:0, iC15:0, Me10C16:0) could be largely attributed to sulfate-reducing bacteria and the monounsaturated fatty acid (i.e., 16:1 omega 7c and 18:1 omega 7c) could be attributed to sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (Beggiatoa/Thioploca). Principal component analysis of PLFA data revealed that microbial communities were consistent with the spatial distributions of gas hydrates and Beggiatoa mats and with the variation in geochemical conditions. Isoprenoid quinone profiles indicated that aerobic respiration was the dominant metabolic process in the top-most sediment layers while the anaerobic respiration dominated the deeper intervals in the marine sediments. Significant amount of cyclopropyl fatty acids at all sites indicated the stress adaptation of the bacteria in the extreme environment. The consistency between the distribution of PLFA and respiratory quinones and the variation in geochemical conditions suggested that analyses of PLFA and quinone could help us to locate the existence of the coupled sulfide-oxidization and sulfate-reduction processes.

AB  - The possibility of transmission of pathogens from duckweed supplemented feed to chickens and consequently to the human consumer necessitated the microbiological testing of duckweed fed chickens. This assessment was thus done to determine whether there is transmission of pathogens from the duckweed supplemented feed to the chickens; determine whether such infection would be systemic or be confined to the gastro-intestinal tract of the birds; and to investigate the microbial load and distribution of the microbes with age. The study birds were sacrificed at 3, 6, 8 and 10 weeks of age and examined for the indicator organisms Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. There was no discernible pattern in the microbial load of both the duckweed fed chickens and control birds with age although the control birds sampled clearly had a lower microbial load than the experimental flock. Some Salmonella and two enteropathogenic E coli strains were isolated from control and experimental sub-samples at 3 weeks. There were no Salmonellae isolated in the subsequent batches of birds and feed although a number of E. coli were isolated. More isolates were obtained from the three weeks' sub-samples (collected during wet weather) than from all the other sub-samples. The use of duckweed at this inclusion rate under the processing conditions at Nemanwa was thus concluded to be microbiologically safe as long as due caution is exercised during the processing of the duckweed and handling of the birds. There are indications that the chickens may get contaminated especially during wet weather as evidenced by the isolation of E coli and Salmonella spp from the first batch sub-samples. This was attributed to poor environmental sanitation at the plant particularly in view of the prevailing wet conditions at the time. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC), is one of the most important parameters determining soil quality and fertility, crop productivity as well as soil resistance to drought. Therefore, the preparation of accurate maps of SOC is of great importance not only for precision agriculture but also for selection of suitable strategies by policy makers. Iran suffers from deficiency of a comprehensive dataset of SOC in agricultural lands. Therefore, this study aimed to present the SOC map of Iran ' s agricultural soils, to compare SOC content of different agricultural land use and to compare SOC of agricultural lands in different Iran ' s agro-ecological zones (AEZs). For this purpose, 3327 sites were sampled. These sampling sites were located in different Iran ' s agricultural land use types (irrigated agricultural lands (AgI), dry farming (AgD), horticultural (Ho) and fallow (Fa) lands) of Iran ' s AEZs, which were selected based on soil and geology maps as well as using a 6000 x 6000 m grid-sampling pattern. According to SOC map of Iran, only 4% of all agricultural lands of Iran (0-30 cm) possessed >2% SOC. This area is located in AEZ2 with wet and humid conditions and expanse covers the western coast of the Caspian Sea. The SOC content in 70% of Iran ' s agricultural topsoil is less than 1%. Meanwhile, about 10% of the topsoil ' agriculturallands had SOC more than 1.5%. In addition, among different studied land uses, SOC content of surface soil decreases as this trend Ho>AgI> AgD> Fa because of more SOC accumulation in horticultural and irrigated agricultural lands than dry farming and fallow ones. In addition, more dairy manure applied in the horticultural lands. According to the results of SOC map, it is essential to manage agricultural strategies for better SOC sequestration in different AEZs in order to achieve sustainable agriculture.

AB  - The biological peculiarities and morphological features of introduced forms of the Elephant garlic (Allium ampeloprasum L.) in comparison with the cultivar of winter garlic (Allium sativum L.) Sofiivskyi were investigated. It was found that Elephant garlic variety samples are more responsive to changing conditions of cultivation than those of Allium sativum L. The winter resistance of the elephant garlic variety samples was within the limits of 98.0-100%. Elephant garlic plants do not form aerial bulbs, but on the bottom and under the covering scales the bulb is formed from 3-5 to 10 pcs of bulbs that is they reproduce by the baby bulbils propagation. The variety samples No. 2 and No. 3 have 7.1 and 5.1 relatively of large cloves in their structure. The weight of the bulb without removing the inflorescence shoot of the cultivar Sofiivskyi was smaller than the variety samples No. 2 and No. 3 relatively by 28.4-53.3 g. With the removal of the inflorescence shoot the difference increased by 60.5-68.6 g. The yield of Elephant garlic without removing the inflorescence shoot No. 2 was lower than the standard by 1.7 t ha(-1) while the variety sample No. 3 exceeded the standard by 1.1 t/ha. With removing the inflorescence shoot the yields of variety samples No. 2 and No. 3 exceeded the cultivar Sofiivskyi by 1.6 and 2.2 t ha(-1). As a result of researches it was established that introduced forms of Elephant garlic have high indicators of economic and valuable characteristics but they are limited in the first years of cultivation, during the period of adaptation to new soil and climatic conditions which creates some difficulties of their cultivation and reproduction.

AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) could be used as carbon source for chemical production. Compared with the environmental assessment, the economic assessment is related with several open questions. Particularly, it still remains unclear when and under which conditions the CO2-based production might become profitable.
   Besides production costs, the cost drivers and options to stimulate the CO2-based production of methane, methanol and polyoxymethylene (POM) in Germany are analyzed. In order to consider the CO2-based production in a realistic way, various options of operation and give an outlook for a potentially cost-effective development in the next decades are analyzed. The approach is based on life cycle costing. Raw biogas, waste gases of a cement plant, and flue gases of a waste incineration plant are considered as CO2-sources. The energy needed to convert CO2 into hydrocarbons via electrolysis is assumed to be supplied by wind power from negative residual load, a dedicated wind park, or by power from the grid based on a low-price deal at the electricity exchange. Economic data originates from both industrial processes and process simulations.
   The results indicate that CO2-based production technologies are not competitive with conventional production methods under present conditions. This is mainly due to high electricity generation costs, high investment costs for electrolysis, and regulative factors like the German Renewable Energy Act (EEG) in case of energy supply from grid. A CO2-based polymer would closer to economic competitiveness than CO2-based platform chemicals. While the decrease in production costs of CO2-based chemicals may be limited in the next decades, a modification of relevant regulative factors could potentially promote an earlier commercialization. Relatively low prices for renewable energy supply may lead to commercialization options of CO2-based products until 2030.

AB  - Sphagnum riparium (Angstrom) is a rare constituent of modern peatland plant communities and is also very rarely found as a subfossil in peat archives. We present new data on the occurrence of Sphagnum riparium macrofossils in three Northern Hemisphere peatlands from Yellowknife (NW Canada), Abisko (N Sweden), and the Northern Ural Mountains (NW Russia). Sphagnum riparium macrofossils were present in transitional phases between rich fen and oligotrophic bog. Sphagnum riparium was a dominant species in the three sites and was found in combination with Sphagnum angustifolium, Drepanocladus sp., and vascular plants including Andromeda polifolia, Chamedaphne calyculata and Oxycoccus palustris. Testate amoebae indicate that the species occurred in wet to moderately wet conditions (water-table depth inferred from a testate amoeba transfer function model ranged between 25 and 0 cm under the peatland surface). The wet-indicator taxa Archerella flavum and Hyalosphenia papilio dominated the testate amoeba communities in peat horizons containing Sphagnum riparium. The presence of Sphagnum riparium macrofossils in peat profiles in the Northern Hemisphere can be interpreted as an indication of wet minerotrophic conditions, often corresponding to a rise in water-level and establishment of a wet habitat. Sphagnum riparium is a transient species in these peatlands and is replaced by communities dominated by more acidophilic species such as Sphagnum angustifolium, Sphagnum russowii, and Sphagnum fuscum. Our data show that although Sphagnum riparium is a transient peat-forming species, it is widespread in sub-arctic and boreal environments. The subfossil occurrence of Sphagnum riparium in the Northern Hemisphere may indicate that its range has increased during the Late Holocene. The conservation of Sphagnum riparium in peatlands depends on the existence of relatively short-lived transitional communities which potentially can be artificially created. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Planktic foraminifers can be sensitive indicators of the changing environment including both the Arctic Ocean and Southern Ocean. Due to variability in their ecology, biology, test characteristics, and fossil preservation in marine sediments, they serve as valuable archives in paleoceanography and climate geochemistry over the geologic time scale. Foraminifers are sensitive to, and can therefore provide proxy data on ambient water temperature, salinity, carbonate chemistry, and trophic conditions through shifts in assemblage (species) composition and the shell chemistry of individual specimens. Production and dissolution of the calcareous shell, as well as growth and remineralization of the cytoplasm, affect the carbonate counter pump and to a lesser extent the soft-tissue pump, at varying regional and temporal scales. Diversity of planktic foraminifers in polar waters is low in comparison to lower latitudes and is limited to three native species: Neogloboquadrina pachyderma, Turborotalita quinqueloba, and Globigerina bulloides, of which N. pachyderma is best adapted to polar conditions in the surface ocean. Neogloboquathina pachyderma hibernates in brine channels in the lower layers of the Antarctic sea ice, a strategy that is presently undescribed in the Arctic. In open Antarctic and Arctic surface waters T. quinqueloba and G. bulloides increase in abundance at lower polar to subpolar latitudes and Globigerinita uvula, Turborotalita humilis, Globigerinita glutinata, Globorotalia inflata, and Globorotalia crassaforinis complement the assemblages. Over the past two to three decades there has been a marked increase in the abundance of Orcadia riedeli and G. uvula in the subpolar and polar Indian Ocean, as well as in the northern North Atlantic. This paper presents a review of the knowledge of polar and subpolar planktic foraminifers. Particular emphasis is placed on the response of foraminifers to modern warming and ocean acidification at high latitudes and the implications for data interpretation in paleoceanography and paleoclimate research.

AB  - Contaminated produce causes approximately 1 million cases of foodborne illness and 1 billion dollars in damages to the U.S. economy annually. The environmental conditions, especially weather, that influence the inoculation, proliferation, and dispersal of microbial load on produce are not well understood. Using a mixed models approach, we examined the relationship of temperature and precipitation to microbial indicators of contamination on fresh produce on the farm over a week-long period prior to harvest. Between 2000 and 2002, we assayed for four microbial indicators of contamination (aerobic plate count, Enterococcus, total coliforms, and Escherichia coli) on 10 produce types in 15 fields in the southern United States. The sample collection times varied, with most occurring between January and May. We collected hourly weather data for the corresponding time period and location. Our results indicated that there was a significant association between the average daily temperature (20 degrees C) and both log aerobic plate count (e.g., an increase of 0.074 log CFU/g [standard error {SE}, 0.023] per degrees C increase in weekly average temperature) and log Enterococcus (e.g., an increase of 0.15 log CFU/g [SE, 0.031] per degrees C increase in weekly average temperature) for approximately 5 days prior to sample collection. Daily total precipitation was significantly associated with log coliforms on 2 days (similar to 0.11 log CFU/g [SE, 0.06] per mm of precipitation) during the week-long lag period prior to harvest. Our results suggest that microbial indicator concentrations may increase as the temperature increases. Precipitation may have a positive but complex relationship with microbial indicators, as precipitation may create moist conditions conducive to bacterial growth, spread contamination onto the field, or wash contamination off of the plant.

AB  - The increasing uptake of anthropogenic CO2 by the oceans has raised an interest in precise and accurate pH measurement in order to assess the impact on the marine CO2-system. Spectrophotometric pH measurements were refined during the last decade yielding a precision and accuracy that cannot be achieved with the conventional potentiometric method. However, until now the method was only tested in oceanic systems with a relative stable and high salinity and a small pH range. This paper describes the first application of such a pH measurement system at conditions in the Baltic Sea which is characterized by a wide salinity and pH range. The performance of the spectrophotometric system at pH values as low as 7.0 ("total" scale) and salinities between 0 and 35 was examined using TRIS-buffer solutions, certified reference materials, and tests of consistency with measurements of other parameters of the marine CO2 system. Using m-cresol purple as indicator dye and a spectrophotometric measurement system designed at Scripps Institution of Oceanography (B. Carter, A. Dickson), a precision better than +/- 0.001 and an accuracy between +/- 0.01 and +/- 0.02 was achieved within the observed and salinity ranges in the Baltic Sea. The influence of the indicator dye on the pH of the sample was determined theoretically and is presented as a pH correction term for the different alkalinity regimes in the Baltic Sea. Because of the encouraging tests, the ease of operation and the fact that the measurements refer to the internationally accepted "total" pH scale, it is recommended to use the spectrophotometric method also for pH monitoring and trend detection in the Baltic Sea.

AB  - This paper describes the geological-depositional and environmental characteristics of diatomite. The diatomite deposit is situated in the southern part of the Alayunt (Kutahya) Basin. Samples of 18 diatomites and 12 host rocks were collected from four sedimentary profiles in the spring season. Basement rocks are Paleozoic-aged metamorphic rocks (schist, phyllite, quartzite, etc.) and Mesozoic-aged ophiolitic and complex rocks. Host rocks are rhyodacitic-rhyolitic tuffite, volcanic glass. Diatomite is composed of Upper Miocene-Upper Pliocene-aged diatom species. Diatomite shows layer morphology and lies on volcanic glass layer. XRD characteristic peaks of diatomite show that it comprises dominantly of Opal-A silica, whereas volcanic glass has Opal-CT constituent. SEM and NPM photomicrographs indicate that diatomites are dominantly composed of benthic freshwater diatom species, such as Pinnularia microstauron, Pinnularia lundii, Pinnularia subrostrata, Pinnularia brevicostata, Pinnularia tenuis, Pinnularia sp., Navicula eligensis, Fragilaria construens, Mastogloia braunii Grunow, Melosira varians Agardh, Surirella capronii Br,bisson, Cymbella lanceoloata, Amphora venata, Gomphonema germainii, Gomphonema angustatum and Rhapalodia gibba. These species are general indicators of shallow paleolake environment and cool climate conditions. Due to the fluvial currents and climatic conditions; lake water levels, temperature and nutrient content fluctuated through the time. Chemical data obtained from 18 diatomite samples show that while silica is the bodybuilding material for diatomite (over 89 % SiO2), Al, Mg and Fe contents of diatomite samples might be derived from clastic materials. The concentration of Al, Mg and Fe decreases toward the lake center. Diatom genera, sedimentary profile sections and mineralogic data suggest that diatomite deposited in lacustrine-type freshwater shallow lake is associated with Upper Miocene-aged extension tectonics. Physical and filtration tests along with environmental characteristics of diatomite suggest that calcined diatomite can be used for waste treatment processes in the filter aid industry.

AB  - The discovery of a plant-fossil assemblage, situated similar to 70 m below the vertebrate-defined Permian-Triassic boundary, allows for the characterization of part of the Late Permian landscape in the southern Karoo Basin. The megafloral and microfloral assemblages are preserved in association with an O-horizon above a weakly developed palaeosol, exposed in both New and Old Wapadsberg Pass, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Stable-isotope geochemical evidence indicates that pedogenesis occurred under conditions of a high regional water table, and the palaeosol was entombed by overbank or avulsion deposits in an aggradational landscape that includes tuffite. The low-diversity macroflora contains gymnospermous (Glossopteris) and sphenopsid (Phyllotheca, Trizygia) elements that include vegetative (axial, leaf) and reproductive (strobilar) remains. Glossopteris leaves are microphyllous and may reflect the taxon's physiological response to purported climate perturbation or wetland edaphic conditions, and exhibit a range of plant-animal interactions. Palynological residues contain sphenophyllalean cuticles, and the microfloral assemblage is consistent with a low-diversity glossoperid-dominated woodland with a sphenopsid understory. Extrabasinal elements include representatives of peltasperms (Alisporites), corystosperms (Falcisporites), and conifers (Lueckisporites). Pollen conforming to Lunatisporites pellucidus is present in the assemblage and is considered an indicator taxon for the latest Permian to Early Triassic. When compared to palynological assemblage zones in Australia, the Wapadsberg Pass flora is assigned a Late Changhsingian age and, therefore, represents the youngest autochthonous, Glossopteris-dominated flora to be reported from Gondwana. These results extend a palynostratigraphic framework across the Southern Hemisphere that complements other zonations presently applied to the Karoo Basin succession. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We tested whether a trade-off exists between tolerance to flooding and tolerance to drought in wetland plants by assessing biomass accumulation, relative growth rate (RGR), survival rate, and physiological response of three wetland plants growing in drought or flooded environments. In wetlands of China's Sanjiang Plain, Carex lasiocarpa typically occurs at low elevations (10-50 cm water depths), Carex limosa at medial elevation (10-30 cm depths), and Deyeuxia angustifolia at high elevation (0-10 cm depths). Plants of three species were subjected to flooding and drought treatments (25 days) in a greenhouse experiment. In the flooding treatments, biomass accumulation (range 0.007-0.031 g per plant) and survival rate (11%) were lowest in D. angustifolia. Relative growth rate (RGR) was highest in C lasiocarpa (-0.006 d(-1)), intermediate in C. limosa (-0.051 d(-1)), and lowest in D. angustifolia (-0.118 d(-1)) at the end of the flooding experiment. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity in C. lasiocarpa and C. limosa increased with flooding time, whereas ADH in D. angustifolia did not vary over the experimental period. These results indicated that tolerance to flooding from highest to lowest among the three species was: C. lasiocarpa > C. limosa > D. angustifolia. In the drought experiment, RGR was lower in C. lasiocarpa, but higher in C. limosa and D. angustifolia. At this experiment's end, only D. angustifolia plants still survived. Under drought conditions, production of malondialdehyde (MDA, an indicator for assessing, a plant's ability to tolerate drought) showed the same pattern as ADH production under flooded conditions for all species. These results indicated that tolerance to drought from highest to lowest among the three species was: D. angustifolia > C. limosa > C. lasiocarpa. Our experiments indicate that a trade-off exists between tolerance to flooding and tolerance to drought in the three marsh plants.

AB  - Understanding pasture degradation processes is key for sustainable development in the Amazon region. Pasture degradation can be indexed by pasture nutritional status, which is impacted by environmental and human related factors. Most studies of the biogeochernistry of Amazonian pastures have been restricted to highly acidic soils with little focus on how management affects pasture biogeochemistry. We investigated soil physical and chemical properties and grass nutrients under different edaphic conditions and management practices in Rond (o) over cap nia state, in the southwestern Amazon region. Our objectives were to analyze the impacts of soil order, pasture age, and pasture management on soil fertility, bulk density and plant nutrients, in order to understand sustainability needs for the future of this region. We sampled 17 study sites on Oxisols, Ultisols, and Alfisols. The pasture age classes we used consisted of 6-10, 11-15, and > 16 years including forest as the control. We also evaluated the impact of beef and dairy management strategies on pastures installed on Ultisols. Pastures on Alfisols showed the highest soil P, Ca, and base saturation, properties that decreased gradually after 5 years of pasture installation. In contrast, pastures on Oxisols showed low and stable levels of nutrients regardless of age. Foliar nutrient concentrations appear to be influenced by edaphic conditions. Soil P and foliar P concentration were highly correlated. In general, pasture age was a poor indicator of soil fertility and foliar chemistry because of high variability among pastures belonging to the same soil order. In terms of the impacts of pasture management, we did not observe significant differences in soil or foliar properties in pasture used for beef and dairy on Ultisols. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Grapevines (Vitis vinifera L.) are often cultivated under suboptimum conditions for both water and nutrients in order to enhance the quality of grapes for making wine. Since water supply and nitrogen nutrition are major determinants of photosynthetic activity, this study investigated the potential of leaf delta C-13 and delta N-15 to explain spatial variations in biomass production as a function of water use efficiency and fertilizer N uptake, respectively. The combined isotopic signal of the leaves, together with pruning weight, leaf nutrients, and soil properties, were measured in randomly selected field positions over two growing seasons in two fertilized, but different, Merlot vineyards. Significant correlations of surface soil properties and leaf nutrients with pruning weight were not great enough to explain spatial patterns in biomass production. In contrast, leaf delta C-13 and delta N-15, when used as independent variables in multiple regression, explained 71 % of the spatial variation of pruning weight across both fields and growing seasons. Most of the explained model variability was attributed to leaf delta N-15 (r(2) = 0.54), but within single years leaf delta C-13 was better correlated to biomass. The negative correlation between these two isotopes and pruning weight was high only within the vineyard that had steep topographic features and spatially variable growth patterns. It indicated a response of vines to adverse soil conditions by a progressive reduction of water use efficiency and an increase in fertilizer N uptake downslope from the low- to the high-biomass areas of this field. If these relationships persist in other fertilized and water-stressed fields, the isotopic signature of the leaves may be an important tool for application of site-specific management practices within single vineyards.

AB  - Finfish farming is the most common aquaculture mode in Europe. In Norway, the industry faces sustainability challenges. One major challenge is fish escape, which is a threat to both the environment and the industry's reputation. The more complex the operation, the greater the risk of escape, and their safety management needs improvement. A recommended strategy is to implement a safety indicator programme to monitor the risk levels before, during, and after an operation. The main objective of this study is to identify risk influencing factors (RIFs) and develop safety indicators for fish farm operations based on accident reports, using a qualitative graphical network to visualise and systematise causal chains. We have used a six-step methodology to develop safety indicators that can be applied to the case of fish escape: 1) The study was limited to fish escape accidents caused by the hazardous events hole in the net and submerged net. 2) Operations of high risk were identified, and chains of events were established, starting with these operations and ending with the accident (fish escape), based on fish escape report data and accident analyses. 3) A qualitative Bayesian network (BN) was drawn to specify the influence between the contributing causes and conditions in the causal chains. 4) RIFs were identified based on the BN (seven environmental, four organisational, eight operational, and 12 technical). 5) Safety indicators were developed to measure the condition of the RIFs. Update frequency of indicators, methods of measurement, and recommended states were also suggested. 6) The safety indicators were evaluated according to the chosen quality criteria. Based on the resulting list of safety indicators, we suggest a safety indicator programme for the operation fish crowding. The causal chains, RIFs, and safety indicators can also be used as a supplement in internal audits and quality improvement work, development of preventive measures, and training of fish farm personnel.

AB  - The relevance of the research. The rich resource base, the large transport and strategic importance of the Arctic Basin and, in particular, the seas of East Arctic, determine the relevance and necessity of researching the hydrometeorological regime variability of the region.
   The main aim of the work is the analysis of variability of regional indicators of the hydrometeorological regime (wind regime, ice conditions and the nature of water mixing) in the East Siberian and Chukchi Seas over the last several decades (from 1979 to 2015).
   Object of the research is the complex of the most significant indicators determining the nature of the hydrometeorological conditions of the region.
   Methods. Methods of multivariate statistics and modeling were used to analyze the hydrometeorological regime variability of the region.
   Results. On the basis of all available hydrometeorological information the analysis of the variability of regional indicators of the hydrometeorological regime is carried out. The conducted researches indicate the directional changes in the indicators of the hydrometeorological regime of the seas of East Arctic:
   the nature and intensity of atmospheric circulation over the region (a change of the nature and intensity of the wind regime is noted);
   in the ice cover of the seas (there is an active decrease of the ice cover);
   in the nature and intensity of wave activity (at the expense of the first two indicators, intensification of the wave activity expressed in a significant increase in the area and depth of wave mixing is observed).
   In the future, the obtained estimates can be used to implement a number of probabilistic-statistical models of the hydrometeorological state variability, as well as in solving a number of practical problems, the economic development of areas of the seas of East Arctic.

AB  - In the absence of long-term monitoring records, paleoecology can be used to extend knowledge of species and community ecology into the past. The rare and declining aquatic plant Najas flexilis is a priority species for conservation across Europe, and is an ideal candidate for paleoecological study; not only are historical records of the plant sparse, but its seeds are commonly found and well preserved in lake sediment cores. In this study, we investigate the timing and causes of decline at two UK sites at which N. flexilis has recently become extinct: Esthwaite Water (England) and Loch of Craiglush (Scotland). For both sites, multiple paleoecological indicators and available historical biological records and monitoring data are compared to numbers of N. flexilis seeds enumerated in dated sediment cores representing the last 150 years. At Esthwaite Water, N. flexilis seeds were found in abundance in association with indicators of a clear, oligo-mesotrophic, mildly alkaline lake. Eutrophication led to the disappearance of N. flexilis in the 1980s. By contrast, far fewer N. flexilis seeds were found in a core from Loch of Craiglush, and the current period of N. flexilis absence was found to be one of several over the last 100 years. Species represented in cores taken from Loch of Craiglush were indicative of slightly more acidic conditions than Esthwaite Water. Given that N. flexilis favours circumneutral to alkaline conditions, it is possible that Loch of Craiglush has not always been favourable for the plant. These findings have important implications for future conservation efforts, particularly at Esthwaite Water where they suggest that recent failed attempts to reintroduce the species may have been premature. More generally, this study demonstrates the value of paleoecological techniques as a means to provide the long-term context that is often missing from conservation planning and management.

AB  - The rise of affordable housing in Malaysia has inspired a study on the indoor environmental quality (IEQ) of affordable housing. This is because there are several studies that have proven that IEQ influences the health and wellbeing of the residents. The study was conducted in four different apartment developments in Klang Valley, Malaysia, by using a questionnaire survey. The Human Development Index (HDI) is developed based on the data collected from the study, using the formula provided by the Ministry of Youth and Sports Malaysia in their annual Malaysia Youth Index report (IBM). The HDI has indicated that the health and well-being of the occupants in Malaysian affordable housing developments are at the neutral category, scoring 72.16 over 100. Physical condition stands at an index score of 74.29 whilst no fatigue is at poor level with a score of 56.82, whereas for psychological condition, all the indicators are in the neutral category except for No annoyance item, which is in the good category. The index was developed for IEQ factors in affordable housing with data collected from the questionnaire survey. The index developed has shown that factors of IEQ are in both the Extremely disappointed range and the Extremely important range. The acoustic comfort factor gained the lowest score for level of satisfaction whilst indoor air quality gained the highest score for level of importance of IEQ. Noise level scored the lowest in the level of satisfaction and state of health scored the highest score for level of importance. This study aims to provide an overview on the health and wellbeing of occupants in Malaysian affordable housing and to assist the improvement of affordable housing for future development in order to improve the quality of life of residents in affordable housing developments.

AB  - Munition constituents (MC) are present in aquatic environments throughout the world. Potential for fluctuating release with low residence times may cause concentrations of MC to vary widely over time at contaminated sites. Recently, polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) have been demonstrated to be valuable tools for the environmental exposure assessment of MC in water. Flow rate is known to influence sampling by POCIS. Because POCIS sampling rates (R-s) for MC have only been determined under quasi-static conditions, the present study evaluated the uptake of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine), and 2,4- and 2,6-dinitrotoluenes (DNT), by POCIS in a controlled water flume at 7, 15, and 30 cm/s in 10-day experiments using samplers both within and without a protective cage. Sampling rate increased with flow rate for all MC investigated, but flow rate had the strongest impact on TNT and the weakest impact on RDX. For uncaged POCIS, mean Rs for 30 cm/s was significantly higher than that for 7 cm by 2.7, 1.9, 1.9, and 1.3 folds for TNT, 2,4-DNT, 2,6-DNT, and RDX, respectively. For all MC except RDX, mean Rs for caged POCIS at 7 cm/s were significantly lower than for uncaged samplers and similar to those measured at quasi-static condition, but except for 2,6-DNT, no caging effect was measured at the highest flow rate, indicating that the impact of caging on Rs is flow rate-dependent. When flow rates are known, flow rate-specific Rs should be used for generating POCIS-derived time-averaged concentrations of MC at contaminated sites.

AB  - Background/Aims: Diabetic nephropathy is a common complication of diabetes. This study explored the renal protective effect and possible mechanism of gliquidone in mice with diabetic nephropathy. Methods: Animal model of diabetic nephropathy was established in KKAy mice. The renal protective effect of gliquidone was studied by evaluating the kidney function through measures of urinary protein, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Scr) and serum triglyceride (TG) that were performed using an automatic biochemical analyzer. The levels of oxidative stress indicators, such as nitric oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA), were evaluated in renal tissue homogenates using the automatic biochemical analyzer. The inhibitory effect of gliquidone on renal interstitial fibrosis and its association with Notch / Snail1 signaling pathway in diabetic nephropathy was investigated using molecular biological techniques. Results: It was found that low-, medium- and high-dose gliquidone improved the mice's general health condition, such as mental status, fur condition, eating, and drinking. Gliquidone reduced the body weight and the kidney weight / body weight ratio of mice. Gliquidone improved the kidney function, indicated by reductions in urinary protein, blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine and triglyceride. Gliquidone treatment increased levels of nitric oxide and superoxide dismutase, but decreased level of malondialdehyde. The expression of Jagged1/Notch1/hes1/Snail1/alpha-SMA decreased, while the expression of E-cadherin increased in gliquidone-treated kidneys. High dose gliquidone showed the best effect, one that was similar to that of the positive control drug irbesartan. Conclusion: Taken together, our results suggested that gliquidone can ameliorate the diabetic symptoms of diabetic nephropathy through inhibiting Notch / Snail1 signaling pathway, improving anti -oxidative response and delaying renal interstitial fibrosis. The efficacy of gliquidone is dose-dependent. (C) 2018 The Author(s) Published by S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Burials were examined from the late Viking Age early medieval Christian cemetery at the farm of Keldudalur in the Skagafjorour region, Northern Iceland. The cemetery likely served a single household for about 100-120years, from the beginning of the 11th century AD to the turn of the 12th century. Cemetery inhabitants represent a population that lived through the transitional period when Christianity was established in Iceland. The changes are visible in the mortuary record with the changeover from outlying pagan graves to enclosed Christian cemeteries situated on the farmsteads. Keldudalur is one of the numerous early Christian family cemeteries that littered the 11th century Skagafjorour landscape. The burials included 53 well-preserved skeletons of 27 adults and 26 subadults. Various factors such as fluctuating climate and environmental conditions, and seasonal or periodical availability of resources have the potential for impacting human diet and health over time. To assess the health status of the burials, data were collected for a number of health status indicators such as stature estimation, developmental enamel defects, porotic hyperostosis, infectious disease, trauma, degenerative joint diseases, dental caries, calculus and tooth loss. Results suggest that inhabitants of Keldudalur experienced periodic stress and rigorous living conditions. Infant mortality was great, although if individuals survived childhood, the age expectancy was fairly high. There was no obvious evidence for interpersonal violence or endemic infectious disease. However, the common occurrence of growth disturbances, generalised periostitis, trauma and degenerative joint disease all point to a number of stressors in the lives of the people at Keldudalur, which is suggestive of a resilient people living and adapting to a harsh and periodically resource scarce subarctic environment.

AB  - Background: Risk assessment for GMOs such as Bt maize requires detailed data concerning pollen deposition onto non-target host-plant leaves. A field study of pollen on lepidopteran host-plant leaves was therefore undertaken in 2009-2012 in Germany. During the maize flowering period, we used in situ microscopy at a spatial resolution adequate to monitor the feeding behaviour of butterfly larvae. The plant-specific pollen deposition data were supplemented with standardised measurements of pollen release rates and deposition obtained by volumetric pollen monitors and passive samplers.
   Results: In 2010, we made 5377 measurements of maize pollen deposited onto leaves of maize, nettle, goosefoot, sorrel and blackberry. Overall mean leaf deposition during the flowering period ranged from 54 to 478 n/cm(2) (grains/cm(2)) depending on plant species and site, while daily mean leaf deposition values were as high as 2710 n/cm(2). Maximum single leaf-deposition values reached up to 103,000 n/cm(2), with a 95 % confidence-limit upper boundary of 11,716 n/cm(2).
   Conclusions: Daily means and variation of single values uncovered by our detailed measurements are considerably higher than previously assumed. The recorded levels are more than a single degree of magnitude larger than actual EU expert risk assessment assumptions. Because variation and total aggregation of deposited pollen on leaves have been previously underestimated, lepidopteran larvae have actually been subjected to higher and more variable exposure. Higher risks to these organisms must consequently be assumed. Our results imply that risk assessments related to the effects of Bt maize exposure under both realistic cultivation conditions and worst-case scenarios must be revised. Under common cultivation conditions, isolation buffer distances in the kilometre range are recommended rather than the 20-30 m distance defined by the EFSA.

KW  - Conceptual definition
KW  - Operational definition
AB  - The environmental significance of soil bound pesticide residues (SBPR) is potentially large because approximately one third of the applied mass of the pesticides in agriculture ends up as SBPR. At EU level, there is little regulatory guidance available on the environmental risk assessment of SBPR in spite of some 50 years of SBPR research. This lack of guidance is partially caused by the fact that the current definitions of SBPR are founded on non-extractability in soil in the laboratory whereas for the environmental risk assessment not the soil in the laboratory but the soil in the field is the system of interest. Therefore a definition of SBPR is proposed that is based on the field soil: a molecule (further called `the mother molecule') is soil bound if a relevant part of this molecule has become part of the solid phase in the soil and if this relevant part will never be released again to the liquid phase in soil under relevant field conditions in the form of this mother molecule or in the form of another molecule that may possibly raise environmental or human toxicological concerns. This mother molecule may be the parent substance that is applied to the soil but it may also be a metabolite of this parent substance. A consequence of the definition is that the SBPR terminology becomes more precise because the mother molecule of the soil bound residue has to be specified. A further consequence is that very strong but reversible sorption of molecules such as paraquat is not considered soil-bound residue anymore (as may be demonstrated by a self-exchange extraction procedure). Furthermore, the definition requires that risk managers have to define what they consider as `relevant field conditions' (e.g. include also changes of agricultural fields into forests?).

AB  - The records of benthic foraminifera and lithology of a 35.60-m-long core in the East China Sea Off the Changjiang (Yangtze River) estuary were used to decipher the paleoenvironmental changes over the last 13,000 years. The result suggests three stages of environmental evolution: a littoral environment dominated by tide influence in the period of Younger Dryas (YD) (about 13,000-11,500 cal yr BP), a nearshore to shallow-sea environment in the early-mid Holocene (11,500-4600 cal yr BP), and a shallow-sea environment with significant hypoxia since the last 4600 years. The alternation of the low-oxygen foraminiferal assemblages (LOFA) and oxic foraminiferal assemblages (OFA) suggests a weakening hypoxia condition during 4600-2000 cal yr BP, which may be linked to factors such as the weakening of Taiwan Warm Current (TWC), a stronger East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM), a moderate water depth with stable sea-level and sufficient supply of terrigenous organic materials. Together with the above mentioned factors, human activities might explain the low-oxygen conditions over the past 400 years. However, the hypoxic process was discontinued during the period of 0.6-0.4 cal ka BP, possibly due to the cold climate during Little Ice Age (LIA), which weakened EASM and reduced Total Solar Irradiance (TSI). This study confirms that the species of Epistominella naraensis, Bolivina spp., Bulimina marginate and Ammonia convexidorsa could be used as indicators for hypoxia while the Quinqueloculina spp. as a sensitive indicator of bottom oxygen levels at the core site.

AB  - We investigated a 3.75-m-long lacustrine sediment record from Lake A"ntu Sinijarv, northern Estonia, which has a modeled basal age > 12,800 cal yr BP. Our multi-proxy approach focused on the stable oxygen isotope composition (delta O-18) of freshwater tufa. Our new palaeoclimate information for the Eastern Baltic region, based on high-resolution delta O-18 data (219 samples), is supported by pollen and plant macrofossil data. Radiocarbon dates were used to develop a core chronology and estimate sedimentation rates. Freshwater tufa precipitation started ca. 10,700 cal yr BP, ca. 2,000 years later than suggested by previous studies on the same lake. Younger Dryas cooling is documented clearly in Lake A"ntu Sinijarv sediments by abrupt appearance of diagnostic pollen (Betula nana, Dryas octopetala), highest mineral matter content in sediments (up to 90 %) and low values of delta O-18 (less than -12 aEuro degrees). Globally recognized 9.3- and 8.2-ka cold events are weakly defined by negative shifts in delta O-18 values, to -11.3 and -11.7 aEuro degrees, respectively, and low concentrations of herb pollen and charcoal particles. The Holocene thermal maximum (HTM) is palaeobotanically well documented by the first appearance and establishment of nemoral thermophilous taxa and presence of water lilies requiring warm conditions. Isotope values show an increasing trend during the HTM, from -11.5 to -10.5 aEuro degrees. Relatively stable environmental conditions, represented by only a small-scale increase in delta O-18 (up to 1 aEuro degrees) and high pollen concentrations between 5,000 and 3,000 cal yr BP, were followed by a decrease in delta O-18, reaching the most negative value (-12.7 aEuro degrees) recorded in the freshwater tufa ca. 900 cal yr BP.

AB  - In order to define criteria for long-term climate change models in Southern Africa, an overview of the available pollen data during the Late Quaternary is needed. Here we reassess the paleo-climatic conditions in southern Africa by synthesising available fossil pollen data that can provide new insights in environmental change processes. The data considered here include the latest as well as previously published information that has been difficult to assess. Available calibrated pollen sequences spanning the Late Pleistocene and Holocene were subjected to Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to monitor taxa sensitive to moisture and temperature fluctuations. The PCA values are presented graphically as indicators of climate variability for the region. The results cover different biomes that include the summer-rain region in the north and east, the winter-rain area in the south and the dry zone in the west. The PCA plots directly reflect major changes of terrestrial environments due to variations in temperature and moisture. Mostly sub-humid but fluctuating conditions are indicated during the cold Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 2, which were followed by a dry phase soon after the beginning of the Holocene but before the middle Holocene in the northern, central and eastern parts of the sub-continent. Marked but non-parallel moisture changes occurred in different subregions during the Holocene suggesting that climatic forcing was not uniform over the entire region. Some events seemed to have had a more uniform effect over the sub-continent, e.g., a relatively dry summer rain event at c. two thousand years ago, which can possibly be related to the ENSO phenomenon. The role of anthropogenic activities in some of the most recent vegetation shifts is likely. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Global Assessment of Soil Degradation (GLASOD) has been the most influential global appraisal of land quality in terms of environmental policy. However, its expert judgments were never tested for their consistency and could not be reproduced at unvisited sites, while the relationship between the GLASOD assessments of land degradation and the social and economic impact of that degradation remains unclear. Yet, other methodologies that Could respond to urgent calls for an updated assessment of the global environmental quality are not operational or, at best, in progress. Therefore, we evaluate the reliability and social relevance of the GLASOD approach and assess its candidacy for new global environmental assessments. The Study concentrates on the African continent, capitalizing on new GIS data to delineate and define the characteristics of GLASOD map units. Consistency is tested by comparing expert judgments on soil degradation hazard for similar combinations of biophysical conditions and land use. Reproducibility is evaluated by estimating an ordered logit model that relates the qualitative land degradation classes to easily available information on explanatory variables, the results of which can be used to assess the land degradation at unvisited sites. Finally, a cross-sectional analysis investigates the relation between GLASOD assessments and crop production data at sub-national scale and its association with the prevalence of malnutrition. The GLASOD assessments prove to be only moderately consistent and hardly reproducible, while the counter-intuitive trend with crop production reveals the complexity of the production-degradation relationship. It appears that increasing prevalence of malnutrition coincides with poor agro-productive conditions and highly degraded land. The GLASOD approach can be improved by resolving the differences in conceptualization among experts and by defining the boundaries of the ordered classes in the same units as independent, quantitative land degradation data.

We compared 3 methods to assess potential or actual nutrient limitation. Ambient nutrient ratios were calculated, and nutrient enrichment bioassays were conducted, along with P-33 turnover times. Comparison of nutrient ratios and bioassays demonstrated that the ambient inorganic nutrient ratios, based on the Red-field Si:N:P ratio of 16:16:1, were a rapid and effective method that could be used to predict the potentially limiting nutrient of phytoplankton biomass, except in eastern waters in summer, since the DIN:PO4 uptake ratio was occasionally below the Redfield ratio. The agreement between nutrient limitation indices of growth rate and biomass yield suggested that phytoplankton biomass and growth rate were P-limited in southern waters, with more stable conditions during summer. In contrast, a lack of agreement between these indicators showed that phytoplankton growth in potentially P-limited cases in western waters and Victoria Harbour was controlled by physical processes (e.g. strong hydrodynamic mixing and dilution). The limiting factor for phytoplankton growth varied spatially and temporally. In summer, there was a change from physical processes (e.g. the rapid dilution and possible light limitation due to strong turbulent mixing) in hydrodynamically active western waters and Victoria Harbour to P limitation, or N + P co-limitation, in southern and eastern waters with more stable conditions. In winter, phytoplankton growth was regulated by strong wind-induced vertical mixing. Hence, different seasonal sewage treatment strategies should be considered for nutrient removal.

AB  - [1] Convective available potential energy (CAPE), frequently regarded as an indicator of the potential intensity of deep convection, is strongly controlled by the properties of the planetary boundary layer (BL). Variations in CAPE observed during field experiments in midcontinent North America, the tropical east Atlantic, and the tropical west Pacific, can be accounted for mostly by changes in the temperature and humidity in the BL. The coupling between CAPE and the BL holds for both convective and nonconvective conditions. The coupling under conditions of deep convection implies a constraint on the intensity of deep convection which can be used as a closure for cumulus parameterization. This constraint requires equilibrium in the environment of the parcel used as a basis for calculating CAPE. Over many cases, parcel-environment equilibrium is observed to hold more robustly than equilibrium of CAPE itself. When observational uncertainties are considered, it is uncertain whether quasi-equilibrium, in which the rate of change of CAPE is substantially less than the rate at which mean advection and BL fluxes change CAPE, holds at subdiurnal timescales in the eastern Atlantic and the western Pacific. Quasi-equilibrium is a poor approximation at subdiurnal timescales in midcontinent North America. At timescales approaching diurnal, quasi-equilibrium holds in all cases. Cumulus parameterizations based on quasi-equilibrium may be limited in their ability to model diurnal cycles as a result. CAPE fluctuations related to large, subdiurnal variations in surface fluxes are much sharper than CAPE fluctuations related to changes in mean advection above the BL, especially over land. The strong BL control on CAPE indicates that deep convection does not equilibrate rapid, high-amplitude variations in CAPE originating there.

AB  - The interleukin 2 receptor (IL2R) plays a prominent role in the biology of T cells, B cells, and NK cells during activation, Of the three chains described, the alpha-chain of the receptor (Tac; IL2R alpha; CD25) is the most subject to regulation and is shed from the surface of activated cells to generate a soluble form in serum and tissues, Conflicting results have been reported on the native structure of soluble Tac, suggesting variously a monomer, a dimer, or higher noncovalent forms, spawning different models for its mechanism of action, We similarly show a large M(r(app)) by HPLC sieving chromatography, suggesting a tetrameric form, However, stoichiometry-ordered size (SOS) analysis of antibody-antigen complexes indicated only a single epitope per Tac molecule, compatible with a monomeric form, This larger M(r(app)) also conflicted with prior in vivo data showing rapid filtration of soluble Tac through the renal glomerulus that was not expected of a larger complex, Using different solvents, denaturants, and columns in the chromatography suggested that the elevated M(r(app)) values were an artifact of solute column interactions, termed ''ionic exclusion,'' rather than reflecting larger native structures, Analytical ultracentrifugation using a new type of analysis specific to glycoproteins demonstrated monomeric masses under all salt conditions with no tendency to form dimers or higher aggregates, Finally, circular dichroism spectroscopy showed no salt-dependent changes to suggest conformational alterations that might correlate with mobility changes on high pressure liquid chromatography, We conclude therefore that Tac is monomeric under physiologic conditions, Assessments of higher molecular weight for the purified soluble protein by other methods may be explained by the highly acidic nature of the molecule, which hampers matrix penetration with chromatographic media and by the high carbohydrate content and low partial specific volumes that accelerate the molecule in sedimentation media relative to pure protein standards.

KW  - DENGUE
AB  - Background
   Dengue epidemics have occurred in the city of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) since 1986. In the year 2015, Zika and chikungunya viruses were introduced in the city, causing sequential and simultaneous epidemics. Poor socioeconomic conditions have been suggested as contributing factors of arboviral infection.
   Objective
   To describe the spatial distribution of human cases of symptomatic arboviral infections and to identify risk factors for infection in a poor community of Rio de Janeiro in the years 2015 and 2016.
   Methods
   We built thematic maps of incidence rates for 78 micro-areas in the Manguinhos neighborhood. The micro-areas congregate about 600 inhabitants. Simple and multiple multilevel logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between the incidence of arboviral diseases and socio-demographic factors at both the individual and micro-area levels.
   Results
   From 2015 to 2016, 370 human cases of arbovirus infection were reported in the Manguinhos community: 123 in 2015 and 247 in 2016. There was a significant difference in the risk of arbovirus diseases among different micro-areas, but this was not explained by water and sanitation indicators. The cumulative incidence rate was 849/100,000 in two years. The incidence was greater in those individuals with familiar vulnerability (1,156/100,000 vs. 794/100,000). The multilevel adjusted model showed that the odds of acquiring an arbovirus infection was 55% greater in those with familiar vulnerability.
   Conclusion
   Arbovirus infections cause a high burden of disease in Brazilian urban centers. Our results suggest that even in poor neighborhoods, there is a high spatial variability in the risk of acquiring an arbovirus infection. The conditions that favor vector proliferation and infection by arboviruses are complex and involve both individual and environmental characteristics that vary from place to place. To reduce the burden of arboviral diseases, continued public health policies and basic services should be provided to the communities at risk that consider specific local needs.

AB  - Slash-and-burn cultivation (swidden) is an important and extensive strategy among agriculturalists in Oceania. The length of the fallow period, in which non-cultivated vegetation is allowed to regrow, is critical to the sustainability of this strategy in tropical environments. Long fallow periods permit greater soil recovery and higher yields over the long term whereas shorter fallow periods drive cycles of soil degradation that ultimately result in a landscape that is too degraded for continued cultivation. Anthropologists recognize that decreasing swidden fallow times is a key form of agricultural intensification that may have shaped interpolity conflict and social complexity. Although it is easy to identify the degraded landscapes that are a legacy of this pattern today, it has been a challenge for archaeologists to identify the timing and rate at which such processes took place in the past. We use alluvial stratigraphic records of charcoal and stable carbon isotopes from a small drainage in Western Viti Levu, Fiji, to reconstruct the timing and rate of intensification of swidden agriculture from long-fallow clearing of native forest, to shorter fallow burning of secondary forest and grassland, to grassland conversion. Results suggest that swidden cultivation in the lower Sigatoka Valley did not commence until centuries after Lapita colonization (ca. 2950 cal BP). Early swiddening apparently used relatively short fallow periods coupled with residential mobility to sustain horticultural yields until mobility no longer became a viable option. Archaeological indicators of resource stress co-occur with persistent swiddening after 1450 cal BP, although these precede the collapse into degraded grassland conditions at 1000 cal BP. Archaeological evidence for conflict increase after landscape degradation, although emerging social inequalities only appear after centuries of degraded conditions and conflict.

AB  - Clonal growth confers a number of benefits on plants, but involves some costs as well. We examined whether seed reproduction is reduced in clonal plants due to these costs. Further, we investigated whether this relationship differs for species with optima at stressful or low-productivity sites, as a possible indication that clonality acts as insurance against reduced seed reproduction in such conditions. We evaluated 472 species for which seed production per unit area had been determined, and employed this information together with data on seed mass, height at maturity, clonal traits and optimum habitat conditions (using Ellenberg indicator values). There was a strong hyperbolic relationship between seed output and seed mass, with a scaling coefficient of -1, indicative of a simple tradeoff relationship. We performed analyses both with and without taking phylogeny into account. Reproductive output (i.e. the product of seed output and seed size) of was lower in clonal than in non-clonal plants (in both with and without phylogeny incorporated in the analyses); within non-clonal species, it was high in annuals and monocarpic plants relative to nonclonal perennials. Reproductive output was lower in clonal plants with extensive lateral spread. This may be due to lower mortality of such plants, which should favor reduced reproductive output, but direct resource tradeoff may also be involved. Reproductive output in all clonal and non-clonal plants increased with the nutrient status and light level of the species' optimum, and decreased with moisture. Because the proportion of clonal plants in vegetation is known to decrease along the same gradients, we can infer that as sexual reproduction becomes increasingly difficult in terms of these characteristics, clonal plants may capitalize on their capacity to bypass it. However, the relationships with habitat parameters disappeared in the phylogenetically corrected analysis, indicating that habitat preferences and reproductive output evolved together.

AB  - A default uncertainty factor of 3.16 (10) is applied to account for interindividual variability in toxicokinetics when performing non-cancer risk assessments. Using relevant human data for specific chemicals, as WHO/IPCS suggests, it is possible to evaluate, and replace when appropriate, this default factor by quantifying chemical-specific adjustment factors for interindividual variability in toxicokinetics (also referred to as the human kinetic adjustment factor, HKAF). The HKAF has been determined based on the distributions of pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g., half-life, area under the curve, maximum blood concentration) in relevant populations. This article focuses on the current state of knowledge of the use of physiologically based algorithms and models in characterizing the HKAF for environmental contaminants. The recent modeling efforts on the computation of HKAF as a function of the characteristics of the population, chemical and its mode of action (dose metrics), as well as exposure scenario of relevance to the assessment are reviewed here. The results of these studies, taken together, suggest the HKAF varies as a function of the sensitive subpopulation and dose metrics of interest, exposure conditions considered (route, duration, and intensity), metabolic pathways involved and theoretical model underlying its computation. The HKAF seldom exceeded the default value of 3.16, except in very young children (i.e., <approximate to 3months) and when the parent compound is the toxic moiety. Overall, from a public health perspective, the current state of knowledge generally suggest that the default uncertainty factor is sufficient to account for human variability in non-cancer risk assessments of environmental contaminants.

AB  - Although pharmaceuticals have been detected in the environment only in the range from ng/L to mu g/L, it has been demonstrated that they can adversely affect the health status of aquatic organisms. Lysosomal membrane stability (LMS) has previously been applied as an indicator of cellular well-being to determine health status in bivalve mussels. The objective of this study is to evaluate LMS in Ruditapes philippinarum haemolymph using the neutral red retention assay (NRRA). Clams were exposed in laboratory conditions to caffeine (0.1, 5, 15, 50 mu g/L), ibuprofen (0.1, 5, 10, 50 mu g/L), carbamazepine and novobiocin (both at 0.1, 1, 10, 50 mu g/L) for 35 days. Results show a dose-dependent effect of the pharmaceuticals. The neutral red retention time measured at the end of the bioassay was significantly reduced by 50% after exposure to environmental concentrations (p < 0.05) (caffeine = 15 mu g/L; ibuprofen = 10 mu g/L; carbamazepine = 1 mu g/L and novobiocin = 1 mu g/L), compared to controls. Clams exposed to these pharmaceuticals were considered to present a diminished health status (retention time <45 mm), significantly worse than controls (96 min) (p < 0.05). The predicted no environmental effect concentration (PNEC) results showed that these pharmaceuticals are very toxic at the environmental concentrations tested. Measurement of the alteration of LMS has been found to be a sensitive technique that enables evaluation of the health status of clams after exposure to pharmaceuticals under laboratory conditions, thus representing a robust Tier-1 screening biomarker.

AB  - Elevated numbers of enteric pathogens in the receiving waters following a storm event can be a serious public health concern. The purpose of this study was to conduct a preliminary investigation into the presence of human pathogens of concern in urban stormwater runoff. The involvement of a human sewage as a potential source of contamination was also investigated by using microbial source tracking methods. Water samples (20 L) were collected after storm events and during the dry weather from six sites in Brisbane, Australia. Collected samples were analyzed for fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), and then concentrated using hollow fiber ultrafiltration followed by molecular detection of selected enteric pathogens. The levels of FIB were found to frequently exceed the upper limit of Australian guidelines for managing risks in recreational water, during the dry periods and by further several orders of magnitude in the stormwater runoff. Enterococcus spp. numbers as high as 3 x 10(4) 100 mL(-1) were detected in the stormwater runoff at the Fitzgibbon site. Human adenovirus and polyomavirus were frequently detected from all six sampling sites during wet and dry weather conditions suggesting their wide spread presence in the urban aquatic environments. Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli and Salmonella enterica were also detected during both dry and wet weather conditions. Presence of human-specific HF183 Bacteroides marker in most of the samples tested suggests ubiquitous sewage contamination in the urban environment. Since stormwater runoff routinely contains high numbers of FIB and other enteric pathogens, some degree of treatment of captured stormwater would be required if it were to be used for non-potable purposes.

AB  - The objective of this study was to test the applicability of groundwater sustainability indicators defined by UNESCO, together with the International Academy of Environmental Sciences (IAES), the International Association of Hydrogeology (IAH) Group on Groundwater Indicators and the Geological Survey of Spain (IGME), to the aquifer scale. We selected four main indicators based on their relevance in the field of groundwater sustainability and because they proved to be the most reliable, based on the data collection and methodology utilized. These indicators were applied to a small-26 km(2) of permeable outcrops-carbonate aquifer situated in the province of Seville (southern Spain), which has semi-arid climate conditions (500 mm/year). The integral application of all these indicators in this particular groundwater body leads us to conclude that, at present, the aquifer is undergoing intensive use. Therefore, the exploitation of its water resources is surpassing the threshold of sustainability when both the quantity and the quality of the groundwater are taken into consideration. The continued increase in exploitation generates a descending trend in the evolution of the piezometric levels, a consequence of adaptation to the new hydrodynamic situation, and also results in exhaustion of the springs that drain the aquifer in undisturbed conditions. At the same time, there is a trend of increasing salinity in the groundwater and a risk of contamination by nitrate which, according to the EU Water Framework Directive and the Groundwater Daughter Directive (EU Official Journal of the European Communities L327, 2000; EU Official Journal of the European Communities L372/19, 2006), should be controlled and reduced. In the future, application of the methodology described here may prove useful for the evaluation of similar systems, either in southern Spain or in other countries with semi-arid climates.

AB  - Earthworm activity is observed at long-term monitoring sites as, an indicator of soil function to assess changes resulting from environmental and management conditions. In order to assess changes, characteristic values of earthworm populations under different site conditions have to be known. Therefore, a classification scheme for site-specific earthworm populations was developed for soil in agricultural use, taking interactions between earthworm populations and soil properties into account. Characteristics of sites grouped by means of a cluster analysis after principal-component analysis served as a basis for the derivation of the classification scheme. Soil variables found to characterize site differences with respect to earthworm populations were the texture of the topsoil, the texture of the subsoil, and the soil organic-matter (SOM) content. The textural classes of the topsoil were divided into five groups comprising sandy soils (Ss), silty sand soils (Su), slightly loamy sand soils (SI2), medium to strongly loamy sand soils (SI3/SI4), and loam and clay soils. Soil organic matter was divided into grades of equal size in a range from < 1%, 1%-2% up to > 6%. The variables "earthworm abundance" and "earthworm species" were selected to represent earthworm populations and were divided into six groups ranging from very low to extremely high. Defined groups of earthworm populations showed a clear structure in relation to soil textural groups and the content of SOM. From this distribution, a classification scheme was derived as basis for prognostic values of site-specific earthworm populations, thus enabling the interpretation of changes over time. For some soil textural groups, selected variables appeared to enable the derivations of expected earthworm densities and species composition outside the range of the given database, but for some soil textural groups, broader databases will be needed to specify these derivations.

AB  - Aim: Identification of high breeding value donor lines harbouring tolerance to moisture stress from diversity stock of 443 genotypes of Brassica juncea.
   Methodology: Germplasm stock of 443 Indian mustard (Brassica juncea L.) genotypes, comprising introgression lines, land races, old cultivars and advance breeding lines, were evaluated under two environments viz., irrigated and rainfed conditions to check the variability for yield and related traits. Statistical software META-Rver 6.0 (Multi Environment Trial Analysis using R) was used for computation of Best Linear Unbiased Predictions, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Genetic Correlations and Heritability. Drought susceptibility index and per cent seed yield reduction under rainfed conditions were used as indicators to determine moisture stress tolerance in genotypes.
   Results: The variability for moisture stress tolerance has been unravelled in a diverse genetic stock of Brassica juncea under two environments: irrigated and rainfed. For high prediction accuracy, the ranking of genotypes was done based on Best Linear Unbiased Predictions for seed yield and its component traits. PBR-378, RGN-329, RB-73, RB-50 and PBR-422 and Giriraj were identified as moisture stress tolerant genotypes. One land race Sahib 36 and three introgression lines viz., MCP 12-211, PTJ-3-69 and MSC-3 have also been identified as potential genetic resources for moisture stress tolerance. Principal component analysis based on biplots depicted specific distribution of variables for each environment.
   Interpretation: This study led to the identification of potential donors for moisture stress tolerance with high predictive accuracy. Low drought susceptibility index and high breeding value in a land race and three introgression lines derived from Erucastrum cardaminoides, B. tournefortii and B. carinata emphasized their utilization as potential genetic resources to breed for moisture stress tolerance in B. juncea.

AB  - The work is devoted to the anatomical study of five populations of the forest-forming species Picea schrenkiana, which grows in the Trans Ili Alatau range of Northern Tian Shan Mountains, and three species of the desert tree Haloxylon, which grows in three regions of Kazakhstan. As the study was taken young needles of P. schrenkiana and shoots of Haloxylon species. In this study, anatomical analyses of young needles from five populations of P. schrenkiana and shoots from three Haloxylon species were performed to identify and describe anatomical features in search of distinctive features that could be used to determine the characteristics of these species. In the cross-section of P. schrenkiana needles, all five populations have a rectangular shape, and the tissue types and their location are similar in all populations. Study of the young needles of P. schrenkiana revealed the presence of the epidermis, hypodermis, stomata, mesophyll, resin ducts, endodermis and vascular bundles all of the five populations. The area of the vascular bundles varies from 141.4 +/- 1.9 to 182.7 +/- 1.4 mu m(2). Comparatively, all indicators were the same, which means that the origins of all five populations are similar to each other. As a result, the anatomical structure of P. schrenkiana needles corresponds to the structure of coniferous plants. In the study of three species of Haloxylon, more precisely Haloxylon aphyllum, Haloxylon persicum, Haloxylon ammodendron, differences were found in the section of each species. This is possible due to the fact that they grow in three different regions and different environmental conditions. And it proves that the environmental conditions of the place where these species grow affects the anatomy and structure of plants.

AB  - Drought is a function of both natural and human influences, but fully characterizing the interactions between human and natural influences on drought remains challenging. To better characterize parts of the drought feedback loop, this study combines hydrological and societal perspectives to characterize and quantify the potential for drought action. For the hydrological perspective, we examine historical groundwater data, from which we determine the decadal likelihoods of exceeding hydrologic thresholds relevant to different water uses. Stakeholder interviews yield data about how people rate the importance of water for different water uses. We combine these to quantify the Potential Drought Action Indicator (PDAI). The PDAI is demonstrated for a study site in south-central Oklahoma, where water availability is highly influenced by drought and management of water resources is contested by local stakeholders. For the hydrological perspective, we find that the historical decadal likelihood of exceedance for a moderate threshold associated with municipal supply has ranged widely: from 23% to 75%, which corresponds well with natural drought variability in the region. For the societal perspective, stakeholder interviews reveal that people value water differently for various uses. Combining this information into the PDAI illustrates that potential drought action increases as the hydrologic threshold is exceeded more often; this occurs as conditions get drier and when water use thresholds are more moderate. The PDAI also shows that for water uses where stakeholders have diverse views of importance, the PDAI will be diverse as well, and this is exacerbated under drier conditions. The variability in stakeholder views of importance is partially explained by stakeholders' cultural worldviews, pointing to some implications for managing water when drought risks threaten. We discuss how the results can be used to reduce potential disagreement among stakeholders and promote sustainable water management, which is particularly important for planning under increasing drought.

AB  - In this study, we developed the urban ecohydrology model (UEM) to investigate the role of bioretention on watershed water balance, runoff production, and streamflow variability. UEM partitions the land surface into pervious, impervious, and bioretention cell fractions. Soil moisture and vegetation dynamics are simulated in pervious areas and bioretention cells using a lumped ecohydrological approach. Bioretention cells receive runoff from a fraction of impervious areas. The model is calibrated in an urban headwater catchment near Seattle, WA, USA, using hourly weather data and streamflow observations for 3years. The calibrated model is first used to investigate the relationship between streamflow variability and bioretention cell size that receives runoff from different values of impervious area in the watershed. Streamflow variability is quantified by 2 indices, high pulse count (HPC), which quantifies the number of flow high pulses in a water year above a threshold, and high pulse range (HPR), which defines the time over which the pulses occurred. Low values of these indices are associated with improved stream health. The effectiveness of the modelled bioretention facilities are measured by their influence on reducing HPC and HPR and on flow duration curves in comparison with modelled fully forested conditions. We used UEM to examine the effectiveness of bioretention cells under rainfall regimes that are wetter and drier than the study area in an effort to understand linkages between the degree of urbanization, climate, and design bioretention cell size to improve inferred stream health conditions. In all model simulations, limits to the reduction of HPC and HPR indicators were reached as the size of bioretention cells grew. Bioretention was more effective as the rainfall regime gets drier. Results may guide bioretention design practices and future studies to explore climate change impacts on bioretention design and management.

AB  - This paper presents a one dimensional thermal model of a solar evacuated tube open at both ends under transient conditions. Variations of fluid mass flow rate, ambient temperature, solar radiation, and wind speed are accounted for. The semi-analytical model relies on the energy conservation equation for small control volumes along the longitudinal axis of the tube. The first order differential equations obtained for each control volume are solved by use of a fully explicit scheme using a fourth order Runge-Kutta algorithm. An experimental setup has been designed, built and calibrated in order to assess the predictions provided by the model. The comparison between simulated and experimentally measured outlet air temperatures showed a good agreement: a root mean square error on the outlet air temperature of about 0.50 K and a mean bias difference of 0.15 K were observed for experiments conducted on a bright sunny day. The validated model applied for steady state heat transfer is then used to conduct an analysis on different parameters. Finally, the influence of the environmental parameters (solar radiation, ambient temperature and wind speed) and the operating condition (airflow) is investigated on different performance indicators like the outlet air temperature, the efficiency, the mean convective heat transfer coefficient and the pressure drop. It appeared that the influence of wind and ambient temperatures is of minor importance although the influence of solar radiation on the outlet air temperature is significant. Moreover, the airflow is the most important parameter acting on the defined performance indicators. Higher is the airflow, better is the efficiency and lower is the outlet air temperature. On the other hand, a low airflow can conduct to as much as 100 K of temperature gain, but the efficiency is then reduced to value as low as 45%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Detection of potentially hazardous compounds in water bodies is a priority in environmental risk assessment. For the evaluation and monitoring of water quality, a series of methodologies may be applied. Among them, the worldwide used toxicity tests with organisms of the genus Daphnia is one of the most powerful. In recent years, some attempts were made to utilize Daphnia magna in genotoxicity testing as many of the new environmental contaminants are described as DNA-damaging agents in aquatic organisms. The aim of this research was to develop a highly standardized protocol of the Comet Assay adapted for D. magna, especially regarding the isolation of cells derived from the same tissue (haemolymph) from newborn organisms exposed in vivo. Several methods for haemolymph extraction and different Comet Assay parameters were compared. Electrophoretic conditions were adapted in order to obtain minimum DNA migration in cells derived from untreated organisms and, at the same time, maximum sensitivity in specimens treated with known genotoxicants (CdCl2 and H2O2). Additional tests were performed to investigate if life-history traits of the cladoceran (such as the age of adult organisms that provide newborns, the clutch size of origin, the number of generations reared in standard conditions) and the water composition as well, might influence the response of the assay. This study confirms the potential application of the Comet Assay in D. magna for assessing genotoxic loads in aqueous solution. The newly developed protocol could integrate the acute toxicity bioassay, thus expanding the possibility of using this model species in freshwater monitoring (waters, sediment and soil elutriates) and is in line with the spirit of the EU Water Framework Directive in reducing the number of bioassays that involve medium-sized species.

AB  - Ultrafine particles have a significant detrimental effect on both human health and climate. In order to abate this problem, it is necessary to identify the sources of ultrafine particles. A parameterisation method is presented for estimating the levels of traffic-emitted ultrafine particles in terms of variables describing the ambient conditions. The method is versatile and could easily be applied to similar datasets in other environments. The data used were collected during a four-week period in February 2005, in Gothenburg, as part of the Gote-2005 campaign. The specific variables tested were temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), carbon monoxide concentration (CO), and the concentration of particles up to 10 mm diameter (PM10); all indicators are of importance for aerosol processes such as coagulation and gas-particle partitioning. These variables were selected because of their direct effect on aerosol processes (T and RH) or as proxies for aerosol surface area (CO and PM10) and because of their availability in local monitoring programmes, increasing the usability of the parameterization. Emission factors are presented for 10-100 nm particles (ultrafine particles; EFufp), for 10-40 nm particles (EF10-40), and for 40-100 nm particles (EF40-100). For EF40-100 no effect of ambient conditions was found. The emission factor equations are calculated based on an emission factor for NOx of 1 g km(-1), thus the particle emission factors are easily expressed in units of particles per gram of NOx emitted. For 10-100 nm particles the emission factor is EFufp 1.8 x 10(15) x (1 - 0.095 x CO - 3.2 x 10(-3) x T) particles km(-1). Alternative equations for the EFs in terms of T and PM10 concentration are also presented.

AB  - In the city of Salzburg a study was carried out to investigate possible effects of the stem-flow on lichens using a transplant technique along raintracks of trees. Between November 2000 and June 2001 specimens of Hypogymnia physodes were exposed around the trunks of Tilia cordata at 6 different sites in the urban area of Salzburg. The lichen thalli were fixed on discs of cork which were fitted into bark holes. As the physiological response of the exposed lichens the CO2-gas exchange was observed in time intervals of 4 weeks. Also the pigment content was measured after exposition. Visible damage and changes in the size of the exposed lichen samples were determined photographically. The stemflow after a rain phase was collected with an equipment created by the department of environmental protection of the provincial government of Salzburg and analysed for conductivity, pH and the content of Ca2+, SO42-, NH4+, NO3- and Zn.
   After 6 months of exposure most of the specimens showed no seriously visible damages. Only some peripheral and selective chlorosis and necrosis appeared. At several sites growth of the thalli was observed to a certain extent.
   The lichens had unimodal responses in gas exchange. The physiological activity varied with alteration in environmental conditions. After rain periods the NP-rates were increasing and the DR-rates were significantly negative correlated.

AB  - Germination provides many potentially unrecognized sources of variation in the regeneration niche. In this study we relate germination requirements and seed size for 16 species of pioneer trees to microclimatic conditions present in gaps in semi-deciduous rain forest in Panama. We found that, whereas increased duration of direct irradiance can be an effective indicator of the presence of a canopy gap across all scales of canopy openness, diel fluctuations in soil temperature effectively discriminate both understory sites and small gaps (25 m(2)) from larger gaps. Germination response was significantly related to seed size. Small-seeded species (seed mass <2 mg) showed significantly greater germination in response to irradiance of 22.3 mumol.m(-2).s(-1) than in complete darkness. Their germination was unaffected by an increasing magnitude of diel temperature fluctuation up to a species-specific threshold, above which it declined. Large-seeded species (seed mass >2 mg) germinated equally in light and darkness (with one exception) and either showed a positive germination response to an increasing magnitude of temperature fluctuation (four species) or no significant response (four species). The maximum seed burial depth from which seedlings could emerge successfully was strongly positively associated with seed mass. We conclude that photoblastic germination of tropical pioneer trees results in small-seeded species germinating in gaps only when seeds are located in microsites that are suitable for seedling emergence. A positive germination response to increasing temperature fluctuation can stimulate germination of larger-seeded species in larger gaps and when they are buried beneath an opaque soil or litter layer. Therefore, seed size differences constrain the physiological mechanisms of canopy gap detection in tropical pioneer trees and might contribute to observed differences in the distribution of adult plants in relation to canopy gap size.

AB  - Autochthonous biomarker distributions were studied in an array of different subfacies of a Devonian carbonate complex (represented in platform, reef and off-platform shelf-basinal systems). It revealed that biomarkers are sensitive indicators of depositional environments and may serve to refine palaeoenvironmental interpretations of carbonate complexes based on "classical" sedimentological/facies analyses. The contrasting biomarker composition of the carbonate platform and reef complex versus shelf-basin deposits is here interpreted as the effect of both more diverse biotic sources of a primary organic matter in the former environments (highly scattered results of sterane distribution) and contrasting styles of decay and bacterial reworking of the primary biomass. Peritidal dolostones deposited under anoxic to suboxic conditions, and with scarce sedimentological evidence of elevated salinity, reveal the highest potential of organic matter preservation among other platform/reefal facies. Their biomarker composition includes several compounds indicating hypersaline conditions and anoxia whereas others, in particular gammacerane, indicate that the water-column was stratified during sedimentation. This observation constrains environmental interpretation of these deposits, pointing to shallow-subtidal lagoons with elevated salinity and low-oxygen near-bottom waters most probably originating from a salinity-controlled stratification of the water-column. Biomarkers diagnostic of green sulphur bacteria were found in both peritidal/lagoonal dolostones and shelf-basinal facies. This indicates the existence of photic zone anoxia in the latter environment, thus suggesting a shallow position of the redoxeline. The Frasnian/Famennian mass extinction event(s) apparently had no impact on the biomarker distribution in the shelf-basinal system continuous across the stage boundary. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Hearing loss is the most common occupational disease in the United States, with noise serving as the presumed causative agent in most instances. This investigation characterizes the exposure conditions that facilitate the potentiation of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) by carbon monoxide (CO), Auditory function was compared in rats exposed 4 weeks earlier to noise alone, CO alone, combined exposure, and air in the exposure chamber. This interval between exposure and auditory threshold assessment was selected to permit recovery of temporary threshold shifts. The compound action potential (CAP) threshold evoked by pure tone stimuli was used as a measure of auditory sensitivity. The no adverse effect level (NOAEL) with respect to potentiation of NIHL was found to be 300 ppm CO. Potentiation of NIHL by CO increases linearly as CO concentration increases between 500-1500 ppm. Benchmark dose software (version 1.1B) published by the U.S. EPA National Center for Environmental Assessment was employed to determine a benchmark concentration of CO that produced either a 5-dB potentiation of NIHL or an increase in auditory threshold equivalent to 10% of the effect of noise alone. The lower bound for these benchmark concentrations were 320 and 194 ppm CO, respectively, Unlike CO dose, the relationship between noise severity and potentiation of NIHL by CO shows a nonlinear relationship. The greatest potentiation was observed at moderate noise exposures (100 dB, 2-h, octave band-limited noise, or OBN) that produce limited permanent threshold shifts. Repeated exposures to 95-dB noise for 2-h periods in combination with 1200 ppm CO also yielded potentiation of NIHL, though such effects were not observed following a single combined exposure. These results underscore the potential risk of hearing loss from combined exposure to noise and CO, and the risks associated with repeated exposure.

AB  - To develop an effective breeding programme for rainfed production of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), the inheritance of seed yield under such conditions should be understood, preferably considering the effects of environment to account for site or season specificity. Thus, heritability, expected and realized gain from selection, and combining ability were evaluated for a nine-parent diallel of common bean without reciprocals but including parents, at two locations each in Mexico and Colombia, using the F2 and F3 and F3 population bulks. Heritability estimated from regressions of F3 on F2 ranged from 0.09 +/- 0.18 (S.E.) to 0.75 +/- 0.25 for seed yield, from 0.26 +/- 0.09 to 0.34 +/- 0.09 for days to maturity and from 0.57 +/- 0.04 to 0.80 + 0.04 for 100-seed weight. Expected gain from selection in the F2 was estimated as a percentage of the population mean, selecting the upper 20% of the populations. Expected gain in seed yield ranged from 1.8 to 8.4 % in Mexico and from 6.5 to 28.1 % in Colombia. Realized gains in seed yield in the F3 were 0.4-7.4% in Mexico and 2.9-15.7% in Colombia. Realized gain values for days to maturity were < 2.2 %, and for 100-seed weight > 13.4 %. General combining ability (GCA) mean squares (estimated using Griffing's Method 2, Model 1) were significant (P < 0.01) and larger than those for specific combining ability (SCA) for all traits at all locations. The parents from the Mexican highlands tended to have a positive GCA effect for yield in Mexico but negative values in Colombia, whereas parents adapted to mid-elevation tropical environments showed the opposite tendency. However, all significant GCA values of breeding line V8025 were positive in both countries.

AB  - Background We aim to determine whether adult retrospective report of child abuse is associated with greater risk of prospectively assessed harmful environments in childhood. We assessed possible recall basis by adult depression status. Methods At 45 years, participants of the 1958 British birth cohort (N = 9308) reported a range of abuse types (by 16 years). Prospective data, ages 7-16 years, were obtained for impoverished upbringing, hazardous conditions, anti-social behaviours and 16 years poor parent-child relationships. We estimated associations between retrospective report of child abuse and prospectively measured harm using (i) odds ratios (ORs, 95% confidence intervals) and (ii) positive predictive values (PPVs). PPVs were calculated stratified by adult depression status. Results Prevalence of retrospectively reported abuse ranged from 10.7% (psychological) to 1.60% (sexual) and 14.8% reported >= 1 type; prospectively recorded harm ranged from 10% (hazardous conditions/poor parent-child relationships) to 20% (anti-social behaviours). Adults retrospectively reporting abuse were more likely to have had harmful childhood environments: 52.4% had >= 1 indicator of harm (vs. 35.6% among others); ORsex-adjusted for poor relationships with parents was 2.98 (2.50, 3.54). For retrospectively reported (vs. none) abuse, there was a trend of increasing relative risk ratio with number of harms, from 1.75 (1.50, 2.03) for 1 to 4.68 (3.39, 6.45) for 3/4 childhood harms. The PPV of >= 1 prospectively recorded harm did not differ between depressed (0.58 (0.52, 0.64)) and non-depressed (0.58 (0.55, 0.61)) groups. Conclusions In a population cohort, adult retrospective report of child abuse was associated with several harms, prospectively measured from childhood to adolescence, providing support for the validity of retrospective report-based research. Findings suggest retrospectively reported child abuse is not biased by depression in adulthood.

AB  - Dewaxing by isomerization is widely used to produce winter and arctic grades of diesel fuel. Preliminary feed hydrotreatment and pure hydrogen are usually used in order to avoid poisoning of the catalyst by sulfur and nitrogen. However, combining hydrotreatment and dewaxing in one reactor has some advantages, such as lower capital and operating costs. In such a configuration, a dewaxing catalyst works in sour environments, defined by sulfur and nitrogen presented in the feed stream. In the presented work, Pt-containing catalysts based on commercial zeolites with one-dimensional channels and their mixtures (ZSM-23, ZSM-22, ZSM- 12, EU-2, SAPO-11, ZSM-23+ZSM-12, and ZSM-23+ EU-2) were prepared, characterized using different analytical techniques (X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, N-2 sorption, and infrared spectroscopy), and tested in dewaxing of the diesel fraction under sour conditions. It was found that catalyst activity, dewaxed product yield, and quality indicators (aromatic hydrocarbon content and density) were highly sensitive to zeolite channel size, while catalyst acidity and zeolite crystal size were less important factors. The highest activity was shown by catalysts based on EU-2 and ZSM-12, which had the widest channels. The highest product yield was observed for the catalyst based on EU-2, which had a medium channel size among compared zeolites. Wider zeolite channels promoted the metal function of catalysts that led to a decrease in the aromatic hydrocarbon content of dewaxed products. Using the mixtures of ZSM-23+ZSM-12 and ZSM-23+EU-2 did not lead to visible synergetic effects. Using different binder materials (Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2) did not significantly affect the quality or yield of dewaxed products.

AB  - Background
   Peripheral intravenous catheters (PIVCs) are the most widely used invasive devices worldwide. Up to 42% of PIVCs are prematurely removed during intravenous therapy due to failure. To date, there have been few systematic attempts in European hospitals to measure adherence to recommendations to mitigate PIVC failures.
   Aim
   To analyse the clinical outcomes from clinical practice guideline recommendations for PIVC care on different hospital types and environments. Methods We conducted an observational study in three hospitals in Spain from December 2017 to April 2018. The adherence to recommendations was monitored via visual inspection in situ evaluations of all PIVCs inserted in adults admitted. Context and clinical characteristics were collected by an evaluation tool, analysing data descriptively.
   Results
   646 PIVCs inserted in 624 patients were monitored, which only 52.7% knew about their PIVC. Regarding PIVC insertion, 3.4% (22/646) patients had at least 2 PIVCs simultaneously. The majority of PIVCs were 20G (319/646; 49.4%) and were secured with transparent polyurethane dressing (605/646; 93.7%). Most PIVCs (357/646; 55.3%) had a free insertion site during the visual inspection at first sight. We identified 342/646 (53%) transparent dressings in optimal conditions (clean, dry, and intact dressing). PIVC dressings in medical wards were much more likely to be in intact conditions than those in surgical wards (234/399, 58.7% vs. 108/247, 43.7%). We identified 55/646 (8.5%) PIVCs without infusion in the last 24 hours and 58/646 (9.0%) PIVCs without infusion for more than 24 hours. Regarding PIVC failure, 74 (11.5%) adverse events were identified, all of them reflecting clinical manifestation of phlebitis.
   Conclusions
   Our findings indicate that the clinical outcome indicators from CPG for PIVC care were moderate, highlighting differences between hospital environments and types. Also, we observed that nearly 50% of patients did not know what a PIVC is.

AB  - Ecotoxicological research detailing trace metal contamination and seasonal variation in the tissues of northern fishes such as Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) has been poorly represented in the literature beyond examination of mercury. In an effort to address this, anadromous Arctic charr were collected from the Deception River watershed in the late summer and post-winter season, before quantifying seasonal and organotropic variations in dorsal muscle and liver concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, nickel, lead, and zinc. Potential linkages with biological variables (fork length, age, and somatic condition) and indicators of feeding behavior (delta C-13 and delta N-15) were also assessed. Trace metal organotropism favouring elevation in liver tissue concentrations was exhibited by cadmium, copper, nickel and zinc, while arsenic, chromium and lead exhibited no significant organotropic variation. Seasonal differences in concentrations were metal and tissue dependent, but generally increased in tissues collected from post-winter sampled Arctic charr. Significant correlations with biological and trophic descriptors were also determined to be element and tissue dependent. These parameters, in addition to season, were incorporated into multi-predictor variable models, where variations in trace metal concentration data were often best explained when season, somatic condition, and trophic descriptors were included. These variables were also of greatest relative importance across all considered trace metals and tissue types. These findings suggest that seasonally linked processes have the greatest influence on trace metal concentrations in anadromous Arctic charr. Future metal-related research on Arctic charr and other northern fish species should further consider these variables when evaluating elemental accumulation.

AB  - Light use efficiency (LUE) is a key indicator of vegetation photosynthesis, which provides important insights into how vegetation productivity responds to environmental conditions. The photochemical reflectance index (PRI) is based on reflectance at 531 and 570 nm, which reflects the xanthophyll cycle process of plants under different radiation conditions, and makes LUE related to plant optical characteristics. In this study, tower-based PRI and eddy covariance (EC) based LUEs were used to explore the ability of PRI to track LUE variations in a subtropical, evergreen mixed forest in South China. The results indicate that there is a stronger relationship between PRI and LUE, corrected by the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), where R-2 = 0.46 before correction and R-2 = 0.60 after correction. Generally, PRI is able to capture diurnal and seasonal changes in LUE. Simultaneously, this study highlights a significant correlation between LUE and PRI, but there is also a large seasonal difference in its correlation. The correlation in winter was significantly stronger than summer. The strongest correlation is found in November (R-2 = 0.91) and the weakest is in July (R-2 = 0.34). Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) had a strong influence on the LUE-PRI relationship, while vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and air temperature (Ta) had negative influences on the relationship between LUE and PRI. Terrestrial laser scanning is used to retrieve the vertical structure of forest crown. Our results show that the vegetation canopy structure (i.e., effective leaf area index, LAI(e)), extracted from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) point data in subtropical mixed forests, had a weak influence on LUE. Our research suggests that environmental factors and vegetation canopy structures should be considered when using PRI to accurately estimate LUE.

AB  - In this paper, we experimentally determined the conditions and characteristics of the ignition of the fuel mixture samples of various composition of crushed coal and wood in stationary air heated to high temperatures (from 600 to 1000 degrees C). The heating of fuel mixtures under study that are promising for heat power engineering and their subsequent ignition and combustion were registered by using a high-speed video camera (image size is 1024 x 1024 pixels, frame rate is up to 10(5) frame/s), which ensures high reliability of the obtained results. The ignition delay times of all the studied mixtures based on lean and long-flame coals were established to decrease with an increase in the wood fraction. The limits of the stable (with small deviations of the delay time from the average values) ignition of weights of the studied mixtures are selected. At an increase in the wood waste fraction up to 50%, the decrease in the ignition delay time of mixed fuel based on grade T coal was found to be 11.2% at 600 degrees C and 55.3% at 1000 degrees C. For fuel mixtures based on grade D coal and wood, similar indicators are 17.6 and 64.3%. At temperatures typical for the furnace environment (approximately 1000 degrees C), the ignition delay time for such fuels was determined to be less than 1 s, which is significantly less than the similar ignition characteristics of long-flame and lean-coal dust. The ash content of the fuel mixture is established to be a nonadditive characteristic relative to the ash content of the corresponding coal and wood. The increase in the wood fraction to 50% leads to a decrease in ash content to 10.44% for grade D coal and to 11.08% for grade T coal.

AB  - Efficient quantification of the three-dimensional forest structure is of increasing importance for our understanding of forest functions and services, but it remains challenging with conventional methods. We used a single-scan ground-based laser approach in stands with a known difference in management history and associated differences in structures. The data were used to test whether the measurement approach could distinguish various structural measures among the stands, including overall density, vertical structure, competitive conditions for regeneration, horizontal visibility, and three-dimensional structural variability. In general, our data reflected known differences in stand structure. However, in some cases the different measures showed contradicting results, highlighting the limited information represented in each measure when considered in isolation. At the same time, our results suggested that all components of stand structure do not develop in sync. The variability of horizontal and vertical structural heterogeneity appears to be a good indicator of structural elements, typically found in old-growth forests, i.e., spatially homogenous (scale independent) horizontal structural variability in combination with a scale-dependent vertical structural variability. In addition, our results provided information with direct management implications. For example, gap creation, a prominent practice in restoration treatments in the region, increased spatial variability, but the hard edges and removal of all trees inside the gap, are not reflecting structural conditions found in our old-growth stand. In summary, our results suggest that this new technology can efficiently provide objective and holistic inventories of stand structures. However, more work is needed to fully understand the implications of the novel structural measures for ecosystem processes and services. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The species composition and size-structure of the phytoplankton community in the Boka Kotorska Bay (SE Adriatic Sea) were analysed with respect to abundance and carbon biomass, together with the physico-chemical parameters, with the aim of evaluating the predefined oligo-mesotrophic status of this transitional water ecosystem. Three stations located in the inner part of the Bay were sampled with seasonal frequency in 2008/2009. Picophytoplankton cells were counted using flow cytometry; nanophytoplankton and microphytoplankton were identified and counted by light microscopy. The relative importance of the picoplankton in the Bay, in terms of both abundance and biomass, during all the investigated seasons emphasized their significance in the phytoplankton community. Picocyanobacteria (Synechococcus) constituted a significant part of the summer assemblages with regard to both abundance (up to 3.38 x 10(8) cells L-1) and carbon biomass (up to 73% of total phytoplankton carbon). The contribution of the nanophytoplankton was found to be generally low (< 20% of the total phytoplankton carbon) in all seasons, and was dominated by autotrophic/mixotrophic flagellates. Species with a preference towards nutrient-enriched conditions, like the diatom Skeletonema marinoi, dominated the microphytoplankton fraction. S. marinoi was the most abundant in spring/winter (up to 2.86 x 10(6) cells L-1) above the halocline (making a 96% contribution to the microphytoplankton). The potentially toxin-producing diatom Pseudo-nitzschia pseudodelicatissima was recorded at abundances greater than 10(5) cells L-1, together with Thalassionema frauenfeldii, as well as the dinoflagellates Prorocentrum, micans and the potentially harmful P. minimum. The higher values of phytoplankton biomass and the dominance of phytoplankton species or groups with preferences for nutrient-enriched conditions appear to be consistent with the oligo-mesotrophic status of this specific ecosystem.

AB  - The regulation of heterotrophic bacterial growth by resource supply (bottom-up control) was temperature-dependent in our analysis of data obtained during 2006 in the euphotic layer of the southern Bay of Biscay (NE Atlantic) continental shelf. The dataset was split into 2 subgroups using 16 degrees C as the boundary between warm and cool waters based on differences in associated physicochemical conditions, e.g. inorganic nutrient limitation at higher temperatures. The linear regressions between bacterial biomass (BB) and leucine incorporation rates (LIR) were significantly positive in both temperature regimes, thus indicating similar total bottom-up control, albeit with a slightly higher slope in warm waters (0.33 vs. 0.22). However, the relationship of LIR with phytoplankton biomass (chl a), which is an indicator of bottom-up control that is mediated by phytoplankton, was only significant in waters below 16 degrees C. The analysis of bimonthly variations in the BB-LIR and LIR-chl a correlations indicated that the strength of total bottom-up control significantly increased while the role of phytoplankton in supplying DOM to bacteria diminished with mean temperatures over the 12 to 19 degrees C range, suggesting a seasonal switch in the major source of substrates used by bacteria. We show that the abundance of cells with relatively high nucleic acid content (HNA), which are hypothesized to be the most active ones, was positively associated with bacterial production and specific growth rates in cool but not in warm conditions. These results suggest that HNA bacteria are good predictors of bulk activity and production in temperate ecosystems only when the community relies principally on phytoplankton substrates for growth and metabolism.

AB  - Background. A key challenge for conservation biology in the Neotropics is to understand how deforestation affects biodiversity at various levels of landscape fragmentation. Addressing this challenge requires expanding the coverage of known biodiversity data, which remain to date restricted to a few well-surveyed regions. Here, we assess the sampling coverage and biases in biodiversity data on fruit-feeding butterflies at the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, discussing their effect on our understanding of the relationship between forest fragmentation and biodiversity at a large-scale. We hypothesize that sampling effort is biased towards large and connected fragments, which occur jointly in space at the Atlantic forest.
   Methods. We used a comprehensive dataset of Atlantic Forest fruit-feeding butterfly communities to test for sampling biases towards specific geographical areas, climate conditions and landscape configurations.
   Results. We found a pattern of geographical aggregation of sampling sites, independently of scale, and a strong sampling bias towards large and connected forest fragments, located near cities and roads. Sampling gaps are particularly acute in small and disconnected forest fragments and rare climate conditions. In contrast, currently available data can provide a fair picture of fruit-feeding butterfly communities in large and connected Atlantic Forest remnants.
   Discussion. Biased data hamper the inference of the functional relationship between deforestation and biodiversity at a large-scale, since they are geographically clustered and have sampling gaps in small and disconnected fragments. These data are useful to inform decision-makers regarding conservation efforts to curb biodiversity loss in the Atlantic Forest. Thus, we suggest to expand sampling effort to small and disconnected forest fragments, which would allow more accurate evaluations of the effects of landscape modification.

AB  - Natural disasters have enormous impacts on human society, especially on the development of the economy. To support decision-making in mitigation and adaption to natural disasters, assessment of economic impacts is fundamental and of great significance. Based on a review of the literature on economic impact evaluation, this paper proposes a new assessment model of the economic impacts of droughts by using the sugar industry in China as a case study, which focuses on the generation and transfer of economic impacts along a simple value chain involving only sugarcane growers and a sugar-producing company. A perspective of profit loss rate is applied to scale economic impact. By using "with and without" analysis, profit loss is defined as the difference in profits between disaster-hit and disaster-free scenarios. To calculate profit, analysis of a time series of sugar price is applied. With the support of a linear regression model, an endogenous trend in sugar price is identified and the time series of sugar price "without" disaster is obtained, using an autoregressive error model to separate impact of disasters from the internal trend in sugar price. Unlike the settings in other assessment models, representative sugar prices, which represent value level in disaster-free conditions and disaster-hit conditions, are integrated from a long time series that covers the whole period of drought. As a result, it is found that in a rigid farming contract, sugarcane growers suffer far more than the sugar company when impacted by severe drought, which may promote reflections among various economic bodies on economic equality related to the occurrence of natural disasters. Further, sensitivity analysis of the model built reveals that sugarcane purchase price has a significant influence on profit loss rate, which implies that setting a proper sugarcane purchase price would be an effective way of realizing economic equality in future practice of contract farming.

AB  - The first results of comparison of palynological analysis (pollen of terrestrial plants), SEM analysis of pollen morphology, and radiocarbon age dating (AMS14C) of sediments of the eastern shelf of the Laptev Sea show that the diverse taxonomic composition of pollen spectra provides an integrated idea of the vegetation and climate of the region over 11.2 calendar kiloyears. It is found that phases of the tree and shrub vegetation development (maxima of pollen of Betula sect. Nanae and Pinus s/g Haploxylon) correspond to the warm epochs in the Holocene. It is obvious that birch phytocoenoses first settled in the southern tundra subzone with increasing temperature, and then coniferous communities of forest tundra. An occurrence of pollen of shrubby birches (Nanae) suggests compliance of permafrost landscapes with cold climate conditions, i.e., with an annual average temperature of -2A degrees C and amount of precipitation of less than 500 mm. Owing to a progressive increase in summer temperatures, dwarf cedar and pine communities advanced toward the seashore. The SEM analysis results show that a significant proportion of regional coniferous pollen belongs to representatives of Pinus pumila (Pall.) and P. sylvestris L. In addition, the SEM study of the exine of Pinus sylvestris L. and P. pumila (Pall.) Regel pollen grains confirmed polymorphism in coniferous pollen. According to the inverse relationship between climate and vegetation, frequent climate fluctuations that are typical of progressive and differential postglacial transgression were revealed. An increase in arboreal pollen transfer onto the shelf later than 9.1 cal. ka coincides with the time of forest boundary migration to the north due to the warming of the Earth's climate. At that time, the tundra vegetation was replaced by forest-tundra vegetation, the maximum stage of sea transgression began, and there appeared a trend of increasing temperature and moisture.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION
LA  - English
KW  - AIRBORNE PARTICLES
AB  - This study investigates the application of the Aerosol-to-Liquid Particle Extraction System (ALPXS), which uses wet electrostatic precipitation to collect airborne particles, for multi-element indoor stationary monitoring. Optimum conditions are determined for capturing airborne particles for metal determination by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), for measuring field blanks, and for calculating limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ). Due to the relatively high flow rate (300 L min(-1)), a sampling duration of 1 hr to 2 hr was adequate to capture airborne particle-bound metals under the investigated experimental conditions. The performance of the ALPXS during a building renovation demonstrated signal-to-noise ratios appropriate for sampling airborne particles in environments with elevated metal concentrations, such as workplace settings. The ALPXS shows promise as a research tool for providing useful information on short-term variations (transient signals) and for trapping particles into aqueous solutions where needed for subsequent characterization. As the ALPXS does not provide size-specific samples, and its efficiency at different flow rates has yet to be quantified, the ALPXS would not replace standard filter-based protocols accepted for regulatory applications (e. g., exposure measurements), but rather would provide additional information if used in conjunction with filter based methods.
   Implications: This study investigates the capability of the Aerosol-to-Liquid Particle Extraction System (ALPXS) for stationary sampling of airborne metals in indoor workplace environments, with subsequent analysis by ICP-MS. The high flow rate (300 L/min) permits a short sampling duration (< 2 hr). Results indicated that the ALPXS was capable of monitoring short-term changes in metal emissions during a renovation activity. This portable instrument may prove to be advantageous in occupational settings as a qualitative indicator of elevated concentrations of airborne metals at short time scales.

AB  - Objectives: In the aftermath of an environmental public health disaster (EPHD) a healthcare system may be the least equipped entity to respond. Preventable visits for ambulatory careYsensitive conditions (ACSCs) may be used as a population-based indicator to monitor health system access postdisaster. The objective of this study was to examine whether ACSC rates among vulnerable subpopulations are sensitive to the impact of a disaster.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis on the 2005 chlorine spill in Graniteville, South Carolina using a Medicaid claims database. Poisson regression was used to calculate change in monthly ACSC visits at the disaster site in the postdisaster period compared with the predisaster period after adjusting for parallel changes in a control group.
   Results: The adjusted rate of a predisaster ACSC hospital visit for the direct group was 1.68 times the rate for the control group (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.47Y1.93), whereas the adjusted ACSC hospital rate postdisaster for the direct group was 3.10 times the rate for the control group (95% CI 1.97Y5.18). For ED ACSC visits, the adjusted rate among those directly affected predisaster were 1.82 times the rate for the control group (95% CI 1.61Y2.08), whereas the adjusted ACSC rate postdisaster was 2.81 times the rate for the control group (95% CI 1.92Y5.17).
   Conclusions: Results revealed that an increased demand on the health system altered health services delivery for vulnerable populations directly affected by a disaster. Preventable visits for ACSCs may advance public health practice by identifying healthcare disparities during disaster recovery.

AB  - The Trad-MCN bioassay was used to investigate the genotoxicity on Tradescantia pallida var. purpurea plants exposed to variations in the environmental conditions in urban and rural sites in the metropolitan area of Porto Alegre, southern Brazil, over a one-year period. In spring 2009 and in summer, autumn and winter 2010, potted plants of T. pallida var. purpurea were exposed at two sites with different characteristics: the urban area of the municipality of Estancia Velha, with leather and footwear industrial activity, and a Site of Special Environmental Interest in the rural area of the municipality of Novo Hamburgo. Other plants comprised the control group and were kept indoors. Frequencies of micronuclei (MCN) were determined in early tetrads of pollen mother cells and expressed as MCN/100 tetrads. Climate data were also registered during the experiment. MCN frequencies in the urban area were significantly higher (up to 8.13) than those found in the rural area (up to 1.26) and in the control group (up to 1.10), which did not differ statistically from each other over the year. The higher MCN frequencies observed in the urban site can be attributed to air pollution, but also may have been influenced by microclimatic and daily thermal variation differences between sites. Higher temperatures recorded in spring and summer may have influenced MCN frequencies observed in the urban site. No clear relation was observed between rainfall and MCN frequencies. Similar and high relative humidity percentages were registered over the period of the study. Considering that the bioindicator plant presents an integrated response to abiotic factors such as pollutants and weather conditions, it can be used as an additional tool that can point to synergistic effects of environmental variables on organisms.

AB  - QUALITY OF LIFE: TYPOLOGY OF EUROPEAN CITIES BASED ON CLUSTER ANALYSIS Veronika Cernakova, Oto Hudec Quality of life is a frequently used term to evaluate living conditions of a person or a family. Both economic and non-economic factors of the quality of life are often taken into account and the role of external environment as objectivized measure for individual life satisfaction is emphasized. Hence, in examining the quality of life, two basic approaches of subjective perception of individual emotions, or approaches based on using objectified measurement methods classifying macroeconomic, social and demographic indicators chosen to reflect "objective" life conditions can be used. Determination of groups of cities with similar subjective quality of life assessment and the spatial patterns of similarity in the European area is the main research question studied in the paper with a proposition, how apparent is a difference between the cities of western, southern Europe and former communist countries.
   Database for comparison descends from the primary research carried out in seventy five European and Turkish cities on a sample of 37 626 citizens in 2009. Research was conducted through a questionnaire survey in which respondents answered 24 questions and the resulting document "Survey on perceptions of quality of life in 75 European cities" offers a basic descriptive comparison of the cities. In the article, the same survey primary data was processed using cluster analysis to classify the cities into eight groups according to similarity of citizen views. The subjective perception of the quality of life is confronted with the measurable quantitative indicators approach. The subsequent analysis examines the relation between objective and subjective assessment of quality of life. To clarify the classification of cities into clusters based on the subjective perception, four key indicators used in developing spatial typologies - GDP per capita, population, population density and the unemployment rate in the cities.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) application management needs to be refined for low yielding environments under dryland conditions. This 3-yr study examined nitrogen fertilization management effects on corn (Zea mays L.) plant characteristics and grain yield in rain fed environment under conventional tillage system. Nitrogen fertilization management consisted of two timing methods of N application [all N at planting and as split with 35 kg N ha(-1) applied at planting and remaining N applied at vegetative (V) 6 growth stage] and live N rates (0, 45, 90, 135, and 180 kg N ha(-1)). Insufficient rainfall at reproductive stage in 2008 and 2009 likely resulted in significant reduction of grain yield compared with grain yield in 2007, average 2.9 vs. 5.9 Mg ha(-1). Grain yield increased with N application up to ;45 kg ha(-1); however, no further increase in N application resulted in increased yields. Plant height, ear height, relative chlorophyll (SPAD) content, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at reproductive (R-1) stage increased with increasing N rate up to 90, 90, 135, and 90 kg N ha(-1), respectively. Corn grain yield significantly correlated with plant height at R-1, SPAD at V-8, NDVI and LAI at V-8 and RI stage. The combination of plant height, NDVI, and LAI of R-1 stage explained most of the variability of grain yield (r-square = 0.71). The fertilization timing had no effect on corn grain yield and plant characteristics. These observations showed that applying more than 45 kg N ha(-1) to corn under dryland conditions with insufficient rainfall, especially during corn pollination, may not significantly increase grain yields.

AB  - To use behaviours as indicators of stress it is important to understand their underlying causation. For a prey animal in the wild, such as a sheep, behavioural responses have evolved to evade detection and capture by predators. The behavioural responses of the wild ancestors of domestic sheep to the threat of predation are characterised predominantly by vigilance, flocking, flight to cover and behavioural inhibition once refuge has been reached Some limited defensive behaviours are seen, mainly in females with young against small predators. Vigilance and flight distance are affected by the animal's assessment of risk and are influenced by the environment social group size, age, sex and reproductive condition, as well as by previous experience with potential predators. Under conditions of stress, domestic sheep show similar behavioural reactions to wild sheep, although the threshold at which they are elicited may be elevated. This is particularly evident when comparing less selected hill breeds with more highly selected lowland breeds, and suggests that a continuum of responsiveness exists between wild and feral sheep, through hill breeds to the lowland sheep breeds. However, this may be confounded by the previous experience of the breeds, particularly their familiarity with humans. Behavioural and neurobiological evidence suggests that although the behavioural response to predators (vigilance, flight) is innate, the stimuli that elicit this behavioural pattern may have a learned component. Since vigilance and flight distances are affected by the animal's perception of threat, they may be useful indices of stress in sheep and, as graded responses, give some indication of the level of threat experienced by the sheep. Thus they may indicate the amount of fear or distress experienced by the sheep and hence have the potential to be used in the assessment of welfare states.

AB  - Spring wheat cv. Yecora 70 was exposed to soil water deficits during three phases between emergence and anthesis: early (22 days after solving to terminal spikelet), mid (terminal spikelet to anthesis) and late (early boot to anthesis). The objective was to quantify the effects of water stress on partitioning of above-ground biomass to the spike, the ratio between kernel number and anthesis spike weight, canopy expansion, radiation interception and phenology. This information can be used to test the assumptions used when modelling wheat growth and yield under water-limiting conditions.
   The extension rate of the lamina and pseudostem was reduced when more than 50% of the extractable soil water had been extracted from the root-zone, independent of the stage when stress was imposed. Stress reduced biomass accumulation more through a reduction of the amount of radiation intercepted than reduced radiation-use efficiency. The reduction in the amount of radiation intercepted was due to lower leaf area index, as the radiation extinction coefficient was similar under stress and non-stress conditions.
   Stress treatments reduced spike biomass at anthesis to 58-94 degrees of that in the well-watered control, but had little effect on the pattern of biomass partitioning to the spike and the proportion of anthesis biomass as spike. Stress after terminal spikelet reduced the ratio of kernel number to anthesis spike weight by 50 degrees, suggesting that reduced kernel number under stress may not be solely due to a restricted assimilate supply.
   This study showed that current assumptions are valid regarding the response of wheat to pre-anthesis stress in terms of canopy expansion, radiation interception and biomass partitioning to the spike. However, the constancy of the ratio of kernel number to anthesis spike weight was shown not to hold under water stress.

AB  - This review is a part of the SI 'Genome-Scale Modeling of Microorganisms in the Real World'. The goal of GEM is the accurate prediction of the phenotype from its respective genotype under specified environmental conditions. This review focuses on the dynamic phenotype; prediction of the real-life behaviors of microorganisms, such as cell proliferation, dormancy, and mortality; balanced and unbalanced growth; steady-state and transient processes; primary and secondary metabolism; stress responses; etc. Constraint-based metabolic reconstructions were successfully started two decades ago as FBA, followed by more advanced models, but this review starts from the earlier nongenomic predecessors to show that some GEMs inherited the outdated biokinetic frameworks compromising their performances. The most essential deficiencies are: (i) an inadequate account of environmental conditions, such as various degrees of nutrients limitation and other factors shaping phenotypes; (ii) a failure to simulate the adaptive changes of MMCC (MacroMolecular Cell Composition) in response to the fluctuating environment; (iii) the misinterpretation of the SGR (Specific Growth Rate) as either a fixed constant parameter of the model or independent factor affecting the conditional expression of macromolecules; (iv) neglecting stress resistance as an important objective function; and (v) inefficient experimental verification of GEM against simple growth (constant MMCC and SGR) data. Finally, we propose several ways to improve GEMs, such as replacing the outdated Monod equation with the SCM (Synthetic Chemostat Model) that establishes the quantitative relationships between primary and secondary metabolism, growth rate and stress resistance, process kinetics, and cell composition.

AB  - In this study, we used scale analysis of returning adults to examine the relationship between early marine growth and survival for Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) returning to the Puget Sound and coastal Washington, USA. In total, we examined scales from 2604 individuals from 5 stocks over 7 outmigration years characterized by a range of survival conditions (range from 0.11 to 9.50%). We observed a positive relationship between growth during the first year at sea and survival for adults returning to Puget Sound and the Washington coast. Scale growth during the first year at sea did not co-vary between coastal Washington and Puget Sound stocks, and in most years coastal Chinook salmon attained a larger size at the end of the first year at sea. Large scale oceanographic variables (PDO, NPGO) were not significantly related to variation in scale growth, but for some Puget Sound populations, scale growth was higher in years of cooler sea surface temperatures and lower Pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) abundance. We developed a biological indicator for forecasting cohort survival of Tumwater Falls hatchery Chinook salmon on the Deschutes River, WA using marine growth estimates of the earliest returning fish (age-21). The marine growth index predicted survival better for 8 brood years compared to a recent 5 year average returns forecasting approach (3.40% vs 35.41% Mean Percent Error). Results from this study suggest that early marine growth is important to the survival of Puget Sound and coastal Washington Chinook salmon and may be a useful biological indicator to improve pre-season forecasting of Chinook salmon populations in Washington State.

AB  - Nitrogen isotopes have been widely used as indicators of depositional conditions in studies of ancient sediments. Bohai Bay Basin is a major continental hydrocarbon province in NE China, but nitrogen isotopic signatures of this lacustrine system(connected with the open ocean occasionally) have barely been investigated. We report a study of paleoenvironmental information recorded by N isotopic variations in the lower third member (Es3L) and upper fourth member (Es4U) of the Eocene Shahejie Formation in the Jiyang Sub-basin, southern Bohai Bay Basin. Paleosalinity (B/Ga, Sr/Ba, and S/TOC) and paleoredox (C-org/P, DOP, U-EF, and Fe/Al) proxies and delta C-13(org) values were used to elucidate paleoenvironmental factors that affect N isotopic signals in the study core. Results indicate that delta N-15 values are positively correlated with paleosalinity proxies in the Luo-69 and Niu-1 drill-cores. Two possibilities may account for this: (1) a paleosalinity surge caused by marine transgression events led to stratification of the water column, creating an anoxic-suboxic deep-water layer and promoting denitrification in sediments; or (2) strong stratification of the water column impeded the upwelling process that brought nutrients to the upper water layer, weakening nitrogen fixation there. In marginal-marine intervals such as the Eocene Shahejie Formation, water-column salinity may play a critical role in regulating the delta N-15 signal. This study indicates that nitrogen isotopic compositions may aid paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic interpretations of marginal-marine shale, particularly when applied together with multiple paleoenvironmental proxies to improve the understanding of ancient sedimentary conditions in marginal-environment.

AB  - As some water utilities are facing increasing concentrations of natural organic matter (NOM) in source water, it has been observed that some of this organic content is refractory to conventional coagulation treatment with alum and ferric sulfate. However, prehydrolyzed coagulants containing polymeric and/or cationic aluminum species such as Al-2, Al-3, Al-13, and Al-30 offer many advantages over conventional metal salts, including improved removal of hydrophilic compounds, stronger electrostatic interactions with anionic functional groups, better stability over a wider pH range, etc. Residual NOM after coagulation was characterized using liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection-organic nitrogen detection (LC-OCD-OND), while aluminum species were identified using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Six coagulants having different proportion of Al species were tested on three surface waters, and guidelines for the coagulant selection are proposed for different NOM fractions: humics (HS), building blocks (BB, breakdown products of HS), low molecular weight acids (LMWa), low molecular weight neutral (LMWn) compounds, biopolymers (BP), and dissolved organic nitrogen from the HS fraction (HS-DON). In summary, ferric sulfate outperformed aluminum-based coagulants in acidic conditions (pH < 6) while aluminum chlorohydrate (basicity of 83 %) was repeatedly noted to be the best coagulant in more alkaline conditions (pH > 7). Under more neutral pH (6-7), alum offered a good compromise between DOC and turbidity removals and the coagulant cost. Coagulant performance was also assessed based on typical indicators used in the industry such as turbidity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), residual aluminum/iron, trihalomethanes/haloacetic acids (THM/HAA) precursors, and alkalinity consumption. Considering all indicators and NOM fractions, this study revealed that PAX 14, a slightly prehydrolyzed coagulant (basicity of 23 %), exhibited the best performance during enhanced coagulation at pH 6.0.

AB  - The interactive effects of paleoclimates and current conditions on pedogenesis in soils developed on volcanic parent materials (VPMs) is still poorly understood, particularly for soils in dry environments. Eight representative profiles located at Harrat Khaybar, Saudi Arabia and representing different landforms and positions including alluvial plain, alluvial fans, active slopes and lava field were investigated to better understand the effect of climate and basalt lithology on pedogenesis. The morphological and physicochemical soil properties and clay mineralogy composition were evaluated to identify the primary diagnostic horizons and therefore the pedogenic pathways that created the studied soils. All investigated profiles showed the influence of slope processes, resulting in heterogeneous soil profiles. The investigated soils can be described as polygenetic due to evidence of andisolization and the presence of salic and calcic diagnostic horizons. Andisolization implies development under a sub-humid paleoclimate during initial pedogenesis, while calcic and salic diagnostic horizons, are typical of the current arid conditions. As a result, about 63% of the investigated soils were classified as Torrands/Vitric Andosols and 37% as Salids/Solonchaks based on Soil Taxonomy and World Reference Base, respectively. Values of Al-o, Fe-o, and Si-o ranged from 0.20 to 0.68%, 0.24 to 3.27%, and 0.23 to 1.03%, respectively, implying the presence of poorly-crystalline fine components (i.e., allophane and ferrihydrite). Vermiculite, kaolinite, and interstratified vermiculite-chlorite were abundant, with illite, palygorskite, and Cazeolites as minor crystalline minerals. A combination of paleo/present-climate influenced pedogenesis leading to andisolization and the coexistence of poorly/crystalline minerals and formation of salic and calcic diagnostic horizons. This study demonstrates that andic properties can persist in dry-hot environments, highlighting the critical role of paleo/modern climate interactions as an influential factor driving the pedogenic pathways of VPMs-derived soils.

AB  - Soil salinity is one of the most significant environmental constraints to global agricultural productivity. To meet the nutritional needs of the growing population, cereals such as wheat, which are essential for dietary products but also sensitive to salinity, must be improved to be either more resilient or less susceptible to salt stress. The main objective of this study was to examine the responses of advanced mutant lines to salt stress. Five-advanced mutant wheat lines, which were previously found to be drought tolerant, were grown under 150 mM NaCl stress conditions to see how they responded to salt stress conditions. They were generated via 200 Gy gamma-ray applications to the Sagittario commercial cultivar. The results show that the content of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), chlorophyll, and electrolyte leakage % did not change significantly. Mutant lines showed higher antioxidant defense system parameters (SOD, CAT, POX, and GR). Similarly, the amount of proline involved in intracellular homeostasis was higher in all mutants. Under saline stress, the expression of Triticum aestivum Salt Overly Sensitive 1 (TaSOS1) increased in all mutant lines, the expression of Triticum aestivum High-Affinity Potassium ion Transporter 2;1 (TaHKT2;1) increased in all except in mutant line 5, and the expression of Triticum aestivum Sodium ion / Hydrogen ion vacuolar antiporter (TaNa+/H+ vacuolar antiporter) increased in all except in mutant line 3. Synergetic interaction in the expression of the genes involved in signal transduction resulted in more intracellular K+. Overall, these results suggest that mutants' responses to salinity stress is related to an ability to accumulate K+ in cells with synergetic expressional regulation of TaHKT2;1, TaNa+/H+ vacuolar antiporter, and TaSOS1 genes, in addition to responses of antioxidant enzyme activities and the accumulation of proline.

AB  - Vibrio cholerae, the Gramnegative facultative pathogen, resides in the aquatic environment and infects humans and causes diarrhoeagenic cholera. Although the environment differs drastically, V. cholerae thrives in both of these conditions aptly and chitinases play a vital role in their persistence and nutrient acquisition. Chitinases also play a role in V. cholerae pathogenesis. Chitinases and its downstream chitin utilization genes are regulated by sensor histidine kinase ChiS, which also plays a significant role in pathogenesis. Recent exploration suggests that CytR, a transcription factor of the LacI family in V. cholerae, also regulates chitinase secretion in environmental conditions. Since chitinases and chitinase regulator ChiS is involved in pathogenesis, CytR might also play a significant role in pathogenicity. However, the role of CytR in pathogenesis is yet to be known. This study explores the regulation of CytR on the activation of ChiS in the presence of mucin and its role in pathogenesis. Therefore, we created a CytR isogenic mutant strain of V. cholerae (CytR(-)) and found considerably less beta-hexosaminidase enzyme production, which is an indicator of ChiS activity. The CytR(-) strain greatly reduced the expression of chitinases chiA1 and chiA2 in mucinsupplemented media. Electron microscopy showed that the CytR(-) strain was aflagellate. The expression of flagellarsynthesis regulatory genes flrB, flrC and class III flagellarsynthesis genes were reduced in the CytR(-) strain. The isogenic CytR mutant showed less growth compared to the wild type in mucinsupplemented media as well as demonstrated highly retarded motility and reduced mucin-layer penetration. The CytR mutant revealed decreased adherence to the HT-29 cell line. In animal models, reduced fluid accumulation and colonization were observed during infection with the CytR(-) strain due to reduced expression of ctxB, toxT and tcpA.

AB  - Planning for more sustainable mobility is an important goal for public authorities worldwide. Setting better conditions for pedestrians and cyclists has been related to many social benefits, such as less pollution and congestion. Local authorities, aware of the relationship between transport and land-use, are adopting planning tools to analyze growth in cities and their impacts using multiple indicators. This paper develops an econometric trip length model that correlates socioeconomic characteristics and built environment conditions with walking travel distances in the city of Bogota, Colombia. A log-linear regression model was estimated using information for 2015 of Bogota's household travel survey, along with data of employment and population by block obtained from official sources. The built environment component of the model serves to evaluate the effect of land-use patterns. A proof of concept was developed using land-use information extracted from a Cellular Automata Land-Use model calibrated for the city. From its results, some factors of the built environment were estimated and two scenarios were tested in this study. One depicts the average walking distance for households surveyed in 2015, and the other takes a simulation of land-use policy in developing a new urban area as an input. The results indicate that people living in areas were the land-use mix and job/population ratio are low, tend to have longer walking distances, suggesting the need to implement special policies that reallocate some activities and encourage higher land-use mix in the urban periphery where low-income households tend to be located. The proposed method can identify the impact of land-use policies in the distances traveled by walking, facilitating the impact assessment of land-use regulations.

AB  - Flash flood is one of the most dangerous natural phenomena because of its high magnitudes and sudden occurrence, resulting in huge damages for people and properties. Our work aims to propose a state-of-the-art model for susceptibility mapping of the flash flood using the decision tree random subspace ensemble optimized by hybrid firefly-particle swarm optimization (HFPS), namely the HFPS-RSTree model. In this work, we used data from a flood inventory map consisting of 1866 polygons derived from Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and a field survey conducted in the northwest mountainous area of the Van Ban district, Lao Cai Province in Vietnam. A total of eleven flooding conditioning factors (soil type, geology, rainfall, river density, elevation, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), plant curvature, and profile curvature) were used as explanatory variables. These indicators were compiled from a geological and mineral resources map, soil type map, and topographic map, ALOS PALSAR DEM 30 m, and Landsat-8 imagery. The HFPS-RSTree model was trained and verified using the inventory map and the eleven conditioning variables and then compared with four machine learning algorithms, i.e., the support vector machine (SVM), the random forests (RF), the C4.5 decision trees (C4.5 DT), and the logistic model trees (LMT) models. We employed a range of statistical standard metrics to assess the predictive performance of the proposed model. The results show that the HFPS-RSTree model had the best predictive performance and achieved better results than those of other benchmarks with the ability to predict flash flood, reaching an overall accuracy of over 90%. It can be concluded that the proposed approach provides new insights into flash flood prediction in mountainous regions.

AB  - Aim: Position of the alpine tree line ecotone around the globe corresponds to a growing season isotherm of approximately 6 degrees C. Accordingly, tree lines are important indicators of Holocene global and regional environmental change. A central line of inquiry in tree line ecology is to better understand the mechanisms that dictate tree line position on the landscape, as well as the environmental conditions that cause upslope and downslope shifts in its position at centennial to millennial time-scales. Here, we present a climate-driven model to predict tree line position over the past 6,000years.
   Location: Sheep Mountain, located in the White Mountain Range of California, USA.
   Time period: 4750 bce to present.
   Major taxa studied: Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva BK Bailey).
   Methods: We use a climate-driven tree line position model that utilizes a topoclimate raster surface of growing season average temperature to predict the spatial position and area of the alpine tree line ecotone across the mountain range. We then produce a time series of tree line position predictions at 500-year intervals from 4750 bce to present, and compare the predictions to the growth dates and spatial locations of 61 remnant bristlecone pine samples from above modern tree line.
   Results: The model indicates that tree line position in the White Mountains, CA migrated downslope throughout the Holocene until approximately 750 ce, rebounded slightly upslope by 1250 ce, and has since likely remained stationary. Applying the model under present-day climatic conditions suggests the current tree line at Sheep Mountain may be out of climatic equilibrium by up to 250 vertical metres in some places.
   Conclusion: The results support independent conclusions from global tree line analyses, underscore the temperature sensitivity of the tree line ecotone, and further develop our understanding of climate-driven tree line dynamics.

AB  - The article presents data on the development of the technology of multicomponent probiotics from two bacterial strains: Bifidobacterium longum-Ya3 and Propionibacterium shermanii-4. The ability of bacteria of the genus Propionibacterium to have a selective stimulating effect on the growth of bacteria of the genus Bifidobacterium has been characterised. Based on the experimental data obtained with the MATLAB software, optimal conditions were determined for the accumulation of the maximum amount of biomass of the consortium of Bifidobacterium longum-Ya3 and Propionibacterium shermanii4. The main parameters that determined the yield of biomass in the process of cultivation under different temperature conditions (T=30 degrees C, T= 34 degrees C, T= 37 degrees C) have been taken as the optimality criteria. These parameters are the number of colonyforming units and the active acidity. It has been established that the optimal time for cultivating a consortium of bifidobacteria and propionibacteria in a soy-lactose medium is 24 hours at a temperature of 34 degrees C. On the basis of the data obtained, we have created a symbiotic BAA (biologically active additive) and developed a basic technological scheme for its production. The biologically active additive was created on the basis of the symbiotic consortium of bifido and propionibacteria containing 4 x 10(10) CFU/cm(3) of B. longum-Ya3, and 3 x 10(10) CFU/cm(3) of P. shermanii-4. The microbiological control of the quality of the obtained dietary supplement based on the consortium of the bacteria Bifidobacterium longum-Ya3 and Propionibacterium shermanii-4 has found no pathogenic and sanitary indicator microorganisms. It means that the finished product is safe and suitable for consumption. As for the organoleptic parameters, the BAA obtained is of a powder-like structure, beige-coloured, with a specific taste and smell.

AB  - The article presents the use of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method for the support of decisions regarding the choice of mining investment. The mining investment, as understood in the analysis conducted in the article is an acquisition of a plant mining zinc and lead ore together with the processing plant producing concentrates of these metals as well as the deposits potentially viable for mining. The subject of analysis consisted of 11 polymetallic ore deposits with different degrees of utilization and mining infrastructure which could be a subject of investment activities in Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro and Macedonia.
   In order to choose the best investment solution, a hierarchic model was built which took into account 5 main criteria and 15 partial criteria. These included in particular quantitative criteria, due to which the degree of subjectivism has been reduced. The main criteria included: geological and mining conditions, technical condition of the mining infrastructure, influence of the conducted mining activity on the environment, capital expenditure for particifiar stages of the investment and finally social and political background which described the investment risk.
   The assessment of influence of the mining plant on the environment was conducted using the influence matrix, so called Leopold's matrix. The method allowed for identifying influences which affected the environment's components and simultaneously permitted to quantify the degree of this influence.
   For each criterion, accordingly to the AHP method's principles, weights (priorities) have been calculated. The weights were then used for construction of aggregating indicators. The choice of the best investment solution was obtained thanks to the use of an aggregating indicator which is a measure of assessment of particular polymetallic ore deposits. The indicators were the base for creating a rating for the mining objects from the point of view of assessment for the investor's needs.

AB  - Coral reefs are in decline worldwide due to anthropogenic stressors including reductions in water and substratum quality. Dredging results in the mobilization of sediments, which can stress and kill corals via increasing turbidity, tissue damage and burial. The Particle Tracking Model (PTM) was applied to predict the potential impacts of dredging-associated sediment exposure on the coral reef ecosystems of Apra Harbor, Guam. The data were interpreted using maps of bathymetry and coral abundance and distribution in conjunction with impact parameters of suspended sediment concentration (turbidity) and sedimentation using defined coral response thresholds. The results are presented using a "stoplight" model of negligible or limited impacts to coral reefs (green), moderate stress from which some corals would be expected to recover while others would not (yellow) and severe stress resulting in mortality (red). The red conditions for sediment deposition rate and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) were defined as values exceeding 25 mg cm(-2) d(-1) over any 30 day window and >20 mg/l for any 18 days in any 90 day period over a column of water greater than 2 m, respectively. The yellow conditions were defined as values >10 mg cm(-2) d(-1) and <25 mg cm(-2) d(-1) over any 30 day period, and as 20% of 3 months' concentration exceeding 10 mg/l for the deposition and SSC, respectively. The model also incorporates the potential for cumulative effects on the assumption that even sub-lethal stress levels can ultimately lead to mortality in a multi-stressor system. This modeling approach can be applied by resource managers and regulatory agencies to support management decisions related to planning, site selection, damage reduction, and compensatory mitigation.

AB  - This manuscript surveys the literature on passive sampler methods (PSMs) used in contaminated sediments to assess the chemical activity of organic contaminants. The chemical activity in turn dictates the reactivity and bioavailability of contaminants in sediment. Approaches to measure specific binding of compounds to sediment components, for example, amorphous carbon or specific types of reduced carbon, and the associated partition coefficients are difficult to determine, particularly for native sediment. Thus, the development of PSMs that represent the chemical activity of complex compound-sediment interactions, expressed as the freely dissolved contaminant concentration in porewater (C-free), offer a better proxy for endpoints of concern, such as reactivity, bioaccumulation, and toxicity. Passive sampling methods have estimated C-free using both kinetic and equilibrium operating modes and used various polymers as the sorbing phase, for example, polydimethylsiloxane, polyethylene, and polyoxymethylene in various configurations, such as sheets, coated fibers, or vials containing thin films. These PSMs have been applied in laboratory exposures and field deployments covering a variety of spatial and temporal scales. A wide range of calibration conditions exist in the literature to estimate C-free, but consensus values have not been established. The most critical criteria are the partition coefficient between water and the polymer phase and the equilibrium status of the sampler. In addition, the PSM must not appreciably deplete C-free in the porewater. Some of the future challenges include establishing a standard approach for PSM measurements, correcting for nonequilibrium conditions, establishing guidance for selection and implementation of PSMs, and translating and applying data collected by PSMs. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2014;10:167-178.

AB  - Climate conditions during the early Holocene may have contributed to the spread of Old World agriculture from its area of birth, in the Fertile Crescent (Near East), west through the Mediterranean Basin. Reconstructing the specific environmental conditions existing in early agricultural settlements of the western Mediterranean may help to elucidate this point. The aim of this work was to gain information on past climate of one of the earliest agricultural settlements of the Iberian Peninsula, La Draga, a lacustrine site dating back to the 2nd half of the 8th millennium BP, in which post fragments of deciduous oak have been exceptionally well preserved in an anaerobic environment (sub-fossil wood). We studied the relationship between climate factors and carbon isotope discrimination (Delta C-13) and oxygen isotope composition (delta O-18) in wood a-cellulose from modern tree-ring series of Quercus humilis Mill. and Quercus petraea (Matt) Liebl. recovered from the area. Climatic responses observed in extant material were used to interpret the isotopic signal of wood a-cellulose extracted from sub-fossil wood. Results showed that water availability of late spring, early summer and September influences Delta C-13 and delta O-18, which allows their use as proxies for palaeoclimatic reconstruction. Differences between sub-fossil and extant samples in Delta C-13 (19.35 vs. 18.02%.) and delta O-18 (26.32 vs. 29.28%.) records suggest slightly lower temperatures and higher plant water availability than at present during the establishment of agriculture at the site. These results seem to disprove the existence of an environmental limitation preventing continuation of hunting and gathering activities as a cause for the adoption of agriculture in this early agricultural site on the Iberian Peninsula.

AB  - When exposed to hot (22-35 degrees C) and dry climatic conditions in the field during the final 4-6 weeks of pod filling, peanuts (Arachis hypogaea L.) can accumulate highly carcinogenic and immuno-suppressing aflatoxins. Forecasting of the risk posed by these conditions can assist in minimizing pre-harvest contamination. A model was therefore developed as part of the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) peanut module, which calculated an aflatoxin risk index (ART) using four temperature response functions when fractional available soil water was <0.20 and the crop was in the last 0.40 of the pod-filling phase. ARI explained 0.95 (P <= 0.05) of the variation in aflatoxin contamination, which varied from 0 to c. 800 mu g/kg in 17 large-scale sowings in tropical and four sowings in sub-tropical environments carried out in Australia between 13 November and 16 December 2007. ARI also explained 0.96 (P <= 0.01) of the variation in the proportion of aflatoxin-contaminated loads (>15 mu g/kg) of peanuts in the Kingaroy region of Australia during the period between the 1998/99 and 2007/08 seasons. Simulation of A RI using historical climatic data from 1890 to 2007 indicated a three-fold increase in its value since 1980 compared to the entire previous period. The increase was associated with increases in ambient temperature and decreases in rainfall. To facilitate routine monitoring of aflatoxin risk by growers in near real time, a web interface of the model was also developed. The ARI predicted using this interface for eight growers correlated significantly with the level of contamination in crops (r=095, P <= 0.01). These results suggest that ARI simulated by the model is a reliable indicator of aflatoxin contamination that can be used in aflatoxin research as well as a decision-support tool to monitor pre-harvest aflatoxin risk in peanuts.

AB  - We correlate the China loess and Antarctica ice records to address the inter-hemispheric climate link over the past 800 ka. The results show a broad coupling between Asian and Antarctic climates at the glacial-interglacial scale. However, a number of decoupled aspects are revealed, among which marine isotope stage (MIS) 13 exhibits a strong anomaly compared with the other interglacials. It is characterized by unusually positive benthic oxygen (delta O-18) and carbon isotope (delta C-13) values in the world oceans, cooler Antarctic temperature, lower summer sea surface temperature in the South Atlantic, lower CO2 and CH4 concentrations, but by extremely strong Asian, Indian and African summer monsoons, weakest Asian winter monsoon, and lowest Asian dust and iron fluxes. Pervasive warm conditions were also evidenced by the records from northern high-latitude regions. These consistently indicate a warmer Northern Hemisphere and a cooler Southern Hemisphere, and hence a strong asymmetry of hemispheric climates during MIS-13. Similar anomalies of lesser extents also occurred during MIS-11 and MIS-5e. Thus, MIS-13 provides a case that the Northern Hemisphere experienced a substantial warming under relatively low concentrations of greenhouse gases. It suggests that the global climate system possesses a natural variability that is not predictable from the simple response of northern summer insolation and atmospheric CO2 changes. During MIS-13, both hemispheres responded in different ways leading to anomalous continental, marine and atmospheric conditions at the global scale. The correlations also suggest that the marine delta O-18 record is not always a reliable indicator of the northern ice-volume changes, and that the asymmetry of hemispheric climates is one of the prominent factors control-ling the strength of Asian, Indian and African monsoon circulations, most likely through modulating the position of the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and land-sea thermal contrasts.

AB  - Vegetation dynamics of three forest communities were studied by resampling of releves recorded in the 1970s in the Bohemian Forest (Sumava Mountains). Results of multivariate analysis (RDA) confirmed significant time changes in species composition of the climax (Calamagrostio-Piceetum) and waterlogged (Bazzanio-Piceetum) spruce forests. The changes in the sphagnum-rich waterlogged spruce forests (Sphagno-Piceetum) are close to the level of significance. The main vegetation changes are represented by a decrease in cover and/or frequency of hygrophilous or sciophilous species (e.g. Athyrium distentifolium, Oxalis acetosella) in climax spruce forests, and an abundant increase of species, indicating a preference to drier stands or better light conditions (e.g. Calamagrostis villosa, Vaccinium vitis-idaea or Avenella flexuosa), in waterlogged spruce forests. We also found a higher proportion of meadow species (e.g. Anthoxanthum odoratum, Festuca rubra or Luzula multiflora) in the newly recorded releves from waterlogged forests. Analysis of species number per plot showed a remarkable shift to species-rich communities, especially in waterlogged stands.
   We tried to find the possible factors responsible for the observed changes. Unfortunately, only indirect measurement of environmental factors using Ellenberg's indicator values could be used and did not yield sufficient results. Thus, the changes observed in climax spruce forests were ascribed mainly to a decrease in canopy cover, which was directly estimated. In waterlogged forests, a complex of several general factors, which influence the climax spruce forest, had to be taken into account, such as: (i) a decrease in atmospheric acidification during the last 10-15 years and subsequent improvement in soil conditions, especially in waterlogged stands; (ii) fragmentation of forests as a result of bark-beetles attack; (iii) climate warming documented by long-term local meteorological measurements.

AB  - Monitoring programs for intrinsic bioremediation of fuel hydrocarbons require indicators that can convincingly demonstrate in situ metabolism. In this evaluation of potential indicators of in situ anaerobic alkylbenzene metabolism, laboratory and field data are reviewed for two classes of aromatic acids: (i) benzylsuccinate, E-phenylitaconate, and their methyl homologs, and (ii) benzoate, and methyl-, dimethyl-, and trimethylbenzoates. The review includes previously unpublished field data from a hydrocarbon-contaminated site in Fallon (Nevada), at which both classes of metabolites were detected in groundwater. The two classes of compounds were evaluated with respect to specificity (i.e., unique biochemical relationship to a specific alkylbenzene), stability, and generation as degradation intermediates versus dead-end products; recent developments in the biochemistry of anaerobic toluene and xylene degradation were incorporated in this evaluation. In general, benzylsuccinates/E-phenylitaconates are superior to benzoates in terms of their very high specificity to their parent hydrocarbons and their lack of commercial and industrial sources. They are also uniquely indicative of anaerobic conditions. All of the benzoates, benzylsuccinates, and E-phenylitaconates are relatively stable chemically and (with the exception of benzoate) biologically under anaerobic conditions, based on the limited data available. Although benzoate, benzylsuccinate, and E-phenylitaconate are intermediates of anaerobic toluene mineralization to carbon dioxide, their methyl homologs can be either mineralization intermediates or cometabolic dead-end products of alkylbenzenes, depending on the bacteria involved. Benzoates are far more commonly reported in field studies of hydrocarbon-contaminated aquifers than are benzylsuccinates and E-phenylitaconates, although it is not clear whether this is an accurate representation of the relative occurrence of these metabolites at contaminated sites, or whether it instead reflects the limited range of target analytes used in most field studies to date.

AB  - Coastal morphodynamics and environmental changes have been obviously altered by global warming, sea-level fluctuations, and human activities. Palynological analysis is one of the most important tools for providing information on vegetation, climate, and environmental change, which can be relatively sensitive indicators of human activity during the Holocene. However, Holocene coastal morphodynamics and palynological evidence from the Pearl River Delta and coastal areas has not been sufficiently studied. In this paper, we carry out analyses using detailed grain-size and palynological records of pollen, spores, freshwater algae, and marine dinoflagellate cysts from Borehole QZK13 in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), southern China. The results show information relating coastal morphodynamics, vegetation evolution, climate changes, and anthropogenic activities during the Holocene based on radiocarbon chronology. In general, the PRE experienced marine transgressive processes; sea-level and the coastline tended to migrate landward between 10,700 and 4250 cal yr BP. Meanwhile, abundant arboreal pollen (mainly Castanopsis, Quercus-evergreen, Oleaceae, and Castanea) and small amounts of non-arboreal pollen (mainly Poaceae, Cyperaceae, and Artemisia) were observed in Borehole QZK13, which suggests that subtropical evergreen broadleaved forests were distributed throughout the PRE and adjacent areas, and relatively warm and moist climatic conditions were present during the early-middle Holocene. After that, there were relatively cool and wet climatic conditions, and marine regressive processes occurred in the PRE during the Late Holocene (ca. 4250-960 cal yr BP) indicated by an abrupt increase in aquatic herbs and Dicranopteris. Moreover, we hypothesize that the Neolithic "cultural fault" in the PRE is likely related to frequent storm surges induced by extreme typhoon events that occurred ca. 3000-2700 yr BP.

AB  - Climate changes comprise increasing global temperature and water cycle deregulation (precipitation storms and long dry seasons). Many affected ecosystems are located within the Mediterranean basin, where cork oak (Quercus suber L.) is one of the most important forest ecosystems. Despite cork oak tolerance to drought, the decrease of water availability and increase of temperature is causing a serious decline of cork oak populations. In the present work, the bacterial community of cork oak soils was assessed by metabarcoding using Illumina Miseq. Soils from seven independent cork oak forests were collected along a climate gradient. In all forest soils, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were the richest and more abundant bacteria. Acidobacteria also presented a high relative abundance, and Chloroflexi was a rich phylum. The soil bacterial community diversity and composition was strongly affected by the climatic region where cork oak resides and specific bacterial taxa were differently affected by precipitation and temperature. Accordingly, cork oak bacterial communities clustered into three distinct groups, related with humid, sub-humid and arid/semi-arid climates. Driest and warmer forests presented more diverse bacterial communities than humid and coolest forests. However, driest climates presented more homogenous bacterial communities among forests than humid climates. Climate (mainly precipitation) revealed to be the strongest driver leading to significant variations of bacterial community profiles. The most impacted bacterial taxa by climatic variables were Proteobacteria, in particular Gammaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes. Humid forests presented mainly Acidobacteria as good indicators of climate, whereas Actinobacteria members were better indicators for arid forests (mainly Gaiellales and Frankiales). Some indicator species for different climate conditions were members of the bacterial core of cork oak stands (7% of the total bacterial community). Taken together, different microbiomes were selected by the climate conditions in cork oak stands along a climate gradient and might provide the key to forest sustainability in times of global warming.

AB  - A large-scale cable-stayed bridge in the state of New South Wales, Australia, has been extensively instrumented with an array of accelerometer, strain gauge, and environmental sensors. The real-time continuous response of the bridge has been collected since July 2016. This study aims at condition assessment of this bridge by investigating three aspects of structural health monitoring including damage detection, damage localization, and damage severity assessment. A novel data analysis algorithm based on incremental multi-way data analysis is proposed to analyze the dynamic response of the bridge. This method applies incremental tensor analysis for data fusion and feature extraction, and further uses one-class support vector machine on this feature to detect anomalies. A total of 15 different damage scenarios were investigated; damage was physically simulated by locating stationary vehicles with different masses at various locations along the span of the bridge to change the condition of the bridge. The effect of damage on the fundamental frequency of the bridge was investigated and a maximum change of 4.4% between the intact and damage states was observed which corresponds to a small severity damage. Our extensive investigations illustrate that the proposed technique can provide reliable characterization of damage in this cable-stayed bridge in terms of detection, localization and assessment. The contribution of the work is threefold; first, an extensive structural health monitoring system was deployed on a cable-stayed bridge in operation; second, an incremental tensor analysis was proposed to analyze time series responses from multiple sensors for online damage identification; and finally, the robustness of the proposed method was validated using extensive field test data by considering various damage scenarios in the presence of environmental variabilities.

AB  - A number of studies have been conducted to enhance the pedestrian detection accuracy of intelligent surveillance systems. However, detecting pedestrians under outdoor conditions is a challenging problem due to the varying lighting, shadows, and occlusions. In recent times, a growing number of studies have been performed on visible light camera-based pedestrian detection systems using a convolutional neural network (CNN) in order to make the pedestrian detection process more resilient to such conditions. However, visible light cameras still cannot detect pedestrians during nighttime, and are easily affected by shadows and lighting. There are many studies on CNN-based pedestrian detection through the use of far-infrared (FIR) light cameras (i.e., thermal cameras) to address such difficulties. However, when the solar radiation increases and the background temperature reaches the same level as the body temperature, it remains difficult for the FIR light camera to detect pedestrians due to the insignificant difference between the pedestrian and non-pedestrian features within the images. Researchers have been trying to solve this issue by inputting both the visible light and the FIR camera images into the CNN as the input. This, however, takes a longer time to process, and makes the system structure more complex as the CNN needs to process both camera images. This research adaptively selects a more appropriate candidate between two pedestrian images from visible light and FIR cameras based on a fuzzy inference system (FIS), and the selected candidate is verified with a CNN. Three types of databases were tested, taking into account various environmental factors using visible light and FIR cameras. The results showed that the proposed method performs better than the previously reported methods.

AB  - Risk-based analysis provides an economically defensible framework for determining the optimal design of hydrosystems with the minimum total cost including project cost (installation plus operation/maintenance/repair) and failure-induced expected damage cost. However, failure-related damage function with good quality may not be widely available in practical applications for assessing annual expected damage cost. In addition to aleatory uncertainty representing natural randomness of hydrologic events, there exists a variety of epistemic uncertainties due to knowledge deficiency from the use of inadequate models, inaccurate model parameters, etc. The presence of epistemic uncertainties could affect the loads and capacity of hydrosystem facilities which, in turn, would affect the value of failure-induced physical performance indicators. Using detention basin design as an example, this paper presents a systematic framework to integrate aleatory and epistemic uncertainties for the risk-based design under the condition of no monetary damage function. For illustration, aleatory uncertainty due to randomness of rainfall intensity and epistemic uncertainties caused by runoff coefficient and curve number are considered in risk-based design of an example detention basin.
   Plain Language Summary Due to the presence of uncertainties from natural randomness of hydrologic events and knowledge deficiency, risk-based procedure provides a economically and logically defensible framework for determining the optimal design of hydrosystems with the minimum total cost including project cost and failure induced damage cost. However, such framework requires failure related damage information with good quality, which may not be widely available in practical applications. To extend the generality and usefulness the risk-based procedure, this paper presents a viable framework to integrate aleatory and epistemic uncertainties in risk-based design under the condition of without monetary damage information. Design of stormwater detention basin is used as an example to illustrate the methodology.

AB  - The European Union (EU) chemicals regulation Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) requires a hazardous substance registration to identify the uses of a substance and the corresponding conditions of safe use. This requirement includes a human and an environmental safety assessment. Exposure scenarios are developed and employed for estimating emissions resulting from the uses of hazardous substances. To support the environmental assessments, the REACH guidance documents define 22 environmental release categories (ERCs) with conservative release factors (RFs) to water, air, and soil. Several industry associations target the ERCs to more specific uses and respective emission scenarios to enable more realistic emission estimations. They have developed more than 190 specific ERCs (SPERCs) as standardized descriptions of operational conditions (OCs) and risk management measures (RMMs). SPERCs reflect the current good practice and are documented in factsheets. These factsheets contain the information necessary for environmental emission modeling. Key parameters are the substance use rate, the efficiency of the risk management measures (if applicable), and the RFs. These parameters can be based on literature or measured company data or are justified by qualitative arguments. The majority of SPERCs have been implemented as realistic worst-case emission values in screening-level chemical safety assessment (CSA) tools. Three regulatory reviews in Europe have established requirements for documenting the SPERCs and for justifying the RFs. In addition, each of the reviews included recommendations for improving the SPERCs. The latest review proposed a condensed factsheet that focuses on the essentials for exposure assessment and subsequent communication in safety data sheets. It is complemented with a background document for providing details on the emission scenarios and justifications. In the EU the SPERCs will be further progressed in a consensus process using the multi-stakeholder expert network on exposure scenarios. The SPERCs have the potential to be used in environmental risk assessments within other regulatory frameworks or in other geographical regions. (C) 2015 SETAC

AB  - High ambient heat and humidity have profound effects on the production, health, profitability, and welfare of dairy cattle. To describe the relationship between summer temperature and relative humidity in the barn and determine the appropriateness of using meteorological station data as a surrogate for on-farm environmental monitoring, a study was conducted on 48 farms in Ontario, Canada, over the summer (May through September) of 2013. Within-barn environmental conditions were recorded using remote data loggers. These values were compared with those of the closest official meteorological station. In addition, farm-level characteristics and heat-abatement strategies were recorded for each farm. Environmental readings within the barn were significantly higher than those of the closest meteorological station; however, this relatioriship varied greatly by herd. Daily temperature-humidity index (THI) values within the barn tended to be 1 unit higher than those of the closest meteorological station. Numerically, 1.5 times more mean daily THI readings were in excess of 68 (heat stress threshold for lactating dairy cows) in the barn, relative to the closest meteorological station. In addition, tiestalls, herds that were allowed access to pasture, and herds that had no permanent cooling strategy for their cows had the highest mean and maximum daily THI values. Minimum daily THI values were almost 4 units higher for tiestall relative to freestall herds. Overall, due to farm-specific and unpredictable variability in magnitude of environmental differences between on-farm and meteorological station readings, researchers attempting to study the effects of environment on dairy cows should not use readings from meteorological stations because these will often underestimate the level of heat stress to which cows are exposed.

AB  - Edible oil is easily contaminated with phthalic acid esters (PAEs). Conventional procedures to analyze individual PAEs require very rigorous experimental conditions that are extremely labor-intensive due to significant procedural contaminations generated by the ubiquitous presence of PAEs in the laboratory environment. In this study, a rapid screening method for PAEs in edible oil was successfully developed. Using a phase-transfer catalyst (terabutylammonium bromide) during oil/water biphasic base hydrolysis of PAEs, the hydrolysis time was decreased from a previously reported time of 20h to 10 min (80 degrees C). The resulting phthalic acid in the acidified hydrolysate was extracted with 600 mu L of tributyl phosphate and then analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in 6 min. Parameters affecting the hydrolysis of PAEs and the extraction of phthalic acid were optimized, and the analytical method was validated. No obvious matrix effect existed in the edible oils whether an external or internal standard method was used. The detection limit was 1.0 mu mol kg(-1), and the quantification limit was 1.3 mu mol kg(-1). The recovery rates varied from 86 to 107% with relative standard deviations equal to or lower than 9.9% in all of the tested conditions. Twenty-six samples were analyzed, and the background corrected total PAE content was found to be in the range of <LOD-52.1 mu mol kg(-1). This fast and reliable method was not only a practical way to screen oil samples but can also be used as an indicator of false positive or overestimated results in conventional analysis of PAEs. In addition, it presents a new and promising methodology to deal with oil matrices. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - For most crops, like Capsicum, their diversity remains under-researched for traits of interest for food, nutrition and other purposes. A small investment in screening this diversity for a wide range of traits is likely to reveal many traditional varieties with distinguished values. One objective of this study was to demonstrate, with Capsicum as model crop, the application of indicators of phenotypic and geographic diversity as effective criteria for selecting promising genebank accessions for multiple uses from crop centers of diversity. A second objective was to evaluate the expression of biochemical and agromorphological properties of the selected Capsicum accessions in different conditions. Four steps were involved: 1) Develop the necessary diversity by expanding genebank collections in Bolivia and Peru; 2) Establish representative subsets of similar to 100 accessions for biochemical screening of Capsicum fruits; 3) Select promising accessions for different uses after screening; and 4) Examine how these promising accessions express biochemical and agromorphological properties when grown in different environmental conditions. The Peruvian Capsicum collection now contains 712 accessions encompassing all five domesticated species (C. annuum, C. chinense, C. frutescens, C. baccatum, and C. pubescens). The collection in Bolivia now contains 487 accessions, representing all five domesticates plus four wild taxa (C. baccatum var. baccatum, C. caballeroi, C. cardenasii, and C. eximium). Following the biochemical screening, 44 Bolivian and 39 Peruvian accessions were selected as promising, representing wide variation in levels of antioxidant capacity, capsaicinoids, fat, flavonoids, polyphenols, quercetins, tocopherols, and color. In Peru, 23 promising accessions performed well in different environments, while each of the promising Bolivian accessions only performed well in a certain environment. Differences in Capsicum diversity and local contexts led to distinct outcomes in each country. In Peru, mild landraces with high values in health-related attributes were of interest to entrepreneurs. In Bolivia, wild Capsicum have high commercial demand.

AB  - Background
   The incidence of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) in children varies dramatically between countries. Part of the explanation must be sought in environmental factors. Increasingly, public databases provide information on country-to-country environmental differences.
   Methods
   Information on the incidence of T1D and country characteristics were searched for in the 194 World Health Organization (WHO) member countries. T1D incidence was extracted from a systematic literature review of all papers published between 1975 and 2014, including the 2013 update from the International Diabetes Federation. The information on country characteristics was searched in public databases. We considered all indicators with a plausible relation with T1D and those previously reported as correlated with T1D, and for which there was less than 5% missing values. This yielded 77 indicators. Four domains were explored: Climate and environment, Demography, Economy, and Health Conditions. Bonferroni correction to correct false discovery rate (FDR) was used in bivariate analyses. Stepwise multiple regressions, served to identify independent predictors of the geographical variation of T1D.
   Findings
   T1D incidence was estimated for 80 WHO countries. Forty-one significant correlations between T1D and the selected indicators were found. Stepwise Multiple Linear Regressions performed in the four explored domains indicated that the percentages of variance explained by the indicators were respectively 35% for Climate and environment, 33% for Demography, 45% for Economy, and 46% for Health conditions, and 51% in the Final model, where all variables selected by domain were considered. Significant environmental predictors of the country-to-country variation of T1D incidence included UV radiation, number of mobile cellular subscriptions in the country, health expenditure per capita, hepatitis B immunization and mean body mass index (BMI).
   Conclusions
   The increasing availability of public databases providing information in all global environmental domains should allow new analyses to identify further geographical, behavioral, social and economic factors, or indicators that point to latent causal factors of T1D.

AB  - Composting and vermicomposting are interesting options for utilisation in restoration and improvement of weathered and infertile tropical soils. The aim of this study was to assess quality of composts and vermicomposts produced from cattle manure (CM) and green wastes (GW) blended at different ratios under tropical conditions. Chemical, biochemical, and biological indicators were used to identify the role of earthworms and the factors affecting organic matter (OM) stability and nutrient balance in the thermophilic (days 0-65) and stabilisation (days 66-183) phases. Total carbon (C) losses averaged 55% and were greater during vermicomposting and for products with a high GW content. One-third of C losses occurred during the stabilisation phase. This phase presented a high level of C mineralisation, which would be linked to high ambient temperatures (similar to 30 degrees C). Although OM content was similar for all of the final products, respiration measurements indicated that OM stability was greater for vermicomposts. These results indicated that humification and OM decomposition occurred simultaneously during vermicomposting. The material source ratio did not affect the OM biodegradability of the final products. No losses were observed for phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg). However, high potassium (K) (45%) and nitrogen (25%) losses were detected and were higher during vermicomposting and for the products with a high GW content. Final vermicomposts were enriched in P, Ca, and Mg, and slightly depleted in K compared with normal composts. Nitrogen content was similar for both composting methods. Plant response to amendment addition was higher for intermediate rates of GW and CM (e.g. 40-60% for CM), with no differences between composts and vermicomposts. The results of this study indicated that vermicomposting was a process that favoured OM stabilisation, which is a key factor for the adoption of this practice in the tropics.

AB  - Tropical cloud forests have received increasing attention because of their significance for freshwater supply. This study aimed to understand hydro-meteorological gradients in relation to spatial changes in forest structure in north-western Costa Rica. Seven climate stations (measuring rainfall, horizontal precipitation, throughfall, temperature and soil moisture) were installed along a 2.5 km transect between 1200 and 1500 m.a.s.l. on the Atlantic (windward) slope and the Pacific (leeward) slope of the Tilaran mountains. Forest structure was investigated on seven 10 x 50 m plots. Epiphytic vegetation was assessed on six trees at 1450 m and at 1200 m on the Pacific slope. Annual rainfall ranged from 3690 mm on the leeward slope to 6390 mm on the windward side. Horizontal precipitation was 3560 mm at the ridge, where it exceeded rainfall during the dry season, compared to 330 mm and 28 mm at the lowest windward and leeward plots, respectively. Throughfall remained below rainfall on the lower slopes but exceeded rainfall on the ridge. Soil water content ranged between 70% and 80% on the ridge top, where waterlogging occurred frequently. The studied forests were classified as lower montane rain forest, lower montane cloud forest and elfin cloud forest. The greatest canopy heights and basal areas occurred on the leeward slope between 1200 and 1450 m and at the lowest windward plot. Tree heights remained below 15 m on the ridge, where stilt roots occurred frequently. Near the ridge, epiphyte abundance and species richness were greater, compared to the lower leeward slope. These findings prove the importance of horizontal precipitation in the study area, confirm the important role of epiphytes as indicators for moisture gradients and elucidate the variability of forest structure under the given biophysical conditions.

AB  - Soil food webs cycle nutrients and regulate parasites and pathogens, services essential for both agricultural productivity and ecosystem health. Nematodes provide useful indicators of soil food web dynamics. This study was conducted to determine if nematode soil food web indicators and crop yield can be enhanced by combinations of cover crops in a conservation tillage system. The effects of three cover crop treatments (vetch/pea, oat/wheat and oat/wheat/pea/vetch) with low, medium and high C:N and a bare fallow control were investigated in Davis, CA. Nematode fauna, Soil Properties and plant productivity were measured. Soil food web indices, including the Enrichment index (EI), Structure Index (SI), Basal Index (BI), and Channel Index (CI), based on the composition of nematode assemblages, were calculated to infer soil food web condition. Cover cropped tomato/corn rotations had twice the number of enrichment opportunist bacterial feeding nematodes, active participants in nitrogen mineralization, than fallowed tomato/corn rotations (opportunist bacterial feeders = 163 versus 98). In winter fallowed plots food webs were basal, common in disturbed, nutrient-poor conditions (BI = 37). Total number of enrichment opportunist nematodes, soil NH4-N levels, and inferred nitrogen mineralization, were higher in cover crop treatments with low to mid C:N ratios. Omnivore and predator nematodes were scarce, averaging less than 6 nematodes 100 g(-1) in all treatments. in year one, plant productivity was highest after fallow. In contrast, in year two productivity was highest after cover crops with high nitrogen content and productivity significantly correlated with the structure of the soil fauna. Monitoring the abundance of enrichment opportunists may provide managers with a new tool to evaluate soil food web nitrogen mineralization and plant productivity. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Biological systems are interacting, molecular networks in which genetic variation contributes to phenotypic heterogeneity. This heterogeneity is traditionally modelled as a dichotomous trait (e. g. affected vs. non-affected). This is far too simplistic considering the complexity and genetic variations of such networks.
   Methods: In this study on type 2 diabetes mellitus, heterogeneity was resolved in a latent class framework combined with structural equation modelling using phenotypic indicators of distinct physiological processes. We modelled the clinical condition "the metabolic syndrome", which is known to be a heterogeneous and polygenic condition with a clinical endpoint (type 2 diabetes mellitus). In the model presented here, genetic factors were not included and no genetic model is assumed except that genes operate in networks. The impact of stratification of the study population on genetic interaction was demonstrated by analysis of several genes previously associated with the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
   Results: The analysis revealed the existence of 19 distinct subpopulations with a different propensity to develop diabetes mellitus within a large healthy study population. The allocation of subjects into subpopulations was highly accurate with an entropy measure of nearly 0.9. Although very few gene variants were directly associated with metabolic syndrome in the total study sample, almost one third of all possible epistatic interactions were highly significant. In particular, the number of interactions increased after stratifying the study population, suggesting that interactions are masked in heterogenous populations. In addition, the genetic variance increased by an average of 35-fold when analysed in the subpopulations.
   Conclusion: The major conclusions from this study are that the likelihood of detecting true association between genetic variants and complex traits increases tremendously when studied in physiological homogenous subpopulations and on inclusion of epistasis in the analysis, whereas epistasis (i.e. genetic networks) is ubiquitous and should be the basis in modelling any biological process.

AB  - Intertidal cohesive estuarine sediments frequently support extensive microphytobenthic biofilms, which are usually dominated by epipelic (motile) diatoms. The distribution of different diatom taxa Varies along estuarine gradients, but it is not clear what the causative factors are in determining these patterns. In many estuaries, salinity covaries with other environmental gradients, particularly with nutrient concentrations when the river is the main nutrient source. Autecological information is required to aid interpretation of these field distributions. In this study the maximum specific growth rate (mu) and stationary phase biomass of four common taxa of estuarine epipelic diatoms (Navicula phyllepta, N. perminuta, N, salinarum and Cylindrotheca closterium) were measured in axenic unialgal cultures grown under a range of nitrogen and salinity regimes. All three Navicula species and two different clones of C. closterium showed significant differences in their response to a range of ammonium (10-4000 mu M) and nitrate (10-2000 mu M) concentrations across a salinity range of 10-35%. Growth rates of N. phyllepta were significantly lower at ammonium concentrations >400 mu M, but the other three taxa showed little evidence of ammonium toxicity, even at concentrations >1 mM. On the basis of the response of each species, the following putative ranking of preferences for inorganic nitrogen concentrations (lowest to highest, with salinity optima in parentheses) was constructed: N. phyllepta (10-20%,) - N. perminuta (10-30%) - N. salinarum (20-35%)/C. closterium (clone 1, 10-25%, done 2, 25-35%). Such a ranking should be interpreted cautiously, as interclonal differences and adaptation to local environmental conditions can alter the preferences of taxa. These autecological data are partially supported by previously published data on field distribution, and suggest that certain taxa may have value as trophic indicator species.

AB  - The interphase distribution and forms of gold occurrence in minerals are studied by hydrothermal experiments in the presence of typical gold-accompanying elements: As, Se, and Te. It is shown that the geochemical role of As and Se differs from that of Te: arsenic and selenium tend to elevate the Au content in the fluid phase giving rise to the formation of <<invisible gold>> in coexisting pyrite as the consequence of this elevation, whereas Te elevated the apparent distribution coefficient of gold between pyrite crystals and fluid phase. That is why As and Se could be considered as gold-guide elements which provide the gold transfer as combined complexes, so these elements may be used as indicators of gold ore deposits. High values of the apparent distribution coefficients of Au between pyrrhotite (magnetite) and fluid together with low gold contents in these minerals even if they occur in gold-bearing ore deposits shaw a rather different chemical conditions during crystallization of these minerals and gold-containing pyrite indicating low activities of Au-bearing species during crystallization of pyrrhotite and magnetite. Rather, the natural pyrite crystals with high concentrations of <<invisible gold>> might be formed from solutions with Au contents of about 3-7 ppm. The chloride complexes are unable to provide such high contents which, alternatively, could easily be provided by gold-guide elements, primarily As. It is confirmed that the formation of <<invisible gold>> in minerals is affected by unstable intermediate phases and compounds which contain gold-guide elements. The process of invisible gold formation should be most effective under low temperature conditions where the crystallization passes via intermediate phases, under high supersaturations giving rise to development of crystal microstructure.

AB  - This paper reports on climate-induced growth changes in relict, low-altitude mountain pines (Pinus uncinata Mill. ex. Mirb.) from two refugia with cold microclimates located in the Northern French Alps. The P. uncinata stands analyzed grow at the lower bound of their ecological limit and are thus thought to be sensitive indicators of ongoing climate change. Using dendroecological approaches, we compare tree-ring growth at two closely spaced low-altitude stands in the Chartreuse massif (French Alps): La Plagne and Cirque de Bresson. La Plagne is a N-NW-exposed, ventilated slope with cold air circulating in the scree during summer, and the presence of sporadic permafrost as well as ground overcooling, whereas Cirque de Bresson is located on a small, S-exposed fan with sporadic avalanche activity. At both sites, growth responses of P. uncinata to changes in twentieth and twenty-first centuries temperature and precipitation conditions were investigated by means of moving correlation analyses. At Cirque de Bresson, a significant and rapid decline in tree-ring widths has been observed since the early 1990s. We attribute this decline to (i) increasing air temperatures at the beginning of the growing season (May-June) as well as to (ii) a decrease in soil water potential. At La Plagne, we do not detect any significant trend between the higher summer temperatures and tree growth, presumably as a result of the circulation of cold air in the scree slope, which is thought to maintain fresh and humid soil conditions and therefore favor tree growth. These forest stands provide prime examples on how dendroecology can contribute to the study of the dynamics and local variability of tree growth and climate change in relict forest populations with high ecological and conservation values.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effects of supplemental Bacillus subtilis (BS, 0.5 x 10(11) CFU/day), injectable vitamin E and selenium (ES, 1000 mg alpha -tocopherol acetate and 10 mg sodium selenite), or both during the transition period on health parameters and the incidence of retained fetal membranes (RFM) of dairy cows under tropical conditions (average temperature humidity index = 77.0). Thirty-two crossbred Holstein-Friesian cows were used in a randomized design trial with a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Cows were randomly assigned to one of four treatments, including no supplementation (CON), single intramuscular injection of ES on day - 21 before the expected calving date (ES), daily oral supplementation of BS between day - 21 and day 21 relative to calving, or both ES and BS. Body condition score (BCS) and blood samples were collected on days - 28, - 14, 0, 14, and 28 relative to calving. Mean concentrations of corpuscular hemoglobin were higher (33.12 vs 34.03 g/dL, p = 0.06) and platelets were lower (380.97 vs 302.32 x 10(3)/mu L, p = 0.10) with ES than without ES. Cows fed supplemental BS had lower concentrations of creatinine and albumin and tended to have lower AST and beta -hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) levels. However, concentrations of glucose were higher for cows fed BS than for those without BS. No differences in the incidence of RFM were observed. In summary, supplemental B. subtilis could reduce indicators of negative energy balance by increasing glucose and lowering BHBA and improve health parameters by keeping WBCs and monocytes in a healthy range during the transition period.

AB  - The aim of the survey was to study the effect of heat stress (HS) on health lipid indices in milk of Holstein-Friesian cows. The study was conducted in a cattle farm with Holstein-Friesian cows in the region of Karnobat (Southeastern Bulgaria) in 2018. Cows were housed in semi-open free stall dairy barn, fed year-round ad libitum with a total mixed ration. The study included 22 cows on different parities studied in two periods - at thermo-neutral environment conditions and at heat stress, respectively, May and August. Extraction of milk fat was performed by the Rose-Gottlieb method. Conditions of HS lead to changes in the values of health lipid indices associated with a decrease in the values of Atherogenic index (AI), Thrombogenic index (TI), Lipid Preventive Score (LPS) and Desaturase (18) index (DI 18) and an increase in Health promoting Index (HPI), polyunsaturated fatty acids/saturated fatty acids (PUFA/SFA), unsaturated fatty acids/saturated fatty acids (UFA/SFA), mono unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), Desaturase (16) index (DI 16) and hypocholesterolaemic/ hypercholesterolaemic ratio (h/H). Increasing the Temperature-humidity index (THI) above 72, results in a decrease in the AI values and an increase in those of the PUFA/SFA. The values of health lipid indices showed a moderate positive correlation with those of THI (PUFA/SFA - 0.36) with rectal temperature (h/H, MUFA/SFA, UFA/SFA) r(p) from 0.36 to 0.37, and with respiratory rate (h/ H, PUFA/SFA), r(p) of 0.33 and 0.31, respectively. Under the influence of heat stress, changes in the metabolic processes occur in the body of dairy cows leading to changes in the fatty acid content of milk related to the improvement of health lipid indices in terms of human health due to an increase in UFA and reduction in SFA.

AB  - The likely increase in extreme rainfall events (ERE) due to climate change, particularly associated with tropical storms and hurricanes, threatens coastal communities worldwide. A model based on socioeconomic and environmental indicators was used to assess and categorize vulnerability to ERE at the municipal level, in Sinaloa, a coastal state of northwest Mexico. Coastal vulnerability was assessed based on a system of indicators, integrated into five criteria within two higher categories: response capacity (Economic conditions, Social development, and Living standards), and severity (Geographic exposure and Risk intensifiers). From a preliminary set of 25 indicators, three of them were selected by criterion using the Delphi method, and their values were later standardized from 0 (low) to 1 (high) on a vulnerability scale. Both criteria and indicators were weighted following an analytical hierarchical process (AHP), resulting in the main determinants of vulnerability being Geographic exposure (0.43) and Economic conditions (0.34). This first approach to a vulnerability assessment using standardized values showed that Guasave (to the north) and Escuinapa (to the south) are the most vulnerable municipalities, scoring >9.0 (with 15 being the maximum score). In contrast, Culiacan and San Ignacio, both central municipalities, ranked as the least vulnerable (<5.5). A further analysis using the integral vulnerability index (IVI) corroborated Guasave (3.73) and Escuinapa (3.15) as the most vulnerable, discarding latitudinal changes as a possible promotor of vulnerability. Although the coastal population was the main determinant of vulnerability (median = 0.57), other indicators associated with severity as well as response capacity were responsible for the increase in IVI scores. This study highlights the need for an integrated vulnerability analysis to support public policies and the decision-making process to protect coastal communities from environmental climate change.

AB  - In order to increase understanding of spatial uncertainty in subsurface conditions for problems in geological and geotechnical engineering, this study develops a geostatistical approach for incorporating a geologist's interpreted cross-section to quantify spatial uncertainty of lithology. In this work, the Sequential Indicator Cosimulation (COSISM) algorithm and the information theory concept of entropy are utilized to generate uncertainty models. A sensitivity analysis is used to study how both borehole data and the cross-section are incorporated into the algorithm, which is quantified using entropy as a metric for uncertainty in geologic unit boundary locations. A verification methodology is then developed to identify the most appropriate combination of input parameters for combining these two data types; recommendations from the verification methodology are made by comparing the calculated entropy to accuracy at the global scale on a point-by-point basis. This methodology is then used to investigate how calibrated input parameters vary due to differences in the input cross-section based on different levels of understanding of the subsurface geology by iteratively providing a geologist with additional borehole data after a cross-section is developed. Results show that two of the parameters, variogram range and the number of conditioning data, can be used to most directly reflect geologist understanding in the simulations. Finally, this study provides guidelines for incorporating a geologist's understanding of a geological environment into this modeling framework, as results show cross-sections that are locally accurate are better represented by different parameters than cross-sections that are not locally accurate but are globally accurate. These guidelines are intended to aid geologists and engineers in understanding how to incorporate a geologist's interpretation of the subsurface lithology or categorical geotechnical parameters at a particular worksite into a structured geostatistical framework.

AB  - The Klink coalfield is located in the south-westernmost part of the Soma Basin in western Turkey and hosts all three Miocene coal seams (from bottom to top: kM2, kM3 and kP1). This study presents the coal-petrographical, mineralogical and organic geochemical features of samples collected from two deep cores. Samples from seam kM2 generally display low ash yields and high TOC content, whereas the kM3 and kP1 seams are characterized by relatively high ash yields and low TOC values. Furthermore, total S content of the kP1 is very high (up to 7.0%, on dry basis). The maceral composition, the coal facies diagrams, and the distributions of n-alkanes and diterpenoids indicate changes of depositional conditions and vegetation in the palaeomires of the kM2 seam during Early Miocene. The precursor peat of kM2 seam started accumulating under limnotelmatic conditions followed by pure telmatic ones. Consequently, initial mixed vegetation was replaced by a conifer-dominant assemblage in the palaeomires, in the upper parts of the kM2 seam.
   The coal facies indices and high concentrations of n-alkanes, along with the relatively low di-/ (di + tri-) terpenoid ratios, are indicators of the higher contribution of herbaceous species and minor abundance of conifers in the palaeomires of kM3 and kPl seams. Nevertheless, the mineralogical composition of the kM3 and kPl seams indicate increased clastic input and alkalinity in the palaeomires that could reduce preservation of organic matter. Thus, high ash yields and low TOC were obtained from these seams. In addition, sulphate-rich water supply along with synchronous pyroclastic air-borne input into the palaeomires caused elevated total S content of the kP1 seam.

AB  - Marine multicellular organisms in composition with their associated microbiota representing metaorganisms are confronted with constantly changing environmental conditions. In 2110, the seawater temperature is predicted to be increased by similar to 5 degrees C, and the atmospheric carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO(2)) is expected to reach approximately 1000 ppm. In order to assess the response of marine metaorganisms to global changes, e.g., by effects on host-microbe interactions, we evaluated the response of epibacterial communities associated with Fucus vesiculosus forma mytili (F. mytili) to future climate conditions. During an 11-week lasting mesocosm experiment on the island of Sylt (Germany) in spring 2014, North Sea F mytili individuals were exposed to elevated pCO(2) (1000 ppm) and increased temperature levels (Delta+5 degrees C). Both abiotic factors were tested for single and combined effects on the epibacterial community composition over time, with three replicates per treatment. The respective community structures of bacterial consortia associated to the surface of F mytili were analyzed by Illumina MiSeq 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing after 0, 4, 8, and 11 weeks of treatment (in total 96 samples). The results demonstrated that the epibacterial community structure was strongly affected by temperature, but only weakly by elevated pCO(2). No interaction effect of both factors was observed in the combined treatment. We identified several indicator operational taxonomic units (iOTUs) that were strongly influenced by the respective experimental factors. An OTU association network analysis revealed that relationships between OTUs were mainly governed by habitat. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of how epibacterial communities associated with F mytili may adapt to future changes in seawater acidity and temperature, ultimately with potential consequences for host-microbe interactions.

AB  - Our study was undertaken to better understand how to increase the success rates of recovery plantings of a rare hemiparasite, golden paintbrush (Castilleja levisecta-Orobanchaceae). This species is endemic to westernWashington and Oregon, USA, and southwestern British Columbia, Canada. Over 5000 golden paintbrush plants were outplanted as plugs in 2007 at six different native prairie sites that were considered to be suitable habitat, based on general evaluations of vegetation and soil conditions. Outplantings were installed at regular intervals along transects up to 1 km long to include a range of conditions occurring at each site. All plantings were re-examined five years later. The patchy distribution of surviving plugs and new recruits within each reintroduction site suggested success is strongly influenced by microsite characteristics. Indicator species analysis of taxa growing in microsites around outplanted golden paintbrush identified species that were positively or negatively associated with paintbrush survival. Species such as Festuca roemeri, Eriophyllum lanatum, and Viola adunca were strong indicators at some sites; non-natives such as Hypochaeris radicata and Teesdalia nudicaulis tended to be frequent negative indicators. Overall, higher richness of native perennial forbs was strongly correlated with both survival and flowering of golden paintbrush, a pattern that may reflect interactions of this hemiparasite with the immediately surrounding plant community. Topographic position also influenced outcomes, with greater survival occurring on mounds and in swales, where soils generally were deeper. Our findings suggest that assessments of site suitability based on vegetation alone, and coarser, site-level assessments that do not characterize heterogeneity at the microsite scale, may not be strong predictors of restoration success over the longer term and in sites with variability in vegetation and soils. By identifying suitable microsites to focus rare species plantings, survival and efficiency may be significantly enhanced.

AB  - Desert mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus eremicus) in central Arizona declined from 11 deer/km(2) in the early 1960s to 2 deer/km(2) in 2006. We had the opportunity to examine the causes of desert mule deer population fluctuations in Arizona from 1960 to 2006 by contrasting deer density, body condition, productivity, and diet quality inside and outside of the 259-ha Walnut Canyon Predator Proof Enclosure (WCPPE) on the Three Bar Wildlife Area (TBWA) in central Arizona. Mule deer inside the enclosure increased from 11/km(2) in 1997 to 32 deer/km(2) in 2004 while mule deer outside the enclosure in the TBWA remained between 1 and 5 deer/km(2) during the same time. There was no difference in body mass and number of fetuses (in utero) between mule deer inside and outside the enclosure. However, there was evidence of mule deer in better body condition inside the enclosure compared to mule deer outside the enclosure. Mule deer inside the enclosure consumed a diet higher in energy than mule deer outside the enclosure. There were no differences in plant species diversity or composition inside and outside the enclosure. Current mule deer densities in the study area are below what the environment is capable of maintaining, and a history of higher mule deer densities inside WCPPE over 40 y has not resulted in measurable impacts on the highly diverse plant communities of TBWA. Observed differences in diet quality of mule deer may be related to trade-offs incurred through predation risk, where mule deer inside the enclosure are maximizing their energy intake without the burden of predator avoidance and vigilance. Our study provided evidence that current mule deer densities in central Arizona are below what the environment is capable of sustaining.

AB  - WARED system is Internet-based software that automatically receives the seismic information from Iran seismic center (ISC) every 30 s. The information is processed in a few seconds and damage assessment maps of various parts of the city (such as buildings, hospitals, bridges, etc) become available, in layered format, to rescue groups through system site. Rescue groups, in addition to receiving probable damage assessment from the system, are capable of loading their field observations of actual damages caused by the earthquake on their system. The system, through organizing volunteer groups of people, takes advantage of these energetic, motivated and capable aid groups to help the affected people.
   WARED system has been designed with three aims of reducing casualties, integrating aid assistance and sending necessary information to the municipal management and private voluntary groups (PVO), within the time-limit after the earthquake. This system has four main indicators which makes it different from other systems. 1. Ability to work with minimum information (magnitudes and locations of earthquakes). 2. No need to install expensive equipment (accelerometer). 3. The operationalization capability in a short time (6 months). 4. Localization capability for the complex and chaotic conditions prevailing in unprepared cities.
   Principles of information processing in this system depend on three main factors including the magnitude and location of earthquakes, the properties of the rocks and sediment the earthquake waves travel through, and the technical characteristics of the buildings (strength, age, type, and geotechnical conditions of soil, etc.). Therefore Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) is used as the most important parameter to assess the damages occurred.
   WARED system was designed by Tous Knowledge-base Researchers for Natural Events Company (TRNE) in January 2014 and was installed in the ICT center of Mashhad Municipality in Iran II The system has the capability to be expanded and used in other cities and developing countries.

AB  - Fire danger indices are used by fire management agencies to assess fire weather conditions and issue public warnings. The most widely used fire danger indices in Australia are the McArthur Fire Forest Danger Index and the Grassland Fire Danger Index. These indices are calculated at weather stations using measurements of weather variables and fuel information. For a vast country like Australia when assessing the risk of severe fire weather events, it is also important to calculate the spatial distribution of these indices considering the extreme tail of the distribution. The spatial distribution of one of the fire weather danger indices regularly used in Australia is presented in this paper. In particular, we present the spatial distribution of the long-term tendency of extreme values of the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI). This indicator of fire weather conditions was assessed by calculating the return period of its extreme values by fitting extreme value distributions to data sets of FFDI at 78 recording stations around Australia. The spatial distribution of these return periods was obtained by using spatial interpolation algorithms with the recording stations measurements. Two conventional and two new algorithms based on machine-learning techniques were tested. This study shows that the best interpolation results for the FFDI can be obtained by using a combination of random forest and inverse distance weighting interpolation algorithms. The spatial distribution of the seasonal FFDI return period shows that the highest FFDI over large parts of southern Australia occurs during the summer months whilst in northern Australia it occurs in spring. The results also show that the FFDI in eastern Australia, the most populated region of the country, is higher inland than in the coastal areas particularly during spring and summer.

AB  - During nesting periods, seabirds are known to exhibit considerable inter-annual variability in diets, yet little is known about the diets of pelagic seabirds during non-breeding periods. Over 5 yr (2005 to 2009), we studied dietary partitioning between sympatric greater and sooty shear-waters, Puffinus gravis and P. griseus, during migratory staging periods in the Northwest Atlantic. Stable-isotope (SI; n = 253) and fatty-acid (FA; n = 127) signatures from blood samples were used to assess inter-annual patterns in diet and quantify prey choices. In addition to significant effects of year, capture site, and body condition, SI signatures revealed subtle, but consistent, dietary partitioning between species. In all years, greater shearwaters fed at slightly higher trophic levels (overall mean delta N-15 = 13.6%) and lower delta C-13 (-19.1%) than sooty shearwaters (delta N-15 = 13.3%, delta C-13 =-18.9%). SI mixing models revealed that sooty shearwaters relied more heavily on euphausiids Meganyctiphanes norvegica, while greater shearwaters consumed more herring Clupea harengus, squid Illex illecebrosus, and, in some years, mackerel Scomber scombrus. In 2005/2006, bird diets consisted primarily of herring and krill, but demonstrated a shift towards krill and squid during 2007-2009. FA from bird plasma showed little inter-specific partitioning but a strong signal of annual variation for both species. We used a subset of prey FA and a modified multivariate approach to model bird diets and obtained dietary preferences broadly in agreement with SI results. The present study revealed inter-annual variability and dietary partitioning in sympatric species of pelagic seabirds, and highlights potential shifts in prey availability to predators in the Bay of Fundy.

AB  - In sexual selection, multimodal signals elicit mate choice when more than one sensory modality is activated. However, determining the relative use of each signal is difficult because it requires a comprehensive understanding of the mating system and how this system works under natural conditions. We examined the role of structural ultraviolet (UV) reflectance and pheromones in the butterfly Colias eurytheme. Both traits are important in mediating interspecific interactions and pheromones have been implicated in intra-specific mate choice. UV reflectance, which arises from the presence of a multilayer thin-film interference array, has potential as an honest indicator of male condition, viability and/or age. We investigated the relevance of these signal traits to courtship success by releasing virgin females in the path of free-flying males until each female had rejected and accepted at least one male. This design facilitated a within-subjects (females) analysis of mate choice, thus controlling for potentially confounding variation in intrinsic female receptivity. Principal component analysis indicated that variation across males in UV brightness and pheromones was essentially orthogonal. Females preferred younger males (as subjectively adjudged by wing wear), and while age covaried with UV brightness and almost all pheromone descriptors, UV brightness emerged as the best and most general predictor of male mating success. Our results suggest that this trait serves as an important intraspecific sexual signal in C. eurytheme, and they provide the clearest evidence to date regarding the functional relevance of structural coloration to female mate choice in butterflies. We discuss the preferential use of one secondary sexual characteristic (UV reflectance) over another (pheromones) with regard to evolutionary strategies.

AB  - Soft bottom macrobenthos at a station located off Cesenatico (Emilia Romagna, Northern Adriatic Sea) was investigated seasonally for six years from July 1996 to July 2002.
   Species composition and abundance of the community have been studied in relation to fluctuation in the water environment parameters, sediment texture pattems and mucilage, that occurred mainly in the water column at the study site.
   Three major Po river flow peaks occurred in November 1996, October 2000 and May 2002; after these events the community was reduced to minimum abundance values (total density < 2000 individuals m(-2)). In the period between the first two episodes the river discharge remained rather low and conditions of increased salinity, lower nutrients and chl a and good oxygen saturation were experienced.
   The fossorial Crustacean Ampelisca diadema became dominant in the community between the first two river flow events, reaching maximum density of 10,200 individuals m-2 and substituting the bivalve Corbula gibba, indicator of sediment instability. Species richness increased in the same period. The role of Ampelisca as a facilitator in structuring the community is discussed. Corbula gibba never recovered to initial densities, apart from an abundance peak that occurred in the summer of 2000. Faunal composition seemed to evolve slowly towards a higher degree of structural complexity (positive trend in diversity and evenness index).
   In the study site near-bottom mucilage events occurred in the summers of 1997, 1998, 2002; they appeared uncorrelated with the observed changes in the community structure. Multivariate analysis of community structure (MDS, ANOSIM) illustrates that community changes in this station are driven mainly by hydrographical conditions influencing sediment texture patterns and trophic resources for the benthos.

AB  - Phosphatic and carbonate hardgrounds occur in a Lower Miocene nontropical carbonate succession in the Maiella carbonate platform margin, located in the Central Apennines. Multiple diagenetic events occurred at or near the sea floor before the deposition of the overlying sediment and included precipitation of inclusion-rich calcite, micrite, iron oxides, and phosphates. Later diagenetic features are limited to chemical compaction and precipitation of clear calcite cement. We relate the development of these features to a two-step model, involving progressive intensification of upwelling on this carbonate margin, which was triggered by regional changes in water circulation and modulated by sea-level changes, leading initially to precipitation of inclusion-rich calcite. With an increase in trophic resources related to the paleoceanographic conditions on the ramp, increased flux of organic matter to the sea floor led to temporary formation of microbial biolilms. These conditions were associated with extensive precipitation of micrite and phosphate microspherules in the uppermost sediment. The lack of sedimentation provides the precondition to accumulate and preserve evidence for organic-matter utilization in the uppermost sediment layer.
   Our study suggests that hardgrounds in nontropical carbonates might be used as indicators of circulation changes and can provide a useful link to major environmental changes in the ocean-margin environment. The occurrence of microbial micrite and phosphate microspherules precipitated in the absence of sedimentation near the sea floor as a response to higher nutrient supply provides a new and important criterion to differentiate nontropical carbonate facies deposited under the influence of higher nutrient supplies rather than temperature alone. Furthermore, our study shows that local depletion in C-13 at a key stratigraphic surface does not necessarily reflect meteoric exposure but may be related to microbial activity at the sea floor.

AB  - The Richmond River is periodically exposed to acid sulphate run-off(ASR). Leaching of acidified water into this system commonly arises from infiltration of rainwater through acid sulphate soils that have been oxidized during construction of flood mitigation drains. Leaching events have been linked to major fish kills and can also lead to sublethal effects in fish, such as red spot disease. The effects of ASR on subtidal estuarine macrobenthic assemblages in the region of the Richmond known as the Tuckean Broadwater are examined here. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that water transparency, pH, and soluble aluminium concentration were the most significant contributors to variation in macrobenthic community structure. Partial canonical correspondence analysis was performed to examine the effects of factors associated with ASR on the relative abundance of macrobenthic species, in isolation from the influence of other environmental variables. Variation in relative abundance was not significantly related to the individual effects of either soluble aluminium or pH. However, their combined effect on species abundance was significant, reflecting that macrobenthos at this site responded to chemical speciation of aluminium at certain pH ranges, rather than directly to either pH or soluble aluminium concentration. Results also showed that two species of sub-surface deposit-feeding polychaetes, Nephtys australiensis and Notomastus torquatus, were the most sensitive to the chemical speciation of aluminium and have tolerances for aluminium species that occur at different levels of acidification. The feeding activities of these two species may have removed the iron flee formed on the sediment surface under acidified conditions. thereby providing suitable conditions for other macrobenthic species to recolonize the Tuckean Broadwater.

AB  - The Late Devonian to Early Carboniferous Albert Formation of the Moncton subbasin, New Brunswick, was deposited in a pull-apart basin in a variety of subenvironments that include alluvial fans, deltas, 'shallow' to 'deep' lacustrine environments, carbonate mudflats and algal swamps. This study examined the role of organic carbon, organic matter reactivity, mineralogy, iron content and sulphate availability on pyrite formation and bottom water conditions during sedimentation of the fine-grained lacustrine sediments. The fine-grained 'deep' lacustrine sediments have higher total organic carbon (TOC) values (5.61+/-3.33) than the fine-grained 'shallow/marginal' lacustrine sediments (0.97+/-0.82). The 'deep' lacustrine sediments have slightly lower pyrite sulphur (0.82+/-0.46) than the 'shallow/marginal' lacustrine sediments (1.86+/-1.98). The adequate presence of reactive organic carbon in both these environments is supported by high hydrogen indices (658-181). The presence of sufficient iron for pyritization is evidenced from the association of early diagenetic siderite and pyrite. Least-squares linear regression parameters indicate low slopes (0.03) and low positive intercepts (<0.8) on the sulphur axis, suggesting pyrite formation in euxinic environment. The 'deep' lacustrine sediments have higher C/S ratios (6.84, sigma = 0.67) than the 'shallow/marginal' lacustrine sediments (1.49, sigma = 0.14). The slope and intercept of the regression equation and C/S ratios suggest the existence of a sulphate gradient from the 'shallow/marginal' areas to the 'deep' water areas of the lake. delta(34)S isotope values of pyrite (+23.06 parts per thousand to -16.23 parts per thousand CDT) suggest pyrite formation from bacterial reduction of sulphates of lacustrine and marine origin.

AB  - The Developmental Processes in Schizophrenic Disorders project is a longitudinal study of schizophrenic patients who have recently had a first episode of psychosis. The project focuses on discriminating characteristics of schizophrenic patients that are "stable vulnerability indicators," "mediating vulnerability factors," and "episode indicators" by comparing normal subjects to schizophrenic patients assessed in clinically remitted and psychotic states. A parallel project goal is to identify predictors of relapse, social and work impairment, and illness course among potential psychobiological vulnerability factors and environmental potentiating factors. Hypothesized vulnerability factors and potential environmental stressors are examined first under standardized maintenance antipsychotic medication conditions for at least 1 year. Patients showing stable remission of psychosis after 1 year of maintenance antipsychotic medication are invited to enter drug crossover and withdrawal protocols to determine the need for continuous antipsychotic medication. Vulnerability and stress factors are again assessed. A summary of results to date is presented. Deficits in early components of processing visual arrays and in sustained discrimination of successive ambiguous perceptual inputs are relatively stable across psychotic and clinically remitted states in the schizophrenic patients. Performance on a vigilance task demanding active, working memory also remains abnormal during clinical remission but covaries significantly with psychotic state and is a candidate for a mediating vulnerability factor. Autonomic activation level does not appear to be an enduring vulnerability factor, but it predicts the extent of short-term symptomatic recovery and may mediate the impact of stressors. Under conditions of standardized, injectable antipsychotic medication, independent stressful life events and highly critical attitudes toward the patient in the social environment predict relapse risk. Prospective data suggest that signs and symptoms prodromal to psychotic relapse may be present in about 60 percent of patients.

TI  - PHASING CYLINDER PRESSURE TO CRANK ANGLE IN A DIRECT INJECTION DIESEL-ENGINE, BY SIMULATION OF COMPRESSION CURVE AND ELABORATION OF MEASURED PRESSURE DATA
T2  - FORSCHUNG IM INGENIEURWESEN-ENGINEERING RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - When measurements of indicator diagrams are made in an internal combustion engine, the serious problem arises of accurate phasing of pressure data to crank position.  This work presents a novel thermodynamic method for such a phasing.  A measuring assembly consisting of a piezoelectric transducer, a charge amplifier and a fast data acquisition board installed on a compatible PC computer, is used to obtain the indicator diagrams (i.e. pairs of pressure-time), dispensing thus with the use of a signal from the flywheel TDC marker.  An advanced simulation thermodynamic model for the corresponding compression curve (i.e. before fuel injection) is proposed, which includes a detailed zero dimensional energy cascade turbulence submodel for predicting the heat transfer rate between cylinder gas and walls, a blowby rate submodel containing flow, calculations in the piston ring pack assembly passages under rings motion conditions, and properties-relations pertaining to real gas (air) behaviour.  The measured pressure data are corrected for drift and their exact period (from cycle to cycle) is determined.  The theoretical compression curve is shifted (in time) to "coincide" to the compression part (before fuel injection) of the first measured cycle, so that its TDC is determined.  The coincidence of the two compression curves is continuously (iteratively) improved by using a double iteration procedure, i.e. by firstly shifting the curves in time and secondly by varying the model's parameters and calibration constants.  After this step, the phasing of pressure data to crank angle of the following cycles can be easily determined, since the corresponding time periods are already accurately calculated.  The method is applied with success, under various speed and load conditions, for a fully instrumented single cylinder, LISTER LV1, direct injection, naturally aspirated, Diesel engine installation at the authors' laboratory.

AB  - Reference sites with relatively unaltered plant communities are used regularly to establish targets for ecological restoration, yet few are free from anthropogenic disturbances. In this study, we sought to understand the capacity for native community indicators and other plant species to recover from abandoned woods roads and tilled soils within reference sites. We mapped disturbances in a 34 ha portion of the Wade Tract, an old-growth longleaf pine-wiregrass (Pinus palustris-Aristida stricta) woodland using GPS and LiDAR and counted stems of 25 native species (20 woody and 5 herbaceous) in plots within disturbances (n = 32; disturbed), 3 m adjacent to disturbances (n = 32; adjacent), and >5 m from any disturbance (n = 30; reference). Ten species were considered indicator species of intact longleaf pine woodlands. We also quantified soil conditions within the disturbed, adjacent, and reference sites. Disturbed sites had more compacted surface soils than adjacent or reference sites and, in a subset of the sites, soil bulk density and soil strength were greater in disturbed than in adjacent. Indicator species were less frequent in disturbed sites than in adjacent or reference sites (except for Quercus pumila). Three oaks (Q. incana, Q. margaretta, and Q. laevis) and 3 other woody species (Rhus copallinum, Sassafras albidum, and Morella cerifera) were significantly less common in the disturbed sites than in adjacent or reference sites. The near absence of some oaks and other woody species on disturbed sites warrants including these species as indicators of intact regional ground cover for longleaf pine woodlands. Legacies of small-scale soil disturbances in relatively undisturbed perennial-dominated ground cover flora reveals the potential for cumulative degradation over decades and underscores the need to avoid such disturbances in remnant longleaf pine woodlands.

AB  - This study was aimed to examine the influence of acclimatization on the change of concentration of stress hormones in men's serum exposed to heat stress during physical training. The study included a total of 40 men, aged 19-21 years, divided randomly into four groups: CTRL group: control, exposed to the Exercise Tolerance Testing in comfortable conditions; O group: exposed to Exercise Tolerance Testing in a warm environment; P group: exposed to passive acclimation to heat for 10 days, followed by Exercise Tolerance Testing in a warm environment; A group: exposed to active acclimation to heat for 10 days, followed by Exercise Tolerance Testing in a warm environment. All participants were tested for thermoregulation and acclimatization, skin and tympanic temperature, heart rate (HR), hormonal status and sweating. The mean skin temperature was the lowest in the control group of subjects exposed to physical exertion under comfortable conditions, and at each point of measurement it was statistically significantly different from that of the other study groups (p < 0.001). Sweating intensity was statistically significantly the lowest in the CTRL group (0.32 +/- 0.04 l/m(2)/h; p < 0.001), compared to all other groups. Cortisol was significantly altered in O group (632.2 +/- 92.3; 467.2 +/- 89.7), testosterone levels were significantly altered in P (19.2 +/- 9.3; 16.4 +/- 7.3) and in A groups (22.1 +/- 12.4; 14.9 +/- 9.9), while prolactin was changed in O (392.1 +/- 51.3; 181.4 +/- 42.3), P (595.1 +/- 191.1; 191.2 +/- 52.5), and A group (407.4 +/- 189.3; 173.4 +/- 43.9) after the experimental period. The impact of acclimatization on hormonal indicators emphasizes its importance in the response of the endocrine system of soldiers to perform military activities in warm climates.

AB  - Salinity is the main environmental factor accountable for decreasing crop productivity worldwide. The effects of NaCl salinity on plant growth (leaf relative water content (RWC), leaf dry weight (LDW), shoot length (SL), number of leaves (NL), number of branches (NB) and total leaf area (TLA) and physiological characteristics (stomatal conductance (g(s)), transpiration rate (TR), net photosynthetic (P-n), yield of photosystem II (Phi PsII) and the intercellular CO2 concentration (CO2int) in peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) varieties ('Vanda', 'P244601' and 'Pl184948', widely used in Cameroon, Tanzania and Ghana, respectively, were investigated under hydroponic condition. Plants were subjected to four levels of NaCl (0, 40, 80 and 120 mM) at early seedling growth stage of plant development. Application of NaCl treatment led to a significant decrease in LDW, SL, NL, TLA, P-n, g(s), TR and CO2int concentration of 'Vanda' and 'P244601' compared to untreated plants while the plant growth inhibition was notably noted at 120 mM NaCl in 'P1184948' for LDW, SL and NB. The highest depressive effect was detected in gs of salt-sensitive 'Vanda' while the lowest were recorded in gs of salt-tolerant 'P1184948' at high salinity level. Enhanced NaCl concentrations led to a significant increase in FPSII of 'P1184948' compared to 'Vanda', 'P244601' and untreated plants. Leaf CHL content was significantly increased in moderately-tolerant ''P244601' and salt-tolerant 'P1184948' at 80 mM NaCl compared to salt sensitive 'Vanda' and untreated plants. The depressive effect of salt on RWC was recorded at 120 mM NaCl in peanut leaves of all varieties. Under salt stress 'P1184948' was observed to have relatively higher tolerance on average of all growth and physiological traits than 'Vanda' and P244601' suggesting that it could be grown in salt-affected soils.

AB  - We document the long-term development of a spring-fed fen assessing its sensivity to climate changes over the last ca. 4000 years. Our investigation is based on high-resolution, continuous plant macrofossil remains and mollusc records, complemented by pollen, geochemical analysis and radiocarbon dating of Valea Morii, located in the Feleac Hills (Transylvanian Depression) in NW Romania, Central Eastern Europe. Based on our palaeocological data we have distinguished three stages of wet habitat conditions: two stages between 4000 and 2450 cal yr BP and one in the last 800 cal yr BP, and one dry stage between ca. 2450 and 800 cal yr BP. These local habitat conditions appear to reasonably reflect regional climate characteristics. High-resolution analysis of two replicated cores documented a mostly comparable pattern of local plant and mollusc succession, and stable isotope values from ca. 500 cal yr BP. The appearance of C. mariscus during the last two centuries may be related to increased wetness and associated active CaCO3 precipitation, which allowed this plant to colonise the springfed fen studied. However, it can be not excluded that the occurrence and spread of a Cladium mariscus population at this site during the last two centuries might have been partly favoured by the warming of the climate after the Little Ice Age. The potential of carbonate oxygen stable isotope values as an indicator of major trends in climatic change, both temperature and humidity, in mountain spring-fed fen deposits is shown. Carbon isotopes in the carbonates were found to be useful in reconstruction of changes in vegetation, soil development and the dissolution of bedrock carbonates, primarily as a reaction to changes in climate humidity.

AB  - Records of changes in the phytosociological structure of vegetation can be observed more clearly in soils that have more significant accumulation of organic matter, like those occurring in high-mountain environments. The aim of this study was to characterize soils formed in high-mountain environments in the ltatiaia National Park (INP), state of Rio de Janeiro, southeastern Brazil, and to discuss the potential of preserved phytoliths as markers of vegetative history and environmental factors. Four profiles were selected, which were morphologically described and evaluated for their physical and chemical properties. For phytolith analysis and high-resolution determination of the stable carbon isotopes, samples were collected at 0.10 m intervals. The profiles showed highly similar morphological characteristics, with peat deposits and colluvial sediments as source material, produced in the highest parts of the landscape. High-mountain soils in the INP have properties related to high contents of organic matter, like high acidity, low base saturation, and high CEC values due to high H+ contents. The soils are formed by the addition of plant residues, which accumulate due to the cold and humid climate during most of the year in these environments. The phytolith assemblage had a high frequency of morphotypes characteristic of temperate, cold, and high elevation intertropical regions, especially of Pooideae plants. The phytolith indexes indicated open vegetation environments with a predominance of C-3 grasses, suggesting cold climate conditions, and corroborating the delta C-13 isotopic values. The results of phytolith analysis of the profiles reflected characteristics related to soil genesis. Organism is the main soil formation factor, conditioned by the factors relief (elevation) and climate, which resulted in low temperatures and lead organic matter accumulation.

AB  - It was estimated the conversion of feed into milk, content of urea, fat, protein, somatic cells in the milk of cows of different breeds in different seasons and months of the year. It was established that the peculiarities of the organization of feeding process significantly influence the productive indicators. Thus, in the conditions of a modern milk complex for 1500 cows with an unattached system of keeping in boxes and feeding with the use of mixed rations, the average value of feed conversion (the measures of digestibility of the feed when it "converted" into dairy products) is 1.38 kg of milk per kilogram of dry matter of feed, and the ratio of fat to protein is 1.10, which is lower than the existing standards. It was established that changes in the conditions by months of the year significantly influenced practically all analyzed qualitative characteristics of milk. And this fact entails the corresponding monthly fluctuations of indicators of safety of products, emissions of by-products of metabolism, and, consequently, fluctuations of dairy cattle breeding impact on the environment and ecology. It was found that milk yield positively and significantly (P=0.999) correlated with the consumption of feed dry matter (r=0.454) and feed conversion rate (r=0.547). At the same time, the milk yield is negatively related to the fat content (r=-0.211) and the protein content (r=-0.192) in milk. The level of urea in milk positively correlates with the content of protein in milk (r=0.130; P >= 0.99). The influence of the factor "breed" on the following important economic-useful traits such as daily milk yield (eta(2)=0.131) and feed conversion rate (eta(2)=0.130) are proved.

AB  - Planktonic diatom composition was investigated in association with environmental factors at bi-weekly and weekly intervals from October 2013 to September 2014 in the Golden Horn Estuary (Sea of Marmara). Sixtysix diatom taxa (50 centrics and 16 pennates) within 32 genera were identified in samples taken during the study period. Chaetoceros species were the most abundant species (30 % of the total number of diatom). The other most common species were Proboscis alata, Rhizosolenia hebetata and Skeletonema marinoi from centrics; Ceratoneis closterium, Nitzschia longissima, Pseudo-nitzschia calliantha and Thalassionema nitzschioides from pennates. The abundance of diatom increased towards the upper estuary, but its species richness decreased markedly. The contribution of diatoms to the total phytoplankton abundance decreased from 60 % to 26 % from the lower to the upper estuary. Some diatom taxa, P. calliantha, S marinoi, T minima and C closterium, formed blooms between May and July, reaching the highest abundances 1.6 x 106, 39 x 106, 13 x 106 and 2 x 106 cells L-1, respectively. Salinity, Sec chi depth, dissolved oxygen and pH values decreased gradually from the lower to the upper estuary, while inorganic nutrient concentrations increased. There was a significant positive correlation between temperature and diatom abundance (p<0.01), while there was a negative correlation between temperature and species richness (p < 0.01). However, salinity, Secchi depth and dissolved oxygen were positively correlated with species richness (p < 0.01). Inorganic nutrients were negatively correlated with diatom abundance (p < 0.01) and species richness (p<0.05). Therefore, the main environmental factors affected the distribution of diatoms along this study area. Thus, diatom assemblages may be considered as a good indicator of changing environmental conditions in such environments.

AB  - Serpentine soils are edaphically stressful environments that host many endemic plant species. In particular, serpentine soils are high in several heavy metals (e. g. nickel, cobalt and chromium) and these high heavy metal concentrations are thought, in part, to lead to varying levels of plant adaptation and soil affinities (i.e. endemic vs. non-endemic plant species). It is unclear, however, whether serpentine endemics vs. non-endemics differ with respect to heavy metal uptake into either vegetative or reproductive organs. Here, we use nickel as a model to determine whether plant heavy metal uptake varies with the level of endemism in several non-hyperaccumulating species. Under controlled greenhouse conditions, we grew seven plant species from the Brassicaceae family that vary in their degrees of affinity to serpentine soil from low (indifferent) to medium (indicator) and high (endemic) in soil that was nickel supplemented or not. We quantified nickel concentrations in leaves, pistils, anthers, pollen and nectar. While nickel concentrations did not vary across organs or affinities when grown in control soils, under conditions of nickel supplementation endemic species had the lowest tissue concentrations of nickel, particularly when considering leaves and pistils, compared with indifferent/indicator species. Species indifferent to serpentines incorporated higher concentrations of nickel into reproductive organs relative to leaves, but this was not the case for indicator species and endemics where nickel concentration was similar in these organs. Our findings suggest that endemic species possess the ability to limit nickel uptake into above-ground tissues, particularly in reproductive organs where it may interfere with survival and reproduction. Indifferent species accumulated significantly more nickel into reproductive organs compared with leaves, which may limit their reproductive potential relative to endemic species when growing on serpentine soils. Additional work determining the fitness consequences of these differences will further our understanding of edaphic endemism.

AB  - The present study constitutes an in situ investigation of metal kinetics within soft tissue of mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis), which solves the problem of the decoupling of the effect of animal physiology and metal bioavailability in water. Field experiments were conducted to measure uptake and elimination kinetics for four metals (Hg, Pb, Cd, and Cu) in three Mediterranean sites with different contamination and nutritive levels. At each site, metal concentrations were monitored in soft tissues of mussels and in the surrounding waters. The experimental conditions were completely characterized: Lazaret Bay (located between Nice and Marseille, France) is a hot spot for Hg (6.3 ng/L) and Ph (163 ng/L) concentrations and is an oligotrophic, stable site; Bages Lagoon (located to the west of Montpellier, France) is particularly contaminated by Cd (1.5 ng/L) and Cu (1.5 mu g/L) and is a mesotrophic site where variability of trophic and physicochemical parameters is significant; and Port-Cros Island (located in the Hyeres National Park, France) is considered to be a reference site. Those kinetics permit us to decouple physiological, chemical, and environmental interactions. After normalizing mussel metal content for similar physiological conditions, application of the local weighted regression (LOWESS) statistical treatment shows a parallelism between the time trends of metal concentrations in the bivalve and metal concentrations in water. The results enabled us to obtain in situ kinetic parameters and realistic bioaccumulation factors. Their logarithmic values were 4.6 for Hg, 4.3 for Ph, 4.9 for Cd, and 3.9 for Cu. The importance of physiological processes such as spawning is discussed as a factor influencing the bioaccumulation factor. This information may be useful in refining monitoring tools for risk assessment and, more generally, in environmental management strategies.

AB  - One hundred and twenty Bos indicus cross steers were allocated to 3 treatments (good, mixed and poor) on the basis of flight speed, as a measure of cattle temperament. The cattle were lot-fed for 100 days and data collected at intervals on their temperament (flight speeds) and productivity (liveweight changes, body condition, pen feed intakes) during this time. After slaughter, data were collected on carcass traits and meat quality. Eating-quality attributes were measured in meat samples from 22 carcasses from each treatment.
   Flight speeds were highly correlated across animals and within treatments, showed little change in variability over time and were highly repeatable.
   Flight speed indicated a slight deterioration in temperament with time in the feedlot until day 70, suggesting an increasing fearfulness in the steers. Differences in flight speeds between treatments were maintained throughout the feedlotting period; poor-temperament animals retained poor temperaments and good retained good. Flight speed was correlated with measures of production, and flight speed measured at feedlot induction was a predictor of performance. Correlations and treatment effects showed that cattle with poor temperaments had poorer average daily gains, feed conversion efficiencies, body conditions and dressing percentages compared with those with good temperaments. Reduced performance in the poor-temperament animals may have resulted from their fearfulness and state of high arousal.
   Treatment (temperament grouping) did not influence carcass traits, but there was evidence of lower initial pH levels and indicators of 'heat-shortening' in the meat of steers with poor temperament compared with those with good temperament. These findings suggest that the poor temperament steers were more susceptible to pre-slaughter stressors than the good temperament animals. However, the meat quality differences were not detected in eating-quality measurements.

AB  - Ensuring the human right to water requires monitoring at national or subnational levels, but few comprehensive frameworks exist for industrialized contexts. This paper introduces a subnational-level framework - known as the California Human Right to Water Framework and Data Tool (CalHRTW) - developed by the authors at the California EPA's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment. This paper has two objectives: (1) to present the theoretical foundations and methodology used to develop the first version of CalHRTW (CalHRTW 1.0) and (2) to showcase how results can be used. CalHRTW 1.0 measures three components of the human right to water: drinking water quality, accessibility and affordability for community water systems. Nine individual indicators grouped by component, and three indices that summarize component-level outcomes are used to quantify system-level results. CalHRTW allows users to (1) summarize system-level conditions statewide and identify challenges, (2) explore social equity implications and (3) centralize information for planning. CalHRTW draws on approaches from existing international monitoring efforts and complements existing California efforts by being the first US effort to comprehensively and explicitly monitor the HRTW under one umbrella. This work offers other US states and countries a model to build monitoring efforts to realize the human right to water. HIGHLIGHTS

AB  - Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is a major pathogen of rice, leading to tremendous rice yield reduction about 20-50% both temperate and tropical rice-growing regions. Here, to develop a rapid and reliable method for Xoo detection, a one-step colorimetric loop-mediated isothermal amplification (cLAMP) assay was established. The conditions for cLAMP using both LpXoo80 and LpXoo4009 primer sets were optimized. The specificity and sensitivity of cLAMP using both primers were determined under the optimal conditions of 60 degrees C for 40 min that the results can be visualized by naked eye. As a result, cLAMP using LpXoo4009 primer amplifying in only Xoo exhibited higher specificity than LpXoo80 primer, generating a cross-reaction of LAMP amplification in both Xoo and other Xanthomonas species (Xag and Xac). cLAMP using LpXoo80 primer showed higher sensitivity than the LpXoo4009 primer, with consistently amplified positive cLAMP products under detected thresholds of at least 2 x 10(3) and 2 x 10(5) cfu/mL, respectively. This developed cLAMP assay was applied to detect Xoo artificially inoculated rice leaf (2.5 x 10(8) cfu/mL). Positive LAMP product was clearly detected over the first 2 days post-inoculation, while external BLB leaf symptoms disappeared. This cLAMP assay also showed high performance of Xoo detection (>80%) in Xoo naturally infected rice leaf samples, harvested from suspected BLB symptomatic leaf in cultivated rice fields. The work reported a high specificity, sensitivity, and simplicity of the cLAMP assay to detect various Xoo isolates identified from the lower north region of Thailand. This method provided feasible point-of-care testing for Xoo surveillance in fields and long-term BLB disease management.

AB  - Palaeo-wildfires were a common phenomenon in the Earth history. Their products can influence on some biomarker indicators characterising palaeo-environment conditions. Selected plant-derived aromatic biomarkers and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were analysed in the Jurassic strata from the Polish Basin, Jurassic strata from the Mesozoic basement of the Carpathian Foredeep and Neogene strata from the Carpathian Foredeep. Marked compounds recorded varied input from palaeoflora families and the variable intensity of palaeowildfires. Retene (Ret), cadalene (Cad), 6-isopropyl-1-isohexyl-2-methylnaphthalene (ip-iHMN), dehydroabietic acid methyl ester (DAME), simonellite (Sim), fluoranthene (Fl), benz[a]anthracene (BaA), benzo[alpha]pyrene (BaP), benzo[ghi]perylene (BgP), coronene (Cor) were identified in the analysed samples. Based on mentioned compounds, pyrolytic input ratio (PIR) defined as (Cad + Sim + TDHA+ip-iHMN+Fl + BaA + BaP + BgP + Cor)/ (Cad + Sim + TDHA+ip-iHMN) was proposed. To provide broader possibility of use, the total dehydroabietic acid (TDHA) counted as sum of DAME and free dehydroabietic acid was used in PIR equation. PIR manage to define pyrolytic organic matter input. Combination of PIR with higher plant parameter (HPP) results, defined as Ret/(Cad + Ret), enables the distinction of samples deposited in a warm/hot and humid palaeo-climate from these deposited in more arid conditions, which were affected by palaeo-wildfires. Heretofore, high HPP values have been interpreted as an evidence of a warm/hot and humid palaeo-climate. This interpretation is true when PIR values are low. If the PIR values were higher, then the palaeo-wildfires influence on HPP was more significant and palaeo-climate misinterpretation was more probable. The new indicator can be used in case of immature or early mature and mostly terrestrial organic matter.

AB  - Iron-manganese (Fe-Mn) concentrations are common morphological indicators of soil oxidation-reduction reactions and are widely used to infer soil hydrology. The factors determining occurrence and distribution of Fe-Mn concentrations at the continental scale have been rarely studied. The objective of this study was to explore the distribution of Fe-Mn concentrations in upland loess soils and identify their favorable environment conditions in the mid-continental North America. A total of 3966 soil profiles were collected from the National Soil Information System database (NASIS). A decision tree (DT) model was used to analyze the spatial relationships between Fe-Mn concentration formation and its relevant environmental factors (climate, soil properties, and land use/land cover), and to identify key factors of Fe-Mn concentrations distribution and occurrence in upland loess soils. The DT model was evaluated with 25% validation dataset with an accuracy of 79%. Results showed that Fe-Mn concentrations were more likely to occur in mesic areas with large precipitation and low internal soil drainage rates, compared to frigid and thermic areas with low precipitation and large internal soil drainage rates. Annual precipitation and temperature were identified as the most important climatic factors influencing the occurrence of Fe-Mn concentrations and showed a complex interaction with soil properties at multiple scales. Soil properties related to potential wet to saturated soil conditions were also important for the occurrence of Fe-Mn concentrations. Results demonstrated the importance of using knowledge of pedogenesis in the selection of environmental covariates and the interpretation of DT model results. Understanding where Fe-Mn concentrations tend to form in the landscape will contribute to improving decisions about proper use of soil that may be limited by wetness and possible inferences about climate influences.

AB  - In conditions of establishing market relations and development of integration processes, efficient functioning of agrarian complex of the Republic of Belarus requires searching for new mechanisms and methods to improve competitiveness. As experience of economically developed countries of the world shows, states and producers actively use diverse logistic solutions, models, strategies and methods for planning and arranging activities. Organization of resource support for agricultural producers and promotion of their products in market according to logistics principles results in a significant economic, social and environmental effect. The paper, in the context of the modern period, presents social and economic indicators of the transport and logistics sector, system of state regulation, structural characteristics of logistics centers, agricultural foreign trade and logistics infrastructure. The main factors were identified hindering development of agrologistics in Belarus. Organizational and economic mechanism has been developed for improving logistical activities at the interstate (EAEU) and national levels have been developed. In case of proposal to create a single agrologistics market of Eurasian Economic Union at the interstate level, it is planned to increase efficiency of the national agrologistics market on the national level based on expansion of logistics infrastructure. Via integration of several prediction methods (expert assessments (pessimistic, optimistic and probabilistic opinions), economic and mathematical (extrapolation, time series analysis), non-standard (verbal information)), a reasonable forecast of development of logistics centers of the Republic of Belarus until 2025 was made. The issues in the paper are of interest for preparation of draft state programs and strategies in the field of agrologistics and development of exchange activities, development of country position in implementation of the agreed agro-industrial policy of the EAEU Member States.

AB  - The article studies regional integration and its innovative forms as well as the formation of innovative environment as an important condition for strengthening the competitive advantages of economy.
   The importance of the article is stipulated by the need for conditions necessary to ensure progressive scientific, technological and socioeconomic development of the regions in modern economic, political, technological, social and other trends. This situation becomes evident in the asymmetry of economic development of the territories as a result of inter-corporate interaction intensity and different types of business activity in them.
   The purpose of this research is to identify the impact of cluster integration on the volume of innovative products, works and services. We solved following tasks: review results of the researchs dealing with interrelation of integration level and innovative activity at the regional level; ranking of regions in Privolzhsky Federal district of Russia according to the degree of integration and the volume of innovative production, works, and services; assessment of interrelation of cluster integration level and indicators of innovative processes. On the basis of evaluation of innovation activity, we divided the regions into the following groups: innovative-advanced, innovative-developed and innovative-developing.
   The authors' hypothesis is based on the rationale for the development of mutually beneficial partnership in the regional economic systems, which in turn contributes to the stimulation of innovative processes in the sectoral and territorial directions. The formation and development of innovation clusters can determine the further vector of progressive innovative development of Russia as a whole. The study was based on the methodology of cluster analysis and methods of empirical research.
   The results of the research in the field of innovative processes can become a practical basis for the development and implementation of innovative development programs in the regions of Russia.

AB  - Suspended sediment concentration is an important estuarine health indicator. Estuarine ecosystems rely on the maintenance of habitat conditions, which are changing due to direct human impact and climate change. This study aims to evaluate the impact of climate change relative to engineering measures on estuarine fine sediment dynamics and sediment budgets. We use the highly engineered San Francisco Bay-Delta system as a case study. We apply a process-based modeling approach (Delft3D-FM) to assess the changes in hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics resulting from climate change and engineering scenarios. The scenarios consider a direct human impact (shift in water pumping location), climate change (sea level rise and suspended sediment concentration decrease), and abrupt disasters (island flooding, possibly as the results of an earthquake). Levee failure has the largest impact on the hydrodynamics of the system. Reduction in sediment input from the watershed has the greatest impact on turbidity levels, which are key to primary production and define habitat conditions for endemic species. Sea level rise leads to more sediment suspension and a net sediment export if little room for accommodation is left in the system due to continuous engineering works. Mitigation measures like levee reinforcement are effective for addressing direct human impacts, but less effective for a persistent, widespread, and increasing threat like sea level rise. Progressive adaptive mitigation measures to the changes in sediment and flow dynamics resulting from sea level rise may be a more effective strategy. Our approach shows that a validated process-based model is a useful tool to address long-term (decades to centuries) changes in sediment dynamics in highly engineered estuarine systems. In addition, our modeling approach provides a useful basis for long-term, process-based studies addressing ecosystem dynamics and health.

AB  - This study presents a method for the removal of Pb(II) from aqueous solution in batch and column modes using a commercial weak acidic cation (WAC) resin (Lewatit CNP80). Batch experiments carried out under different conditions yielded optimum conditions of pH = 5, t = 360 min, and m = 0.05 g (1 g L-1). The mechanism of ion exchange was studied using isotherm, kinetic, and thermodynamic models. The good fit of the Koble-Corrigan isotherm model indicates both heterogeneous and homogeneous sorption of Pb(II) on the resin. The concentration of Pb(II) in the solution had a strong influence on both the diffusion kinetics and the mechanism controlling the kinetic coefficient The fit of the experimental data to the pseudo-second-order model indicated that the reaction is affected fundamentally by Pb(II) concentration, whereas temperature did not result in a significant change. The Gibbs free energy change (Delta G degrees) values were negative, corresponding to a spontaneous process of Pb(II) ion sorption onto the WAC resin. The S-shaped breakthrough curves from the column studies show that most of the resin capacity was used up to the breakthrough point. Clean and Pb(II)-loaded WAC resins were characterized on the basis of zeta-potential measurements, Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR) spectral study, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and environmental scanning election microscopy (ESEM) images. The O-H and C-O stretching of the carboxylic acid groups and the C-O-C stretching groups were the main functional groups of the WAC resin participating in the Pb(II) binding. A visible change in the surface morphology observed from the ESEM images showed some fouling, an indicator of the 28% irreversible loss of capacity after regeneration It can be concluded that ion exchange with WAC resin is a satisfactory process for Pb(II) removal especially for low concentrations.

AB  - In Lithuania, ragweed is attributed to late-emerging weeds. The highest number of this species' representatives was identified during the 1985-2000 period, while currently only sporadic individuals are being found. The present paper assesses biometrical indicators (number and length of branches, length of male inflorescences and number of flower heads in them, pollen productivity, number of clusters of female flower heads, seed number and weight) of ragweed grown in a cultivated soil in Lithuania and to establish the interrelationships among the indicators tested. At all growth stages, the plants were cultivated in uncontrolled environmental conditions. Common ragweed formed shrubby plants exhibiting high seed and pollen productivity. A strong relationship between inflorescence length and number of male flower heads (r > 0.85, p < 0.01) was established. The longest male inflorescences (14.46 +/- 8.28 cm) were formed in the tops of branches of the first rank and the number of male flower heads was the highest (140 +/- 50) in them. A plant grown in a cultivated soil forms approximately 36000 flower heads. It was determined that 3408 +/- 2127 pollen grains are produced per anther. The plants grown in the conditions favourable for their development produce about 7.4 E + 09 pollen grains per plant. In the upper part of plant, there was established a strong relationship between the number of clusters of female flower heads and number of seeds (r > 0.75, p < 0.01). One branch of ragweed has on average 5-6 clusters of female flower heads in which from 1.6 +/- 0.3 to 2.3 +/- 0.7 seeds are formed, depending on the branch position on the plant. One plant was found to produce 6906 +/- 1692 seeds with an average weight of 2.98 mg per seed (SD = 0.36).)

AB  - The microbiological quality of water is currently assessed by search for fecal bacteria indicators. There is, however, a body of knowledge demonstrating that bacterial indicators are less resistant to environmental factors than human pathogenic viruses and therefore underestimate the viral risk. As river water is often used as a resource for drinking water production, it is particularly important to obtain a valid estimation of the health hazard, including specific viral risk. This work was conducted to compare the survival of infectious Poliovirus-] used as a pathogenic virus model to the persistence of, on the one hand, thermotolerant coliforms commonly used as indicators and on the other hand, to somatic coliphages and Poliovirus-] genome considered as potential indicators. We studied the behavior of infectious Poliovirus-1 and the three (potential) indicators of viral contamination in river water at three different temperatures (4degreesC,18degreesC and 25degreesC). This experiment was performed twice with river water sampled at two different periods, once in winter and once in summer. Our results showed that the survival of thermotolerant coliforms can be 1.5-fold lower than infectious Poliovirus-1. In contrast, under all our experimental conditions, somatic coliphages and Poliouirus-1 genome persisted longer than infectious Poliovirus-1, surviving, respectively, 2-6-fold and about 2-fold longer than infectious Poliovirus-1. According to our results exclusively based on survival capacity, somatic coliphages and viral genome, unlike thermotolerant coliforms appear to be better indicators of viral contamination in river water. Moreover, the disappearance of viral genome is well-correlated to that one of infectious virus irrespective of the conditions tested. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Both permit requirements and ecological assessments have been used to evaluate mitigation success. This analysis combines these two approaches to evaluate mitigation required under Section 404 of the United States Clean Water Act (CWA) and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, which allow developers to provide compensatory mitigation for unavoidable impacts to wetlands. This study reviewed permit files and conducted field assessments of mitigation sites to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation required by the US Army Corps of Engineers for all permits issued in Orange County, California from 1979 through 1993. The 535 permit actions approved during this period allowed 157 ha of impacts. Mitigation was required on 70 of these actions, with 152 ha of enhanced, restored, and created habitat required for 136 ha of impacts. In 15 permit actions, no mitigation project was constructed, but in only two cases was the originally permitted project built; the two cases resulted in an unmitigated loss of 1.6 ha. Of the remaining 55 sites, 55% were successful at meeting the permit conditions while 11% failed to do so. Based on a qualitative assessment of habitat quality, only 16% of the sites could be considered successful and 26% were considered failures. Thus, of the 126 ha of habitat lost due to the 55 projects, only 26 ha of mitigation was considered successful. The low success rate was not due to poor enforcement, although nearly half of the projects did not comply with all permit conditions. Mitigation success could best be improved by requiring mitigation plans to have performance standards based on habitat functions.

AB  - Wastewater contamination threatens the shellfish aquaculture industry by posing risks to public health. Multiple indicators of wastewater contamination, including fecal coliforms (fc), male-specific coliphage (MSC), dissolved nutrients, stable isotope ratios, and artificial sweeteners were analyzed to determine possible sources of wastewater to local shellfish farms. Samples were collected at a wastewater treatment plant outfall (WTPO), nonpoint residential, and agricultural areas of a tidal river, and tidal creek inflows adjacent to farms. To capture seasonal variation, we sampled under warm and cold, and wet and dry conditions. Fc ranged < 5-5250 CFU 100 mL(-1), NH4+ concentrations ranged up to 9.58 mu M, and delta N-15 ranged 1.4-7.8 parts per thousand across all sites and time periods. Fc and NH4+ were higher, and delta N-15 was lower in the cold wet period and near residential and agricultural areas. Acesulfame and sucralose concentrations ranged 0.004-0.05 mu g L-1 and up to > 0.8 mu g L-1, respectively, and did not correlate with other indicators but tended to be higher in residential areas and at the WTPO, supporting their value in differentiating human sewage from other sources. Shoreline disturbance during septic system upgrades may have inadvertently contributed bacterial indicators to shellfish farms. Overall, indicator source dominance depended on environmental conditions, with WTPO and residential sources conveying human-specific indicators to farms year-round, while agricultural and industrial sites contributed additional fc during cold wet periods. The use of multiple indicators will aid managers to detect and define wastewater sources, identify targets for monitoring or remediation, and manage shellfish areas in estuaries with a mosaic of land-derived wastewater sources.

AB  - Among all the recent improvements in the railway industry, ground vibration remains an important showstopper in metropolitan cities. In some particular cases, significant levels of vibration are felt by residents. The role of engineers is to propose mitigation solutions and to ensure that they are efficient in the long-term. This paper presents a numerical study of a large-scale building dose to underground networks. A two-step time-frequency prediction method for train-induced vibrations of a superstructure is proposed in this work. In the first step, the spatial train-track coupled dynamic model in time domain is established and then simulated to obtain the vertical and lateral rail supporting forces (fastener forces). In the second step, the discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of fastener forces are taken as the external loads of a finite element (FE) model of the track-tunnel-soil-building system to solve the building vibrations. On this basis, train-induced vibrations of the large-scale building are predicted under different train operation conditions, and two relevant standards are adopted to evaluate the building vibrations. Further, a base isolation measure, that consists in installing steel springs between the superstructure and the base, is employed to mitigate excessive building vibration. Results show that the underground train and track interaction could result in over-limit building vibrations. The train moving with a higher speed will deteriorate track vibration level and leads to more serious extent of over-limit vibrations of the larger-scale building. The base isolation measure can effectively reduce the excessive building vibrations, and also ensures the train-induced vibrations of the building to satisfy the relevant standard requirements under the worst train operation conditions.

AB  - Monitoring drought in real-time using minimal field data is a challenge for ecosystem management and conservation. Most methods require extensive data collection and in-situ calibration and accuracy is difficult to evaluate. Here, we demonstrated how the space-borne canopy "thermal stress", defined as surface-air temperature difference, provides a reliable surrogate for drought-induced water stress in vegetation. Using physics-based relationships that accommodate uncertainties, we showed how changes in canopy water flux from ground-based measurements relate to both the surface energy balance and remotely-sensed thermal stress. Field measurements of evapotranspiration in the southeastern and northwestern US verify this approach based on sensitivity of evapotranspiration to thermal stress in a large range of atmospheric and climate conditions. We found that a 1 degrees C change in the thermal stress is comparable to 1-1.2 mm day(-1) of evapotranspiration, depending on site and climate conditions. We quantified temporal and spatial sensitivity of evapotranspiration to the thermal stress and showed that it has the strongest relationship with evapotranspiration during warm and dry seasons, when monitoring drought is essential. Using only air and surface temperatures, we predicted the inter-annual anomaly in thermal stress across the contiguous United States over the course of 15 years and compared it with conventional drought indices. Among drought metrics that were considered in this study, the thermal stress had the highest correlation values. Our sensitivity results demonstrated that the thermal stress is a particularly strong indicator of water-use in warm seasons and regions. This simple metric can be used at varying time-scales to monitor surface evapotranspiration and drought in large spatial extents in near real-time.

AB  - Several models can be used in order to represent the hydrological processes in an urbanized catchment. Developing those models has been with respect to modeling objectives, spatiotemporal scale and hydroclimatic and spatial data availability. These models can be explicit, hence complex and data demanding, or rather implicit, but lacking direct linking between the model parameters and the urbanization features. Leaning toward simplicity, we aim at developing an efficient modeling tool that permits implicitly to take into account the spatial configuration (urban landscape vs. natural surfaces) and temporal evolution at the scale of an urbanized hydrological catchment. Development of such tool can be achieved by complexifying step-by-step a starting model structure that is not dedicated to urbanized contexts. Before conducting structure modifications, the first step to take is to determine which model functions can be modified. In this paper, we analyze the initial structure and the sensitivity of the parameters that it contains to the presence of urban surfaces within the catchment. For this end, a large sample of 365 French and American catchments was prepared. These catchments are of various sizes going from 1 to 5000 km(2) and represent a large panel of hydroclimatic conditions. The model was calibrated on two periods for each catchment, leading to 730 catchment-period couples for which the fraction of the urban cover was determined. The sensitivity analysis of the model parameters and other hydrological indicators with respect to this fraction was conducted for a selection of area-homogeneous 416 catchment-period couples. The results of this empirical study have shown (1) good model performances at the hourly time step regardless of the urban condition of the catchment and (2) that the model parameters and the hydrological indicators are significantly different with regards to intensively or slightly urbanized catchments, reflecting faster and greater streamflows for intensively urbanized situations.

AB  - In recent years, the concept of "asset life extension" has become increasingly important to safety critical industries including nuclear power, offshore oil and gas, petrochemical, renewable energy, rail transport, aviation, shipping, electricity distribution and transmission, etc. Extending the service life of industrial assets can offer a broad range of economic, technical, social and environmental benefits as compared to other end-of-life management strategies such as decommissioning and replacement of equipment. The aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive literature review and classification framework for academic research and industrial practices related to life extension of safety critical systems and installations. To achieve this, a systematic review is performed on the current state-of-the-art and new developments in the field of asset life extension in various industries. Major sources from which the literature can be gathered are identified and some assessment criteria are defined to categorize the selected publications. A classification framework is then proposed to support life extension decision making process with respect to the-type of asset and industry sectors where the concept of life extension has been of interest, condition assessment techniques used for qualification of assets for life extension, life prediction models, life extension strategies, etc. The current key issues in relation to the subject are outlined and the strengths and weaknesses of existing life extension decision-making tools are highlighted. This review contains an exhaustive list of scientific references on the topic, including articles published in journals, industry magazines, books and conference proceedings, university dissertations, technical reports and government documents. The proposed literature classification and analysis can help asset owners, asset managers, service providers, stakeholders, public policy-makers, environment protection authorities, and regulatory bodies gain valuable insights on asset life extension decision making procedures and methodologies.

AB  - Rangeland degradation has been identified as a serious concern in alpine regions of western China on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau (QTP). Numerous government-sponsored programs have been initiated, including many that feature long-term grazing prohibitions and some that call for eliminating pastoralism altogether. As well, government programs have long favored eliminating plateau pikas (Ochotona curzoniae), assumed to contribute to degraded conditions. However, vegetation on the QTP evolved in the presence of herbivory, suggesting that deleterious effects from grazing are, to some extent, compensated for by reduced plant-plant competition. We examined the dynamics of common steppe ecosystem species as well as physical indicators of rangeland stress by excluding livestock and reducing pika abundance on experimental plots, and following responses for 4 years. We established 12 fenced livestock exclosures within pastures grazed during winter by local pastoralists, and removed pikas on half of these. We established paired, permanent vegetation plots within and outside exclosures and measured indices of erosion and biomass of common plant species. We observed modest restoration of physical site conditions (reduced bare soil, erosion, greater vegetation cover) with both livestock exclusion and pika reduction. As expected in areas protected from grazing, we observed a reduction in annual productivity of plant species avoided by livestock and assumed to compete poorly when protected from grazing. Contrary to expectation, we observed similar reductions in annual productivity among palatable, perennial graminoids under livestock exclusion. The dominant grass, Stipa purpurea, displayed evidence of density-dependent growth, suggesting that intra-specific competition exerted a regulatory effect on annual production in the absence of grazing. Complete grazing bans on winter pastures in steppe habitats on the QTP may assist in the recovery of highly eroded pastures, but may not increase annual vegetative production.

AB  - Communication via substrate vibrations can convey information on conspecific presence, individual quality, group cohesion and/or allow for predator avoidance. Although studies have identified that various species use this modality, few studies on mammalian taxa have investigated whether the information contained in substrate vibrations is a reliable indicator of resource-holding potential (RHP). The grey seal, Halichoerus grypus, breeding colony at Donna Nook, U.K., is part of a limited geographical region where the Body Slap (BS) behaviour is performed during male-male conflicts. This behaviour is thought to have a mechanical component. We examined whether the magnitude of the BS substrate vibrations contained reliable information on male mass and size as measures of RHP, and whether reliability varied across environmental conditions. To test this, we deployed seismometers during the breeding season that recorded continuous seismic data over a frequency bandwidth of 0.03-500 Hz. Locations and times of BS events performed by individual males were recorded, matched with the seismic data, and a distance-corrected magnitude was calculated for each event. Our results demonstrate the BS generates a stereotyped seismic signature measurable up to 126.3 m away. We found a positive correlation between the maximum and mean magnitudes of the substrate-borne vibrations and a male's length. Dampness of the sand substrate had no effect on magnitude. Results of this study confirm that the maximum magnitude substrate vibrations generated by the BS behaviour is an indicator of male size and that the substrate-borne vibrations are reliable across varying environmental conditions.

AB  - This study represents the most comprehensive assessment of kinetic parameters for Karenia brevis to date as it encompasses natural populations sampled during three different bloom years in addition to cultured strains under controlled conditions. Nitrogen (N) uptake kinetics for ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-), urea, an amino acid mixture, individual amino acids (glutamate and alanine), and humic substrates were examined for the toxic red tide dinoflagellate, K. brevis, during short term incubations (0.5-1 h) using N-15 tracer techniques. Experiments were conducted using natural populations collected during extensive blooms along the West Florida Shelf in October 2001, 2002, and 2007, and in cultured strains (CCFWC 251 and CCFWC 267) obtained from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Institute culture collection. Kinetic parameters for the maximum uptake velocity (V-max), half-saturation concentration (K-s), and the affinity constant (alpha) were determined. The affinity constant is considered a more accurate indicator of substrate affinity at low concentrations. K. brevis took up all organic substrates tested, including N derived from humic substances. Uptake rates of the amino acid mixture and some NO3- incubations did not saturate even at the highest substrate additions (50-200 mu mol N L-1). Based upon the calculated alpha values, the greatest substrate preference was for NH4+ followed by NO3- >= urea, humic compounds and amino acids. The ability of K. brevis to utilize a variety of inorganic and organic substrates likely helps it flourish under a wide range of nutrient conditions from bloom initiation in oligotrophic waters offshore to bloom maintenance near shore where ambient nutrient concentrations may be orders of magnitude greater.

AB  - The continuously increasing solid waste generation worldwide calls for management strategies that integrate concerns for environmental sustainability. By quantifying environmental impacts of systems, life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool, which can contribute to answer that call. But how, where and to which extent has it been applied to solid waste management systems (SWMSs) until now, and which lessons can be learnt from the findings of these LCA applications? To address these questions, we performed a critical review of 222 published LCA studies of SWMS. We first analysed the geographic distribution and found that the published studies have primarily been concentrated in Europe with little application in developing countries. In terms of technological coverage, they have largely overlooked application of LCA to waste prevention activities and to relevant waste types apart from household waste, e.g. construction and demolition waste. Waste management practitioners are thus encouraged to abridge these gaps in future applications of LCA. In addition to this contextual analysis, we also evaluated the findings of selected studies of good quality and found that there is little agreement in the conclusions among them. The strong dependence of each SWMS on local conditions, such as waste composition or energy system, prevents a meaningful generalisation of the LCA results as we find it in the waste hierarchy. We therefore recommend stakeholders in solid waste management to regard LCA as a tool, which, by its ability of capturing the local specific conditions in the modelling of environmental impacts and benefits of a SWMS, allows identifying critical problems and proposing improvement options adapted to the local specificities.

AB  - Background: Traditional fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) measurement is too slow (>18 h) for timely swimmer warnings.
   Objectives: Assess relationship of rapid indicator methods (qPCR) to illness at a marine-beach impacted by urban runoff.
   Methods: We measured baseline and two-week health in 9525 individuals visiting Doheny Beach 2007-08. Illness rates were compared (swimmers vs. non-swimmers). FIB measured by traditional (Enterococcus spp. by EPA Method 1600 or Enterolert (TM), fecal coliforms, total coliforms) and three rapid qPCR assays for Enterococcus spp. (Taqman, Scorpion-1, Scorpion-2) were compared to health. Primary bacterial source was a creek flowing untreated into ocean; the creek did not reach the ocean when a sand berm formed. This provided a natural experiment for examining FIB-health relationships under varying conditions.
   Results: We observed significant increases in diarrhea (OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.29-2.80 for swallowing water) and other outcomes in swimmers compared to non-swimmers. Exposure (body immersion, head immersion, swallowed water) was associated with increasing risk of gastrointestinal illness (GI). Daily GI incidence patterns were different: swimmers (2-day peak) and non-swimmers (no peak). With berm-open, we observed associations between GI and Traditional and rapid methods for Enterococcus; fewer associations occurred when berm status was not considered.
   Conclusions: We found increased risk of GI at this urban runoff beach. When FIB source flowed freely (berm-open), several traditional and rapid indicators were related to illness. When FIB source was weak (berm-closed) fewer illness associations were seen. These different relationships under different conditions at a single beach demonstrate the difficulties using these indicators to predict health risk. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - P>1. Physiological responses to environmental stress such as adrenocortical hormones and cellular stress proteins have recently emerged as potentially powerful tools for investigating physiological effects of avian food limitation. However, little is known about the physiological stress responses of free-living nestling birds to environmental variation in food availability.
   2. We experimentally tested how hydrologically mediated changes in food availability affect the physiological stress responses of juvenile white ibises Eudocimus albus in a fluctuating wetland. We provided supplementary food to free-living nestlings during 2 years with contrasting hydrologic and food availability conditions, and used plasma (PCORT) and faecal (FCORT) corticosterone and heat shock proteins (HSP60 and HSP70) from first-hatched (A-nestlings) and second-hatched (B-nestlings) to detect relatively short- to long-term responses to food limitation.
   3. Nestling physiological stress responses were relatively low in all treatments during the year with optimal food availability, but PCORT, FCORT and HSP60 levels increased during the poor food year. FCORT and HSP60 responses were clearly due to nutritional condition as elevated concentrations were evident primarily in control nestlings. Significant year by hatch order interactions for both FCORT and HSP60 revealed that these increases were largely incurred by B-nestlings. FCORT and HSP60 responses were also well developed early in neonatal development and remained elevated for the duration of the experiment suggesting a chronic stress response. PCORT and HSP70 were less informative stress responses.
   4. The nutritionally mediated increases in FCORT and HSP60 provide compelling evidence that white ibis nestlings can be physiologically affected by environmental food levels. FCORT and HSP60 are effective indicators of nutritional mediated stress for nestling white ibises and potentially for other species prone to capture or handling stress.

AB  - Spatial and temporal variations of free CO2 concentrations in surface waters are mainly controlled by dynamic processes encompassing terrestrial inputs and in-stream biotic cycling. Free CO2 can be expressed as 'excess partial pressure of CO2' (epCO(2)), indicating supersaturation or under-saturation with respect to atmospheric CO,. Seasonal patterns of epCO(2) at sites draining nested upland catchments between 3.40 and 1837 km(2) were assessed within the River Dee basin in NE Scotland. EpCO(2) values ranged from 0.14 at the lowermost site on the mainstem in autumn to 12.7 on a major tributary during spring.
   A seasonality index was derived to describe contrasting winter/spring maxima and summer/autumn minima as annual mean epCO(2) values could not clearly distinguish between different sites. Seasonal differences tended to increase downstream as progressive changes in physicochemical conditions enhanced the influence Of autotrophic communities. However, perturbations to this continuum occurred as CO2 inputs from high DOC, heterotrophic tributaries and land-use changes between open moorland and forest affected downstream continuity. Major tributaries showed reduced differences between seasons compared to the mainstem. Smaller headwaters indicated a lack of seasonality as high connectivity of responsive, peaty soils enabled continual inputs of terrestrially derived free CO2 to streams concomitant with limited autotrophic CO2 removal, maintaining epCO(2) > 1 throughout.
   Seasonality of epCO(2) was mainly driven by the ability of in-stream biota to consume CO2 during optimal conditions in summer/autumn. This was confirmed by multiple linear regression analysis, which indicated that, apart from catchment area, baseflow and biotic activity indicators were the best predictors of epCO(2) seasonality characteristics at any particular stage of the river system.

AB  - We examined the effects of past and future climate change on natural snow cover in southeastern mainland Australia and assessed the role of snowmaking in adapting to projected changes in snow conditions. Snow-depth data from 4 alpine sites from 1957 to 2002 indicated a weak decline in maximum snow depths at 3 sites and a moderate decline in mid- to late-season snow depths (August to September). Low-impact and high-impact climate change scenarios were prepared for 2020 and 2050 and used as input for a climate-driven snow model. The total area with an average of at least 1 d of snow cover per year was projected to decrease by 10 to 39% by 2020, and by 22 to 85 % by 2050. By 2020, the length of the ski season was projected to have decreased by 10 to 60 %, while by 2050 the decrease was 15 to 99 %. Based on target snow-depth profiles from May to September nominated by snowmaking managers at various ski resorts, the snow model simulated the amount of snow that is needed to be made each day, taking into account natural snowfall, snow-melt and the pre-existing natural snow depth. By the year 2020, an increase of 11 to 27 % in the number of snow guns would be required for the low impact scenario, and 71 to 200 % for the high impact scenario. This corresponds to changes in total snow volume of 5 to 17 % for the low impact scenario to 23 to 62 % for the high impact scenario. Therefore, with sufficient investment in snow guns, the Australian ski industry may be able to manage the effect of projected climate change on snow cover until at least 2020.

AB  - This bench-scale study investigated the passage of particle- associated bacteriophage through a dual-media (anthracite -sand) filter over a complete filter cycle and the effect on subsequent ultraviolet (UV) disinfection. Two model viruses, bacteriophages MS2 and T4, were considered. The water matrix was de-chlorinated tap water with either kaolin or Aldrich (R)) humic acid (AHA) added and coagulated with alum to form floc before filtration. The turbidity of the influent flocculated water was 6.4 +/- 1.5 NTU. Influent and filter effluent turbidity and particle counts were measured as well as headloss across the filter media. Filter effluent samples were collected for phage enumeration during three filter cycle stages: (i) filter ripening; (ii) stable operation; and (iii) end of filter cycle. Stable filter operation was defined according to a filter effluent turbidity goal of < 0.3 NTU. Influent and filter effluent samples were subsequently exposed to UV light (254 nm) at 40 mJ/cm(2) using a low pressure UV collimated beam. The study found statistically significant differences (alpha = 0.05) in the quantity of particle- associated phage present in the filter effluent during the three stages of filtration. There was reduced UV disinfection efficiency due to the presence of particle- associated phage in the filter effluent in trials with bacteriophage MS2 and humic acid floc. Unfiltered influent water samples also resulted in reduced UV inactivation of phage relative to particle-free control conditions for both phages. Trends in filter effluent turbidity corresponded with breakthrough of particle-associated phage in the filter effluent. The results therefore suggest that maintenance of optimum filtration conditions upstream of UV disinfection is a critical barrier to particle-associated viruses. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Salads Mediana lacustrine sequence, central Ebro Basin, Spain (41 degrees 30'10 "N, 0 degrees 44'W, 350 m a.s.l.) provides an example of the potential and limitations of saline lake records as palaeoclimate proxies in the semi-arid Mediterranean region. Sedimentary facies analyses, chemical stratigraphy, stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta C-13) of authigenic carbonates, delta C-13 values of bulk organic matter and pollen analyses from sediment cores provide paleohydrological and vegetation change reconstructions for the Lateglacial and Late Holocene in the central Ebro basin. A preliminary chronology is based on Pb-210 and C-14 AMS dates. The lacustrine sequence is composed of three sedimentary Sections. The Lower Section was deposited in a permanent saline to brackish lake. This stage represents the most humid period in the record and it was accompanied by the expansion of temperate trees (particularly Corylus). The Middle Section was deposited in an ephemeral playa-lake complex. Frequent subaerial exposure conditions favour the colonisation of the playa lake floor by Chenopodiaceae during a low water table period. This interval reflects the most arid conditions ill the Salads Mediana record, including the current environment. A secondary temperate tree expansion occurred after the maximum aridity period. Aquatic plants and cyanobacterial mats spread in the lake during periods of raised water tables. This paleohydrological and vegetational evolution attests to large changes in effective moisture during the Lateglacial in the semi-arid northeastern Spain. The abundance of Corylus during the Lateglacial indicates that refugia for temperate trees were located along the Ebro valley during the Last Glacial Maximum. The Holocene sediments in the Salada Mediana records have been eroded, and the Upper Section represents deposition during the last few centuries. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA.

AB  - Escherichia coli levels in recreational waters are often used to predict when fecal-associated pathogen levels are a human health risk. The reach of the Chattahoochee River that flows through the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area (CRNRA), located in the Atlanta-metropolitan area, is a popular recreation area that frequently exceeds the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency beach action value (BAV) for E. coli. A BacteriALERT program has been implemented to provide real-time E. coli estimates in the reach and notify the public of potentially harmful levels of fecal-associated pathogens as indicated by surrogate models based on real-time turbidity measurements from continuous water quality monitoring stations. However, E. coli does not provide information about the sources of fecal contamination and its accuracy as a human health indicator is questionable when sources of contamination are non-human. The objectives of our study were to investigate, within the Park and surrounding watersheds, seasonal and precipitation-related patterns in microbial source tracking marker concentrations of possible sources (human, dog, and ruminant), assess correlations between source contamination levels and culturable E. coli levels, determine which sources best explained model-based E. coli estimates above the BAV and detection of esp2 (a marker for the esp gene associated with pathogenic strains of Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis), and investigate associations between source contamination levels and land use features. Three BacteriALERT sites on the Chattahoochee River were sampled six times per season in the winter and summer from December 2015 through September 2017, and 11 additional stream sites (synoptic sites) from the CRNRA watershed were sampled once per season. Samples were screened with microbial source tracking (MST) quantitative PCR (qPCR) markers for humans (HF183 Taqman), dogs (DogBact), and ruminants (Rum2Bac), the esp2 qPCR marker, and culturable E. coli. At the BacteriALERT sites, HF183 Taqman concentrations were higher under wet conditions DogBact concentrations were greater in the winter and under wet conditions, and Rum2Bac concentrations were comparatively low throughout the study with no difference across seasons or precipitation conditions. Concentrations of HF183 Taqman, DogBact, and Rum2Bac were positively correlated with culturable E. coli concentrations; however, DogBact had the largest R-2 value among the three markers, and the forward stepwise regression indicated it was the best predictor of culturable E. coli concentrations at the BacteriALERT sites. Recursive partitioning indicated that BAV exceedances of model-based E. coli estimates were best explained by DogBact concentrations >= 3 gene copies per mL (CN/mL). Detections of esp2 at BacteriALERT sites were best explained by DogBact concentrations >= 11 CN/mL, while detections of esp2 at synoptic sites were best explained by HF183 Taqman >= 29 CN/mL. At the synoptic sites, HF183 Taqman levels were associated with wastewater treatment plant density. However, this relationship was driven primarily by a single site, suggesting possible conveyance issues in that catchment. esp2 detections at synoptic sites were positively associated with development within a 2-km radius and negatively associated with development within the catchment, suggesting multiple sources of esp2 in the watershed. DogBact and Rum2Bac were not associated with the land use features included in our analyses.
   Implications for Park management include: 1) fecal contamination levels were highest during wet conditions and in the off season when fewer visitors are expected to be participating in water-based recreation, 2) dogs are likely contributors to fecal contamination in the CRNRA and may be sources of pathogenic bacteria indicating further investigation of the origins of this contamination may be warranted as would be research to understand the human health risks from exposure to dog fecal contamination, and 3) high levels of the human marker at one site in the CRNRA watershed suggests more extensive monitoring in that catchment may locate the origin of human fecal contamination detected during this study.

AB  - The potential effect of climate change on regional suitability for cocoa cultivation is a serious economic concern for West Africa-especially for Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire, whose cocoa cultivation accounts for respectively similar to 19% and similar to 45% of world production. Here, we present a modelling and observational study of cocoa net primary productivity (NPP) in present day and future West African climates. Our analysis uses a data assimilation technique to parameterise a process-based land-surface model. The parameterisation is based on laboratory observations of cocoa, grown under both ambient and elevated CO2. Present day and end of 21st century cocoa cultivation scenarios are produced by driving the parameterised land-surface model with output from a high-resolution climate model. This represents a significant advance on previous work, because unlike the CMIP5 models, the high-resolution model used in this study accurately captures the observed precipitation seasonality in the cocoa-growing regions of West Africa-a key sensitivity for perennials like cocoa. We find that temperature is projected to increase significantly and precipitation is projected to increase slightly, although not in all parts of the region of interest. We find, furthermore, that the physiological effect of higher atmospheric CO2 concentration ameliorates the impacts of high temperature and variation in precipitation thereby reducing some of the negative impacts of climate change and maintaining NPP in West Africa, for the whole 21st Century, even under a high emissions scenario. Although NPP is an indicator of general vegetation condition, it is not equivalent to yield or bean quality. The study presented here is, nevertheless, a strong basis for further field and modelling studies of cultivation under elevated CO2 conditions.

AB  - Marine coastal areas have high social-economic relevance and ensuring the good quality of these areas has gained importance in the past decades due to the increase of anthropogenic pressures. Understanding the dynamics of these areas is crucial to support management decisions. In this context, phytoplankton communities are generally used as key indicators of environmental quality as they respond in short time-scales and are at the base of food webs. This work intends to improve our understanding on how phytoplankton communities respond to environmental conditions, particularly in upwelling areas. Seawater samples were collected from Algarrobo Bay, Central Chile, for both phytoplankton pigments and microscopy analysis. Data were analyzed in combination with physico-chemical parameters and two distinct hydrographic regions were identified for the study area: i) a region occupying most of the northern bay section, characterized by lower temperatures and dissolved oxygen (DO), higher concentration of nutrients and higher N:P, where a mixed community with diatoms, chrysophytes, cryptophytes, haptophytes and other small flagellates were observed; and ii) a central-southern section, with higher temperatures and DO, lower nutrients and lower N:P, where diatoms, in particular the centric diatom Chaetoceros Ehrenberg, 1844 sp. (similar to 92.5% on average), dominated the phytoplankton assemblage. Other common but much less abundant diatom genus included Skeletonema Greville, 1865, Eucampia Ehrenberg, 1839, Dactyliosolen Castracane, 1886, Nitzschia Hassall, 1845, Cylindrotheca Rabenhorst, 1859 and Asterionellopsis Round, 1990. Apart from diatoms, the most abundant taxa belonged to flagellates, mainly chrysophytes (228.4 x 10(3) cells L-1 on average) and cryptophytes (213 x 10(3) cells L-1 on average). Overall, results suggest that the southern part of the Algarmbo Bay, with higher residence times and nutrient discharges, may act as an upwelling shadow area, where phytoplankton species can accumulate.

AB  - Minimizing the risks associated with manureborne pathogenic microorganisms requires an understanding of microbial survival under realistic field conditions. The objective of this 3-year study was to assess the fate of Salmonella (SALM) and fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), E. coli (EC) and enterococci (ENT), in glacial till-derived soils, after application of poultry manure (PM) to cornfields under chisel-plowed (CP) or no-till (NT) management. From 2010 to 2012, soil samples were obtained each spring at 0-15- and 15-30-cm depths, to determine whether over-wintering of target bacteria had occurred. Sampling was followed by application of PM at low (PM1) and high (PM2) rates, based on nitrogen application goals. In 2012, soil samples were collected 21, 42, and 158 days after manure application (DAM), to assess the effects of time, application rates, and tillage on frequency of detection and concentrations of target bacteria. Despite dry conditions, all three target organisms were detected 158 DAM in 2012, and detection of these organisms in spring soil samples from manured plots in 2011 and 2012, nearly a full year after PM application, suggests that these organisms can persist in the soil environment long after application. The highest SALM concentration (790 cfu/gdry weight) and detection rate (25%) was found in PM2 plots 42 DAM. SALM were detected more frequently in CP plots (20%) compared to NT plots (5%). In contrast, tillage practices had no apparent effect on EC or ENT survival, as indicated by both soil, and decay rates estimated from tile-water bacteria concentrations. Decay rate constants (mu) ranged from 0.044 to 0.065 day(-1) for EC and 0.010 to 0.054 day(-1) for ENT.

AB  - Exotic plant invasions threaten ecosystems globally, but we still know little about the specific consequences for animals. Invasive plants can alter the quality of breeding habitat for songbirds, thereby impacting important demographic traits such as dispersal, philopatry, and age structure. These demographic effects may in turn alter song-learning conditions to affect song structure and diversity. We studied Chipping Sparrows (Spizella passerina) breeding in six savannas that were either dominated by native vegetation or invaded by spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe), an exotic forb known to diminish food resources and reproductive success. Here, we report that the prevalence of older birds was relatively low in knapweed-invaded habitat, where recruitment of yearlings compensated for diminished site fidelity to sustain territory abundance. In both habitat types, yearling males tended to adopt songs similar to their neighbors and match the songs of older birds rather than introducing new song types, a pattern seen in many songbird species. As a consequence, in invaded habitat where age structure was skewed away from older birds serving as potential song models, yearlings converged on fewer song types. Similarity of songs among individuals was significantly higher and the overall number of song types averaged nearly 20% lower in invaded relative to native habitat. Degradation of habitat quality generally impacts site fidelity and age ratios in migratory songbirds and hence may commonly alter song-learning conditions. Associated shifts in song attributes known to influence reproductive success could in turn enforce demographic declines driven by habitat degradation. Local song structure may serve as an important indicator of habitat quality and population status for songbirds.

AB  - Drought is a major constraint to faba bean (Vicia faba L.) production, and there are many mechanisms by which leaves can regulate water loss. Our primary objective was to test if the origin of the faba bean accessions, from drought-prone and non-drought-prone environments, was associated with differences in measurable aspects of stomatal morphology and physiology related to water use. Two sets, each consisting of 201 faba bean accessions, were chosen from environments with contrasting seasonal moisture profiles following the focused identification of germplasm strategy (FIGS), and then screened under well watered conditions. From these, two subsets of 10 accessions each were chosen to test for differences in response to drought. Parameters related to stomatal function and water status were measured. The dry-adapted set had bigger stomata, higher leaf relative water content (LRWC) and cooler leaves under well watered conditions. Stomatal density and stomatal area per unit area of leaflet were negatively correlated with gas exchange parameters and positively correlated with intrinsic water use efficiency. Drought caused stomatal densities to increase in the dry set while stomatal length decreased in both sets. The moisture deficit was sufficient to decrease gas exchange in both sets to similar levels, but the dry-adapted set maintained warmer leaves and a higher LRWC that showed no significant correlations with leaf morphology or gas exchange, demonstrating more effective stomatal regulation. The results also support that collection site data from the environment where genetic resources are collected can be used as indicators of adaptive traits in an herbaceous annual species.

AB  - The effects of climate change on high latitude regions are becoming increasingly evident, particularly in the rapid decline of sea ice cover in the Arctic. Many high latitude species dependent on sea ice are being forced to adapt to changing habitats. Harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus) are an indicator species for changing high-latitude ecosystems. This study analyzed multiple factors including ice cover, demographics, and genetic diversity, which could affect harp seal stranding rates along the eastern coast of the United States. Ice cover assessments were conducted for the month of February in the Gulf of St. Lawrence whelping region from 1991-2010 using remote sensing data, and harp seal stranding data were collected over the same time period. Genetic diversity, which may affect how quickly species can adapt to changing climates, was assessed using ten microsatellite markers to determine mean d(2) in a subset of stranded and by-caught (presumably healthy) seals sampled along the northeast U. S. coast. Our study found a strong negative correlation (R-2 = 0.49) between ice cover in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and yearling harp seal strandings, but found no relationship between sea ice conditions and adult strandings. Our analysis revealed that male seals stranded more frequently than females during the study period and that this relationship was strongest during light ice years. In contrast, we found no significant difference in mean d(2) between stranded and by-caught harp seals. The results demonstrate that sea ice cover and demographic factors have a greater influence on harp seal stranding rates than genetic diversity, with only a little of the variance in mean d(2) among stranded seals explained by ice cover. Any changes in these factors could have major implications for harp seals, and these findings should be considered in the development of future management plans for the Arctic that incorporate climate variability.

AB  - Most species of Dalechampia vines (Euphorbiaceae) attract bee pollinators with terpenoid resins secreted by a gland-like structure in the inflorescence. In some species, pollinating bees appear to preferentially visit inflorescences (blossoms) with large resin-producing glands, whereas in other species bees preferentially visit blossoms with large involucral bracts. In this study, the reliability of bract and gland size as signals of the quantity of resin produced in one species, D. scandens, was assessed. Whether resin secretion has a cost with respect to the number or mass of the seeds produced by a blossom was also examined.
   Measurements were made of bract size, gland size and the amount of resin secreted by blossoms of D. scandens maintained in a common environment, and the relationships between these traits were analysed. Resin production was also manipulated, and the effects of the manipulation were tested on seed set and seed mass.
   The amount of resin produced was better predicted by the size of the gland than by the size of the bract. Furthermore, when the effect of gland size was accounted for, bract size only weakly predicted the amount of resin produced. Neither an increase in resin secretion (by daily removal of the resin) nor a decrease (by removal of the resin gland) affected seed set or seed mass detectably, but resin production correlated positively with mean seed mass at the individual level once the size of the resin gland was accounted for.
   Gland size is a better indicator of the amount of reward than bract size, although the latter remained an honest signal of the quantity of resin produced. Resin secretion has no detectable cost in terms of seed production, but may be condition dependent, as suggested by a positive correlation with seed mass at the individual level.

AB  - An experiment was conducted to determine the effects of period on the performance, immunity, and some stress indicators of broilers fed 2 levels of protein and stocked at a normal or high stocking density. Experimental treatments consisted of a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with 2 levels of prebiotic (with or without prebiotic), 2 levels of dietary CP [NRC-recommended or low CP level (85% of NRC-recommended level)], and 2 levels of stocking density (10 birds/m(2) as the normal density or 16 birds/m(2) as the high density), for a total of 8 treatments. Each treatment had 5 replicates (cages). Birds were reared in 3-tiered battery cages with wire floors in an opensided housing system under natural tropical conditions. Housing and general management practices were similar for all treatment groups. Starter and finisher diets in mash form were fed from 1 to 21 d and 22 to 42 d of age, respectively. Supplementation with a prebiotic had no significant effect on performance, immunity, and stress indicators (blood glucose, cholesterol, corticosterone, and heterophil: lymphocyte ratio). Protein level significantly influenced broiler performance but did not affect immunity or stress indicators (except for cholesterol level). The normal stocking density resulted in better FCR and also higher antibody titer against Newcastle disease compared with the high stocking density. However, density had no significant effect on blood levels of glucose, cholesterol, corticosterone, and the heterophil: lymphocyte ratio. Significant interactions between protein level and stocking density were observed for BW gain and final BW. The results indicated that, under the conditions of this experiment, dietary addition of a prebiotic had no significant effect on the performance, immunity, and stress indicators of broilers.

AB  - 1. Carotenoids transferred from mother to offspring may enhance the quality of the offspring. Whether such maternal effects occur in guppies (Poecilia reticulata) has an important bearing on mate preference evolution.
   2. By raising female guppies from birth on different dietary carotenoid levels, we examined the pattern of carotenoid allocation to maternal tissue (skin) vs. eggs. Skin carotenoid content was only weakly affected by carotenoid intake while egg carotenoid content was strongly affected.
   3. We then tested for effects of maternal carotenoid intake on several measures of offspring quality, including size and condition at birth, juvenile growth rate, and the size, condition, skin carotenoid content and colouration of mature sons. To test for interactions between maternal and offspring carotenoid intake, broods were split and offspring were reared on one of two carotenoid levels.
   4. Offspring carotenoid intake had the expected effects on male colouration, but otherwise we found no evidence that maternal or offspring carotenoid intake influences offspring quality. It remains possible that maternal carotenoids affect offspring fitness parameters that we did not measure or that such effects depend on environmental factors that were absent in our laboratory aquaria.
   5. Our review of the literature on maternal carotenoid effects in birds and fishes suggests that such effects may be taxon-specific. Thus, it seems unwarranted to assume that an adaptive trade-off necessarily exists between allocation of carotenoids to eggs vs. maternal tissues. Alternative hypotheses, such as the possibility that eggs provide a means of excreting excess carotenoids, also merit consideration.
   6. Our results indirectly support the indicator model of mate preference evolution by casting doubt on an alternative hypothesis that requires females to benefit more from consuming carotenoids than males do.

AB  - Background. The southern African tick shell, Nassarius kraussianus (Dunker, 1846), has been identified as being the earliest known ornamental object used by human beings. Shell beads dated from similar to 75,000 years ago (Pleistocene era) were found in a cave located on South Africa's south coast. Beads made from N. kraussianus shells have also been found in deposits in this region dating from the beginning of the Holocene era (<10,000 years ago). These younger shells were significantly smaller, a phenomenon that has been attributed to a change in human preference. Methodology/Principal Findings. We investigated two alternative hypotheses explaining the difference in shell size: a) N. kraussianus comprises at least two genetic lineages that differ in size; b) the difference in shell size is due to phenotypic plasticity and is a function of environmental conditions. To test these hypotheses, we first reconstructed the species' phylogeographic history, and second, we measured the shell sizes of extant individuals throughout South Africa. Although two genetic lineages were identified, the sharing of haplotypes between these suggests that there is no genetic basis for the size differences. Extant individuals from the cool temperate west coast had significantly larger shells than populations in the remainder of the country, suggesting that N. kraussianus grows to a larger size in colder water. Conclusion/Significance. The decrease in fossil shell size from Pleistocene to Holocene was likely due to increased temperatures as a result of climate change at the beginning of the present interglacial period. We hypothesise that the sizes of N. kraussianus fossil shells can therefore serve as indicators of the climatic conditions that were prevalent in a particular region at the time when they were deposited. Moreover, N. kraussianus could serve as a biomonitor to study the impacts of future climate change on coastal biota in southern Africa.

AB  - Questions: 1. Do different management types (i.e. hay meadow, silage meadow, meadow-pasture, pasture) have different impact on the size and composition of the seed bank of mesic grassland (Arrhenatheretalia)? 2. How strong is the effect of management on the seed bank in relation to above-ground vegetation, edaphic factors and land-use history? 3. Are there differences in C-S-R plant strategy types and seed longevity under different management regimes?
   Location: Lahn-Dill Highlands in central-western Germany.
   Methods: Above-ground vegetation and the soil seed bank of 63 plots (at 21 sites) in mesic grasslands were studied. Differences between management types in quantitative seed bank traits and functional characteristics were tested by ANOVA. The impact of management, above-ground vegetation, site conditions and land-use history on seed bank composition were analysed by partial CCA.
   Results: Management had no significant impact on species richness and density of the seed bank but significantly influenced their floristic composition and functional characteristics. CCA revealed that even after adjustment for soil chemical parameters and above-ground vegetation management still had significant impact on seed bank composition. ANOVA revealed that silage meadows contained higher proportions of R-strategy compared to hay meadows. In contrast, in hay meadows and meadow-pastures proportions of S-strategy were higher than in silage meadows.
   Conclusions: The type of grassland management has little impact on quantitative seed bank traits. Management types with a high degree of disturbance lead to an increase of species following a ruderal strategy in the seed bank. Irrespective of management type only a limited proportion of characteristic grassland species is likely to re-establish from the seed bank after disappearance from above-ground vegetation.

AB  - The paper describes a modelling study of near-shore coastal waters, undertaken to assess the impact of various bacterial input loads on the receiving waters in a coastal basin in the UK. Total and faecal coliforms, used as the indicators for bathing water quality under the European Union (EU) Bathing Water Directive, were numerically modelled using a 2D depth integrated hydro-environmental model. Details are given of the governing equations and solution methods used in the numerical model, together with a discussion of the recent development in faecal bacterial indicator modelling. Details are also given of a field data collection exercise, which involved initially collecting existing information on effluent input loads and followed by an intensive field survey. Using the water quality model, the mortality rate of the pathogen bacteria was investigated. Three methods were used to represent the relationship between the decay rate and the level of solar radiation including: a constant decay rate, day- and night-time decay rates and a solar radiation related time varying decay rate. Relatively close agreement between model predicted and measured total and faecal coliform concentration distributions were obtained for different day- and night-time decay rates and time varying decay rates. No significant differences were found in the optimum decay rates for total and faecal coliform levels. Finally, the impact of the individual inputs on the bathing water quality of the basin was also statistically and numerically investigated. Results showed that the River Irvine was the most significant input during high river flows, and that under these conditions the bathing waters were likely to fail to comply with the European Union Bathing Water Directive. For base river flow conditions the Meadowhead effluent input was found to be critical for both total and faecal coliform level predictions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A series of soil survey interpretive procedures, or pedotransfer functions (PTFs), are presented that follow from the hypothesis corroborated in the companion paper that the saturated compressive behavior of structured and of corresponding remolded agricultural soils in southern Ontario were strongly related. The three PTFs were useful in characterizing the degree of overconsolidation as a physical indicator of soil quality on a regional basis. PTF1 identified soils as being highly overconsolidated when the void ratio difference between the normal compression Line (NCL) at unit stress and e(0) exceeded 0.36. The preconsolidation stress (sigma(c)') of a soil was estimated from the dry bulk density measured in situ and from other soil properties needed to estimate the NCL of remolded soils (PTF2) or the virgin compression line of structured soils (PTF3). The PTFs were tested on a data set comprised of soil horizons characterized in five county-level soil inventories that meet the minimum PTF data requirements and other defined criteria (n = 210). An PTFs showed that the degree of soil overconsolidation increased significantly (P < 0.0001) with depth and with increasing clay content. For PTF2; the mean estimated (T: for the Ap horizons (n = 47) was only 20 kPa due to the effect of repeated tillage and natural turbational processes. The untilled solum (B) horizons were found to be in a less consolidated condition than the C horizon subsoils (mean sigma(c)' = 97 and 138 kFa, respectively). This suggested that effective stresses from wheel traffic and tillage operations have generally been no greater than those originating from natural causes in this region, Many of the clay-rich subsoils were quite overconsolidated (mean sigma(c)' > 150 kPa), whereas the coarser textured soils appeared to be closer to a normally consolidated condition, PTF3 corroborated most of these findings.

AB  - Analysis of small mammal distribution in Western Siberia is often carried out for a group of species as a whole or for one species in a relatively small area. In both cases, the research results are species essays with a brief description of the spatial heterogeneity of quantitative indicators to the placement of animals on the accepted level of data aggregation. The influence of environmental gradients on the distribution of species or groups is usually assessed by given natural and anthropogenic factors; their composition is not formalized and varies depending on the objectives of a particular study. All of the above makes it difficult to generalize the results of studies of the species distribution in different areas, as well as the comparison of data on the spatial variability of biotopic preferences and its causes for different species in the same territory.
   The main tasks of our research were to compare biotopic preferences, abundance and number across all species of small mammals and to develop a general classification reflecting similarities and differences in their distribution across Western Siberia as a whole. The study is not ecological, but zoogeographic, so the terms should be uniform, at least in seasonal terms. The main zoogeographic meaning of the work is to identify the general patterns of distribution of the studied species and environmental factors that correlate with the spatial heterogeneity of their abundance. Therefore, the preliminary division of the territory into habitats, as well as key sites and time of observations should be uniform. The collected and analyzed information can be used for environmental purposes, in assessing the territorial variability of prey resources for hunting birds and commercially sold fur-bearing mammals, the number of which depends significantly on the level of abundance of small mammals. The aim of this research was to analyze the distribution of Siberian brown lemming in Western Siberia and to assess the impact of the identified environmental factors on its abundance heterogeneity using population methods and approaches.
   The methods and approaches implemented to study the animal population were successfully used to analyze the distribution of individual species of small mammals. It allows to secure within the limits of strict separation of habitats according to similarities in the abundance and avoid their subjective dividing into groups. The distribution of the Siberian brown lemming was analyzed by the results of small mammal surveys carried out in the second half of the summer from 1954 to 2016 in the plains and mountains of Western Siberia. The abundance indices for all years were averaged by groups of vegetation maps within the zones, subzones and subzonal belts of the plain and mountain provinces. The spatial-typological organization of the biotope distribution was revealed by means of factor classification, one of the methods of cluster analysis. As a measure of similarity, the Jaccard-Naumov coefficient for quantitative characteristics was chosen. To evaluate the relationship of habitat classification, we used the linear quality approximation of the coupling matrix. The total number of Siberian lemming was obtained by converting the relative abundance indicators into absolute ones taking into account the areas of natural zones, subzones and subzonal belts. The relative error and asymmetric confidence intervals of the generalized population estimate are calculated with a confidence probability of 0.9.
   Siberian brown lemming within the West Siberian plain is widespread to the North of the typical Northern taiga (See Fig. 1). It was not encountered in the Altai and Kuznetsk-Salair mountain regions, although literary sources note its presence in the mountain tundra of the Northern Urals. In structured classification, five types of habitats are identified according to their degree of favorability for the Siberian brown lemming: optimal, suboptimal, subpessimal, pessimal and extreme (See Fig. 2). Most of its abundance is in the tundra and lowland meadow-willow-moss communities in the Northern moss tundra subzone belt (See Fig. 3A). Slightly less favorable are habitats of Arctic tundras. The next type includes swamps to the North of the Middle taiga and non-forest biotopes from low-shrub subarctic tundras to the Northern taiga light forests. The environmental conditions in pre-tundra open woodlands and the Northern taiga light forests are severe for the Siberian lemming. The last, extreme, type of favorability combines areas of the plain to the South of the Northern taiga light forests and mountain areas, where this lemming does not enter.
   Using the cluster analysis, the list of environmental factors is revealed: heat availability (the mode of zoning and subzoning on the plain, altitudinal zonation and provinciality in the mountains), zoning and subzoning on the plain separately, macro relief of areas (plain-mountains), type of vegetation, forest cover degree, swampiness, pouring in the flood and human development degree. The greatest connection with the heterogeneity of the abundance of Siberian brown lemming is traced for heat availability and zoning and subzoning (See Table 1). The other factors are less significant, their local influence is undoubted, but small, in general, for the studied area. Multiple evaluation of the relationship with all identified environmental factors and their combinations gives 78% of the recorded variance (multiple correlation coefficient 0.88).
   In total, the number of Siberian brown lemming in Western Siberia is estimated as 374 million individuals, almost 90% is concentrated in the Northern subarctic tundra of the plain (See Fig. 3B, Table 2). The total number of species depends on the areas of habitats of different favorability by zones, subzones and subzonal belts. Spatial variability of relative abundance (individuals per 100 cylinder-days) and total number (million individuals) is diamond-shaped. These values are declining from the Northern moss subarctic tundras to the North, in Arctic tundras, and to the South from low-shrub subarctic tundras to the Northern taiga light forests.

AB  - Mangroves, a blue carbon ecosystem between land and ocean in the (sub)tropics, are sensitive to changes in climate and the sea level. It is imperative to reconstruct the historical dynamics of their development to predict the fate of mangrove ecosystems in the backdrop of rapid global changes. This study analyzes records of the sources of organic matter from sediment core Q43 of Qinzhou Bay in tropical China by using the endmember mixing model based on stable organic carbon isotopes and C/N ratio. Mangrove-derived organic matter (MOM) is regarded as a reliable indicator for reconstructing the historical development of mangroves. The variations in MOM in Qinzhou Bay over the past similar to 3,000 cal yr BP indicate that mangrove forests underwent two periods of flourishment: similar to 2,200-1,750 cal yr BP and similar to 1,370-600 cal yr BP, as well as three periods of deterioration: similar to 3,000-2,200 cal yr BP, similar to 1,750-1,370 cal yr BP, and similar to 600-0 cal yr BP. Of factors that might have been influential, changes in the relative sea level and the regional hydrological environment (e.g., seawater temperature, salinity, and hydrodynamic conditions) did not appear to have notable effects on mangrove flourishing/degradation. However, climate change, especially the variation in air temperature, formed the primary factor controlling mangrove development. The stages of mangrove flourishing/deterioration corresponded to the warm/cold periods of the climate, respectively. Noteworthy is that the rapid rise in air temperature during the Anthropocene warm period should have promoted mangrove development, but the increasing intensity of human activity has reversed this tendency leading to the degradation of mangroves.

KW  - FRUITING PHENOLOGY
AB  - Variability of ephemeral resources provided by woody plants is related to fluctuating environmental conditions, specifically the predominant climate variables temperature and rainfall. Photoperiod has less impact but also plays a role in the onset of resource pulses. In the seasonally affected bushveld of southern Africa, declining resources could have dire consequences to various animals that depend on these resources. Understanding the impact that rainfall, temperature and photoperiod has on woody plant resources allows managers of natural areas to plan for times when resources are scarce. Using a series of General Linear Models, this baseline study investigates the effects that these variables have on flower production, numbers of new fruit/pods and numbers of new leaves for 113 tagged trees from 26 woody plant species. Leads, lags and coincidental relationships observed between environmental predictor and phenological response variables were explored using time-series cross-correlations and concomitant correlograms. Model results indicated that temperature was the predominant indicator for flowering, with initial flowering starting when temperatures increase in September. A significant lead was observed between flowering and rainfall, suggesting that flower numbers increase approximately one month before rainfall increases. Temperature had the biggest effect on the number of species with new fruits and pods. Significant lags were observed between new fruits and pods and all environmental variables investigated, indicating that these resources depend on rainfall, temperature and photoperiod to reach their full potential. Photoperiod, temperature and the interaction between these variables had a noticeable effect on the number of species with new leaves. Peaks in species with new leaves coincide with peaks in rainfall, temperature and photoperiod. No leading or lagging indicators were observed between new leaves and the environmental variables investigated. In areas containing wildlife populations, recommendations are to undertake regular monitoring of climatic variables investigated, and the ephemeral resources on woody plant species.

AB  - Desert environments remain largely neglected by the society and their potential to provide benefits to people remain understudied. Hotspots of cultural ecosystem services have been identified in some deserts; yet, knowing which countries need to strengthen efforts to satisfy people's demand for those services is timely needed. Here, we show the performance of countries within the Earth's largest warm region-the Sahara-Sahel-in managing cultural ecosystem services. Using the most-advanced decision-support tools and updated databases on biodiversity features and constrains to ecosystem services and on socioeconomic indicators, we identified national priorities for cultural services management. We also identified countries that are missing opportunities for local sustainable development. About 34% of Sahara-Sahel is prioritized for cultural ecosystem services, particularly in the main mountains and waterbodies of the region and along the Western and Eastern coastal limits. Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Senegal, and Tunisia are performing better in managing their cultural services given the availability of such services in their territories. Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Sudan, and South Sudan need to urgently improve their ease of mobility, governance, safety, socioeconomic and health systems to foster ecosystem services demand. Cameroon, Eritrea, and Senegal are receiving far less tourists than what their ecosystems can handle and need to improve their local conditions for better marketing international tourists able to economically contribute to sustainable development through ecotourism programs. The approach developed here serves as a framework for conserving the last world wild ecosystems and is replicable to other contexts where regional planning for ecosystem management is compulsory.

AB  - The scale of land-contamination problems, and of the responses to them, makes achieving sustainability in contaminated land remediation an important objective. The Sustainable Remediation Forum in the UK (SuRF-UK) was established in 2007 to support more sustainable remediation practices in the UK. The prevailing international consensus is that risk assessment is the most rational approach for determining remediation needs and urgency. Sustainability in this context is related to the effectivedeliveryof whatever risk management is necessary to protect human health or the wider environment. SuRF-UK suggests that decisions made at the project planning stage, and also in the choice of remediation approach used to reach particular objectives decided upon, are both opportunities for sustainability gain. In 2011, SuRF-UK issued a set of wide-ranging indicators to support sustainability assessments made during project planning and remediation option appraisal. This advice was reviewed over 2018-2020 and new guidance on process and indicators has been released. Within this guidance, SuRF-UK has provided a checklist of possible sustainability indicators/criteria that can be used to benchmark the scope of sustainability assessment for remediation projects. These indicators are divided into 15 overarching ("headline") categories, divided in a balanced way across the three elements of sustainability: Environmental (emissions to air, soil and ground conditions, groundwater and surface water, ecology, and natural resources and waste); social (human health and safety, ethics and equity, neighborhoods and locality, communities and community involvement, and uncertainty and evidence); and economic (direct economic costs and benefits, indirect economic costs and benefits, employment and employment capital, induced economic costs and benefits, and project lifespan and flexibility). The majority of this study explains these categories and their various considerations in more depth and provides the supporting rationale that led to their inclusion in the revised SuRF-UK guidance.

AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been increasingly used as a primary tool for fisheries management and conservation. Over the past few decades, the implementation of MPAs has achieved mixed results with regard to conservation goals, which has driven the scientific community to contemplate what factors may determine the effectiveness of an MPA. Most previous analyses have tended to focus on the design criteria of MPAs as well as post-closure management capabilities, but pre-closure conditions are seldom considered. Here, we investigate the effects of varying pre-closure fishing effort scenarios on MPA performance by applying a developed evaluation framework and age-structured dynamic model for the small yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) in Haizhou Bay, China. We specifically focus on the overall fishing pressure imposed on the fish population and the spatial heterogeneity of fishing effort. We used ecological and social indicators to evaluate the effects of MPAs. Our results demonstrate that MPAs with lower pre-closure fishing pressure are more effective than thosewith higher pre-closure fishing pressure in recovering the fish population. Highly aggregated fishing efforts inside the MPAs prior to their implementations could also make MPAs less effective. By comparing our findings to other studies, we noticed that evaluation metrics and time frames could make a difference in determining the effects of a given MPA, which indicates the importance of monitoring programs. From a social perspective, placing MPAs in heavily exploited areas without additional harvest regulations may result in a tragedy of the commons situation that leads to a significant loss in catches. This study highlights the ecological and social risks of establishing MPAs under different pre-closure fishing scenarios and provides insights for the development of marine conservation plans.

AB  - Lead (Pb) is a toxic environmental pollutant that is frequently present in effluents from urban, mining, and industrial sources. The combinatorial effects of heavy metal exposure and temperature in aquatic organisms have received considerable attention as heat stress occurs simultaneously in conjunction with several contaminants in a natural environment. In this study, we examined the potential effects of Pb exposure in conditions of thermal stress (34 degrees C) in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. Thermal stress at 34 degrees C induced a dramatic decrease in the survival rate, although exposure to Pb at 26 degrees C decreased the survival rate of the embryos. Malformations, such as the curved body shape, were increased in response to exposure to a combination of Pb and heat stress. The combination of Pb and heat stress also caused a decrease in the heart rate. Moreover, Pb and high-temperature exposure induced the upregulation of SOD, CAT, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, p53, and BAX transcripts, and downregulation of Dnmtl and Dnmt3b transcripts. Thermal stress enhanced transcriptional responses of eight indicator genes following Pb toxicity. The induction of cell death in response to combined exposures was also confirmed in the body of zebrafish by fluorescence intensity image analysis. These data indicated that thermal stress enhanced the poisonous effects of Pb exposure on antioxidant defense, inflammation, and apoptotic mechanisms. Transcriptional inhibition of DNA methylation-related genes might serve as a crucial factor contributing to the possibility of epigenetic adaptation by altering combined stress. We suggest that a careful evaluation of the potential effects of climate change (especially temperature) should be considered when investigating the toxic levels of metal pollution, such as Pb, in an aquatic environment.

AB  - Many producers use cover crops as a means to increase soil health and agricultural productivity, yet benefits of this practice vary depending on environmental and management conditions. In an effort to objectively evaluate how cover crops affect soil properties and crop production across climates and systems, we compiled data from 269 studies that compared cover crop treatments versus no cover crop controls. We then used t-tests and unbalanced analysis of variation tests to evaluate cover crop-related effects on 38 indicators of soil health and productivity. The t-test analysis indicated that cover cropping caused significant changes in 28 of 38 indicators, with differences seen for all physical parameters and most indicators associated with biological and environmental measurements. The unbalanced analysis of variation test allowed us to identify a hierarchy of most to least important environment and management factors for each indicator. Using this hierarchy, we developed a calculator that allows users to evaluate how cover crop usage affects 13 key indicators, including cash crop yield, weed pressure, soil aggregate stability, soil organic carbon, soil nitrogen, and infiltration rates. The calculator requires only four inputs - climatic region, soil texture group, cash crop rotation, and cover crop type - and as output provides mean percent change for each indicator based on the selected factors. The analyses produced in this study provide new insight into specific soil health and productivity responses to cover cropping, and the corresponding web-based calculator will help to ensure that soil health measurements from the field and laboratory are useful to farmers, planners, and regulators. Further, as more data becomes integrated into the calculator, results will continue to improve in accuracy and realism, ultimately helping to make soil health evaluation a practical outcome for more producers.

AB  - Bering Sea sea ice during winter 2017-2018 was the lowest ever recorded. Ecosystem effects of low ice have been observed in the southeastern Bering Sea, but never in the northern Bering Sea. Observations in both systems included weakened water column stratification, delayed spring bloom, and low abundances of large crustacean zooplankton. Summer Cold Pool presence was extremely limited. Young walleye pollock production and condition were similar to prior warm years, though catches of other pelagic forage fishes were low. Summer seabird die-offs were observed in the northern Bering Sea, and to lesser extent in the southeastern Bering Sea, and reproductive success was poor at monitored colonies. Selected bottom-up responses to lack of sea ice in the north were similar to those in the south, potentially providing environmental indicators to project ecosystem effects in a lesser studied system. Results offer a potential glimpse of the broader Bering Sea pelagic ecosystem under future low-ice projections.
   Plain Language Summary During the winter of 2017-2018, there was a lack of winter sea ice in the northern and southeastern Bering Sea. This was unprecedented, and its implications were unknown, especially for the northern Bering Sea. Ecosystem surveys showed that oceanic plants and animals at the base of the food web were delayed in their spring production and food quality was generally low. Abundances of young walleye pollock, a commercial species important to the global fish market, were average in 2018, but catches of other forage fishes were lower. Seabird die-offs in the northern Bering Sea were extensive. If heat-related ecosystem changes previously observed in the southeastern Bering Sea ecosystem are now happening in the northern Bering Sea, disruptions to food webs and increased die-offs could occur if oceans continue to warm in the future.

AB  - Environmental heterogeneity significantly affects the structure of ecological communities. Exploring vegetation distribution and its relationship with environmental factors is essential to understanding the abiotic mechanism(s) driving vegetation succession, especially in the ecologically fragile areas. In this study, based on the quantitative analysis of plant community and environmental factors in 68 plots at 10 different transects in the Minqin oasis-desert ecotone (ODE) of northwestern China, we investigated desert vegetation distribution and species-environment relationships using multivariate analysis. Two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN), detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) methods were used. A total of 28 species, belonging to 27 genera in 8 families, were identified. Chenopodiaceae, Zygophyllaceae, Gramineae, and Leguminosae were the largest families. Annual and perennial herbs accounted for 28.60% of the total number of plants, while shrubs (42.90%) were the most dominant. Nitraria tangutorum was the constructive species of the desert plant community. We divided the 68 plots surveyed in this study into 7 community types, according to the results of TWINSPAN. The distribution of these 7 communities in the DCA ordination graph showed that species with a similar ecotype were clustered together. Results of CCA indicated that groundwater was the dominant factor influencing vegetation distribution, while distance between plot and oasis (Dis) and soil electrical conductivity (EC) were the local second-order factors. Our study suggests that optimizing the utilization of groundwater in oases is key to controlling the degradation of desert vegetation. The favorable topographic conditions of sand dunes should be fully utilized for vegetal dune stabilization, and the influence of soil salinity on the selection of afforestation tree species should be considered.

AB  - In the present study, eleven man-made reservoirs were visited between 17 and 20 June 2009 and 18 and 21 July 2010 to determine ecological requirements of zooplankton communities by major environmental variables (water temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, pH, conductivity). The water temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, pH, conductivity values during the study among the sites ranged between 15.6-28.3 degrees C; 7.94-13.4 mg L-1; 8.07-8.66; and 219-464 (mu S cm(-1)), respectively. Major limnological variables showed significant differences both temporally (between years) (except for DO and EC) and spatially (i.e. sampling sites) (p < 0.05). A total of 62 taxa of zooplankton represented by 41 Rotifera, 11 Cladocera, and 10 Copepoda was identified. The most common species were rotifers Keratella cochlearis (Gosse) (11 sampling sites), Asplanchna priodonta (Gosse) and Synchaeta oblonga Ehrenberg, Polyarthra vulgaris (Carlin) (10 sampling sites), cladocerans Bosmina longirostris (Muller) and Chydorus sphaericus (Muller) (11 sampling sites) and copepod Acanthocyclops venustus (Norman & Scott) (6 sampling sites). Predominant and also most of the other identified species in the present study were known as eutrophication indicators. Species richness (as total number of species) of the sampling sites changed between 9 (Utuk reservoir) and 27 (Kirazoglu reservoir). Abundances of main taxonomic zooplankton groups were similar but varied temporally and spatially. Sampling sites were determined as beta-mesosaprobic. Statistically, cladoceran C. sphaericus was determined as the indicator species throughout the study, which is common and resistant to the wide range conditions. The results of the present study are generally indicative of unpolluted waters. All of the identified zooplankton species are the first report for the studied water bodies.

AB  - Biological markers and carbon isotope data were used to delineate characteristics, maturity, and source of the crude oils from Asmari and Bangestan reservoirs of the Mansourabad oilfield, SW Iran. In spite of extremely similar source-related parameters reflecting an identical source, non-biodegraded Asmari and Bangestan oils have different gravities. Based on not-equilibrated maturity parameters, Bangestan oils are slightly more mature than Asmari oils resulting in higher API gravity. Geochemical indicators propose a carbonate-marl source rock deposited in a marine environment under anoxic-suboxic conditions as the source of the oils. Strong marine organic matter signature of predominantly algal origin along with robust signals of contribution from land plants were detected. Based on geochemical evidence, the Mansourabad field Asmari and Bangestan oils being sourced from a mix of Kazhdumi and Pabdeh organic matters. Carbon isotope composition and V/Ni ratio of the oils delineate Kazhdumi Formation of Albian age as the main source rock. Nevertheless, partial contribution of Pabdeh source rocks of Middle Eocene-Early Oligocene were also deduced based on medium concentration of oleanane, low sulfur content, and less than unity values of C-29/C-30 hopanes ratio. It seems that the degree of contribution from Pabdeh-derived oils were insufficient to impact a typical mixed signature over the geochemical fingerprint of the reservoired oils. According to the stratigraphic levels, the latest more mature Kazhdumi-derived oils only charged the adjacent reservoir, resulting in higher overall maturity of the Bangestan oils. Since maturity and bulk geochemical properties of the Asmari and Bangestan oils are different, it can be concluded that fluids within the reservoirs are completely separated from each other by effective static barriers of dense Pabdeh and Gurpi beds.

AB  - Knowledge of the vegetation and the monitoring of its changes in preserved areas is an essential part of effective conservation policy and management. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of traditional methods of conservation of silver fir forests. The study analyses the changes in the structure and species composition of a temperate forest excluded from the commercial silvicultural management for 50 years, and since then protected as a nature reserve. The study is based on a comparative analysis of phytosociological releves made on permanent plots in 1961, 1982, 1994 and 2011. PCA and ecological indicator values were analyzed, as well as characteristic species based on an indicator value (IndVal) index. Results revealed significant and dynamic changes in the forest structure and composition. The mixed coniferous-broadleaved forest with Abies alba and diverse ground flora, considered in the 1960s as valuable and worthy of conservation, was found to have been anthropogenically transformed and unstable. Significant reduction in the human impact was followed by spontaneous regeneration of oak-hornbeam forest. However, the directional process of changes in vegetation was modified by such silvicultural treatments as selective cutting of trees and gap creation, all intended for silver fir maintenance. The results show that Carpinus betulus effectively outcompeted Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies, Quercus robur and A. alba. Changes in the forest overstory and understory caused temporal changes in the habitat conditions reflected in changes in the ground vegetation composition. The proportion of light-demanding and oligotrophic species significantly decreased, while the contribution of species with a wide ecological amplitude, i.e. more shade-tolerant and nutrient-demanding - increased. The share of A. alba was reduced. Species defined in this study as most valuable, should be actively protected, or selection of conservation targets should be re-evaluated.

AB  - We propose an empirical method for nondestructive estimation of chlorophyll in tree canopies. The first prototype of a full waveform hyperspectral LiDAR instrument has been developed by the Finnish Geodetic Institute (FGI). The instrument efficiently combines the benefits of passive and active remote sensing sensors. It is able to produce 3D point clouds with spectral information included for every point, which offers great potential in the field of environmental remote sensing.
   The investigation was conducted by using chlorophyll sensitive vegetation indices applied to hyperspectral LiDAR data and testing their performance in chlorophyll estimation. The amount of chlorophyll in vegetation is an important indicator of photosynthetic capacity and stress, and thus important for monitoring of forest condition and carbon sequestration on Earth.
   Performance of chlorophyll estimation was evaluated for 27 published vegetation indices applied to waveform LiDAR collected from ten Scots pine shoots. Reference data were collected by laboratory chlorophyll concentration analysis. The performance of the indices in chlorophyll estimation was determined by linear regression and leave-one-out cross-validation.
   The chlorophyll estimates derived from hyperspectral LiDAR linearly correlate with the laboratory analyzed chlorophyll concentrations, and they are able to represent a range of chlorophyll concentrations in Scots pine shoots (R-2 = 0.88, RMSE = 0.10 mg/g). Furthermore, they are insensitive to measurement scale as nearly the same values of vegetation indices were measured in natural setting while scanning the whole canopy and from clipped shoots re-measured with hyperspectral LiDAR in laboratory. The results indicate that the hyperspectral LiDAR instrument has the potential to estimate vegetation biochemical parameters such as the chlorophyll concentration. The instrument holds much potential in various environmental applications and provides a significant improvement over single wavelength LiDAR or passive optical systems for environmental remote sensing.

AB  - This article explores the feeding and territorial behaviour of the wild camelids - guanacos and vicunas - consumed by the inhabitants of the Dry Puna during the Early and Mid-Holocene, as a way to deal with the strategies for resource exploitation employed by these human groups. We present 38 stable isotope values (delta C-13 and delta N-15) generated from bone collagen extracted from the faunal remains obtained from the Hornillos 2 archaeological site (Susques, Jujuy Province, Argentina). These bone assemblages were recovered from nine layers that comprise human occupations corresponding to both periods (from 9710 to 6130 years bp). These data will be discussed considering ecological and ethological information about wild camelids, especially regarding territorial behaviour and dietary selectiveness of vicunas and guanacos that currently inhabit the Puna. Finally, the trends and patterns identified in these isotopic evidences will be analysed in the light of the environmental and cultural changes that took place during the mentioned chronological span.
   Our results show no significant differences between camelid species, implying that delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of bone collagen constitute a poor taxonomical indicator, dismissing the possibility to identify the early incidence of human intervention in animal diet as an initial step to deal with the problem of domestication. In chronological terms, the delta N-15 results from Early and Mid-Holocene show certain differences that can be linked to the preponderance of arid conditions during the latter. This underscores the usefulness of this line of evidence when evaluating environmental changes. On the other hand, the delta C-13 values show no substantial differences, meaning that carbon isotopic composition of bone collagen in mixed C-3-C-4 systems is not a reliable paleoenvironmental proxy.

AB  - A primary objective of ecological monitoring programs typically includes the efficient detection of population trends. Passerines as a group are important ecological indicators and are often included in such programs to provide information on multiple species with a single survey technique. However, commonly used field and analytical approaches may not provide appropriate inference or sensitivity due to assumption violations and differences in the proportion of the population exposed to sampling. Recent methodological developments utilizing repeated point counts and an N-mixture modeling approach for analysis may produce more consistent and interpretable estimates applicable to the superpopulation of individuals using a site during the breeding season. These estimates should be more useful for monitoring because they are not conditioned on presence or availability as are most single-visit approaches. We used repeated count data collected in Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska (Denali) between 1995 and 2009 from 12 common passerine species to assess variation in presence and availability throughout the season, estimate trends in superpopulation abundance, and provide recommendations for the design of future monitoring programs. We found that variation in detection due to presence and availability was large and differed among species. After accounting for these sources of variation, we estimated abundance of Wilson's warblers (Wilsonia pusilla) had declined by approximately 48% and fox sparrow (Passerella iliaca) abundance had increased by approximately 250% over 15 years. Combined, our results suggest that if trend estimation is a priority, passerine monitoring programs should formally address all components of the detection process, including the probabilities of presence and availability.

AB  - A multiproxy approach to a sediment sequence at Lake Saint-Point in the French Jura Mountains gives evidence of a strong coupling between changes in terrestrial and lacustrine ecosystems throughout the Holocene. The early Holocene (11,700-10,200 cal. BP) is characterised by the recovery of terrestrial and lake ecosystems favoured by climatic warming. During the middle Holocene (10,600-6200 cal. BP), the climatic optimum coincided with an extension of deciduous forests into the catchment area, while lake sedimentation is dominated by authigenic carbonates and low detrital inputs. After 6200 cal. BP, the Neoglacial favoured expansion of Abies-Fagus forests and increasing detrital inputs to the lake where ostracod fauna declined and changed in composition. After 1200 cal. BP, human impact was responsible for extensive forest clearings in the catchment area, while the lake basin shows contrasting pictures with increasing detrital input, resuming sedimentation of authigenic carbonates and changes in dominant ostracod species. Orbitally driven climatic variations were the dominant factor of environmental changes until c. 1200 cal. BP. Around 2600 cal. BP, human impact increased and became the major factor in the catchment area and the lake basin from 1200 cal. BP onwards. Finally, the Saint-Point record offers a clear illustration of how gradual changes in insolation or increasing human impact may provoke, even under temperate climatic conditions, abrupt responses in mid-European terrestrial and lake ecosystems, and how differences in the dates of tipping points revealed by proxies suggest specific threshold values depending on the sensitivity of indicators used and on their role in the different compartments of these ecosystems.

AB  - Stranded marine mammals are an important source of information and biological samples on cetacean population. Nevertheless, collecting stranding data remains opportunistic and its representativity must be improved, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Drifts of small cetaceans found by-caught in fishery observation projects and subsequently released dead with a numbered tag fitted to the tail fluke were predicted by using the Meteo-France drift model MOTHY and allowed us to assess the proportion of dead dolphins recovered by volunteers of the French stranding network. Only 8% of dolphins were recovered ashore. The spatial representativity of strandings was assessed by performing back-calculation of carcass drift with the same model in order to map the likely origin of stranded cetaceans. As a first step, external visual criteria of time-after-death (as a proxy to drift duration) were obtained from series of photographs of dead small cetaceans maintained in a floating cage for 40 days and from tagged by-caught dolphins recovered stranded after a drift in real condition. Then, pictures of 242 stranded common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) were used to establish the average distribution of dolphin time-after-death in this area. Finally, 40 days-long reverse drifts of the 829 common dolphins recorded in the winter months of 2004-2009 were weighted by the modelled distribution of time-after-death in order to map the areas of likely origin. It appeared that most stranded common dolphins recorded along the French Atlantic coast originated from the continental shelf, mostly in the south of the Bay of Biscay. These results open new perspective on the use of stranding data and biological samples as sources of indicators in monitoring strategies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of plastic row covers (plastic mulch) on vegetable farms increases runoff of pesticides after rainfall events and has been linked to toxic events in adjacent tidal waters. In coastal Virginia, USA, runoff from tomato fields with plastic mulch was suspected of causing mortality of commercial hard clam larvae at a hatchery located downstream of farming operations. Concern about the putative impacts of this practice on local waters resulted in a collection of studies to: (1) determine the sensitivity of early life stages of bivalves to copper, a commonly used fungicide; (2) examine acute and chronic biological effects of runoff on tidal creeks; and (3) examine the efficacy of management practices designed to reduce the delivery of pesticides to adjacent creeks. Laboratory bioassays revealed that 48-h LC50 values for embryonic clams Mulinia lateralis and Mercenaria mercenaria were 38 and 20 mug/l, respectively. In situ bioassays with Palaemonetes pugio showed that pulsed toxic conditions sometimes occur downstream of some tomato farms in plastic mulch following rainfall events. Growth, mortality rates and bioaccumulation of copper and organic pesticides in oysters were not correlated with the use of plastic mulch in watersheds. Sediment bioassays indicated potential toxicity in sediment collected downstream of some tomato fields in plastic mulch, but the effects were not consistent between years. Closer examination of management practices on the farms suggests that controlling runoff can prevent toxic impacts. Elevated levels of crop protectants measured at the outflow of farm ponds suggested that they may do little to reduce loadings of some pesticides. However, forested buffer zones and ephemeral sedimentation basins appeared to be effective in reducing pesticide concentrations in runoff and pulsed toxicity in tidal creeks. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Biodegradation of non-calorific fat substitutes sucrose polyesters in sewage sludge amended soil
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
LA  - English
AB  - As part of an overall environmental assessment, a non-metabolisable synthetic fat, sucrose polyester (SPE), was evaluated in terms of biodegradability in sewage sludge amended soil. Three SPEs were investigated, each predominantly composed of octa-esters, but varying in the saturation and chain length distribution of the attached fatty acyl groups.
   When applied at 100 mg/kg soil, the mineralisation of SPEs was poor to moderate. The most extensively degraded SPE was the liquid type (experimental code D2), with 36% mineralisation in 151 days compared to 63-79% for two triglyceride controls, glycerol trioleate and HB307. The solid SPE types (codes X12 and Z24) gave 0.47 and 0.94% CO2 respectively under the same conditions. Following incubation, up to 30% of the residual D2 remained non-extractable, probably due biological breakdown followed by incorporation into biomass and soil humic material. For X12 and Z24, less than 2% of the residue was non-extractable, but for X12 at 7.5 mg/kg, 9% of the residue was non-extractable. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) demonstrated that almost all the D2 extracted exhibited more polar behaviour than the parent material. For X12 and Z24 there was little or no change in behaviour. However, for X12 at 7.5 mg/kg there was a significant shift of the extractable residue to more polar characteristics as compared to the parent material.
   The data suggest that the liquid SPE type D2 has the potential to undergo significant degradation in sludge amended soil, including incorporation into biomass and soil humic material, and it would be unlikely to persist. However, for the solid SPE types there is little evidence for either complete or partial breakdown of the materials, although at low concentrations X12 residues appeared to undergo some form of degradation. Therefore, the possibility of accumulation of the solid SPE types in soil, following their annual application via sewage sludge, cannot bed discounted. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Urbanisation alters landscapes, introduces wildlife to novel stressors, and fragments habitats into remnant 'islands'. Within these islands, isolated wildlife populations can experience genetic drift and subsequently suffer from inbreeding depression and reduced adaptive potential. The Western tiger snake (Notechis scutatus occidentalis) is a predator of wetlands in the Swan Coastal Plain, a unique bioregion that has suffered substantial degradation through the development of the city of Perth, Western Australia. Within the urban matrix, tiger snakes now only persist in a handful of wetlands where they are known to bioaccumulate a suite of contaminants, and have recently been suggested as a relevant bioindicator of ecosystem health. Here, we used genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data to explore the contemporary population genomics of seven tiger snake populations across the urban matrix. Specifically, we used population genomic structure and diversity, effective population sizes (N-e), and heterozygosity-fitness correlations to assess fitness of each population with respect to urbanisation. We found that population genomic structure was strongest across the northern and southern sides of a major river system, with the northern cluster of populations exhibiting lower heterozygosities than the southern cluster, likely due to a lack of historical gene flow. We also observed an increasing signal of inbreeding and genetic drift with increasing geographic isolation due to urbanisation. Effective population sizes (N-e) at most sites were small (< 100), with N-e appearing to reflect the area of available habitat rather than the degree of adjacent urbanisation. This suggests that ecosystem management and restoration may be the best method to buffer the further loss of genetic diversity in urban wetlands. If tiger snake populations continue to decline in urban areas, our results provide a baseline measure of genomic diversity, as well as highlighting which 'islands' of habitat are most in need of management and protection.

AB  - During the 2019-2020 Australian bushfire season, large expanses (similar to 47%) of agricultural and forested land in the Upper Murray River catchment of southeastern (SE) Australia were burned. Storm activity and rainfall following the fires increased sediment loads in rivers, resulting in localized fish kills and widespread water-quality deterioration. We collected water samples from the headwaters of the Murray River for sediment and contaminant analysis and assessed changes in water quality using long-term monitoring data. A robust runoff routing model was used to estimate the effect of fire on sediment loads in the Murray River. Peak turbidity in the Murray River reached values of up to 4200 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU), shown as pitch-black water coming down the river. The increase in suspended solids was accompanied by elevated nutrient concentrations during post-bushfire runoff events. The model simulations demonstrated that the sediment load could be five times greater in the first year after a bushfire than in the prefire condition. It was estimated that Lake Hume, a large reservoir downstream from fire-affected areas, would receive a maximum of 600 000 metric tonnes of sediment per month in the period immediately following the bushfire, depending on rainfall. Total zinc, arsenic, chromium, nickel, copper, and lead concentrations were above the 99% toxicant default guideline values (DGVs) for freshwater ecosystems. It is also likely that increased nutrient loads in Lake Hume will have ongoing implications for algal dynamics, in both the lake and the Murray River downstream. Information from this study provides a valuable basis for future research to support bushfire-related policy developments in fire-prone catchments and the mitigation of postfire water quality and aquatic ecosystem impacts.

AB  - Knowledge of Southern Ocean carbon cycling is limited by a paucity of phytoplankton primary productivity (PP) and spectral absorption data in this globally-important region. We measured C-13-based PP in the Indian sector of Southern Ocean (ISSO) during austral summer 2017, examining its link with spectral absorption coefficients and phytoplankton size structure derived from an absorption-based global model. Phytoplankton productivity was assessed at both coastal (60 degrees S-69 degrees S) and frontal stations (40 degrees S-60 degrees S), characterized by silicate- replete and -deplete water masses, respectively (indicated by measured nutrient ratios) to capture a range of phytoplankton growth conditions. Bio-optical relationships were used as indicators of phytoplankton community size structure and to assess the extent of cellular pigment packaging - a phenomenon reported previously for phytoplankton in this region. Blue-Red (B/R) ratios of phytoplankton absorption (a(ph)) spectra indicated that microphytoplankton (more prone to "package effects") were the dominant size class at most sites sampled. Overall, PP was better explained by a(ph) (R-2 = 0.85) than total chlorophyll-a (R-2 = 0.64) in surface waters. The a*(ph) (675)-chlorophyll-a relationship explained package effects more effectively in frontal regions (R-2 = 0.63) than stations further south (R-2 = 0.30). The global absorption-based model captured smaller (pico, nano) phytoplankton size classes but failed to identify larger microphytoplankton, underscoring the need for region-specific algorithm modifications. Our findings improve existing understanding of spatio-temporal trends in PP and bio-optical variability within the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean (ISSO) - knowledge that is essential to improve capacity to retrieve PP from satellite-based models in this region.

AB  - Saltwater intrusion is a potential risk damaging crop diversity and productivity due to degraded soil physicochemical properties. However, little is known about how salinity affects the structure and function of soil nematodes community in intensive rice cultivated area. This study aimed (1) to assess the impacts of saltwater intrusion on the nematode community in alluvial and acid sulfate soils; and (2) to evaluate its relation with soil conditions. Saltwater intrusion reduced the abundance of both free-living nematodes (FLN) and plant-parasitic nematodes (dominated by Hirschmanniella) in soils. FLN community was different among sites with different physicochemical properties. The omnivorous genera Aporcelaimellus and Thornenema were only found in nonsalt-affected alluvial soil, whilst Mesodorylaimus was dominant in salt-affected acid sulfate soil, suggesting that this genus might be tolerant to higher EC and soluble Na+, K+, Ca2+. The bacterivorous nematodes (dominant taxa Chronogaster, Rhabdolaimus) were dominant in both non-salt affected and salt-affected alluvial soils, which accounted for 48% and 40%, respectively, whilst it accounted for 21% in salt-affected acid sulfate soil. The abundance of fungivorous nematodes (Aphelenchoides, Ditylenchus, Filenchus) were greater in salt-affected alluvial soil in contrast to the other treatments, suggesting that these might be tolerant to salinity and low pH. Saltwater intrusion reduced biological diversity (Margalef, Shannon-Wiener, and Hill's indices), maturity index (Sigma MI, MI25), and clearly affected functional guilds of nematode community, especially c-p 5 group was reduced in both salt-affected soils. This study suggests that saltwater intrusion showed a potential risk in the degradation of soil properties, as indicated by the altered nematode community, trophic structure, functional guilds and their ecological indices in paddy fields.

AB  - The polar cod (Boreogadus saida) has a circumpolar distribution and is the most abundant planktivorous fish in the Arctic. Declining sea-ice coverage impacts polar cod directly and also facilitates expansion of human activities in the region leading to increasing anthropogenic pressures on biota. Here we summarize current data and knowledge on polar cod from the Russian sector of the Barents Sea and discuss knowledge needs for the management of polar cod under changing environmental conditions and anthropogenic impacts. We review 36 Russian historical (1935 - 2020) sources of data and knowledge largely unknown to western researchers, in addition to sources already published in the English language. This effort allowed for digitalization and visualization of 69 separate datasets on polar cod ecology, including maturation, fertility, feeding intensity, diet, lipid content, length-weight relationships and seasonal variation in larval size. Our review suggests that polar cod abundances are particularly large in the eastern Barents Sea and adjacent waters. Here, we identify and discuss key knowledge gaps. The review of polar cod in the eastern Barents Sea revealed 1) major variation in the timing and area of polar cod spawning, 2) uncertainty as to what degree the polar cod is dependent on sea ice, 3) deficient knowledge of juvenile (e.g., 0-group) distributions, particularly in the north-eastern Barents Sea, 4) deficient knowledge of the species? genetic structure and spatio-temporal distributions, and 5) insufficient understanding as to whether ongoing environmental change may induce phenological changes affecting the availability of potential food items for polar cod larvae and their match in space and time. Filling these knowledge gaps would provide an important step towards the reliable knowledge base needed in order to perform well-founded management and impact assessment under environmental changes and increasing anthropogenic impacts.

AB  - A three-year field experiment was conducted to determine the influence of plastic mulch (PM) and fertilization methods (FMs) on marketable yield (MY) and environmental impact of spring cabbage production. The trial consisted of two levels of mulching (without and with PM) and nine different FMs, including the control without fertilization (FM1). PM use without fertilization (FM1) increased yields by 35.9 % on average, but the positive yield effect of mulching decreased with fertilizer application (FM2-9). Mature cattle manure, composted pig manure and mineral fertilizer increased yields by 21.2 %, 60.6 % and 51.5 %, respectively. Combined fertilization gave higher yield up to 73.3 % compared to the control (FM1). The environmental impact was evaluated with the ReCiPe 2016 (H) life cycle impact assessment method. The foreground system was modeled mainly using primary data, while background system data were available from the ecoinvent 3.4 generic LCI database. On average across the nine FMs, the application of PM reduced water consumption (23 %), non-carcinogenic toxicity (25 %), terrestrial acidification (4 %), and required land area (11 %), but increased fossil resource scarcity (8 %), global warming (6 %) and fine particulate matter emissions (14 %). PM application had positive impacts on ecosystem quality, but regarding human health and resources availability, positive impacts were found only in the control (FM1). Negative environmental impact of PM was the consequence of large amounts of energy used for its production and hazardous emissions through PM disposal. On-site burning of PM under uncontrolled, open burn conditions should be avoided because of negative health impacts. Landfilling and combustion of PM in incinerators with energy recovery could reduce impacts of cabbage production on human health by 16 and 21 %, respectively, as compared to on-site burning. Fertilizer use was environmentally justified as damage indicators were lower on a MY basis compared to the control treatment without fertilization (by 18 %-44 %).

AB  - This study, for the first time, investigated the impact of microwave pretreatment on the fate of the pervasive antimicrobial triclocarban (TCC) that was already present in municipal sludge, before and during advanced anaerobic digestion (AD) under thermophilic and mesophilic conditions. A range of microwave temperature (80 and 160 degrees C) and exposure duration (1 and 30 min) configurations were studied by employing ten bench-scale anaerobic digesters fed with mixed sludge at three different solids retention times (SRTs) including 20, 12, and 6 days. Seasonal changes influenced the levels of TCC in municipal sludge sampled from a plant employing the biological nutrient removal. Initial batch pretreatment studies showed that microwave irradiation itself can achieve TCC removal efficiencies up to 30 +/- 4 and 64 +/- 5% at 80 and 160 degrees C, respectively. The control digesters utilizing un-pretreated mixed sludge showed limited TCC removals, between 18 and 32% and 11-26% respectively, under thermophilic and mesophilic temperatures. On the other hand, the highest TCC elimination (78 +/- 2%) was obtained from the thermophilic digester utilizing microwaved sludge at 160 degrees C for 30 min at SRT of 12 days. The non-chlorinated carbanilide (a transformation product of TCC) was detected and quantified for the first time during conventional and microwave-pretreated anaerobic sludge digestion. The formation of carbanilide in biosolids through reductive dechlorination could be an indicator of efficient and complete TCC transformation. This research demonstrated that AD coupled with microwave pretreatment can be used to reduce environmental concentrations of TCC in municipal sludge and biosolids. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Benzotriazole ultraviolet stabilisers (BUVSs) are emerging compounds used in personal care products and in other products, such as plastics, to absorb UV light. BUVSs have been described as bioaccumulative, persistent and toxic, so it is of great interest to understand their presence in the environment. Some marine organisms, such as seaweeds, have been used as bioindicators of contamination in the environment because they are able to accumulate metals and organic compounds. We have selected seaweeds to develop a novel method to extract, identify and determine six BUVSs (UV P, UV 326, UV 327, UV 328, UV 329, UV 360) based on microwave assisted extraction (MAE) and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array (UHPLC-DAD) and mass spectrometry confirmation (UHPLC-MS/MS). Under optimum conditions, recoveries ranging from 49.8 to 92.3% were obtained, while intra-day and inter-day precision values were lower than 10% for most of the compounds. Limits of detection in the ranges 1.79-4.58 and 0.89-1.76 ng g(-1) dry weight (dw) were obtained for UHPLC-DAD and UHPLC-MS/MS, respectively.
   The optimised method was applied for the analysis of twelve species of seaweed sampled during four months in 2018 from Las Canteras beach (Gran Canaria, Spain), with the results confirmed by UHPLC-MS/MS. UV 360 was found in concentrations between 42.5 and 115 ng g(-1) (dw) in five of the twelve species. Although the highest concentrations were found in Asparagopsis taxiformis, the presence of UV 360 in other species could suggest that seaweeds can act as potential bioindicators of the occurrence of these compounds in the coastal environment.

AB  - The increasing prevalence of hypoxia in aquatic ecosystems emphasizes the need to understand sublethal effects on organisms to anticipate potential changes in population dynamics. Carryover effects of hypoxia exposure during early life stages on lifetime survival and growth performance are rarely known, which leaves major knowledge gaps about the long-term impacts of sublethal exposures. Geochemical signatures incorporated into fish hard parts can track lifetime hypoxia exposure, thereby allowing sublethal carryover effects across age-classes to be quantified. We examined the impact of hypoxia exposure on the Atlantic Croaker Micropogonias undulatus, a demersal fish inhabiting the northern Gulf of Mexico, which is one of the largest hypoxic systems in the world. Using an otolith-based, dual-proxy (Mn:Ca and Ba:Ca) geochemical method coupled with intracohort comparisons, we assessed changes in the traits of Atlantic Croakers that survived hypoxia exposure during their first year of life. We also investigated whether somatic growth was affected by exposure to sublethal hypoxia during the first year of life. Within three cohorts of Atlantic Croakers, there was no evidence that the otolith-based traits of survivors changed from one year to the next. Additionally, somatic growth in individuals that had previously experienced sublethal hypoxia during the first year of life and survived was not depressed relative to somatic growth in individuals that did not experience hypoxic conditions. These results indicate that Atlantic Croakers are tolerant to hypoxia experienced during early life and that sublethal carryover effects do not manifest as reductions in survival or growth. Geochemical indicators of hypoxia exposure in fish otoliths can thus provide vital insight into the range of potential sublethal responses by fishes with variable sensitivities to this growing environmental stressor across the world.

AB  - Different ecosystem models often provide contrasting predictions (model uncertainty), which is perceived to be a major challenge impeding their use to support ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM). The focus of this manuscript is to examine the extent of model disagreements which could impact management advice for EBFM in the central Baltic Sea. We compare how much three models (EwE, Gadget and a multispecies stock production model) differ in 1) their estimates of fishing mortality rates (Fs) satisfying alternative hypothetical management scenario objectives and 2) the outcomes of those scenarios in terms of performance indicators (spawning stock biomasses, catches, profits). Uncertainty in future environmental conditions affecting fish was taken into account by considering two seal population growth scenarios and two nutrient load scenarios. Differences in the development of the stocks, yields and profits exist among the models but the general patterns are also sufficiently similar to appear promising in the context of strategic fishery advice. Thus, we suggest that disagreements among the ecosystem models will not impede their use for providing strategic advice on how to reach management objectives that go beyond the traditional maximum yield targets and for informing on the potential consequences of pursuing such objectives. This is especially true for scenarios aiming at exploiting forage fish sprat and herring, for which the agreement was the largest among our models. However, the quantitative response to altering fishing pressure differed among models. This was due to the diverse environmental covariates and the different number of trophic relationships and their functional forms considered in the models. This suggests that ecosystem models can be used to provide quantitative advice only after more targeted research is conducted to gain a deeper understanding into the relationship between trophic links and fish population dynamics in the Baltic Sea.

AB  - Mechanisms of uranium (U) transfer from soil to plants remain poorly understood. The kinetics of supply of U to the soil solution from solid phases could be a key point to understand its phytoavailability and implications for environmental risk assessment. Root activity, particularly the continuous release of organic acids in the rhizosphere, could have an effect on this supply. We tested the impact of citrate exudation by roots of Lupinus albus, either P-sufficient (P+) or P-deficient (P-), on the phytoavailability of U from a naturally contaminated soil (total content of 413 mg U kg(-1)) using a rhizotest design. Combined effects of P (P-/P+ used to modulate plant physiology) and citrate (model exudate) on the solubilization of U contained in the soils were tested in closed reactors (batch). The batch experiment showed the existence of a low U available pool (0.4% total U) and high accessibility (k(d)' around 20 L kg(-1)) which was not significantly affected by P treatment or citrate concentrations. Analysis of U, Fe, Ca, P and citrate concentrations in the batches suggested a complex combination of mechanisms and factors including desorption, resorption, precipitation, co-sorption. On rhizotest, L. albus plants extracted 0.5-0.75% of the total U and between 25 and 40% of the estimated available U present in the rhizotest in 5 days. Uranium accumulation at the whole plant level (20 mg U kg(d.w.)(-1), shoot to root ratio around 10(-3)) seemed to be dependent neither on the plant P nutrition status nor citrate exudation level, possibly in relation with the equivalent accessibility of U whatever the growth conditions. Yet differential translocation to shoots seemed to be positively correlated to citrate exudation.

AB  - There are few studies on pelagic mollusks from the California Current, despite their ecological importance and vulnerability to climate change (e.g., ocean acidification and hypoxia). We analyzed abundances of holoplanktonic mollusks during three years (2006-2008) along a transect-line parallel to the Baja California coast. The main differences in physical factors were increasing temperature and salinity from north to south, and lower dissolved oxygen concentration south of Punta Eugenia (28 degrees N). The lowest oxygen concentrations occurred in summer, with hypoxic conditions (< 0.5 ml.L-1) in the upper 100 m depth at some locations. Planktonic mollusk abundance did not differ along the latitudinal gradient, excepting Desmopterus pacificus Essenberg, 1919 and individuals from the genus Pterotrachea Forskal, 1775. In contrast, the temporal variability was high, mainly in a seasonal scale but also among years. The influence of El Nino 2006-2007 and La Nina 2007-2008 were evident by a sharp increase of Corolla spectabilis Dall, 1871 in April 2007 during the El Nino-La Nina transition. During 2008, pelagic mollusks remained with moderate abundance in winter-spring despite the high chlorophyll concentrations recorded (up to 3.26 mg.m(-3)). Subsequently, during the relaxation of a first pulse of La Nina in July 2008, there was a rebound in the abundance of the heteropod Atlanta Lesueur, 1817. and individuals in the Order Gymnosomata. The oxygen gradient inversely influenced mollusk abundance in most of the genera (Clio Linnaeus, 1767, Limacina Bosc, 1817, Atlanta, and Firoloida Lesueur, 1817) and the order Gymnosomata, but for Cavolinia Abildgaard, 1791, Creseis Rang, 1828, Desmopterus, and Pterotrachea, the salinity gradient was more influential. Therefore, holoplanktonic mollusks genera were useful indicators of climatic variability.

AB  - Targeting agri-environmental measures (AEM) improves their effectiveness in the delivery of public goods, provided the necessary coordination with other incentives. In less favoured areas (LFA) measures focusing on the conservation of extensive farming contribute to sustainable land management in these areas. In this paper we investigate the implementation of a possible AEM supporting the improvement of permanent pastures coordinated with the extensive livestock and single farm payments actually in place. Through applying a spatially-explicit mixed integer optimisation model we simulate future land use scenarios for two less favoured areas in Portugal (Centro and Alentejo) considering two policy scenarios: a 'targeted AEM', and a 'non-targeted AEM'. We then compare the results with a 'basic policy' option (reflecting a situation without AEM). This is done with regard to landscape-scale effects on the reduction of fire hazard and erosion risk, as well as effects on farm income. The results show that an AEM for permanent pastures would be more cost-effective for erosion and fire hazard mitigation if implemented within a spatially targeted framework. However when cost-effectiveness is assessed with other indicators (e.g. net farm income and share of grazing livestock) 'non-targeted AEM' implementation delivers the best outcome in Alentejo. In Centro the implementation of an AEM involves important losses of income compared to the 'basic policy'. 'Targeted AEM' tends to favour farms in very marginal conditions, i.e. targeting is demonstrated to perform best in landscapes where spatial heterogeneity is higher. The results also show the risk of farm abandonment in the two studied less favoured areas: in all three scenarios more than 30% of arable land is deemed to be abandoned. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Upland moors in the UK have been managed for centuries using rotational prescribed-burning, but in recent years there has been contentious debate over its continuing use due to varying effects on moorland ecosystem services. Prescribed-burning should only be carried out using good-practice codes, which include restrictions on the size, location and frequency of burns. Good burning practice is an indicator of management standards and habitat condition in moorland landscapes. However, there has been little attempt to assess management performance with respect to these restrictions. We investigated prescribed-burning on a case-study estate (Howden Moor) in the Peak District National Park from 1988 to 2009 using management maps and aerial photography. The annual area burned (0.9%) was far below recommendations (10%) and patches were in keepingwith the target sizes specified (mean +/- se: 2370 +/- 70 m(2)). The risk of a large or escaped fire was very low, with less than 1% of fires greater than 15,000 m(2). However, only 28.9% of the total burnable area was burned, leaving the rest unmanaged and accumulating fuel. Future guidelines might recommend the application of prescribed-burning across the range of Calluna vulgaris growth phases, to reduce fuel load and promote biodiversity at the landscape scale. We show that vegetation mapping and aerial photography are an effective method for monitoring prescribed burning practice on moorlands. The information derived from such monitoring studies should lead to greater confidence in the standard of prescribed-burning and adherence to good-practice guidelines and requirements imposed by statutory authorities.

AB  - This paper presents a method for the analysis of socio-ecological patterns of vulnerability of people being at risk of losing their livelihoods as a consequence of global environmental change. This method fills a gap in methodologies for vulnerability analysis by providing generalizations of the factors that shape vulnerability in specific socio-ecological systems and showing their spatial occurrence. The proposed method consists of four steps that include both quantitative and qualitative analyses. To start, the socio-ecological system exposed to global environmental changes that will be studied needs to be determined. This could, for example, be farmers in drylands, urban populations in coastal areas and forest-dependent people in the tropics. Next, the core dimensions that shape vulnerability in the socio-ecological system of interest need to be defined. Subsequently, a set of spatially explicit indicators that reflect these core dimensions is selected. Cluster analysis is used for grouping the indicator data. The clusters found, referred to as vulnerability profiles, describe different typical groupings of conditions and processes that create vulnerability in the socio-ecological system under study, and their spatial distribution is provided. Interpretation and verification of these profiles is the last step in the analysis. We illustrate the application of this method by analysing the patterns of vulnerability of (smallholder) farmers in drylands. We identify eight distinct vulnerability profiles in drylands that together provide a global overview of different processes taking place and sub-national detail of their distribution. By overlaying the spatial distribution of these profiles with specific outcome indicators such as conflict occurrence or migration, the method can also be used to understand these phenomena better. Analysis of vulnerability profiles will in a next step be used as a basis for identifying responses to reduce vulnerability, for example, to facilitate the transfer of best practices to reduce vulnerability between different places.

AB  - Ostracod shells, belonging to three taxa (Leucocytherella sinensis Huang, 1982, ?Leucocythere dorsotuberosa Huang, 1982 and ?L dorsotuberosa f. postilirata sensu Pang, 1985), were collected from two sediment cores from Lake Nam Co, on the central Tibetan Plateau. Two variants of LA-ICP-MS (laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry), spot and line-scan analyses, were used to investigate trace element concentrations (Mg, Sr, Ba, U and rare earth elements [REEs]) in single ostracod shells. The results suggest that the line-scan method can provide better precision than the spot analysis and is therefore preferred. No significant difference in trace element composition between taxa was detected in our study. Fluctuations of Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca in the shells show good agreement with the reported lake level changes during the Holocene, indicating that ostracod Mg and Sr can be related to palaeohydrochemical processes in this area. A high correlation between Ba/Ca and Sr/Ca was detected in our study, perhaps implying that both metals were controlled by the same mechanisms. A possible relationship between ostracod U/Ca and the past redox conditions on the lake bottom is discussed. Relatively low and constant La/Ca was observed, which could be due to the REE characteristics in the lake water, or ostracod biological processes, or even the associated Fe-Mn and/or organic contaminants.

AB  - The use of biofilms for adsorption of sterols was investigated for the first time to evaluate sewage contamination in the Barigui River, Curitiba (Brazil). The characteristics of a biofilm that favor its use in monitoring include the relatively rapid development of biofilms and their capacity to sorb hydrophobic compounds. Some fecal sterols considered to be biomarkers for human and animal feces have relatively high octanol-water partitioning coefficients (log K-ow); thus, sterols were expected to be readily sorbed in the biofilms. The biofilms were developed on glass plates (0.48 m(2)) previously coated with a fine layer of stearic acid and supported by a PVC tube that was submersed in the river 20 cm above the river bottom. After a certain period of incubation time, the biofilm growth was scraped from the plates and analyzed for the following fecal steroids: coprostanol (5 beta-cholestan-3 beta-ol), epicoprostanol (5 beta-cholestan-3 alpha-ol), cholesterol (5,6-cholesten-3 beta-ol), cholestanol (5 alpha-cholestan-3 beta-ol), stigmastanol (24 beta-ethyl-5 alpha-cholestan-3 beta-ol) and coprostanone (5 beta-cholestan-3-one). Six samples were collected between March 2012 and June 2012. All analyzed compounds were detected, and in general, cholesterol was present in high amounts (23 160-41.9 ng g(-1) dry biofilm). Variation among campaigns was observed in the distribution of sterols, with cholestanol showing the least variation among the samples. Sterol ratios that are commonly used for evaluating sewage contamination were calculated; these ratios indicated some periods of potential sewage influence. However, these sterol ratios are intended to be applied primarily for sediments and not for biological compartments; thus, the results must be carefully interpreted. Biofilms developed under natural conditions can be a tool for monitoring some important sterols that are used as biomarkers of fecal pollution.

AB  - The mesic Caspian (Hyrcanian) forest and ecotone communities provide a marked contrast to the arid and semiarid landscapes associated with most of the territory of Iran. To date, the ecological characteristics of these habitats, threatened and of conservation importance, have been little studied. Accordingly, ecological profiles of some important plant species of these communities have been assessed along two altitudinal gradients (300-2300 m a.s.l.). Vegetation and soils were sampled every 100 m in elevation, with the data subsequently analyzed using TWINSPAN and corrected frequency (CF) analyses. Relationships between soil variables (subdivided into three classes, the lowest, the middle and the upper third of all values) and herbaceous and shrub species (presence/absence data) were analyzed by the polythetic divisive classification method. 379 plant species and eleven soil variables - N, P, K, CaCO3, EC, pH, organic matter, C/N ratio and percentage of sand, clay and silt - were considered. The ecological profile method was used to evaluate the affinity and significance of associations between the probability of species' occurrence and topsoil characteristics found by the polythetic method. Five vegetation groups were identified: two groups, with Acer campestre and Quercus macranthera in the tree layer and Veronica mazanderanae and Phuopsis stylosa as herbs, were restricted to forest-steppe ecotones and the upper mountain areas. Three groups, with Acer velutinum, Ruscus hyrcanus, Carpinus betulus, Danae racemosa, Fagus orientalis and Aruncus vulgaris as indicator species, occurred in the forest itself. Of the 42 plant species assessed. as being of particular importance, 13 had significant relationships with eight soil factors. Thus, certain species, including endemic plant species of restricted distribution and conservation importance, can be used as indicators of particular soil conditions in the Hyrcanian forest area.

AB  - Aims - Iran is one of the main centres of diversity for the genus Onobrychis Miller. This study includes 55 specimens from eleven representative wild populations of Onobrychis carduchorum C.C.Towns. originating from their natural habitats in Iran. The aims of this study are to provide a detailed taxonomical, morphological, genetic and ecogeographical characterization of O. carduchorum in Iran.
   Methods - The specimens which represent all Iranian populations were biometrically assessed using 45 quantitative and fifteen qualitative morphological characters. The phenotypic variation among the populations depends on various environmental factors; thus at each sample site we recorded data regarding longitude, latitude, altitude, slope inclination, slope orientation, substrate, minimum and maximum annual temperatures, number of rainy days, annual precipitation as well as soil traits including texture, electrical conductivity, organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, available potassium, total neutralizing value, pH, and saturation percentage. The floristic composition of each population habitat was examined as an indicator of environmental conditions. To assess genetic variation, we obtained nucleotide sequence data from the internal transcribed spacer of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS) and carried out genomic fingerprints using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) analysis.
   Results - Cluster analysis of morphological characters showed that the eleven populations could be divided into two major groups including five subgroups. Principal component analysis (PCA) of floristic data confirmed the two major morphological groups suggesting habitudinal segregation among the groups and the indicative value of floristic composition of study sites in assessing intraspecific variation in the target species. Furthermore, canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of ecogeographic data showed correlations between morphological variations and ecogeographic factors. Longitude, latitude, substrate, available potassium, clay%, total nitrogen, organic carbon, slope orientation, sand%, texture, altitude and rainy days are apparently the main environmental variables associated with morphological groups of O. carduchorum. Both ITS and ISSR data indicate that O. carduchorum is a young species with a recent divergence of its populations.

AB  - The species sensitivity distribution (SSD) concept is an important probabilistic tool for environmental risk assessment (ERA) and accounts for differences in species sensitivity to different chemicals. The SSD model assumes that the sensitivity of the species included is randomly distributed. If this assumption is violated, indicator values, such as the 50% hazardous concentration, can potentially change dramatically. Fundamental research, however, has discovered and described specific mechanisms and factors influencing toxicity and sensitivity for several model species and chemical combinations. Further knowledge on how these mechanisms and factors relate to toxicologic standard end points would be beneficial for ERA. For instance, little is known about how the processes of toxicity relate to the dynamics of standard toxicity end points and how these may vary across species. In this article, we discuss the relevance of immobilization and mortality as end points for effects of the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos on 14 freshwater arthropods in the context of ERA. For this, we compared the differences in response dynamics during 96 h of exposure with the two end points across species using dose response models and SSDs. The investigated freshwater arthropods vary less in their immobility than in their mortality response. However, differences in observed immobility and mortality were surprisingly large for some species even after 96 h of exposure. As expected immobility was consistently the more sensitive end point and less variable across the tested species and may therefore be considered as the relevant end point for population of SSDs and ERA, although an immobile animal may still potentially recover. This is even more relevant because an immobile animal is unlikely to survive for long periods under field conditions. This and other such considerations relevant to the decision-making process for a particular end point are discussed.

AB  - Frequent and continuous time series is required for the detection of plant phenology and vegetation succession. The launch of novel remote sensor MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer) provided us with an opportunity to make a new trial of studying the rapid vegetation succession in estuarine wetlands. In this study, the spatiotemporal variations of vegetation cover and tidal flat elevation along a transect (covering 6 pixels of MODIS) of an estuarine wetland at Dongtan, Chongming Island, in Yangtze River estuary, China were investigated to assess its rapid vegetation succession and physical conditions. By combining the field data collected, the time series of MODIS-based VIs (vegetation indices), including NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), EVI (enhanced vegetation index) and MSAVI (modified soil adjusted vegetation index), and a water index, LSWI (land surface water index) were utilized to characterize the rapid vegetation succession between 2001 and 2006. We found that NDVI, EVI and MSAVI exhibited significant spatial and temporal correlations with vegetation succession, while LSWI behaved in a positive manner with surface water and soil moisture along with the successional stages. In order to take the advantages of both VIs and water index, a composite index of VWR (vegetation water ratio) combining LSWI and EVI or MSAVI was proposed in this paper. This index facilitates the identification of vegetation succession by simply comparing the values of VWR at different stages, and therefore it could track vegetation succession and estimate community spread rate. Additionally, this study presented an attempt of using MODIS datasets to monitor the change of tidal flat elevation, which demonstrated a potential remote sensing application in geodesy of coastal and estuarine areas.

AB  - Question: Is the pendulous epiphytic indicator lichen Alectoria sarmentosa influenced by proximity to forest edge in natural old-growth forests?
   Location: Large (28 400 ha), naturally heterogeneous boreal landscape in northern Sweden dominated by old-growth Picea abies forest in a matrix of open wetland.
   Methods: The abundance of A. sarmentosa and forest structure were quantified in ten edge-interior transects (0- 100 m) at southern to western forest edges. Four 10 m x 50 in plots were sampled along each transect. Mass of A. sarmentosa in the lower canopy (0-5 m) of P. abies was estimated from maximum thallus length.
   Results: The maximum length of A. sarmentosa was four times lower, and the lichen mass 16 times lower, at the forest edge compared to the forest interior. Lichen mass showed a monotonic decrease from the interior to the edge. Mean distance of edge influence was 58 m for lichen mass, and extended longer into the forest than changes in stand structural variables. The response of A. sarmentosa to edges is a result of a combination of changes in microclimate and substrate availability.
   Conclusions: The indicator species A. sarmentosa is strongly affected by proximity to forest edge in natural old-growth forests. Edge influence is thus important in controlling the abundance of this group of pendulous lichens in natural forest ecosystems. Distance of edge influence was longer in natural wetland-forest ecotones than previously reported for fragmented forests; this was probably due to higher lichen abundance and lower site productivity in the study area. Understanding lichen response to natural landscape structure may help us to improve conditions for epiphytes in managed forests.

AB  - Twelve soil-preparation techniques used in afforestation were applied and 16 environmental variables were measured to test their effects on vegetation abundance, diversity, and cover in semiarid abandoned farmland located in southeastern Spain. The soil-preparation techniques consisted of punctual treatments-making a hole and constructing a plantation bench with different types of machinery; linear treatments-making furrows along contour lines; and surface treatments-that prepare the soil in general all over the plantation surface. Variables measured were the surface and volume affected by the soil-preparation treatments, distance from sample quadrats to the remnants of natural vegetation, surface runoff estimated by slope angle, and some edaphic characteristics such as gravel content, active lime, CaCO3, phosphorus, oxidizable organic matter, total soil nitrogen, pH, potassium, salinity, and clay, silt and sand content. The multivariate contrasts obtained demonstrated the existence of a significant relationship between species, samples and environmental variables. Both the distance of the quadrats from the remnants of natural vegetation and the volume of soil removed in different treatments were very weighty variables in the explanation of the variance of data, negatively affecting overall vegetation development. The accumulation or loss of surface runoff and the CaCO3 content in soil were also important variables to explain abundance and diversity data. However, not all the species responded to the variables analysed in the same way. Identification of non-uniform spatial patterns that significantly affect vegetation suggests that afforestation policies and conservation and management strategies in these semiarid abandoned lands should always take into consideration the quality of the whole landscape. Voluminous soil treatments for afforestation should be avoided. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In Autumn 2001, a UK wide survey was conducted to investigate the nitrogen status of soils and vegetation under 20 beech woodlands on brown earth soils. Predictor variables (including nitrogen pollution levels, ecosystem biological demand and soil-water flux) were used to explain measurements of nitrate at depth (55-60 cm). Indicators of nitrogen pollution levels included estimates from the national mapping database, the distance to the edge of each wood, foliar nitrogen levels in ground flora and measurements of soil and litter nitrogen. Biological demand was represented by ground cover, soil carbon and tree age, diameter at breast height (DBH) and density. Indices used to reflect soil water flux included precipitation, precipitation excess and particle size distribution. Data were also collected to explain the character of the ground flora at the sites as expressed by Ellenberg values of nitrogen, light and reaction.
   Results showed that the distribution of ground cover was primarily related to canopy gap fraction-this also governed species composition along with soil pH and nitrogen inputs (as represented by site proximity to edge of the wood). However, ground flora composition itself was a poor predictor of nitrate levels at depth as were soil and litter nitrogen levels. The latter were controlled by soil moisture, carbon content and pH. Nitrate levels in the sub soils were highly skewed; 80% of the measurements were less than 40 mg l(-1), yet the mean concentration was 37 mg l(-1) due to extreme values at three sites with extraordinary local conditions. A multiple linear regression, including bramble (Rubus) foliar nitrogen levels, DBH, precipitation, tree density and ground vegetation cover, explained 85% of the variation in sub soil nitrate levels when these three extreme site were excluded. An acceptable regression which requires minimal field work is also presented. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Bilbao Estuary is one of the most contaminated estuaries on the north coast of Spain, and vast efforts have been made to abate pollution there. In fact, the local water authority has forecast a biological recovery of the native fauna after a substantial increase in dissolved oxygen to normoxic levels. In order to assess this prediction by evaluating the extent of natural regeneration of these polluted sediments, two long-term bioassays (t = 90 d) were performed. In both of them, lethal (differences in survival) and sublethal (differences in length and weight growth) effects were measured by using juvenile individuals of the autochthonous clam, Scrobicularia plana (Da Costa, 1778). The sediments tested differed in pollution levels, as measured by a set of indicators including PAHs, PCBs, heavy metals, volatile organic matter and coprostanol. All sediments were finally exposed to normoxic conditions in situ in the Bilbao Estuary (DO similar to 6.3 mg l(-1)). In the first experiment, concerning moderately polluted sediments from the Bilbao Estuary and reference sediments from the "pristine" Plentzia Estuary, no significant differences (P > 0.05) were found regarding animal survival (similar to94.5%) or growth in length or weight between the sediments tested. In the second experiment, also involving grossly polluted sediments (GPS) from the Bilbao Estuary, survival (24.5%) was statistically lower (P < 0.05) than in the other sediments (similar to93%). No significant differences were found in growth (length, weight) between animals exposed to moderately polluted or reference sediments. We interpret this dramatic difference in survival as the lethal effect on the animals tested of the GPS of the Bilbao Estuary, indicating a situation where biological recovery is not possible due to the adverse consequences of contaminants sorbed into sediments. The extensive use of this inexpensive bioassay could help to distinguish sediments in which homeostatic recovery is possible from grossly polluted "hot spots", which need costly remedial actions.

AB  - Quantifying fish species diversity in rich tropical marine environments remains challenging. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is a promising tool to face this challenge through the filtering, amplification, and sequencing of DNA traces from water samples. However, because eDNA concentration is low in marine environments, the reliability of eDNA to detect species diversity can be limited. Using an eDNA metabarcoding approach to identify fish Molecular Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) with a single 12S marker, we aimed to assess how the number of sampling replicates and filtered water volume affect biodiversity estimates. We used a paired sampling design of 30 L per replicate on 68 reef transects from 8 sites in 3 tropical regions. We quantified local and regional sampling variability by comparing MOTU richness, compositional turnover, and compositional nestedness. We found strong turnover of MOTUs between replicated pairs of samples undertaken in the same location, time, and conditions. Paired samples contained non-overlapping assemblages rather than subsets of one another. As a result, non-saturated localized diversity accumulation curves suggest that even 6 replicates (180 L) in the same location can underestimate local diversity (for an area <1 km). However, sampling regional diversity using similar to 25 replicates in variable locations (often covering 10 s of km) often saturated biodiversity accumulation curves. Our results demonstrate variability of diversity estimates possibly arising from heterogeneous distribution of eDNA in seawater, highly skewed frequencies of eDNA traces per MOTU, in addition to variability in eDNA processing. This high compositional variability has consequences for using eDNA to monitor temporal and spatial biodiversity changes in local assemblages. Avoiding false-negative detections in future biomonitoring efforts requires increasing replicates or sampled water volume to better inform management of marine biodiversity using eDNA.

AB  - This paper investigates how variation in forest structural characteristics affects the water retention capacity of gaps and forests in fir-beech forests in the Dinaric Karst. Forests are identified as a key element of the landscape for provision of pristine water resources, particularly in highly vulnerable karst aquifers characterized by rapid infiltration of recharge water, high subsurface permeability, and heterogeneous underground flow. Indicators of hydrologic fluxes (drainage flux, canopy interception, transpiration, and soil evaporation) in a large experimental gap (approximately 0.2 ha in size) and those in a nearby old-growth gap were compared over a 13-year period using the Brook90 hydrological model and their structural characteristics were analyzed. In addition, the hydrologic fluxes were also simulated for a managed forest and an old-growth forest for reference. Water regulation capacity was lowest in the experimental gap, where drainage flux accounted for 81% of precipitation and the sum of canopy interception, transpiration, and soil evaporation (evapotranspiration) accounted for 18%. This was followed by the old-growth gap, where drainage flux accounted for 78% of precipitation and evapotranspiration for 23%. Water retention capacity was highest and generally similar for both forests, where 71-72% of annual precipitation drained to the subsurface. The results of this study suggest that the creation of large canopy gaps in fir-beech forests in the Dinaric Karst results in significant and long-lasting reduction in soil and vegetation water retention capacity due to unfavorable conditions for successful natural tree regeneration. For optimal provision of water regulation ecosystem services of forests in the Dinaric Karst, small, irregularly shaped canopy gaps no larger than tree height should be created, mimicking the structural characteristics of naturally occurring gaps in old-growth forests.

AB  - The economic reality of the Romanian rural space describes a different unemployment rate than those registered in the urban areas or at national level. At the same time, the dynamics of the economic sectors belonging to the rural areas is different from its evolution in the urban environment. Forms of employment in rural areas tend to be predominantly of a permanent nature, to the detriment of temporary work or seasonal ones. Elements of influence on the individual, which affect the decision to work or the option to choose a satisfactory job are the financial and social conditions. Influencing factors such as the level of education and qualification, the level of income per person or household, the work seasonality phenomenon in different economic sectors, constantly change the employment work level, also the contractual form in which the work is performed. This article describes the interaction of some economic and social indicators on the unemployment rate in the Romanian rural areas and highlights its evolution in the economic and social context of the last decade. The analysis method used in this paper is the quantitative one. An important share of the total number of unemployed in rural areas, is represented by people who have never worked, who have never had a work experience, regardless of age or level of education. The highest values are registered for people aged between 15-24 years and for those who graduated high school and the lowest weight values are for people aged 55-64 years and those with university degrees. For the last decade, the highest number of rural unemployed are people who have finished or graduate the high school, and the unemployed with secondary school. The highest increasing value of unemployed people is recorded in 2015. The highest decreasing values of unemployed people are recorded between 2016 and 2019.

AB  - The water flea Daphnia magna is a keystone species in freshwater ecosystems and has been widely used as a model organism in environmental ecotoxicology. This aquatic crustacean is sensitive to environmental stressors and displays considerable plasticity in adapting to changing environmental conditions. Part of this plasticitymay be due to epigenetic regulation of gene expression, including changes to DNA methylation and histone modifications. Because of the generally hypomethylated genome of this species, we hypothesized that the histone code may have an essential role in the epigenetic control and that histone modifications might be an earlymarker for stress. This study aims to characterize the epigenetic, transcriptional and phenotypic responses and their causal linkages in directly exposed adult (F0) Daphnia and peritoneal exposed neonates (F1) after a chronic (7-day) exposure to a sublethal concentration (10 mg/l) of 5-azacytidine, a well-studied vertebrate DNA methylation inhibitor. Exposure of the F0 generation significantly reduced the cumulative fecundity, accompanied with differential expression of genes in the one-carbon-cyclemetabolic pathway. In the epigenome of the F0 generation, a decrease in global DNA methylation, but no significant changes on H3K4me3 or H3K27me3, were observed. In the F1 offspring generation, changes in gene expression, a significant reduction in global DNA methylation and changes in histone modifications were identified. The results indicate that exposure during adulthood may result in more pronounced effects on early development in the offspring generation, though interpretation of the data should be carefully done since both the exposure regime and developmental period is different in the two generations examined. The obtained results improve our understanding of crustacean epigenetics and the tools developed may promote use of epigenetic markers in hazard assessment of environmental stressors.

AB  - Leatherstem plants (Jatropha dioica) live in arid and semiarid climates, it is used in traditional medicine and could also be utilized as an industrial raw material, which is why this plant is vital to the economy of rural populations. The fundamental aspects of its distribution and abundance are unknown, as well as the environmental factors that determine them. The objective of this study was to determine its distribution, abundance, and the variables that influence its density, height, and biomass of stems. The area of study consisted of 86 493 km(2), and the sampling design consisted in locating sites using a grid of 5x5 km with the software program ArcGIS 9.2 and scale 1: 250 000, and 3 % of the squares were randomly selected (234 sampling sites). We conducted the fieldwork from February 2011 to March 2013. We registered the abundance and height of stems in each site and measured the altitude and slope of the terrain in plots of 10x100 m. By mapping, we registered the physiographic subprovinces (PSP), the types of vegetation and the types of soil. For every individual measured in the field, we adjusted a tabulation of equivalence between height and biomass from 500 stems with different heights. The abundance, height, and weight of the stems between de PSPs, type of vegetation, type of soil, slope, and altitude of the terrain were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test in each case. There were significant differences in density and weight between every variable. The height was only different in the type of vegetation and slope. The abundance of stems of J. dioica was higher in terrains with little slope and with scrub vegetation, the distribution in North-central Mexico is broad, and the habitat conditions influence the distribution and abundance.

AB  - Sewage inputs on fluvial ecosystems affect benthic communities and alter trophic networks resulting in changes on river functioning. Functional indicators (e.g. river metabolism) have been proposed as a valuable tool to evaluate ecosystem impairment. In the present study we monitored river metabolism in spring (few days after a major flood) and in summer (after 35 days of low flow conditions) using both single-station and two-stations methods over a 24 h period up and downstream of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents on three Atlantic river reaches located in northern Spain (Europe). Concurrently with river metabolism, we characterized environmental characteristics (flow, velocity, depth, pH, water temperature, nutrients, etc.), benthic macroinvertebrate communities and biofilm (algae and epilithic biomass). Ecosystem Respiration (ER24) was similar at the different periods and locations, but Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) tended to decrease in impacted reaches (downstream WWTPs) and in summer (except in the Saja River). However, the balance of the metabolic processes showed a trend towards autotrophy in the largest river, while WWTP effluents increased its autotrophy. Chlorophyll a concentration was >4 times larger in spring than in summer in all river reaches, while epilithic biomass followed a similar but less obvious pattern. Increase of invertebrate scraper densities (mainly, Potamopyrgus antipodarum) seems to be a plausible explanation for biofilm biomass temporal patterns in all sites (higher in spring than in summer), altering GPP and ER24 patterns. Thus, metabolism rates show different responses to WWTP effluents depending on season and on the relationships among functional and structural components, with special focus on the composition and structure of macroinvertebrate communities. Increasing our understanding of cause-effect relationships on the impairment of aquatic ecosystems needs to account for both structural and functional components and their interactions.

Contrary to the expectation that the injected CO2 dispersed in the direction of groundwater flow, the model simulations showed that the CO2 plume was isotopically dispersed initially and then transported preferentially towards the northeastern direction of the injection well. This result can be related to the zone of a relatively higher electrical resistivity (ER) where the injection well existed and the northeastern zone where a relatively lower ER was distributed. The results of model simulations on the change of volume factions of major minerals via water-rock-CO2 interactions for the period of 1,000 years after the CO2 injection indicate that naturally-occurring K-feldspar, albite, anorthite, chlorite, kaolinite, and glauconite seemed to be continuously dissolved as a result of decreasing pH, whereas quartz and illite were observed to be predominantly precipitated. Furthermore, it is likely that the mineral trapping of the injected CO2 was mostly contributed to calcite and dolomite. However, the volume fraction of magnesite seemed not to be changed, and which indicates that it was not precipitated under the given conditions of temperature and pressure. It is expected that these results of model simulations can be applied as one of indicators to quantitatively evaluate the long-term efficiency of mineral trapping of injected CO2.

AB  - Artificial water bodies like reservoirs are unique in sense that they encompass hybrid characters of both lakes and streams. Detailed study of reservoir ecosystem is necessary in order to understand and evaluate the health of such systems. A universal characteristic of any ecosystem is its ability to counter stress conditions and this ability is termed robustness which signifies the systems sustainability. Exergy or eco-exergy, measuring the amount of stored workable energy in the system is another important descriptor of an ecosystem. Both robustness and eco-exergy are good indicators of ecosystem health and also they are dependent on the magnitude and type of the inflicted stress. Robustness of Bakreswar reservoir system has been studied here following hypothetical perturbation scenarios that represent possible real situations of eutrophication (nutrient loading) and over fishing. Quite a few descriptive ecosystem indices have also been considered for the current study including Total System Throughflow (TST), Finn Cycling Index (FC1), Redundancy (R), Ascendancy (A), Developmental capacity (C), Total Primary Production to Total Respiration ratio (TPP/TR), Total Primary Production to Total Biomass Ratio (TPP/TB), detritivory to herbivory ratio and also the Exergy of the system. It is concluded from this study that the Bakreswar reservoir is a moderately stable ecosystem with fair maturity level and is able to withstand stress for a reasonable extent. The network indices revealed that variation in robustness of the system is related more with fish biomass perturbation scenario rather than that for the autotroph biomass perturbations. This is confirmed by the network indices as well as the change in the system exergy values which shows more variation in the fish biomass scenario.

AB  - Forests are being clearcut over extensive areas of western North America, but plant community response to harvesting and slashburning under varying climatic conditions in central British Columbia, Canada is still largely unknown. Evaluation of resilience is hampered by the short history of logging, lack of long-term experiments and methodological limitations. To test the effect of clearcut logging, prescribed burning and reforestation on forest resilience, we recorded vascular plant cover repeatedly after treatment between 1981 and 2008 in 16 permanent research installations in three biogeoclimatic zones: Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir, Interior Cedar-Hemlock and Sub-Boreal Spruce. We created a plant-trait dataset for the 181 recorded species to define plant functional types representing groups of plants that behave in similar ways and/or produce similar ecological outcomes. These plant functional types, along with taxonomic analysis of diagnostic and indicator species, were then used to evaluate plant community response to disturbance. Twenty years post-treatment, species diversity increased in all zones and plant abundance was greatest in the Interior Cedar-Hemlock. Cover of understory plant functional types associated with mature conifer forests increased in all zones, constituting a significant proportion (> 40%) of the vegetation community by year 20. Response patterns varied by zone and with time. Understory species diagnostic of mature forests were present in all zones by year 20, but we identified indicator species sensitive to slashburning or requiring more time for recovery, including white-flowered rhododendron (Rhododendron albiflorum) and devil's club (Oplopanax horridus). Overall, loss of compositional or functional diversity following harvest and site remediation was not detected, suggesting that montane and subalpine forests in British Columbia are resilient to this treatment. However, because these forests can be slow to recover from disturbance, the post-disturbance assessment window of this study may not have been long enough to detect diminishment of ecosystem resilience.

AB  - The Foraminifera are a diverse class of protists whose ubiquity in marine environments, small shells, and ease of collection have made them critical tools in bioindicator, bioassay, paleo-environmental, and paleoceanographic research. Despite the plethora of applications and accompanying literature on foraminifers, many aspects of their biology and ecology remain unexplored. One of these aspects is dormancy, a life-history strategy involving suspension of active life, arrested development, and reduced or suspended metabolic activity, mediated either by internal physiological factors (known as diapause) or exogenous factors (known as quiescence). Dormancy is a widespread adaptation, playing a role in the life cycles of a huge variety of organisms. Yet, despite anecdotal and circumstantial evidence, very little research has directly addressed this aspect of foraminiferal biology. The relatively recent discovery of cryptobiotic propagules has revealed a fundamental role for dormancy in the life cycles of foraminifers, most prominently for dispersal. Moreover, culture studies with environmental applications have shown that post-propagule quiescence (i.e., in juveniles, sub-adults and adults) may be a common response to environmental stressors, allowing rapid recovery of populations following disturbance or otherwise unfavorable conditions.
   A review of publications on foraminiferal biology revealed that observations indicating the potential for dormancy have been recorded for at least six decades, and that this potential is well represented throughout the class in a variety of forms, suggesting that dormancy may be a basic adaptation in the Foraminifera. If dormancy is as widespread as the literature suggests, its role in structuring foraminiferal assemblages and determining global distributions in the geological past, present, and future is fundamental. Further research into the mechanisms of dormancy will expand understanding of its role in foraminiferal life cycles, and provide new perspectives in the many fields that utilize and apply foraminiferal data.

AB  - Intensive anthropogenic land use such as urbanization alters the hydrological cycle, water chemistry and physical habitat characteristics, thus impairing stream physicochemical and biological quality. Diatoms are widely used to assess stream water quality as they integrate water chemistry temporally and reflect the joint influence of multiple stressors on stream biota. However, knowledge of the major community patterns of diatoms in urban streams remains limited especially in boreal regions. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of water chemistry and catchment characteristics on stream diatom communities, and to test the performance of the Index of Pollution Sensitivity (IPS) as a stream water quality indicator across an urban-to-rural gradient in southern Finland. Diatom community structure and species richness were related to local-scale variables such as water temperature, aluminium concentration, and electrical conductivity, which were in turn influenced by patterns in catchment land use and land cover. Diatoms reflected the intensity of human activities as more intensive land use increased the occurrence of pollution-tolerant species. The change in community structure along the land use intensity gradient was accompanied by a distinct decline in species richness. On the contrary, the IPS index failed to indicate differences in water quality along the urban-to-rural gradient as no consistent differences in the IPS values were found. Our results highlight the joint influence of multifaceted factors that underlie diatom patterns, and show that diatom biodiversity can be used as cost-effective metric indicating urban stream conditions. However, the IPS index turned out to be an unsuitable tool for assessing water quality among these streams. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - To explore the heat and cold adaptation in Indian goats by the physiological, haematological, blood biochemical parameters and their seasonal variations, this study was conducted on heat- and cold-adapted Indian goats maintained in their natural habitat. Study was carried out in three different phases coincide with the three seasons (winter, spring and summer). The levels of physiological responses, that is rectal temperature, respiration rate and pulse rate, were observed to be significantly (p<0.01) lower in heat-adapted breeds and higher in cold-adapted breeds, whereas the levels of Hb, PCV and TEC were significantly (p<0.01) higher in cold-adapted goats. Significantly (p<0.01) higher levels of plasma thyroid hormones (thyroxine and triiodothyronine) and plasma stress enzyme (AST and ALT) were also observed in cold-adapted goats. Significant (p<0.01) seasonal variations in physiological responses, haematological and blood biochemical parameters in both heat- and cold-adapted breeds were reported in this study. Physiological responses, plasma enzymes and plasma cortisol levels significantly (p<0.01) increased during summer in all the goat breeds. The levels of haematological parameters (Hb, PCV, TEC and TLC) and plasma thyroid hormones (thyroxine and triiodothyronine) decreased during summer. The changes in physiological parameters during summer due to heat stress were higher in cold-adapted goats whereas the levels of changes in these parameters during winter due to cold were higher in heat-adapted goats. High neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio during summer in cold-adapted breeds is an indicator of higher level of stress. Decrease in plasma electrolytes (Na and K) during summer also observed in cold-adapted breeds during summer. The variations in physiological, haematological, blood biochemical parameters in heat- and cold-adapted goats may be due to their adaptation to different environmental and geographical conditions essential for their survival.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess changes in forest owners' preferences regarding indicators of sustainable forest management. The analysis and deliberation framework served as a platform upon which to explore these changes in a rural community in Puebla, Mexico. Sixty-two indicators were selected from existing sets to design a five-point Likert survey instrument. The instrument was administered three times: early in the study to capture the forest owners' preferences before intervention (baseline); following an educational meeting in which the participants learned of three alternative forest management plans (analysis); and following a community meeting in which the forest owners deliberated to choose one of the alternatives (deliberation).
   As forest owners were exposed to knowledge (analysis) and deliberation, their preferences for the indicators changed significantly. An examination of the instrument demonstrated how the indicators increased or decreased in importance. Social and economic indicators tended to be ranked differently following analysis and again following deliberation because of the commitment to pursue a forest management plan that would benefit the community without jeopardizing stakeholder values. The ecological indicators directly associated with forest structure gained relevance following the analysis meeting. The deliberation process elucidated the importance of forest administration and professional help.
   Forest owners' preferences were reflected by the selection of the management plan that included good science and accommodated community values. The forest owners changed their preferences in response to new knowledge, management objectives, and their commitment to safeguarding the future condition of the forest. Analysis and deliberation is a participatory forum that facilities communication and learning and allows stakeholders to share values; thus, it serves as a mechanism for forest planning.

AB  - Performance assessment, impact detection, and the assessment of regulatory compliance are common scientific problems for the management of protected areas. Some habitats in protected areas, however, are rare and/or variable and are not often selected for study by ecologists because they preclude comparison with controls and high community variability makes meaningful change detection difficult. Shallow coastal saline lagoons are habitats that experience comparatively high levels of stress due to high physical variability. Lagoons are rare, declining habitats found in coastal regions throughout Europe (and elsewhere) where they are identified as one of the habitats most in need of protected area management. The infauna in the sediments of 25 lagoons were sampled. Temporal and spatial variation in three of these [protected] lagoons was investigated further over 5years. In a multivariate analysis of community structure similarities were found between some lagoons, but in other cases communities were unique or specific to only two sites. The protected lagoons with these unique/specific communities showed significant temporal and spatial variation, yet none of the changes observed were attributed to human impacts and were interpreted as inherent variability. Multivariate control charts can operate without experimental controls and were used to assess community changes within the context of normal' lagoon variability. The aim of control chart analysis is to characterize background variability in a parameter and identify when a new observation deviates more than expected. In only 1 year was variability more than expected and corresponded with the coldest December in over 100years. Multivariate control charts are likely to have wide application in the management of protected areas and other natural systems where variability and/or rarity preclude conventional analytical and experimental approaches but where assessments of condition, impact or regulatory compliance are nonetheless required.

AB  - MONSERRAT, A.L.; CELSI, C.E., and FONTANA, S.L., 2012. Coastal dune vegetation of the Southern Pampas (Buenos Aires, Argentina) and its value for conservation. Journal of Coastal Research, 28(1), 23-35. West Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208.
   Vegetation structure and species composition of southern Pampas coastal dunes were studied to evaluate their significance for conservation. The vegetation was described in 41 plots of 100 m(2) along four transects perpendicular to the coast. The floristic dataset was classified by two-way indicator species analysis. Vegetation distribution patterns were analysed in relation to the geomorphology and environmental factors. Fifty-one taxa (19 families) of vascular plants were recorded, with Asteraceae, Poaceae, and Fabaceae being the most abundant. The main vegetation groups obtained from the classification are related to distinctive geomorphology. (1) Upper beach and active dunes are habitats with extreme conditions, characterized by species-poor associations with low vegetation cover; group dominated by few shrubs and gramines like Panicum urvilleanum, Calycera crassifolia, and Senecio bergii. (2) Fixed/semifixed dunes are habitats with more stable substrate, characterized by dense vegetation, high species richness, and woody life forms; group dominated by Poa lanuginosa, Hyalis argentea var. latisquama, Oenothera mollissima, and Glycyrrhiza astragalina. (3) Hygrophilous communities are mostly associated with dune slacks with high herbaceous vegetation cover; group largely dominated by Cortaderia selloana, Typha sp., and Intperata brasiliensis. Detrended correspondence analysis shows that the major floristic variation follows a gradient from the beach inland. Also, there is a clear zonation pattern strongly associated with geomorphologic heterogeneity. The occurrence of threatened species (e.g., Adesmia filipes, Neosparton ephedroides) and endemic taxa (S. bergii and Baccharis divaricata) plus the high habitat diversity and plant species richness confers to the area special value for conservation. The ecological role of dune vegetation is discussed in conservation and management context.

AB  - A 332-cm long lacustrine core was drilled in the Nam Co in the central-southern part of the Tibetan Plateau. From the core, 15 species of ostracods (Crustacea: Ostracoda), which belong to 6 genera have been identified. According to the variations of the ostracod assemblages and the ostracods ecological features, which are sensitive to the changing environment, three main stages can be distinguished as follows: Stage I was from 8400 to 6800 a BP, during which the climate was cold-humid, and the lake depth changed from shallow to deep. Stage 11 was from 6400 to 2500 a BP, during which the climate changed from warm-humid to cold-humid, and then to cold-dry. The lake depth gradually became deep. The shifting of climate, from wet-cold to dry-cold during this period, had constructed the basis of present environment in the Nam Co. Stage III was from 2500 a BP to the present, which showed a trait of lake depth increasing. At the earlier period of this stage, the climate kept as cold-dry as that in the former stage, but the salinity of the lake increased. At the later period of this stage, the degree of cold-dry was enhanced, and the activities of land surface runoff tended to be weakened. Our research also found that the peak values of ostracods with black shell was coherent with the maximum production of the ostracods, and agreed with the increasing sedimentary water dynamics. This indicated that the ostracods with black shell was simultaneous with the high prolificacy of ostracod, and transported from other places. The abundance of Candona juvenile shells reflected the high mortality of that kind of ostracods under an unfavorable condition. This was probably a result of the rapid change of water dynamics of sedimentary environment.

AB  - We investigated quantitatively the sensitivity of plant species response curves to sampling characteristics (number of plots, occurrence and frequency of species), along a simulated pH gradient. We defined 54 theoretical unimodal response curves, issued from combinations of six values for optimum (opt = 3,4,..., 8), three values for tolerance (tol = 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5, sensu ter Braak and Looman [ter Braak, C.J.F., Looman, CW.N., 1986. Weighted averaging, logistic regression and the Gaussian response model. Vegetatio 65, 3-111), and three values for maximum probability of presence (p(max) = 0.05, 0.20, and 0. 50). For each of these 54 theoretical response curves, we built artificial binary data sets (presence/absence) to test the influence of species occurrence, frequency, or number of available plots. With real data extracted from EcoPlant, a phytoecological database for French forests [Gegout, J.-C., Coudun, Ch., Bailly, G., jabiol, B., 2005. EcoPlant: a forest sites database linking floristic data with soil characteristics and climatic conditions. J. Veg. Sci. 16, 257-2601, we compared the ecological response of 50 plant species to soil pH, based first on a small data set (100 randomly sampled plots), and then based on the whole data set available (3810 plots).
   Results on simulated data showed that the curve optimum, amplitude, or maximum probability of presence, cannot be assessed reliably with logistic regression, when a species is too rare, or when its theoretical optimum lies near an extreme of the gradient. Those theoretical results were illustrated by real data extracted from EcoPlant. We suggest a general minimum value of 50 occurrences for species to derive acceptable ecological response curves with logistic regression. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Since the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, considerable movement has been made by international organizations engaged in ocean affairs towards adopting ecosystem-based assessment and management practices. A decade later, at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), another significant milestone was reached with the support, by over 100 countries, for a Plan of Implementation that agreed on several specific ecosystem-related targets including: achievement of "substantial" reductions in land-based sources of pollution by 2006; introduction of the ecosystems approach to marine resource assessment and management by 2010; designation of a network of marine protected areas by 2012; and the maintenance and restoration of fish stocks to maximum sustainable yield levels by 2015. An international financial mechanism, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), is assisting developing countries in meeting the WSSD targets by supporting Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) assessment and management projects. Of the 29 LMEs for which published case study information is available on analyses of principal forces driving changes in biomass yields, fishing effort was the primary forcing mechanism in 14 LMEs, climate forcing was the principal factor in 13 LMEs, eutrophication in one case and the data were inconclusive in another. Fishing effort was a secondary driver of change in biomass yields in the 13 LMEs driven by climate forcing. Mitigating actions for reducing fishing effort to promote recovery of lost biomass yield is proving successful in one case study. Actions for improving forecasts of oceanographic conditions affecting fish stocks are underway in four GEF-supported LME projects (e.g., Humboldt Current, Canary Current, Guinea Current and Benguela Current); measures to assess and manage excessive fishing effort are planned for eight LME projects, eutrophication reduction and control in another; and six LMEs with relatively stable decadal biomass yields appear suitable for mandating precautionary total allowable catch levels. The GEF/LME projects include countries that contributed to 45% of global marine biomass yields in 1999. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The extremely high level of solar radiation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau may induce photoinhibition and thus limit leaf carbon gain. To assess the effect of high light, we examined gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence for two species differing in light interception: the prostrate Saussurea superba and the erect-leaved Gentiana straminea. In controlled conditions with favorable water and temperature, neither species showed apparent photoinhibition in gas exchange measurements. In natural environment, however, their photosynthetic rate decreased remarkably at high light. Photosynthesis depression was aggravated under high leaf temperature or soil water stress. Relative stomatal limitation was much higher in S. superba than in G. straminea and it remarkably increased in the later species at midday when soil was dry. F-v/F-m as an indicator for photoinhibition was generally higher in S. superba than in the other species. F-v/F-m decreased significantly under high light at midday in both species, even when soil moisture was high. F-0 linearly elevated with the increment of leaf temperature in G. straminea, but remained almost constant in S. superba. Electron transport rate (ETR) increased with photosynthetically active photon flux density (PPFD) in S. superba, but declined when PPFD was high than about 1000 mumol m(-2) s(-1) in G. straminea. Compared to favorable environment, the estimated daily leaf carbon gain at PPFD above 800 mumol m(-2) s(-1) was reduced by 32% in S. superba and by 17% in G. straminea when soil was moist, and by 43% and 53%, respectively, when soil was dry. Our results suggest that the high radiation induces photoinhibition and significantly limits photosynthetic carbon gain, and the limitation may further increase at higher temperature and in dry soil.

AB  - The relationship between environmental variables, community composition and the sensitivity of periphyton on artificial substrata to the herbicide atrazine (EC50 values obtained by concentration-effect curves of photosynthesis to atrazine) was studied for 20 stream and river sites on a latitudinal gradient across Europe (Sweden, The Netherlands, Spain). Sensitivity to atrazine was higher in the Swedish than in the Spanish or Dutch sites. Direct gradient analyses were used to relate diatom taxa and algal groups with environmental variables. A first redundancy analysis (RDA) based on diatom taxa showed a pollution gradient (atrazine and nutrient concentration) associated to diatom taxa that are indicators of different degrees of pollution. A second RDA based on algal groups showed that diatom-dominated communities corresponded both to sites at higher altitudes and less industrialized areas and to sites with higher atrazine concentration; Cyanobacteria were the most common in industrial areas, whereas Chlorophyceae dominated in sites with high water temperature and alkalinity. Linear regression analyses were applied to find the relationship between the ordination axes obtained and the EC50 values. First axes of both RDA showed significant or marginally significant relationship with atrazine sensitivity. Regression analyses for the Spanish sites indicated that the sensitivity to atrazine was related with light conditions (EC50 was positively correlated with light) and the percentage of different algal groups (EC50 was positively correlated with the percentage of diatoms and negatively correlated with the percentage of green algae). The results indicating that differences in sensitivity are related to environmental variables such as light, nutrients or atrazine concentration, permitted us to identify biological indicators of sensitivity to atrazine in lotic systems: Bacillariophyceae-dominated periphyton communities were more tolerant than Chlorophyceae and Chrysophyceae-dominated communities. In addition, diatom taxa found to be tolerant to atrazine in this study have been considered in the literature to be tolerant to organic pollution.

AB  - Particulate matter (PM) is the primary air pollutant in northern China. The PM2.5/PM10 ratio has been used increasingly as an indicator to reflect anthropogenic PM pollution, but its advantages compared with individual PM2.5 or PM10 concentrations have not been proven sufficiently by experimental data. By dividing Hebei Province (China) into seven natural ecological regions, this study investigated the spatial characteristics of the PM2.5/PM10 ratio and its relationships with PM2.5, PM10, economic density, and wind speed. Results showed that the PM2.5/PM10 ratio decreased from east to west and from south to north, with an annual average value in 2019 of 0.439-0.559. The characteristics of the spatial variation of the PM2.5/PM10 ratio were different to those of either PM2.5 or PM10 concentration, indicating that PM pollution reflected by the PM2.5/PM10 ratio is not entirely consistent with that by PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations. In comparison with PM2.5 or PM10 concentration, the PM2.5/PM10 ratio had higher (lower) correlation with economic density (wind speed), indicating that the PM2.5/PM10 ratio is a better indicator used to reflect the intensity of anthropogenic emissions of PM pollutants. According to the characteristics of the spatial variations of the PM2.5/PM10 ratio and the PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations, the seven ecological regions of Hebei Province were categorized into four different types of atmospheric PM pollution: "three low regions," "three high regions," "one high and two low regions," and "one low and two high regions." This reflects the comprehensive effect of the intensity of anthropogenic PM emissions and the atmospheric diffusion conditions.

AB  - Distinguishing between human impacts and natural variation in abundance remains difficult because most species exhibit complex patterns of variation in space and time. When ecological monitoring data are available, a before-after-control-impact (BACI) analysis can control natural spatial and temporal variation to better identify an impact and estimate its magnitude. However, populations with limited distributions and confounding spatial-temporal dynamics can violate core assumptions of BACI-type designs. In this study, we assessed how such properties affect the potential to identify impacts. Specifically, we quantified the conditions under which BACI analyses correctly (or incorrectly) identified simulated anthropogenic impacts in a spatially and temporally replicated data set of fish, macroalgal, and invertebrate species found on nearshore subtidal reefs in southern California, USA. We found BACI failed to assess very localized impacts, and had low power but high precision when assessing region-wide impacts. Power was highest for severe impacts of moderate spatial scale, and impacts were most easily detected in species with stable, widely distributed populations. Serial autocorrelation in the data greatly inflated false impact detection rates, and could be partly controlled for statistically, while spatial synchrony in dynamics had no consistent effect on power or false detection rates. Unfortunately, species that offer high power to detect real impacts were also more likely to detect impacts where none had occurred. However, considering power and false detection rates together can identify promising indicator species, and collectively analyzing data for similar species improved the net ability to assess impacts. These insights set expectations for the sizes and severities of impacts that BACI analyses can detect in real systems, point to the importance of serial autocorrelation (but not of spatial synchrony), and indicate how to choose the species, and groups of species, that can best identify impacts.

AB  - Characterizing indoor microbial communities using molecular methods provides insight into bacterial assemblages present in environments that can influence occupants' health. We conducted an environmental assessment as part of an epidemiologic study of 50 elementary schools in a large city in the northeastern USA. We vacuumed dust from the edges of the floor in 500 classrooms accounting for 499 processed dust aliquots for 16S Illumina MiSeq sequencing to characterize bacterial assemblages. DNA sequences were organized into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and identified using a database derived from the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Bacterial diversity and ecological analyses were performed at the genus level. We identified 29 phyla, 57 classes, 148 orders, 320 families, 1193 genera, and 2045 species in 3073 OTUs. The number of genera per school ranged from 470 to 705. The phylum Proteobacteria was richest of all while Firmicutes was most abundant. The most abundant order included Lactobacillales, Spirulinales, and Clostridiales. Halospirulina was the most abundant genus, which has never been reported from any school studies before. Gram-negative bacteria were more abundant and richer (relative abundance = 0.53; 1632 OTUs) than gram-positive bacteria (0.47; 1441). Outdoor environment-associated genera were identified in greater abundance in the classrooms, in contrast to homes where human-associated bacteria are typically more abundant. Effects of school location, degree of water damage, building condition, number of students, air temperature and humidity, floor material, and classroom's floor level on the bacterial richness or community composition were statistically significant but subtle, indicating relative stability of classroom microbiome from environmental stress. Our study indicates that classroom floor dust had a characteristic bacterial community that is different from typical house dust represented by more gram-positive and human-associated bacteria. Health implications of exposure to the microbiomes in classroom floor dust may be different from those in homes for school staff and students.

AB  - Coral communities around the world are projected to be negatively affected by ocean acidification. Not all coral species will respond in the same manner to rising CO2 levels. Evidence from naturally acidified areas such as CO2 seeps have shown that although a few species are resistant to elevated CO2, most lack sufficient resistance resulting in their decline. This has led to the simple grouping of coral species into "winners" and "losers," but the physiological traits supporting this ecological assessment are yet to be fully understood. Here using CO2 seeps, in two biogeographically distinct regions, we investigated whether physiological traits related to energy production [mitochondrial electron transport systems (ETSAs) activities] and biomass (protein contents) differed between winning and losing species in order to identify possible physiological traits of resistance to ocean acidification and whether they can be acquired during shortterm transplantations. We show that winning species had a lower biomass (protein contents per coral surface area) resulting in a higher potential for energy production (biomass specific ETSA: ETSA per protein contents) compared to losing species. We hypothesize that winning species inherently allocate more energy toward inorganic growth (calcification) compared to somatic (tissue) growth. In contrast, we found that losing species that show a higher biomass under reference pCO(2) experienced a loss in biomass and variable response in area-specific ETSA that did not translate in an increase in biomass-specific ETSA following either short-term (4-5 months) or even lifelong acclimation to elevated pCO(2) conditions. Our results suggest that resistance to ocean acidification in corals may not be acquired within a single generation or through the selection of physiologically resistant individuals. This reinforces current evidence suggesting that ocean acidification will reshape coral communities around the world, selecting species that have an inherent resistance to elevated pCO(2).

AB  - The use of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in vegetable species is one of the technological procedures applied to improve the spectral composition of light in protected areas, as well as to stimulate plant growth, obtaining high values of production and increasing resistance to conditions of culture. The biological material represented by tomato seedlings, from varieties with nutritional value and with high ecological plasticity, was studied in terms of characterizing the effects of applying the treatment using light fields emitted by blue, red and white LEDs, by analysis physiological parameters, such as: photosynthesis intensity (mu mols CO(2)m(-2)s(-1)), transpiration intensity (mmoles H2O m(-2)s(-1)), stomatal conductance (mols H2O m(-2)s(-1)) and intercellular carbon dioxide (mu mol CO2 mol(-1) air). In this study, the estimation of the amount of total chlorophyll (mg m(-2)), was also investigated. The determinations of the physiological parameters were performed in 3 series, and the recorded results were statistically analysed, by expressing the significance of the differences between the control and the studied tomato varieties being studied. Thus, after the treatment period, applied in 23 days (Series II), with monochrome LEDs, at the level of the stomatal conductance parameter, statistically assured values were registered for the plants in the 'L-75' line exposed to White LED and for those in the 'L-76' line exposed to the Blue LED. The analysis of the results from the investigation of the physiological parameters at the level of the leaves from the experimental samples indicated that after 35 days (Series III), from the application of the treatments of 30 minutes/day, with White LED light, they ensured the plants tomatoes from the 'L-76' line, distinctly significantly positive values, compared to those of the control plants, at the intensity of photosynthesis and the internal concentration of CO2.

AB  - Natural swimming ponds (NSPs) are artificially created bodies of water intended for human recreation, characterised by the substitution of chemical disinfection with natural biological processes for water purification. NSPs are growing in popularity, however little is known regarding the public health risks. A screening level risk assessment was undertaken as an initial step in assessing the first Canadian public NSP located in Edmonton, Alberta. Risk of enteric pathogens originating from pool bathers was assessed under normal conditions and following accidental faecal release events. The performance of the natural treatment train for health protection was quantified with and without the addition of UV disinfection of naturally-treated water, and compared to the US EPA benchmark to provide a reference point to consider acceptability. Estimated levels of pathogen contamination of the pond were dependant upon the discrete number of shedders present, which in turn depended upon the prevalence of infection in the population. Overall performance of the natural disinfection system was dependant upon the filtration rate of the natural treatment system or turnover time. Addition of UV disinfection reduced the uncertainty around the removal efficacy, and mitigated the impact of larger shedding events, however the impact of UV disinfection on the natural treatment biome is unknown. Further information is needed on the performance of natural barriers for pathogen removal, and therefore challenge studies are recommended. Given the identified risks, the pool is posted that there is risk from accidental faecal releases, as in any natural water body with swimmers. Screening level risk assessment was a valuable first step in understanding the processes driving the system and in identifying important data gaps. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human activities threaten the effectiveness of protected areas (PAs) in achieving their conservation goals across the globe. In this study, we contrast the influence of human and macro-environmental factors driving fire activity inside and outside PAs. Using area burned between 1984 and 2014 for 11 ecoregions in Canada and the United States, we built and compared statistical models of fire likelihood using the MaxEnt software and a set of 11 key anthropogenic, climatic, and physical variables. Overall, the full model (i.e. including all variables) performed better (adjusted area under the curve ranging from 0.71 to 0.95 for individual ecoregions) than the model that excluded anthropogenic variables. Both model types (with and without anthropogenic variables) generally performed better inside than outside the PAs. Climatic variables were usually of foremost importance in explaining fire activity inside and outside PAs, with anthropogenic variables being the second most important predictors, even inside PAs. While the individual contributions of anthropogenic variables indicate that fire activity decreased as of function of increasing human footprint, the anthropogenic effects were often substantially greater than those of physical features and were comparable to or even greater than climatic effects in some densely developed ecoregions, both outside and within PAs (e.g. Mediterranean California, Eastern Temperate Forest, and Tropical Wet Forests). Together, these results show the pervasive impact of humans on fire regimes inside PAs, as well as outside PAs. Given the increasing attractiveness of PAs, the implications for adaptive fire management beyond the concept of naturalness in the PAs are discussed. Our assessment of human-altered fire activity could serve as an indicator of human pressure in PAs; however, we suggest that further analysis is needed to understand specific interactions among fire, human pressures, and the environmental conditions at the scale of PAs.

AB  - Benthic foraminiferal assemblages from 19 superficial marine sediment samples of a coastal area in the Ligurian Sea were analysed for benthic foraminifera in order to recognize changes in assemblage composition and structure, decrease of faunal density, increased morphological abnormalities and inclusion of heavy metals in carbonate tests as possible evidences of environmental stress. Also grain size was determined as a main factor conditioning foraminifer's distribution.
   The generalized low faunal density was considered as indicative of environmental stress, attributable to the well-known natural Cr and Ni enrichment, which characterizes marine sediments of the region. The cluster analysis highlighted distinct foraminiferal assemblages with decreasing species diversity approaching to the coast. This distribution was interpreted as the result of local source of environmental stress, probably due to the stream contribution. Deformed foraminifera more abundant than background levels of unstressed environments were also recorded in 39% of samples.
   Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) analyses were carried out on carbonate tests of 55 specimens to investigate the role of the incorporation of heavy metals in the development of morphological abnormalities. Foraminifera showed the inclusion of heavy metals, not present in control specimens, indicating that environmental stress, due to metal sediment enrichment, plays a role in this phenomenon. Although anomalous elements were detected both in normal and deformed specimens and chambers, it was supposed that deformities develop as a result of the toxic effect of heavy metals on cytological activities because, contrarily to the normal specimens, all the deformed ones included anomalous elements. Higher occurrence of deformities in porcelaneous tests, typically enriched in Mg, is associated to the higher number of incorporated elements (Mn, Fe, Cu and Zn).

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential determinants of FDI, in developed and developing countries.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper investigates FDI determinants based on panel data analysis using static and dynamic modeling for 20 countries (11 developed and 9 developing), over the period 2004-2013. For static model estimations, Hausman (1978) test indicates the applicability of fixed effect/random effect, while generalized moments of methods (GMM) (dynamic model) is used to capture endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity.
   Findings The outcome across different countries depicts diverse results. In developed countries, FDI seeks policy-related determinants (GDP growth, trade openness, and freedom index), and in developing country FDI showed positive association for economic determinants (gross fixed capital formulation (GFCF), trade openness, and efficiency variables).
   Research limitations/implications The destination of FDI is limited to 20 countries in the present paper. The indicator of the institutional environment, namely economic freedom index, used in this paper has received some criticism in calculations.
   Practical implications The paper enlists recommendations for future FDI policies and may assist government in providing a tactical framework for skill development, thereby increasing manufacturing growth rate. The paper also throws light on vertical and horizontal capital inflows considering resource, strategy, and market-seeking FDI.
   Social implications FDI may bring significant benefits by creating high-quality jobs, introducing modern production and management practices. It highlights how multinational corporations and government contribute to better working conditions in host countries.
   Originality/value The paper uncovers important features like macroeconomic variables, especially country-wise efficiency scores, policy variables, GFCF, and freedom index, for determining FDI inflows in 20 countries using panel data methods and provides a roadmap for developed and developing countries. The study highlights endogeneity and unobserved heteroscedasticity by applying GMM one- and two-step procedure.

AB  - European heathland habitats are cultural landscapes derived from previously-forested ecosystems. Heathlands are of significant conservation interest but have experienced prolonged degradation due to a range of factors including overgrazing by domestic livestock. There is growing recognition of the need to restore upland landscapes to produce a diverse mosaic of woodlands, heathlands and forest edge ecotones. In some studies stock removal has been sufficient to promote heathland recovery, but often more intensive interventions are required. Few studies have specifically examined how abiotic gradients associated with changing elevation might relate to restoration success. We examined differences in vegetation between grazed and restored areas over a 500 m elevational gradient split across two hillsides that were part of a landscape-scale restoration project in the Scottish Southern Uplands. Species alpha and gamma diversity showed non-linear responses to elevation but the effects of grazing differed between sites. Grazing increased diversity on the lower elevation site but reduced it at higher elevations. The differing effects of grazing with elevation can be interpreted in the context of levels of competition and likely impacts on rates of colonization and extinction. Differences in community composition were assessed using PERMANOVA, NMDS and Cluster Analysis and were primarily controlled by elevation with no significant effect of grazing. The keystone heathland species Calluna vulgaris was not recorded in any of our monitoring plots but some other dwarf shrubs were common. Changes in community structure following stock removal are slow on upland sites but initial impacts interact strongly with abiotic site conditions and pre-restoration vegetation composition. During large-scale restoration it is therefore vital to consider how widely-applied treatments might differ in their effects across landscapes. Changes in diversity may provide a useful early indicator of important ecological processes and likely directions of change.

An easily measured resource composite (i.e., seston, epilithon, or leaf litter) often is used to represent ingested stoichiometry, but whether such a composite is a good indicator of food actually ingested is a relatively unexplored assumption. We examined the application of a stoichiometric model to the diets of 4 generalist stream invertebrates. We fed 3 trichopteran and 1 amphipod taxa rations consisting of cultured algae, stream epilithon, and several species of conditioned leaf litter. The rations ranged widely in C : N from 10 to 69 (molar) and in C : P from 165 to 3500. After a 2-d feeding period, we measured NH4+ and PO43- excretion, and C, N, and P egestion rates. The relationships observed between the stoichiometries of release and ration were unexpected. Total N: P release rates conformed to stoichiometric predictions for only 1 taxon. Excretion and egestion rates and ratios were generally similar across diets and rarely varied with ration stoichiometry. These patterns were the result of smaller-than-expected responses to leaf-litter rations, which were the most imbalanced relative to body stoichiometry. Analysis of the C: N stoichiometry of foregut material for 2 taxa showed selective ingestion of an N-rich fraction of leaf litter, in 1 case reducing an apparent 8.4 : 1 C: N imbalance between diet and body composition to 1.5 : 1. Our results show that selective feeding can reduce potential stoichiometric imbalances, altering patterns of nutrient release relative to expectations based on bulk-diet stoichiometry. Assuming that stream invertebrates consume materials stoichiometrically similar to a resource composite can obscure understanding of stoichiometric imbalances and the role of invertebrates in nutrient cycles.

AB  - Nitraria retusa nabkhas occupy a stretch within the old playa and supratidal sabkha flat along the northern coast of Kuwait Bay. These nabkhas were developed as a result of entrapment of wind transported sediments by N. retusa shrubs that were flourished within this particular stretch. A part of this stretch was protected within a National Reserve that was established in 1990, while the rest are left non-protected. This study aimed at the assessment and comparison of the population density, morphometric parameters and granulometric characteristics of these nabkhas in protected and non-protected areas. Several nabkha fields were selected within both protected and non-protected areas. Nabkha's population density and shrub canopy coverage area were measured using satellite imageries. Morphometric parameters were measured in the field and sediment samples were collected for grain size analysis. Collected data were statistically analyzed. It was concluded that protected nabkhas are well developed while the non-protected nabkhas are severely degraded. Nabkhas in protected area are generally large, display a domal shape, densely populated with a large shrub canopy, while those in the nonprotected area are relatively small, elongated, and scattered with a degraded shrub canopy. Degradation of non-protected nabkhas is attributed to drastic reduction of nabkha's shrub canopies which increase proneness of nabkha sediments to wind erosion. The coexistence of sever irrational anthropogenic activities, mainly overgrazing, and harsh climatic conditions, particularly prevailing drought during the last two decades is responsible for such degradation. It is recommended that the present Nature Reserve should be extended to cover the remaining nabkhas in the open area to avoid extinction of N. retusa shrubs in this sensitive coastal ecosystem.

AB  - In this study, we propose the use of the marine green alga Ostreococcus tauri, the smallest free-living eukaryotic cell known to date, as a new luminescent biosensor for toxicity testing in the environment. Diuron and Irgarol 1051, two antifouling biocides commonly encountered in coastal waters, were chosen to test this new biosensor along with two degradation products of diuron. The effects of various concentrations of the antifoulants on four genetic constructs of O. tauri (based on genes involved in photosynthesis, cell cycle, and circadian clock) were compared using 96-well culture microplates and a luminometer to automatically measure luminescence over 3 days. This was compared to growth inhibition of O. tauri wild type under the same conditions. Luminescence appeared to be more sensitive than growth inhibition as an indicator of toxicity. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDKA), a protein involved in the cell cycle, fused to luciferase (CDKA-Luc) was found to be the most sensitive of the biosensors, allowing an accurate determination of the 50% effective concentration (EC50) after only 2 days (diuron, 5.65 +/- 0.44 mu g/liter; Irgarol 1015, 0.76 +/- 0.10 mu g/liter). The effects of the antifoulants on the CDKA-Luc biosensor were then compared to growth inhibition in natural marine phytoplankton. The effective concentrations of diuron and Irgarol 1051 were found to be similar, indicating that this biosensor would be suitable as a reliable ecotoxicological test. The advantage of this biosensor over cell growth inhibition testing is that the process can be easily automated and could provide a high-throughput laboratory approach to perform short-term toxicity tests. The ability to genetically transform and culture recombinant O. tauri gives it huge potential for screening many other toxic compounds.

AB  - Within the forest sector, the sustainability concept has evolved from a narrow focus on sustainable wood production to a much broader evaluation of environmental, social, and economic sustainability for whole value chains. A new software tool - ToSIA - has been developed for assessing sustainability impacts of Forest-Wood-Chains (FWCs). In the approach, FWCs are defined as chains of production processes (e.g. harvesting-transport-industrial processing), which are linked with products (e.g. a timber frame house). Sustainability is determined by analysing environmental, economic, and social sustainability indicators for all the production processes along the FWC. The tool calculates sustainability values as products of the relative indicator values (i.e. indicator value expressed per unit of material flow) multiplied with the material flow entering the process. Calculated sustainability values are then aggregated for the segments of the FWC or for the complete chain. The sustainability impact assessment requires carefully specified system boundaries. ToSIA uses a data-oriented approach that is very flexible in the focus of the analysis and the selection of indicators of sustainability. An example of alternative Norway spruce management systems in Southern Germany and their effects on six sustainability indicators is presented. The less intensive management system with natural regeneration and motor-manual harvesting shows higher carbon storage and slightly less energy use. It creates more employment and higher labour costs, but the average rate of accidents is also higher. ToSIA offers a transparent and consistent methodological framework to assess sustainability impacts in the forest-based sector as affected, e.g. by changes in policies, market conditions, or technology. The paper discusses strengths and limitations of the approach and provides an outlook on further development perspectives of the methodology. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In highly anthropogenic plant communities, environmental conditions and human practices play a significant role in the composition, structure and diversity of the flora. This paper presents a study of current and past floras of two anthropogenic habitats (cultivated and ruderal) in eastern France that have been the subject of numerous palaeoenvironmental studies (pollen and seed analysis). To understand the different components that constitute the biodiversity of these floras, it is necessary to develop a transdisciplinary method combining ecology, phytogeography and palaeoenvironmental sciences. As a first step, a distinction has been made between native and alien plants as well as between two categories of the latter: archaeophytes (alien taxa introduced into a study area before Ad 1500) and neophytes (alien taxa which became established after Ad 1500). Second, the study of ecological characteristics of these species and the knowledge of human and climatic history of the region allow the elaboration of a synthesis of biodiversity evolution in these environments from the Neolithic to the present day. The results of this analysis show that there has been a constant enrichment of the anthropogenic flora by alien species through time. Two main periods can be emphasized: the first began in the late Neolithic and reached a peak in the late Bronze Age, the second began with the advent of Modern times. This kind of study has a double implication: first, by distinguishing between native and alien species (archaeophytes and neophytes) and by refining their ecological characteristics, the method allows a critical evaluation of the modern phytosociological units which are traditionally used to interpret fossil assemblages and to discriminate species that are 'strong' indicators of human activities. Second, the recognition of native and alien species also has implications for species invasion studies and for species conservation and vegetation management in anthropogenic habitats.

AB  - A quantitative analysis of benthic foraminifera was carried out on a scientific core from the type locality of the Paratethyan stage Badenian (Middle Miocene) and results were compared to stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta C-13) and magnetic susceptibility. Two approaches were applied to reconstruct the paleoenvironment. First, several indices (inbenthics %, oxyphylic %, foraminiferal numbers, diversity) and paleodepth proxies were calculated, second, multivariate statistics (Detrended Correspondence Analysis, cluster analyses combined with the indicator value method) were carried out. High correlations between environmental indices and core-depth manifest some trends. Five biofacies units were recognized, and the lowermost unit I encompasses a laminated interval coinciding with a biofacies subunit. The most indicative and abundant species is Uvigerina semiornata, a dysoxy tolerant inbenthic. The following unit II can be characterized as a stable period of improved oxygenation and lowered nutrient supply. Unit III is distinguished by Trifarina angulosa preferring well-aerated turbulent bottom water and sandy substrate, while accompanied by some low salinity tolerant species. A non-stratified water column with high terrigenous input is accepted for this unit. Unit IV is characterized by low diversities and the deep inbenthic indicator species Bulimina elongata, Fursenkoina acuta, tolerant of oxygen deficiency and benefiting from unlimited food supply in a well-stratified sea. The high foraminiferal numbers are the consequence of low terrigenous input not diluting the highly productive opportunistic species in the sediment. The indicator species of unit V, the reticulate Bolivina viennensis, has ecological needs similar to the previous unit. Environmental changes from unit IV to V are the increased terrigenous input and oscillation, indicating less stable conditions. The biofacies unit boundaries always coincide with major shifts of the isotope and susceptibility record. It is Concluded, that the physical environmental parameters controlling benthic foraminiferal distribution are primarily influenced by proximity to land.

AB  - The objective of this study was to quantify differences in udder health and milking characteristics among the Holstein-Friesian ( HF), Montbeliarde ( MB), Normande ( NM), Norwegian Red ( NRF), Montbeliarde x Holstein-Friesian ( MBX), and Normande x Holstein-Friesian ( NMX) genotypes, while considering the effect of feeding system and parity. A total of 749 lactations were available for inclusion in the analysis from 309 cows in 1 research herd over 5 yr. Somatic cell score ( SCS; i.e., natural logarithm of somatic cell count) was used as an indicator of udder health. Milking duration ( seconds/d) was defined as the sum of the milking duration in the a. m. and milking duration in the p. m. Average daily milk flow ( AMF; kg/min) was defined as total daily milk yield divided by total daily milking duration. Peak milk flow ( kg/min) was defined as the maximum rate of milk flow achieved in the daily milking process. The SCS of the NRF ( 10.31 units) and MB ( 10.47 units) breeds was less than that of the HF ( 10.96 SCS units), whereas that of the NM ( 10.88 SCS units), MBX ( 10.93 SCS units), and NMX ( 10.84 SCS units) breeds was similar to that of the HF. The MBX and NMX had the greatest AMF ( 1.56 and 1.54 kg/min, respectively) and the NM had the lowest ( 1.33 kg/min). Animals offered a high concentrate diet had greater AMF, peak milk flow, and milking duration. The differences expressed by the divergent breeds may reflect differences in the past breeding goals among the breeds, namely the inclusion of traits aimed at maintaining or improving udder health.

AB  - The red-backed shrike (Lanius collurio L.) is a bird living in human-altered agricultural areas that are managed by extensive farming techniques. This passerine species has declined significantly in Western Europe over the last 30-40 years. The development of efficient species-specific conservation strategies relies on fine-grained information about the ecological resources and environmental conditions that constitute its reproductive habitat in this agricultural landscape. Species distribution models are used increasingly in conservation biology to provide such information. Most studies investigate the environmental pattern of species distribution, assuming that species records are reliable indicators of habitat suitability. However, ecological theory on source-sink dynamics and ecological traps points out that some individuals may be located outside the environmental bounds of their species' reproductive niche. Those individuals could reduce model accuracy and limit model utility. Parameters related to the reproductive success of this shrike in Southern Belgium were integrated into a fine-scale presence-only modelling framework to demonstrate this problem and to address critical habitat requirements of this species relative to conservation management. Integrating reproductive parameters into the modelling framework showed that individuals occurred, but did not reproduce successfully, above a certain environmental threshold. This indicated that the reproductive niche of the shrike is ecologically narrower than standard practice in species distribution modelling would suggest. The major resources (nest sites availability, distance to human settlements, suitable perching sites, foraging areas and insect abundance) required for the reproduction of the red-backed shrike were quantified and ranked to offer concrete species -specific conservation management guidelines.

AB  - Many sexually selected traits exhibit phenotypic plasticity. Despite a growing appreciation for the ecological context in which sexual selection occurs, and for the role of plasticity in shaping traits associated with local adaptation and divergence, there is an important gap in knowledge about the onset and duration of plasticity in sexual trait expression. Integrating this temporal dimension of plasticity into models of sexual selection informs our understanding of the information conveyed by sexual traits and our predictions related to trait evolution, and is critical in this time of unprecedented and rapid environmental change. We conducted a systematic review of 869 studies to ask how trait modalities (e.g., visual and chemical) relate to the onset and duration of plasticity in vertebrate sexual signals. We show that this literature is dominated by studies of coloration in birds and fish, and most studies take place during the breeding season. Where possible, we integrate results across studies to link physiology of specific trait modalities with the life stage (e.g., juvenile, breeding, or nonbreeding) during which plasticity occurs in well-studied traits. Limitations of our review included a lack of replication in our dataset, which precluded formal analysis. We argue that the timing of trait plasticity, in addition to environmental context, is critical for determining whether and how various communication signals are associated with ecological context, because plasticity may be ongoing or occur at only one point in an individual's lifetime, and determining a fixed trajectory of trait expression. We advocate for careful consideration of the onset and duration of plasticity when analyzing how environmental variation affects sexual trait expression and associated evolutionary outcomes.

AB  - Cover crops production and soil cover in semi-arid ecoregions are considered the most challenging issues for improving soil quality into tropical ecosystems. The AMF diversity, and plant transpiratory rate in 5-year cultivation of green manure plant species in the Brazilian semi-arid, Areia, Paraiba, Brazil was investigated between August 2017 and April 2018. Soil samples containing colonized roots and AMF spores were collected using soil cores. Plant transpiratory rate was determined using an infrared gas analyzer under ten green manure plant species: B. decumbens Stapf. cv. Basilisk, C. ensiformis (L.) DC, C. juncea L, C. ochroleuca G. Don, C. spectabilis Roth, L. purpureus (L) Sweet, M. pruriens (L) DC, and N. wightii (Wight & Arn.) J.A. Lackey. The most abundant AMF species in our experiment were Claroideoglomus claroideum, Claroideoglomus etunicatum, Funneliformis mosseae, Glomus coremioides, and Rhizoglomus intraradices. The highest values of AMF diversity, dominance, and richness were found on the plots where N. wightii were cultivated. For the transpiratory rate, the highest leaf temperature and internal CO2 concentration were found on plots where C. ensiformis was cultivated, while the highest values of water use efficiency and instantaneous water use efficiency were found on plots where C. juncea was cultivated. Our findings suggest that: 1) green manure practice changed AMF abundance, richness, diversity, and dominance in tropical conditions; and 2) the plant transpiratory rate (e.g., water use efficiency, stomatal conductance, internal CO2 concentration, and photosynthetic rate) was promoted by plant species from Fabaceae family. The results highlight the importance to consider plant species from Fabaceae family as hosts for AMF species, based on a sustainable way to improve soil biodiversity, ecological processes, plant physiology, and soil productivity.

AB  - Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are designed to eliminate pollutants and alleviate environmental pollution resulting from human activities. However, the construction and operation of WWTPs consume resources, emit greenhouse gases (GHGs) and produce residual sludge, thus require further optimization. WWTPs are complex to control and optimize because of high non-linearity and variation. This study used a novel technique, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL), to simultaneously optimize dissolved oxygen (DO) and chemical dosage in a WWTP. The reward function was specially designed from life cycle perspective to achieve sustainable optimization. Five scenarios were considered: baseline, three different effluent quality and cost-oriented scenarios. The result shows that optimization based on LCA has lower environmental impacts compared to baseline scenario, as cost, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions reduce to 0.890 CNY/m(3)-ww, 0.530 kWh/m(3)-ww, 2.491 kg CO2-eq/m(3)-ww respectively. The cost-oriented control strategy exhibits comparable overall performance to the LCA-driven strategy since it sacrifices environmental benefits but has lower cost as 0.873 CNY/m(3)-ww. It is worth mentioning that the retrofitting of WWTPs based on resources should be implemented with the consideration of impact transfer. Specifically, LCA-SW scenario decreases 10 kg PO4-eq in eutrophication potential compared to the baseline within 10 days, while significantly increases other indicators. The major contributors of each indicator are identified for future study and improvement. Last, the authors discussed that novel dynamic control strategies required advanced sensors or a large amount of data, so the selection of control strategies should also consider economic and ecological conditions. In a nutshell, there are still limitations of this work and future studies are required. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Zooplankton communities in response to hydrological (salinity, turbidity, water temperature, nitrate, phosphate, silicate) and biological (phytoplankton density) variables were studied in the Asia's largest brackish water lagoon, Chilika (India). Water samples were collected from 13 stations on a monthly frequency between July 2014-June 2015. A total of 141 species of holoplankton including Ciliophora, Foraminifera, Rotifera, Rhizopoda, Gastropoda, Cladocera, Copepoda, Ostracoda, Malacostraca, Chaetognatha, Chordata, Nematoda, and 18 types of planktonic larvae were identified. Copepods were the most dominant and diverse zooplankton in terms of their species richness, numerical abundance, and widespread distribution in the lagoon. The major holoplanktonic taxa were Acartia sp., Acrocalanus gibber, Acrocalanus gracilis, Acrocalanus longicornis, Euterpina acutifrons, Lecane sp., Oithona sp., Pseudodiaptomus serricaudatus, and Tintinnopsis tubulosa. The dominant planktonic larvae were bivalve veliger, copepod nauplii, cyphonautes larvae, gastropod veliger, and protozoea of lucifer. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that distribution of zooplankton assemblages was influenced by salinity, turbidity, and phytoplankton density. Indicator analysis demarcated 26 indicator zooplankton taxa. Of these, the most prominent indicator zooplankton such as Belzebub hanseni, Mesopodopsis orientalis, Chydorus sphaericus, and Corycaeus catus were characteristic to salinity gradient in southern sector, sediment resuspension in central sector, eutrophic conditions in northern sector, and tide-induced intrusion of marine forms in outer channel, respectively. Hudhud, a category 4 cyclone resulted decline in the abundances of zooplankton population. Copepod nauplii and copepodites were dominant during post-Hudhud and their succession was linked to the increased phytoplankton density due to an upsurge in the nutrient level in the northern sector of the lagoon. The present study provided a comprehensive detail on the zooplankton composition and their environmental drivers including the impact of a tropical cyclone from a tropical coastal lagoon system.

AB  - Alkenones are biomarkers produced solely by algae in the order Isochrysidales that have been used to reconstruct sea surface temperature (SST) since the 1980s. However, alkenone-based SST reconstructions in the northern high latitude oceans show significant bias towards warmer temperatures in core-tops, diverge from other SST proxies in down core records, and are often accompanied by anomalously high relative abundance of the C-37 tetra-unsaturated methyl alkenone (%C-37:4). Elevated %C-37:4 is widely interpreted as an indicator of low sea surface salinity from polar water masses, but its biological source has thus far remained elusive. Here we identify a lineage of Isochrysidales that is responsible for elevated C-37:4 methyl alkenone in the northern high latitude oceans through next-generation sequencing and lab-culture experiments. This Isochrysidales lineage co-occurs widely with sea ice in marine environments and is distinct from other known marine alkenone-producers, namely Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa oceanica. More importantly, the %C-37:4 in seawater filtered particulate organic matter and surface sediments is significantly correlated with annual mean sea ice concentrations. In sediment cores from the Svalbard region, the %C-37:4 concentration aligns with the Greenland temperature record and other qualitative regional sea ice records spanning the past 14 kyrs, reflecting sea ice concentrations quantitatively. Our findings imply that %C-37:4 is a powerful proxy for reconstructing sea ice conditions in the high latitude oceans on thousand- and, potentially, on million-year timescales. Some algae produce compounds called alkenones that can reconstruct sea surface temperature through geological time, but in high latitudes unknown species complicate use of this proxy. Here the authors find a lineage of sea ice algae that produces alkenones and can be used as a paleo-sensor for sea ice abundance.

AB  - A widely cited roadblock to bridging ecological psychology and enactivism is that the former identifies with realism and the latter identifies with constructivism, which critics charge is subjectivist. A pragmatic reading, however, suggests non-mental forms of constructivism that simultaneously fit core tenets of enactivism and ecological realism. After advancing a pragmatic version of enactive constructivism that does not obviate realism, I reinforce the position with an empirical illustration: Physarum polycephalum, a communal unicellular organism that leaves slime trails that form chemical barriers that it avoids in foraging explorations. Here, environmental building and sensorimotor engagement are part of the same process with P. polycephalum coordinating around self-created, affordance-bearing geographies, which nonetheless exist independently in ways described by ecological realists. For ecological psychologists, affordances are values, meaning values are external to the perceiver. I argue that agent-enacted values have the same status and thus do not obviate ecological realism or generate subjectivism. The constructivist-realist debate organizes around the emphasis that enactivists and ecological theorists respectively place on the inner constitution of organisms vs. the structure of environments. Building on alimentary themes introduced in the P. polycephalum example and also in Gibson's work, I go on to consider how environment, brain, visceral systems, and even bacteria within them enter perceptual loops. This highlights almost unfathomable degrees of mutually modulating internal and external synchronization. It also shows instances in which internal conditions alter worldly configurations and invert values, in Gibson's sense of the term, albeit without implying subjectivism. My aim is to cut across the somatic focus of enactive constructivism and the external environment-oriented emphasis of ecological realism and show that enactivism can enrich ecological accounts of value.

AB  - Oyster areas are widely used as species of biological indicator, and they are also the most important shellfish in terms of ecosystem economic valuation. Oysters are production on the west coast before 2007 accounted for about 5 % of the nation's total production, but the 2007 Hebei Spirit oil spill caused production to plunge to less than 1 %. Therefore, spatial distribution maps of oyster reefs are required to help local authorities define management strategies. In this study, Kompsat-2/3 was used to map oyster reef distribution and analyze the distribution of oyster reefs based on linear spctral unmixing in Hwangdo tidal flat. A spectral library, collected in situ for various conditions with a field spectroradiometer, was used to conduct linear spectral unmixing classifications on Kompsat-2/3 data. The classification result shows very high accuracy, with an overall accuracy of 95 % or more, and there were misclassifications in some areas. The most causes of misclassification are the similarity of spectral characteristics and the limitations of the spatial and spectral resolutions of satellite images. For this reason, it was difficult to distinguish between oyster reefs and area distributed with many macrobenthos, and small-young oyster reefs were difficult to classify due to very weak reflectivity. In addition, the sand bar, it was is difficult to distinguish between oyster reefs related to dead reefs and sandbars because of the high reflectivity of these areas in the imagery. As a result of analyzing the change in the oyster reef area, it increased in 2019 compared to that in 2015. Especially, the oyster reef area increased in 30-50 % sand content and decreased in 20-30 % and 60-70 %. The changes of sand sediment seem to affect the distribution of oyster reefs. This study may be useful for mapping the distribution of oyster reefs and understanding the spatial variation of their habitat.

AB  - The relevance of the research is caused by the need to consider the correlations of radioactive and rare earth elements from the point of view of their high indicator role in the complex of components of the environment in local territories characterized by different natural and man-made conditions and zoning of the territory based on biogeochemical indicators.
   The aim of the research is to consider the correlations of radioactive and rare earth elements in the complex of the components of the environment in the territory of the Tomsk region, characterized by various natural and man-made environments.
   Methods. The main method of the research is instrumental neutron activation analysis, which was carried out on the basis of a research nuclear reactor of the National Research Tomsk Polytechnic University. The content of two radioactive - thorium and uranium, as well as seven rare earth (La, Ce, Sm, Eu, Tb, Yb, Lu) elements - was determined.
   Results. The authors have studied the content of rare earth and radioactive elements in four simultaneously selected and studied components of the environment of Tomsk region: soil, salt sediment of water, human blood and hair. The content of the studied elements is maximal for soils and for salt sediment of water, and significantly lower in human biosubstrates. Human hair and blood as living tissues are characterized by a sharp cerium minimum. The ytterbium maximum was detected in the blood, which may be related to its presence in the form of organometallic complexes. According to the frequency of occurrence of the anomalous contents of rare earth and radioactive elements, zoning of Tomsk region was carried out for significant tributaries of the Ob river in all studied components.

The scientific novelty of the work is to expand ideas about the features of long-term storage of documents on traditional media that have been in extreme conditions. For the experiments, the types of paper that were used as the material basis of the documents subjected to the greatest extreme technogenic load - excessive wetting, freezing, and drying - were selected as model samples. This is rag paper of the 17th - 18th centuries, newsprint of the middle of the 20th century, printing paper No. 1 of the middle of the 20th century. with certain physicochemical and capillary hygroscopic properties. The operational properties of these model paper samples were determined by mechanical strength indicators: fracture strength at repeated kinks, destructive force and tensile strength, because it is these indicators that most accurately characterize the processes of natural aging of the material. Conclusion. Providing targeted recommendations for categories of documents on traditional media that have undergone anthropogenic load depending on the type of paper, the degree and nature of the impact of negative factors in an emergency. Also relevant are ways of protecting binding materials in an emergency, because the frame is often the first to experience the consequences of its negative impact. For a positive solution to the problem of ensuring the safety of documents on traditional media that have undergone anthropogenic load, it remains relevant to implement all possible varieties of preventive conservation as a guarantee of the effective safety of library collections.

AB  - The marine environment plays a major socio-economic role in the Agadir region (south-west Morocco). This area, which hosts important fishery resources, is currently not spared from the pollutants produced in the course of agricultural, domestic, industrial and tourist development. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of the Taghazout bay tourist resort on the bacteriological and physicochemical quality of the coastal waters of Taghazout. The seawater samples were collected between March 2016 and March 2018 at three sampling sites (S1, S2 and S3) in order to monitor the concentrations of fecal coliforms (FC), fecal streptococci (FS) and total germs (TG). The results of physicochemical parameters show seasonal fluctuations influenced by climatic factors. The spatio-temporal monitoring of the bacteriological parameters shows that the average total germ count is 127.05 CFU/100 ml, 39.61 CFU/100 ml for fecal coliforms and 15.21 CFU/100 ml for fecal streptococci. The values of FC80, FC95 and FS90 do not exceed the guide values of the Moroccan standards. This classifies the Taghazout beach in category A (good quality of bathing water). The monitoring analysis recorded by the Pearson correlation test between the environmental parameters and the level of fecal bacteria showed that there was a significant positive correlation between the FC concentrations and rainfall; the FS concentrations showed significant positive correlations with all the environmental parameters while the TG concentrations indicate no correlation with them. The fecal contamination parameters should be routinely monitored for improving the environmental conditions of coastal cities. This must be the case for the Taghazout coastline where a regular monitoring program must be established to evaluate the impact of the new tourist resort "Taghazout bay" on the environmental quality of this ecosystem.

AB  - The coralligenous habitats found in the Mediterranean Sea are hotspots comparable in biodiversity to tropical reefs. Coralligenous reefs are vulnerable to many human pressures, thus they are among the most threatened habitats in the Mediterranean Sea. In this study, we assessed the impacts on coralligenous habitats of activities associated with salvaging the wreck of the Costa Concordia cruise ship. After its partial foundering in 2012, the Costa Concordia remained adjacent to the eastern coast of Giglio Island (Tuscany, Italy), in the Tyrrhenian Sea, for over two years. Its salvage required high-impact engineering works, during the course of which monitoring of benthic communities was undertaken. We performed Rapid Visual Assessment (RVA) sampling (using recorded video) from 17 stations located between 35 and 76 m depth and characterized by coralligenous habitats. Sampling activity was performed during the summers of 2012, 2013, and 2014. In parallel, chemical and physical water parameters were measured continuously from summer 2012 to the end of summer 2014, in order to detect any perturbation in natural conditions caused by salvage activities. We assessed the ecological quality of coralligenous habitats by applying the COARSE (COralligenous Assessment by ReefScape Estimate) index, based on the RVA approach. Slight modifications were applied to one of the descriptors of the COARSE index in order to adjust for study site features. There was clear evidence of a reduction in coralligenous habitats quality. Assemblages, slope, type of pressure, and distance from the source of disturbance played a pivotal role in characterizing bottom quality. The index was shown to have an easy and cost-effective application, even in waters deeper than its calibration specification; furthermore, the modification reported here may increase its potential applications.

AB  - Successional processes in forest gaps created by tree falls are often considered a principal mechanism maintaining species diversity within forests. Although insects are important as mediators of forest recovery processes, there have been few observations of how they differ between forest gaps and non-gaps across latitudes. Here we tested the impacts of gap habitat on beetle assemblage composition at three locations spanning sub-tropical and tropical biomes (28A degrees S, 16A degrees S, 5A degrees N: Lamington and Daintree in Australia, and Danum in Borneo). Beetles were collected by flight interception traps and sorted to family and feeding guilds. Despite clear differences in environmental conditions between gaps and non-gaps at all three location, we found weak and inconsistent differences in beetle family and feeding guild composition across a latitudinal gradient. PERMANOVA results showed no significant differences in beetle family and feeding guild composition between gaps and non-gaps. For beetle families, however, the interaction effect (between gap vs. non-gap treatment and location) was significant. Post-hoc analysis and NMDS ordinations showed significant and clear separation of family assemblages between gaps and non-gaps within the Danum samples but not within samples from either the Lamington or Daintree sites. Using IndVal, when all three locations were combined, Chrysomelidae and Tenebrionidae were found to be indicators for gaps and Scarabaeinae and Leiodidae for non-gaps. Analysed separately, gap indicators were only Chrysomelidae at Daintree, whereas non-gap indicators were Scarabaeinae at Lamington, Scarabaeinae, all other Scarabaeidae, Anthicidae, Scydmaeninae, and Hybosoridae at Danum. We suggest the scale of changes in insect composition and richness with the creation of a natural light gap in forests contrast with those resulting from anthropogenic disturbance such as logging and clearing of forests and the greater adaptability of forests to small-scale changes rather than large-scale changes.

AB  - Various studies have assessed autonomic and respiratory underpinnings of panic attacks, yet the psychophysiological functioning of panic disorder (PD) patients has rarely been examined under naturalistic conditions at times when acute attacks were not reported. We hypothesized that emotional activation in daily life causes physiologically demonstrable deviations from efficient metabolic regulation in PD patients. Metabolic coupling was estimated as within-individual correlations between heart rate (HR) and indices of metabolic activity, i.e., physical activity (measured by 3-axial accelerometry, Acc), and minute ventilation (Vm, measured by calibrated inductive plethysmography, as proxy for oxygen consumption). A total of 565 daytime hours were recorded in 19 PD patients and 20 healthy controls (HC). Pairwise cross-correlations of minute-by-minute averages of these metabolic indices were calculated for each participant and then correlated with several indices of self-reported anxiety. Ambulatory HR was elevated in PD (p = .05, d = 0.67). Patients showed reduced HR-Acc (p < .006, d = 0.97) and HR-Vm coupling (p < .009, d = 0.91). Combining Vm and Acc to predict HR showed the strongest group separation (p < .002, d = 1.07). Discriminant analyses, based on the combination of Vm and Acc to predict HR, classified 77% of all participants correctly. In PD, HR-Acc coupling was inversely related to trait anxiety sensitivity, as well as tonic and phasic daytime anxiety. The novel method that was used demonstrates that anxiety in PD may reduce efficient long-term metabolic coupling. Metabolic decoupling may serve as physiological characteristic of PD and might aid diagnostics for PD and other anxiety disorders. This measure deserves further study in research on health consequences of anxiety and psychosocial stress. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article examines the concepts 'environment' and 'expertise'. It is argued that these concepts, while having long and diverse individual histories, acquired new meaning through a process of mutual co-production which occurred largely in the period 1920-1960, thus significantly preceding the common understanding of environmentalism as a phenomenon emerging in the 1960s. It is further argued that environmental expertise is much predicated on natural science in a range of fields that were integrated into a comprehensive understanding scaling upwards from the local to the global. Quantitative analysis, observing, measuring, and monitoring rates of change of a growing set of indicators were other key features of this emerging understanding of the environmental. Yet another key aspect was the self-proclaimed ability of environmental expertise to predict rates and directions of current and, crucially, future changes of global environmental conditions, increasingly assuming that these changes were largely of human origin. In addition to thus presenting a brief history of environmental expertise the article also makes the point that the environmental was, despite changed by human action, essentially regarded as something that did not in itself belong to the human or the social and thus the implicit prerogative of the natural sciences. The article argues, on the contrary, that there is solid historical evidence to suggest that 'environment' should also, perhaps primarily, be understood as a social concept, or rather as an extension of the social into nature. As conventional environmental expertise has failed to provide the advice needed to question the driving forces behind environmental degradation and lack of sustainability it is here instead suggested that environmental expertise be fundamentally reconfigured to include the social sciences and humanities, and that concerted research efforts are directed to the understanding of the formation of environmental expertise.

AB  - Stratigraphic records from peatlands suggest that the shift from a rich fen (calcareous fen) to an ombrotrophic bog can occur rapidly. This shift constitutes a switch from a species-rich ecosystem to a species-poor one with greater carbon storage. In this process, the invasion and expansion of acidifying bog species of Sphagnum (peat mosses) play a key role. To test under what conditions an acidifying bog species could invade a rich fen, we conducted three experiments, contrasting the bog species S. fucsum with the rich-fen species S. warnstorfii and S. teres. We first tested the effect of calcareous water by growing the three species at different constant height above the water table (HWT; 2, 7, and 14 cm) in a rich-fen pool and measured maximum photosynthetic rate and production and difference in length growth as an indicator of competition. In none of the species was the photosynthetic capacity negatively affected when placed at low HWT, but S. fuscum was a weaker competitor at low HWT. In our second experiment we transplanted the three species into microhabitats with different and naturally varying HWT in a rich fen. Here, S. fuscum nearly ceased to photosynthesize when transplanted to low HWT (brown moss carpet), while it performed similarly to the two rich-fen species at the intermediate level (S. warnstorfii hummock level). In contrast to S. fuscum, the rich-fen sphagna performed equally well in both habitats. The brown moss carpet was seasonally flooded, and in our third experiment we found that S. fuscum, but not S. teres, was severely damaged when submerged in rich-fen water. Our results suggest two thresholds in HWT affecting the ecosystem switch: one level that reduces the risk of submergence and a higher one that makes bog sphagna competitive against the rich-fen species.

AB  - Objective: Recent studies suggest a role for social factors during childhood in the later development of schizophrenia. Since social conditions in childhood are closely related to parental psychiatric illness, there is a need to disentangle how genes and social environmental factors interact.
   Method: A total of 13,163 children born in Sweden between 1955 and 1984 and reared in Swedish adoptive families were linked to the National Patient Register until 2006 regarding admissions for nonaffective psychoses, including schizophrenia. Hazard ratios for nonaffective psychoses were estimated in relation to three indicators of socioeconomic position in childhood (household data of the rearing family obtained via linkage to the National Censuses of 1960-1985) and in relation to indicator of genetic liability (biological parental inpatient care for psychosis). In addition, the total Swedish-born population was investigated.
   Results: Increased risks for nonaffective psychosis were found among adoptees without biological parental history of psychosis) reared in families with disadvantaged socioeconomic position, which consisted of adoptive parental unemployment (hazard ratio = 2.0), single-parent household (hazard ratio = 1.2), and living in apartments (hazard ratio = 1.3). The risk was also increased among persons with genetic liability for psychosis alone (hazard ratio = 4.7). Among those exposed to both genetic liability and a disadvantaged socioeconomic situation in childhood, the risk was considerably higher (hazard ratio = 15.0, 10.3, and 5.7 for parental unemployment, single-parent household, and apartment living, respectively). Analyses in the larger population supported these results.
   Conclusions: The results indicate that children reared in families with a disadvantaged socioeconomic position have an increased risk for psychosis. There was also some support for an interaction effect, suggesting that social disadvantage increases this risk more in children with genetic liability for psychosis.

Surface sediment assemblages and environmental variables were collected along the U.S. coastline at 191 sample sites, which were classified by lake and geomorphic type: high-energy (HE), embayment (EB), coastal wetland (CW), riverine wetland (RW), protected wetland (PW), and open water (OP). Diatom inferred (DI) total phosphorus (TP) transfer functions (models) were developed for each lake and geomorphic type. Robust models included: the overall model (RMSEPI-r(jack)(2) = 0.65; RMSEP = 0.005), Lake Superior (r(jack)(2) 0.73; RMSEP = 0.003), Lake Ontario (r(jack)(2) = 0.73; RMSEP = 0.007), PW (r(jack)(2) = 0.64; RMSEP 0.003), and EB (r(jack)(2) = 0.64; RMSEP = 0.007). Weaker models, indicating poorer diatom-TP relationships, included: RW (r(jack)(2) = 0.03; RMSEP = 0.005), OP (r(jack)(2) = 0.15; RMSEP = 0.059), and Lake Michigan (r(jack)(2) = 0.38; RMSEP = 0.006). DI TP data were regressed against landscape characteristics to quantify the relationships to adjacent watershed stressors. RW data were further scrutinized as a case study to investigate the suitability of diatom-based approaches in systems with poor diatom-TP relationships. Despite poor performance of the RW model, DI phosphorus data for riverine wetlands, derived from the overall model, were strongly related to watershed characteristics (r(2) = 0.61), indicating the overall model's ability to integrate stressors from the surrounding watershed in areas where measured phosphorus did not adequately characterize prevailing conditions. This study confirms that physical properties (e.g., lake or habitat type) can influence indicator models; however, weaknesses may be overcome by robust calibration techniques.

AB  - An aged-based population model was used to simulate shrimp (Pandalus borealis Kroyer) age and stage structures at different growth rates and the results compared with stage structures of populations with known growth rates. Both simulations and field data indicate that different growth rates result in characteristic stage structures, which can be used to infer spatial and temporal differences in growth rates. It is concluded that the mean carapace lengths of all life history stages ordered chronologically (stage structure), contains more information on growth characteristics than the carapace length of individual stages (e.g., length at sex change, L(50)) alone. In the absence of growth information, based on direct ageing methods, it is recommended that the complete stage structure be used when inferring growth characteristics from carapace length data. In addition to allowing specific spatial and temporal comparisons of growth rates, stage structure analysis allowed inference of the following growth characteristics, including: growth rates are highly site specific and sensitive to environmental conditions such as food availability and temperatures; environmental influences on growth rates tend to affect all size categories (i.e., stages and ages) simultaneously and without time lags; the "invariant" relationship between L(50) and maximum size (L(max)) is not unique to these stages and simply a consequence of environmental influences on the growth rate of all stages simultaneously; length at sex change is directly related to growth/metabolic rates; length and age at sex change are highly flexible, occurring at the age and size a shrimp happens to be when growth/metabolic rates determine sex change. The usefulness of stage structure analysis as an indicator of ecosystem change is discussed in light of the results.

AB  - Spatial variation in morphological and structural characteristics of the seagrass Zostera tasmanica was examined in Westernport, an estuarine embayment in south-eastern Australia. An environmental gradient exists within the embayment, with moderate sediment loads and resuspension in the north correlating with high turbidity, chlorophyll a and reduced photon flux density (PFD). This gradient generally decreases towards the south, where oceanic influences and lower catchment inputs result in less turbid waters, with increased PFD and reduced water column chlorophyll a. We investigated variation in Z tasmanica characteristics across this environmental gradient. A hierarchy of scales was examined ranging from cm within sites (meadows), km between sites, and 10s of kill between regions. Structural variables examined included shoot density, seagrass cover and biomass, while morphological variables were number of leaves, leaf and total shoot weight, number of nodes, internode length and shoot length. Plants from northern regions of Westernport were characterised by low leaf numbers, low shoot weight and few internodes, suggesting either a loss of condition in these plants or younger plants with high shoot turnover. In contrast, plants from the mid to southern regions had more and longer leaves, more nodes and greater internode lengths, and structurally these meadows exhibited greater densities, cover and biomass. Partitioning of the variation showed that region (> 20 kin apart) contributed the greatest percentage of variation for a number of variables (e.g. shoot numbers, numbers of nodes, internode length and seagrass cover), suggesting the importance of the environmental gradient: in shaping seagrass form and meadow structure. These variables are potentially useful indicators of anthropogenic influences driving seagrass morphology and structure at ecosystem scales.

AB  - The polycyclic musks 6-acetyl-1,1,2,4,4,7-hexamethyltetraline (AHTN) and 1,2,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta-gamma-2-benzopyran (HHCB) are used as fragrance ingredients in perfumes, soaps, and household cleaning products. They are known to be ubiquitously present in the aquatic environment, and because of their lipophilic nature, they tend to bioaccumulate in aquatic biota. In surface waters, concentrations between 1 ng/L and 5 mug/L have been found, depending mainly on the proportion of sewage effluents in the water. In fish, under normal environmental conditions, concentrations in the microgram per kilogram fresh weight (fw) range are found. In a previous study we showed that AHTN and HHCB exert mainly antiestrogenic effects on the human estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and ERbeta in an in vitro reporter gene assay. In the current study, we assessed the in vitro antiestrogenic effects of both musks on zebrafish ERs. Antagonism was observed on zfERbeta, and more pronounced on the newly cloned zfERgamma. Using a transgenic zebrafish assay, we studied antiestrogenicity of the musks in vivo. Dose-dependent antagonistic effects were observed at concentrations of 0.1 and 1 muM AHTN and HHCB. GC-MS analysis showed that the musks bioaccumulated in the fish, with internal concentrations (15-150 mg/kg fw) which were roughly 600 times higher than the nominal test doses. To our knowledge, this is the first time that environmental contaminants are shown to be antiestrogenic in an in vivo fish assay that focuses solely on ER-mediated effects. This makes the transgenic zebrafish assay a promising tool for the rapid detection of both estrogenic and antiestrogenic effects of chemicals in fish.

AB  - The coastal environment of Kuwait has been under considerable stress since the onset of the oil era in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Oil, sewage, and industrial pollution were believed to be the main environmental problems in the coastal zone. The huge oil spill and destruction caused by the Gulf War further complicated those problems. in this article, the temperature, pH, salinity, and total dissolved sulfide (TDS) of the interstitial water in the intertidal zone and the water content and total organic carbon (TOC) of the intertidal sediment were investigated. The purpose of the study was to understand the effect of the physicochemical characteristics on the intertidal benthic ecology and to identify the level and sources of organic pollution in the intertidal zone. The study results indicated that the prevailing harsh environmental conditions, especially high temperature and salinity, restricted benthic fauna diversity and led to the development of a fragile intertidal ecosystem. The fauna inhabiting the intertidal zone was dominated by a few species probably living at their limit of tolerance. Organic pollution was evident mainly in Sulaibikhat Bay and to a lesser extent in Kuwait City waterfront and Shuaiba coast in the south. The pollution was attributed mainly to land-based sources such as the occasional discharge of raw sewage through stormwater outlets, the direct oil spillage, and industrial effluents from refineries, oil terminals, and petrochemical plants. Quantitative analysis was inconclusive in establishing a significant correlation between the chemistry and composition of the benthic fauna. However, close examination of sites with high TOC and TDS concentrations indicated that the benthic fauna in those sites was showing evidence of degradation. number of strategies were recommended to ensure protection and sustainable management of the coastal environment.

AB  - The taxonomy-based response pattern of macroinvertebrates to pollution gradient is well established, with tolerant taxa increasing in impacted conditions, while sensitive taxa increase with decreasing deterioration, typical of rural pollution. This study identified rural indicator and sensitive traits of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) taxa by examining their trait distribution pattern in relation to rural pollution. Physicochemical parameters and EPT were sampled seasonally from August 2016 to April 2017. Eight sites were selected and categorised into three site groups. Site group 1 served as the least impacted site group and Site group 2 as the moderately influenced, whereas Site group 3 was the most impacted. Seven traits were selected and categorised into 27 trait modalities. The response of EPT traits to physicochemical parameters was analysed using the simultaneous analysis of the information contained in three tables: R (environmental characteristics of samples), L (taxa distribution across samples) and Q (species traits) (RLQ) and confirmed with fourth-corner analysis. Three trait attributes, large (10-20 mm), swimming, shredding, streamlined body shape and large body size (>= 10-20), were considered tolerant signature traits of semi-urban pollution. These trait attributes were associated with the influenced Site group 3 and indicated a significant positive affinity with at least one physicochemical indicator of increasing semi-urban pollution (NH4-N, NO3-N, NO2-N, PO4-P, EC, turbidity, temperature and pH). Conversely, small body size (<10 mm), operculate gills, spherical body shape and a preference for sediments were correlated with the least influenced Site group 1 and were considered sensitive traits of semi-urban disturbance. Overall, this study provided critical insights into EPT responses to disturbance, revealing that semi-urban activities influenced EPT traits differently in the Tsitsa River.

AB  - The Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), located in the abyssal equatorial Pacific, has been subject to intensive international exploration for polymetallic nodule mining over the last four decades. Many studies have investigated the potential effects of mining on deep-sea ecosystems and highlighted the importance of defining environmental baseline conditions occurring at potential mining sites. However, current information on biodiversity and species distributions in the CCZ is still scarce and hampers the ability to effectively manage and reduce the potential impacts of mining activities. As part of the regulatory regimes adopted by the International Seabed Authority, concession holders are required to conduct an environmental impact assessment and gather baseline data on biodiversity and community structure in relation to their license areas. In the present study, we used an integrative molecular and morphological approach to assess species richness and genetic variation of deep-sea scavenging amphipods collected in two nodule-mining exploration areas (UK-1 and OMS-1 areas) and one Area of Particular Environmental Interest (APEI-6) in the eastern part of the CCZ. We analyzed the DNA sequences of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene of 645 specimens belonging to ten distinct morphospecies. Molecular data uncover potential cryptic diversity in two investigated species, morphologically identified as Paralicella caperesca Shulenberger & Barnard, 1976 and Valettietta cf. anacantha (Birstein & Vinogradov, 1963). Our study highlights the importance of using molecular tools in conjunction with traditional morphological methods for modern biodiversity assessment studies, particularly to evaluate morphologically similar individuals and incomplete specimens. The results of this study can help determine species identity and ranges, information which can feed into environmental management.

AB  - Currently water resources in nature conservation areas are under severe pressure due to external drivers of anthropogenic pollution. There is a lack of monitoring tools to determine water quality status of dams situated in nature reserves receiving a mixture of pollutants over space and time. The present study was conducted over a 12-month period with the aim of applying a modified pollution index (PILD) to determine the water quality and phytoplankton status of the Loskop Dam situated in the Loskop nature reserve, South Africa. From the data generated in the current study, it was evident that the PILD effectively determined nutrient enrichment and heavy metal pollution in the dam. Furthermore, the study showed that the most pollution tolerant phytoplankton species was the diatom Melosira varians followed by the dinoflagellate Ceratuim hirundinella and the cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa. Chemical variables during the sampling period that exceeded the limits of the South African, Canadian, Australia and New Zealand guideline levels were Zn, TP, Cl, Fe, Mn and NH4. The occurrence of concentrations of Cl above the target water quality range for aquatic ecosystems (5 mu gl(-1)) over the entire sampling period, may have been related to point source sewage pollution in the upper catchment. The PILD showed poor water quality conditions during the months of September and October during the dam's destratification (lake overturn). By modifying an existing index to incorporate physico-chemical variables that are strongly related to a mixture of pollutants, it should have application on global scale applied to different waterbodies with differ phytoplankton indicator species across different geographical regions. Furthermore, it could also in the future serve as a decision support tool for conservation managers to determine the pollution status of a dam situated in nature conservation areas receiving a mixture of pollutants.

AB  - Sediment is the most dominant reservoir of organic pollutants in the aquatic environment. Understanding carbon and nitrogen sources in sediments and factors that controls distribution enhances our understanding of biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen. Different end-members and surface sediments of rivers and sediments profiles of lakes were collected. The concentrations of TOC and TON and their delta C-13 and delta N-15 were studied for qualitative and quantitative analysis of natural and anthropogenic sources. The results show that TOC and TON concentrations of the sediments from rivers range from 0.63% to 10.83% and 0.06%-0.86%, respectively, indicating substantial great environmental risks in these rivers. The concentrations of TOC and TON for the four sediment profiles below the 5 cm, increase in the order of Miyun < Chuidiao < Qunming < Houhai, as influenced by their respective environment condition. Moreover, water quality was quite good and there was no risk of eutrophication in Miyun reservoir. delta C-13(org) and (delta)15N(or)g in surface sediments of the studied 18 rivers range from - 27.2 parts per thousand to - 24.9 parts per thousand and - 2.2 parts per thousand to +10.9 parts per thousand, respectively. Based on a simple delta C-13-based end-member mixing and a C/N ratio model, organic matter in the surface sediments of these rivers were mainly derived from sewage and C3 plant. In addition, the sources of organic matter differed in each layer of the four sediment profiles. This study provides a reliable method for qualitative and quantitative identification of the source of organic matter in sediments, and offers theoretical basis for better management of rivers and lakes.

AB  - Crop yield estimates over large areas are conventionally made using weather observations, but a comprehensive understanding of the effects of various environmental indicators, observation frequency, and the choice of prediction algorithm remains elusive. Here we present a thorough assessment of county-level maize yield prediction in U.S. Midwest using six statistical/machine learning algorithms (Lasso, Support Vector Regressor, Random Forest, XGBoost, Long-short term memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)) and an extensive set of environmental variables derived from satellite observations, weather data, land surface model results, soil maps, and crop progress reports. Results show that seasonal crop yield forecasting benefits from both more advanced algorithms and a large composite of information associated with crop canopy, environmental stress, phenology, and soil properties (i.e. hundreds of features). The XGBoost algorithm outperforms other algorithms both in accuracy and stability, while deep neural networks such as LSTM and CNN are not advantageous. The compositing interval (8-day, 16-day or monthly) of time series variable does not have significant effects on the prediction. Combining the best algorithm and inputs improves the prediction accuracy by 5% when compared to a baseline statistical model (Lasso) using only basic climatic and satellite observations. Reasonable county-level yield foresting is achievable from early June, almost four months prior to harvest. At the national level, early-season (June and July) prediction from the best model outperforms that of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE). This study provides insights into practical crop yield forecasting and the understanding of yield response to climatic and environmental conditions.

AB  - The article aims to compare the age and temporal dynamics of cephalometric characteristics in the Tuvan school population in 1978 and 2018-2019. Our main objective was to assess the age and temporal variability of craniometric characteristics in Tuvan populations under contemporary conditions.
   Anthropological data was collected from Tuvan children aged 6-17, according to the standard method, in one of the ethnic schools in Kyzyl (414 people) and Toora-Khem (341 Tozhu nvans). All those examined were also photographed according to the method of anthropological photography adopted at the Research Institute and Museum of Anthropology of Moscow State University. The generalized portrait method was applied to the photographs obtained, which simplified the visualization of the sex, age and ethno-territorial variability of the surveyed contingent.
   The results obtained showed that the dynamics of changes in the size of the head and face of urban and rural children and adolescents of both genders corresponds to general biological patterns: the relatively low intensity of variability of most indicators demonstrates an increase throughout the age series (except for the cephalic index). Comparison of these data with earlier ones (1978) allows us to conclude that there are no significant intergenerational differences. This is the reason that the main characteristics of the head and face inherent in the Tuvan ethnic group have been preserved over the decades since the last survey (the longitudinal diameter of the head alone does not make an significant contribution to the transformation of the racial and ethnic appearance of the population). The retention of the classical characteristics of the Central Asian type is also confirmed by the results of generalizations of the photographs, which also indicates a significant homogeneity of the studied Tuvan groups at the present time.

AB  - AimsThe aim of this study was the baseline description of oil-degrading sediment bacteria along a depth transect in the Faroe-Shetland Channel (FSC) and the identification of biomarker taxa for the detection of oil contamination in FSC sediments.
   Methods and ResultsOil-degrading sediment bacteria from 135, 500 and 1000m were enriched in cultures with crude oil as the sole carbon source (at 12, 5 and 0 degrees C respectively). The enriched communities were studied using culture-dependent and culture-independent (clone libraries) techniques. Isolated bacterial strains were tested for hydrocarbon degradation capability. Bacterial isolates included well-known oil-degrading taxa and several that are reported in that capacity for the first time (Sulfitobacter, Ahrensia, Belliella, Chryseobacterium). The orders Oceanospirillales and Alteromonadales dominated clone libraries in all stations but significant differences occurred at genus level particularly between the shallow and the deep, cold-water stations. Alcanivorax constituted 64% of clones at FSC135 but was absent at deeper stations. Pseudoalteromonas and Oleispira dominated the bacterial community at 500 and 1000m.
   ConclusionsThe genus Oleispira emerged as a major player in the early stages of crude oil degradation in deep-sea sediments of the FSC particularly at subzero temperatures. This finding is offering a direction for future research into biomonitoring tools for the detection of low levels of crude oil contamination in the deep FSC, and possibly high latitude cold waters in general.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyOil and gas exploration in the FSC occurs at depths >1000m but baseline environmental data necessary for the assessment of ecosystem recovery to prespill conditions in the event of an oil spill are lacking. This study will contribute to our ability to assess the impact of oil release in the FSC and guide the direction of bioremediation strategies tailored to the area.

AB  - Triadimefon (TF, S-(+)-TF, R-(-)-TF) and its metabolite triadimenol (TN, TN-Al, A2 and TN-B1, B2) are two systemic fungicides and both of them are chiral pharmaceuticals which are widely used in agricultural industry. Many researches focused on the toxicity effects of triadimefon on mammals, while the ecotoxicological data of tiradimefon on reptiles is limited. In order to understand the toxicity mechanism of triadimefon in reptiles, the current study administrated S-(+)-TF or R-(-)-TF traidimefon (50 mg/kg(bw)) to Chinese lizards (Eremias argus) respectively, the absorption, distribution of triadimefon and the formation of triadimenol were analysed at different sampling times. The metabolic pathways were demonstrated through relative gene expression using quantitative real-time PCR reaction. During the experiment time, triadimefon was quickly peaked to the maximum concentration within 12 h in liver, brain, kidney, and plasma, eliminated slowly. The biotransformation in kidney was the lowest and fat possessed the worst degradation ability among others. The metabolite, triadimenol was detected in blood in 2 h and reached to a plateau at about 12 h in most organs (fat excepted), while the process of metabolism is stereoselective. The mainly metabolite in R-(-)-TF treated group was TN-B1, and TN-A2 in S-(+)-TF group which showed the selective metabolism to other species caused by environmental conditions, differences in the animal models and concentration of TF. The related gene expression of cyp1a1, cyp3a1 and hsd11 beta mRNA level in lizards showed different metabolic pathways in the liver and brain. Both P450s enzymes and 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase participated in metabolic reaction in liver, while no 11 beta-hydroxysieroid dehydrogenase pathway observed in brain. This diversity in liver and brain may cause different degradation rate and ecotoxicological effect in different organs.

AB  - For thousands of years, humans have created different types of terraces in different sloping conditions, meant to mitigate flood risks, reduce soil erosion and conserve water. These anthropogenic landscapes can be found in tropical and subtropical rainforests, deserts, and arid and semiarid mountains across the globe. Despite the long history, the roles of and the mechanisms by which terracing improves ecosystem services (ESs) remain poorly understood. Using literature synthesis and quantitative analysis, the worldwide types, distributions, major benefits and issues of terracing are presented in this review. A key terracing indicator, defined as the ratio of different ESs under terraced and non-terraced slopes (delta), was used to quantify the role of terracing in providing ESs. Our results indicated that ESs provided by terracing was generally positive because the mean values of delta were mostly greater than one. The most prominent role of terracing was found in erosion control (11.46 +/- 2.34), followed by runoff reduction (2.60 +/- 1.79), biomass accumulation (1.94 +/- 0.59), soil water recharge (1.20 +/- 0.23), and nutrient enhancement (1.20 +/- 0.48). Terracing, to a lesser extent, could also enhance the survival rates of plant seedlings, promote ecosystem restoration, and increase crop yields. While slopes experiencing severe human disturbance (e.g., overgrazing and deforestation) can generally become more stable after terracing, negative effects of terracing may occur in poorly-designed or poorly-managed terraces. Among the reasons are the lack of environmental legislation, changes in traditional concepts and lifestyles of local people, as well as price decreases for agricultural products. All of these can accelerate terrace abandonment and degradation. In light of these findings, possible solutions regarding socio-economic changes and techniques to improve already degraded terraces are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aquatic macrophytes are commonly used to assess the ecological condition of lakes. Little is known, however, about long-term macrophyte dynamics in shallow lakes. In the absence of historical data, the remains of macrophytes (fruits, seeds and vegetative fragments) found in lake sediments may provide just such information. In order to interpret confidently past change in aquatic plant communities from their sedimentary remains, it is vital to establish the similarity between the contemporary and fossil assemblages.
   We investigated the relationship between present lake vegetation and plant macrophyte remains in surface sediments. Thirty-five shallow lakes, spanning around six degrees of latitude and mostly located in the semi-arid Mediterranean climatic zone of Turkey, were sampled for aquatic plants, surface sediment plant remains and a range of other key environmental variables.
   Around 50% of the taxa recorded in the modern vegetation were represented in the sediment. Sedimentary macrofossils of some taxa were under- or over-represented relative to their frequency in the modern vegetation, for example Potamogeton spp. and Characeae, respectively. Despite this disparity, there was good agreement between the assemblage composition of the modern and sedimentary samples. Furthermore, conductivity and trophic state (as indicated by total nitrogen, total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a) were the environmental variables most clearly correlated with both the contemporary and macrofossil assemblages in these lakes.
   We conclude that aquatic macrophyte macrofossils can be used as reliable indicators of ecological status and to determine qualitative changes in assemblages of aquatic plants consequent to environmental change (e.g. in lake trophic status and/or salinity). This may be especially useful for lakes in arid and semi-arid Mediterranean regions, which are particularly vulnerable to hydrological constraints under climate change.

AB  - Conservation translocations aim to restore species to their indigenous ranges, protect populations from threats and/or reinstate ecosystem functions. They are particularly important for the conservation and management of rare and threatened species. Despite tremendous efforts and advancement in recent years, animal conservation translocations generally have variable -success, and the reasons for this are often uncertain. We suggest that when little is known about the physiology and wellbeing of individuals either before or after release, it will be difficult to determine their likelihood of survival, and this could limit advancements in the science of translocations for conservation. In this regard, we argue that physiology offers novel approaches that could substantially improve translocations and associated practices. As a discipline, it is apparent that physiology may be undervalued, perhaps because of the invasive nature of some physiological measurement techniques (e.g. sampling body fluids, surgical implantation). We examined 232 publications that dealt with translocations of terrestrial vertebrates and aquatic mammals and, defining 'success' as high or low, determined how many of these studies explicitly incorporated physiological aspects into their protocols and monitoring. From this review, it is apparent that physiological evaluation before and after animal releases could progress and improve translocation/reintroduction successes. We propose a suite of physiological measures, in addition to animal health indices, for assisting conservation translocations over the short term and also for longer term post-release monitoring. Perhaps most importantly, we argue that the incorporation of physiological assessments of animals at all stages of translocation can have important welfare implications by helping to reduce the total number of animals used. Physiological indicators can also help to refine conservation translocation methods. These approaches fall under a new paradigm that we term 'translocation physiology' and represent an important sub-discipline within conservation physiology generally.

AB  - Urbanisation is an important cause of species extinctions. Although urban water systems are also highly modified, studies on aquatic or semi-aquatic organisms are rare. The aim of this study is to identify the factors that determine species richness of Odonata in 22 Central European cities and along an urban-rural gradient within six of them. With 64 indigenous species in total and an average of 33 species per city, the species richness of Odonata in Central European cities is comparatively high. A generalised linear model indicates that species richness is positively related to city area. Additional predictors are climatic variables (temperature amplitude, sunshine duration and July temperature) and the year last studied. Since most cities are usually located in areas with naturally high habitat heterogeneity, we assume that cities should be naturally rich in dragonflies. The role of city area as a surrogate for habitat and structural richness most likely explains why it is strongly associated with Odonata species richness. The relationship between species richness and the climatic variables probably reflects that Odonata species richness in Central Europe is limited by warm and sunny conditions more than by availability of water. The temporal effect (the year last studied) on species richness is likely to be a consequence of the recent increase in Mediterranean species associated with global warming. Urbanisation clearly has an adverse effect on the species diversity of Odonata. Species richness increases along a gradient from the centre of a city to the rural area and is significantly highest in rural areas. This pattern probably reflects a gradient of increasing habitat quality from the centre of cities to rural areas. Moreover, the number of water bodies is generally very low in the city centres. Based on our results, we make recommendations for increasing the abundance and number of species of dragonflies in cities.

AB  - Natural and anthropogenic impacting factors simultaneously cause wetland loss in the Louisiana coastal area. Ongoing natural processes are integrated with anthropogenic impacting factors to rationalize the contribution of each impact type within a total system. From baseline conditions of today, two natural processes account for approximately 85% of the estimated cumulative land loss by 2050: (1) subsidence by sediment compaction and tectonism that is driven by the weight of the Mississippi Delta's sedimentary pile and (:2) absolute sea-level rise. Hurricanes are sudden natural processes that act as impact accelerators. After the Mississippi River became hydrologically isolated from the delta it built, anthropogenic impacts coinciding with the ramp up to peak oil production in the Louisiana coastal area caused many direct impacts, such as the construction of access canals and pipelines, but indirect impacts are largely symptomatic of natural delta platform submergence. Formation extraction is the only significant anthropogenic activity influencing projected land losses: about 6%. Other anthropogenic activities, such as onshore development, maintenance dredging, and oil spills, are not significant impacting factors. Additive processes, such as delta outbuilding and coastal restoration, are also not significant. A growing body of Louisiana coastal area subsidence studies is proceeding in absence of insight as to how conclusions might be ordered by the subsurface structural fabric that has influenced coastal geomorphology and that continues to influence surface processes. Subsidence assessments have been heavily weighted with inputs based on surface and near-surface data sets that are easy to see and touch. Approaches using basin analysis techniques are a critical omission. Such outputs integrate subsurface geologic logs and seismic data sets into products able to inform decisions about locating coastal restoration or flood protection projects and avoid areas of geologically persistent subsidence.

AB  - Well-being is a complex multidimensional concept defined as a state of being happy, healthy and prosperous. Generally, well-being is geographically not evenly distributed within a country. Major differences in well-being among territorial units at subnational level impede the progress of society and may cause economic, social, urban, environmental and political problems. Acknowledging of regional differences in well-being is of key importance for efficient planning and implementation of regional and spatial policy measures. The principal objective of these policies is balanced regional development proven by diminishing differences in economic development and well-being. The paper deals with the measurement of geographical differences of well-being in Slovenia using composite indicators based on principal components. Municipalities were selected as basic units, since presently municipality is the only type of subnational government in Slovenia. They represent the level of government closest to people that provides local public services to community. Well-being was defined by 49 quantitative social, economic, demographic and environmental indicators. The indicators were selected on the basis of relevance for well-being and data availability at the municipality level. In order to verify the validity of the measurement of well being using composite indicators and to enhance the interpretability and usability of the results, several approaches based on multivariate analysis were applied. All approaches clearly show substantial differences in the level of wellbeing of municipalities with prevailing higher level in the Western and lower level in the Eastern part of Slovenia. Besides that, cluster analysis has revealed dual nature of the top well-being group of municipalities. On one side, there is a subgroup of a socially most developed urban centres. On the other side, well-being of the second subgroup of municipalities is characterized by high standards of living and pleasant environmental conditions, although being a step behind on the economic and social scale.

AB  - It is expected that nearby populations are constrained by the same ecological features shaping in turn similarity in their ecological traits. Here, we studied the spatio-temporal variability in egg size among local populations of the critically endangered Balearic shearwater Puffinus mauretanicus, a top marine predator endemic to the western Mediterranean region. Specifically we assessed whether this trait was influenced by maternal body size, as an indicator of a genetic component, and feeding ecology (through stable-carbon and nitrogen-isotope measurements), as an indicator of environmental factors. We found that egg size varied among local populations, an unexpected result at such a small spatial scale. Body size differences at the local population level only partially explained such differences. Blood isotope measurements also differed among local populations. Values of ON suggested inter-population differences in trophic level, showing a similar general pattern with egg size, and suggesting a nutritional link between them whereby egg size was affected by differences in feeding resources and/or behaviour. Values of delta C-13 suggested that local populations did not differ in foraging habits with respect to benthic- vs. pelagic-based food-webs. Egg size did not vary among years as did breeding performance, suggesting that a differential temporal window could affect both breeding parameters in relation to food availability. The absence of a relationship between breeding performance and egg size suggested that larger eggs might only confer an advantage during harsh conditions. Alternatively parental quality could greatly affect breeding performance. We showed that inter-population differences in egg size could be influenced by both body size and environmental factors.

AB  - The performance of numerous soil and pasture indicators was determined during three consecutive years in two types of silvopastoral grasslands based on Leucaena leucocephala-Panicum maximum to select those showing higher variability, detect the most useful ones, and know the degree of stability of the soil-pasture system for monitoring the management effect. The grasslands were: a) silvopastoral system on hydrated red ferrallitic soil with six years of exploitation, and b) silvopastoral system on lixiviated red ferrallitic soil with five years of exploitation. Three groups of indicators (vegetation, soil physicochemical and biological) were obtained through the analysis of principal components. Those with preponderance value higher than +/- 0.78 and accounting for, at least, 65% of the accumulated variance were chosen. In the vegetation, up to 50 indicators were studied, selecting 7 and 9 out of them (for six and five years of exploitation, respectively). The plant cover, the bare soil, the density of the basic pasture, and the presence of native pastures coincided in them. Out of the 76 soil indicators, 15 and 19 were selected (for six and five years of exploitation, respectively). In them, the distribution of aggregates in humid and dry conditions, the structural stability, the value of n, the underground phytomass, the macrofauna, and the mesofauna were repeated to account for their variability. Both silvopastoral systems progressed in time by increasing the basic pasture population and its productive stability, as well as by improving their edaphic characteristics. The performance of the indicators permitted characterizing the status of the soil-plant system in each grassland, and showed that the management to which both grasslands were subject affected their ecological and productive improvement. Tables with ranges of confidence values were presented for the indicators, which could serve as useful, confident, and sensitive tools to discern the shifts occurring in each type of grassland, and that could be used in research, teaching, and production.

AB  - Many environmental benefits have been attributed to agroforestry systems in various ecosystems around the world. However, there is a limited amount of information to evaluate this agricultural system in the semi-arid region, specifically in the region of Ceara, Brazil. The objective of this work was to evaluate five agricultural (four agroforestry and one conventional) systems in order to test the hypothesis that the agroforestry systems promote an increase in the soil organic carbon stocks and organic carbon pools, thus improving soil quality. The following treatments were tested: agrosilvopasture (AGP), silvopasture (SILV), traditional agroforestry (TRAG), intensive cropping (IC), and native forest (NF). The soil samples were collected at four depths: 0-6, 6-12, 12-20 and 20-40 cm. Total soil organic carbon stocks and the organic carbon pools (microbial biomass-C, mineralizable-C, oxidizable-C, free, occluded light fraction organic matter, and C in the humic substances) were analyzed. After 5 years of experimental cultivation, the soil under the SILV system presented the best results for the attributes studied, preserving, and in some cases, improving these attributes, when compared to the other conditions. The traditional agroforestry system (TRAG) reduced total organic carbon stocks and, consequently, C in some organic matter compartments, indicating that the fallow period was not sufficient to maintain soil quality. The AGP and IC systems presented significant losses in some of the soil organic matter (SOM) pools, suggesting that the soil environment had been degraded. The most labile SOM components were considered sensitive indicators of change in the soil quality. The silvopasture system can, therefore, be recommended as an alternative soil management strategy for food production and for the maintenance of soil quality and agricultural sustainability in the semiarid region of Ceara state.

AB  - Moss samples from the Fluxnet-Canada western peatland flux station in the Boreal Region of Alberta were measured in the laboratory to obtain the net photosynthesis rate and chlorophyll fluorescence of the moss under controlled environmental conditions, including the regulation of moss water content, simultaneously with measurements of moss spectral reflectance. One objective was to test whether the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) detected changes in moss photosynthetic light-use efficiency that were consistent with short-term (minutes to hours) changes in xanthophyll cycle pigments and associated changes in non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), as recorded by chlorophyll fluorescence. The rate of net photosynthesis was strongly inhibited by water content at values exceeding approximately 9 (fresh weight/dry weight) and declined as the water content fell below values of approximately 8. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of maximum photosystem II efficiency generally remained high until the water content was reduced from the maximum of about 20 to values of approximately 10-11, and then declined with further reductions in moss water content. A significant linear decline in NPQ was observed as moss water content was reduced from maximum to low water content values. There was a strong negative correlation between changes in NPQ and PRI. These data suggest that PRI measurements are a good proxy for short-term shifts in photosynthetic activity in Sphagnum moss. A second objective was to test how accurately the water band index (WBI, ratio of reflectance at 900 and 970 nm) recorded changes in moss water content during controlled laboratory studies. Strong linear relationships occurred between changes in moss water content and the WBI, although the slopes of the linear relationships were significantly different among sample replicates. Therefore, WBI appeared to be a useful tool to determine sample-specific water content without destructive measurements.

AB  - Moroccan Berbers and the Bolivian Aymara are two unrelated peasant groups living in adverse environments with a still rather traditional agriculture. Precarious life conditions may be responsible for the importance given to male labor and hence for the cultural preference conferred on male descent. This preference, expressed in the social valorization of sons to the detriment of daughters, is more emphasized if the socioeconomic status of the family is lower. Interpreted according to the cost(benefit approach of Fisher ([19581 Genetical Thoery of Natural Selection, New York: Dover) of variations in the sex ratio and to its later developments (Trivers and Willard [19731 Science 179:90-91; Trivers [19851 Social Euolution, Menlo Park: Benjamin/Cummings; Hewlett [19911 J. Anthropol. Res. 47:1-37; Smith (1993] Ethol. Sociobiol. 14:39-44), these cultural characteristics could determine that parents bias the care allocated to their progeny in favor of sons, to the detriment of daughters. This could eventually affect their respective survival and finally modify the offspring tertiary sex ratio. This study compares differences in survival as indicators of parental care according to a child's sex and across three economic strata: poor, medium, and high. The Moroccan data express no other sex differences in survival than an advantage for daughters during the preweaning period in the medium and high strata. Within the same sex and across economic strata, a greater mortality between age 10-20 years is observed for boys of the poorest stratum. The Aymara data do not show sex differences by economic stratum, except for an advantage to daughters between birth and 5 years in the medium group, and no survival differences within the same sex across economic strata. These results suggest either that despite the social valorization of male progeny no differences in parental care according to sex occur, or that their magnitude is not great enough to contrast the survival of sons and daughters.

AB  - With the prevalence of stroke rising due to both aging societies and more people getting strokes at a younger age, a comprehensive investigation into the relationship between urban characteristics and age-specific stroke mortality for the development of a healthy built environment is necessary. Specifically, assessment of various dimensions of urban characteristics (e.g. short-term environmental change, long-term environmental conditions) is needed for healthy built environment designs and protocols. A multifactorial assessment was conducted to evaluate associations between environmental and sociodemographic characteristics with age-stroke mortality in Hong Kong. We found that short-term (and temporally varying) daily PM10, older age and being female were more strongly associated with all types of stroke deaths compared to all-cause deaths in general. Colder days, being employed and being married were more strongly associated with hemorrhagic stroke deaths in general. Long-term (and spatially varying) regional-level air pollution were more strongly associated with non-hemorrhagic stroke deaths in general. These associations varied by age. Employment (manual workers) and low education were risk factors for stroke mortality at younger ages (age <65). Greenness and open space did not have a significant association with stroke mortality. Since a significant connection was expected, this leads to questions about the health-inducing efficacy of Hong Kong's compact open spaces (natural greenery being limited to steep slopes, and extensive impervious surfaces on public open spaces).

AB  - Bioaccumulation of environmental contaminants in mammalian predators can serve as an indicator of ecosystem health. We examined mercury concentrations of raccoons (Procyon lotor; n = 37 individuals) and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis; n = 87 individuals) in Suisun Marsh, California, a large brackish marsh that is characterized by contiguous tracts of tidal marsh and seasonally impounded wetlands. Mean (standard error; range) total mercury concentrations in adult hair grown from 2015 to 2018 were 28.50 mu g/g dw (3.05 mu g/g dw; range: 4.46-81.01 mu g/g dw) in raccoons and 4.85 mu mg/g dw (0.54 mu g/g dw; range: 1.53-27.02 mu g/g dw) in striped skunks. We reviewed mammalian hair mercury concentrations in the literature and raccoon mercury concentrations in Suisun Marsh were among the highest observed for wild mammals. Although striped skunk hair mercury concentrations were 83% lower than raccoons, they were higher than proposed background levels for mercury in mesopredator hair (1-5 mu g/g). Hair mercury concentrations in skunks and raccoons were not related to animal size, but mercury concentrations were higher in skunks in poorer body condition. Large inter-annual differences in hair mercury concentrations suggest that methylmercury exposure to mammalian predators varied among years. Mercury concentrations of raccoon hair grown in 2017 were 2.7 times greater than hair grown in 2015, 1.7 times greater than hair grown in 2016, and 1.6 times greater than hair grown in 2018. Annual mean raccoon and skunk hair mercury concentrations increased with wetland habitat area. Furthermore, during 2017, raccoon hair mercury concentrations increased with the proportion of raccoon home ranges that was wetted habitat, as quantified using global positioning system (GPS) collars. The elevated mercury concentrations we observed in raccoons and skunks suggest that other wildlife at similar or higher trophic positions may also be exposed to elevated methylmercury bioaccumulation in brackish marshes.

AB  - The mechanism of sudomotor regulation in the family Camelidae, as in other mammals, is poorly understood. Five healthy dromedary bulls (400 kg and 4 years-old) were used to examine the interrelationship of sweating rate (SR) with ten thermal parameters measured (and/or estimated) every 3-hr for a 24-hr time period under natural and shaded environmental conditions, in order to subsequently identify the potential thermal drivers of sudomotor in this species. Results revealed that all parameters, including SR, had clearly (P < 0.001) exhibited monophasic circadian rhythms. Moreover, the obtained findings pointed out that strong/moderate positive correlations were existed between SR and eight parameters [i.e. ambient (T-a) rectal (T-r), body (T-b), skin (T-sk), coat (T-ct) temperatures as well as total (ambient-to-body, BTG(ex)), external (ambient-to-skin, BTG(ex)), and internal (skin-to-body, BTG(in)) body thermal gradients] suggesting that they may all be good indicators of sweating activity. Nonetheless, out of those highly-correlated parameters, merely six (i.e. T-a, T-b, T-sk, BTG(t), and BTG(ex)) showed superior coefficients of determination (R-2 >= 0.90; P < 0.000) when interrelated with SR; thereby, implying that they have the potential to drive sudomotor. Notably, however, results were more probably allude that sudomotor is regulated through BTG,. Accordingly, the onset of sweating (i.e. threshold) and its effective level was determined using BTG(t). A method of how SR can be regulated through BTG(t)was proposed according to Webb's theory of controlling body-heat content. Some shortcomings prevent confirming that BTG(t) is the best thermal driver of sudomotor in this species were noted. Research dealing with this interesting physiological process requires further experimentation to fully elucidate the basic functional mechanisms of Camelidae's thermoregulatory system.

AB  - Ongoing variations in rainfall and temperature regimes affect the physiology and productivity of grapevines, calling for irrigation in drought-prone areas. During vintage 2015, we monitored plants water status and indirectly assessed rooting depth and exploited water sources (oxygen isotope analyses) in a mature Vitis vinifera cv. Malvasia Istriana vineyard on red soils ("terra rossa") developed on highly permeable carbonate rocks. We also investigated effects of topsoil irrigation or late summer rains on plant water status and yield. Under the harsh summer environmental conditions of 2015, the plant water status was overall favorable (moderate water deficit) and never reached critical levels, suggesting that irrigation was not mandatory. Leaf conductance to water vapor (g(L)) measured in July decreased by about 70% compared to spring, while minimum leaf water potential (Psi(min)) dropped by only 16%, suggesting an isohydric behavior of the cultivar (strict stomatal control of transpiration). Both Psi(min) and g(L) reached a minimum in July (peak of drought), and returned to pre-drought values in late summer. Rainfalls or supplemental irrigation (about 40 mm) promoted prompt recovery of plant water status. Irrigation treatments or occasional summer rainfalls can influence the water status of plants, although roots have access to deep water sources. In fact, the isotopic composition of xylem sap was similar to that of soil water sampled in a nearby deep cave, supporting the hypothesis that deep soil is the main water source for grapevines in karstic areas during summertime. Deficit irrigation, based on careful evaluation of physiological indicators of plant water status, might be an effective strategy for promoting sustainable viticulture, and a rationale use of water resources in karstic ecosystems.

AB  - With the rapid development of ultra-high-voltage direct-current (UHVDC) transmission, the strength of environmental static electric field (SEF) around UHVDC transmission lines increased substantially, which has aroused widely public attention on the potential health effects of SEF. In this study, the effect of SEF exposure on learning and memory ability was investigated. Institute of Cancer Research mice were exposed to 56.3 kV/m SEF for a short term (7 days) or long term (49 days). Behaviors in the Morris water maze (MWM) test, hippocampal neurotransmitter contents, and oxidative stress indicators were examined. Results showed that short-term SEF exposure significantly prolonged escape latency and decreased the number of platform-site crossovers, as well as decreased the time spent in the target quadrant in the MWM test. Meanwhile, serotonin level and the ratio of glutamate level to gamma-aminobutyric acid level changed significantly. Besides, malondialdehyde content and glutathione peroxidase activity increased significantly, while superoxide dismutase activity decreased significantly. After long-term SEF exposure, all indices above showed no significant differences between the SEF and sham exposure groups. These data indicated that short-term exposure to 56.3 kV/m SEF could cause abnormal neurotransmitter levels and oxidative stress in the hippocampus, which led to the decline in learning and memory ability. Under the condition of long-term exposure, the SEF-induced disturbances in neurotransmitter contents and redox balance were offset by the compensatory responses of mice, and thus, the learning and memory ability returned to normal level. The temporary and reversible decline in learning and memory ability was only a common biological effect of SEF rather than a health hazard.

AB  - The St. Louis River Estuary (SLRE), a freshwater estuary bordering Duluth, Minnesota, Superior, Wisconsin, and the most western point of Lake Superior (46.74A degrees, - 92.13A degrees), has a long history of human development since Euro-American settlement similar to 200 years ago. Due to degradation from logging, hydrologic modification, industrial practices, and untreated sewage, the SLRE was designated an Area of Concern in 1987. Action has been taken to restore water quality including the installation of the Western Lake Superior Sanitary District in 1978 to help remove beneficial use impairments. A better understanding of historical impacts and remediation is necessary to help document progress and knowledge gaps related to water quality, so a paleolimnological study of the SLRE was initiated. Various paleolimnological indicators (pigments, diatom communities, and diatom-inferred phosphorus) were analyzed from six cores taken throughout the SLRE and another from western Lake Superior. Reductions in eutrophic diatom taxa such as Cyclotella meneghiniana and Stephanodiscus after 1970 in certain cores suggest an improvement in water quality over the last 40 years. However, in cores taken from estuarine bay environments, persistence of eutrophic taxa such as Cyclostephanos dubius and Stephanodiscus binderanus indicate ongoing nutrient problems. Sedimentary pigments also indicate cyanobacteria increases in bays over the last two decades. Diatom model-inferred phosphorus and contemporary monitoring data suggest some of the problems associated with excess nutrient loads have been remediated, but modern conditions (internal phosphorus loading, changing climate) may be contributing to ongoing water quality impairments in some locations. The integrated record of biological, chemical, and physical indicators preserved in the sediments will aid state and federal agencies in determining where to target their resources.

AB  - Acoustic diversity indices have been proposed as low-cost biodiversity monitoring tools. The acoustic diversity of a soundscape can be indicative of the richness of an acoustic community and the structural/vegetation characteristics of a habitat. There is a need to apply these methods to landscapes that are ecologically and/or economically important. We investigate the relationship between the acoustic properties of a coniferous forest with stand-age and structure. We sampled a 73 point grid in part of the UK's largest man-made lowland coniferous plantation forest, covering a 320ha mosaic of different aged stands. Forest stands ranged from 0-85 years old providing an age-gradient. Short soundscape recordings were collected from each grid point on multiple mornings (between 6am-11am) to capture the dawn chorus. We repeated the study during July/August in 2014 and again in 2015. Five acoustic indices were calculated for a total of 889 two minute samples. Moderate relationships between acoustic diversity with forest stand-age and vegetation characteristics (canopy height; canopy cover) were observed. Ordinations suggest that as structural complexity and forest age increases, the higher frequency bands (4-10KHz) become more represented in the soundscape. A strong linear relationship was observed between distance to the nearest road and the ratio of anthropogenic noise to biological sounds within the soundscape. Similar acoustic patterns were observed in both years, though acoustic diversity was generally lower in 2014, which was likely due to differences in wind conditions between years. Our results suggest that developing these relatively low-cost acoustic monitoring methods to inform adaptive management of production landscapes, may lead to improved biodiversity monitoring. The methods may also prove useful for modelling road noise, landscape planning and noise mitigation.

AB  - Artificial seawater and freshwater microcosms inoculated with raw sewage were set up to compare the persistence of microbial source tracking (MST) markers (i.e. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (B. theta), Methanobrevibacter smithii (M. smithii), human polyomaviruses JC and BK (HPyVs)) and human adenoviruses under different sunlight intensity and salinity. PMA pretreatment successfully eliminated the false-positive detection of dead bacterial cells in the model-development experiment. The results were then validated using real environmental matrices in microcosms inoculated with raw sewage. The genome concentrations of the targets followed a first-order decay pattern with 90% reduction of the initial amounts in <5 days for both artificial and natural surface waters. Decay rate constant (k(1)) were developed microorganisms in artificial water matrices. Due to the different water environment conditions, improved decay rates (k(2)) incorporated with sunlight, TSS and TOC adjustment coefficients were used for validation of the natural water matrices. Based on the predictive squared correlation coefficient (Q(F)(2)) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) validation criteria, the improved k(2) were able to provide better prediction on the survival of target microorganisms in environmental surface waters (Q(F)(2) > 0.6 and RMSE ranged from 0.05 to 1.81). For microbial source tracking purposes, HPyVs are suggested to be better MST markers in freshwater, while B. theta is recommended for seawater based on the decay models developed in this study. The targeted DNA of M. smithii should only be used to indicate recent human faecal pollution in surface waters due to their faster decay than human adenoviruses. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Land use changes are among the main factors shaping diversity patterns of soil fauna in European ecosystems. However, current knowledge on soil fauna biodiversity levels across land use types to establish baseline values with monitoring purposes are still lacking. Also, only few initiatives have been including functional components of soil fauna on biodiversity monitoring, despite the noticeable link between soil organisms and aboveground ecosystem services. Here, we analyzed the differences of collembolan taxonomic and functional diversity across an European transect with sites comprising different land use types (forests, grasslands and arable lands) and characteristics in terms of habitat conditions and soil properties. No clear relation was found between collembolan species richness and the site typology established in this study. However, community traits of life-forms responded to the gradient of site properties and indicated different land use types based on the higher proportion of eu-edaphic species in forested sites, in comparison to grasslands and arable lands. Among the environmental variables, pH was the main soil parameter influencing both collembolan richness and community weighted mean of life-forms, and was negatively correlated to both biodiversity components. The effects of pH may also reflect the influence of land use history and management practices in different European ecosystems and more suitable traits related to pH preferences, and tolerance should be further investigated for collembolan species. Our results suggest that functional diversity may provide a clearer picture on soil fauna diversity changes across different land use types and site properties. So components of functional diversity based on community traits should be included in the 'indicator shopping basket' of soil biodiversity monitoring studies across European ecosystems.

AB  - The rising average global temperature can lead to changes both in the physical and biological environments and affect the survival of organisms. Freshwater turtles are considered to be susceptible species since their development is dependent on incubation temperature. In Thailand, although several species of freshwater turtle are present, the extent of their susceptibility to temperature change is unknown due to the lack of information on their developmental patterns. This research, therefore, is aimed at examining the effects of temperature on somatic development in Malayemys macrocephala, a native species and the most common freshwater turtle in Thailand. Turtle eggs were collected from rice fields in the central part of Thailand during December 2011 to February 2012 inclusive. Eggs (237-238 per condition) were incubated in microprocessor-controlled incubators at three different temperatures (26 degrees C, 29 degrees C and 32 degrees C) with a relative humidity in excess of 80%. Each week, until the remaining eggs hatched, eggs were randomly selected, removed and dissected to reveal the developing embryo to screen for developmental stage and any abnormalities. The incubation period (lay to hatch) was not significantly different among the three temperatures (115 +/- 11.3 d, 115 +/- 20.3 d and 109 +/- 17.8 d, respectively), but the growth patterns, as indicated by the stages of development and carapace lengths, were significantly different. At a high temperature (32 degrees C), turtle embryos showed a significantly faster growth rate than at the intermediate and low temperatures (29 degrees C and 26 degrees C), but had a significantly (over 3.3-fold) higher incidence of developmental abnormalities (especially deformed bodies) than at the lower temperatures. Overall, the results indicate that incubation temperature is an important variable affecting the somatic development of this tropical freshwater turtle species, whilst abnormalities in the embryonic body may be a sensitive indicator of extreme thermal stress.

AB  - The presence of pharmaceuticals in the environment is now a major concern given their potential adverse effects on organisms, particularly human beings. Because the feeding style and habitat of the crab Carcinus maenas make this species vulnerable to organic contaminants, it has been used previously in ecotoxicological studies. Lysosomal membrane stability (LMS) in crabs is a general indicator of cellular well-being and can be visualized by the neutral red retention (NRR) assay. LMS in crab hemolymph has been evaluated as a cellular biomarker of adverse effects produced by exposure to pharmaceutical compounds. Crabs were exposed in the laboratory to four different pharmaceuticals for 28 days in a semistatic 24-h renewal assay. Filtered seawater was spiked every 2 days with various concentrations (from 0.1 to 50 mu g center dot L-1) of caffeine, ibuprofen, carbamazepine, and novobiocin. Results showed that NRR time, measured at day 28, was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) after exposure to environmental concentrations of each pharmaceutical (caffeine = 15 mu g center dot L-1; carbamazepine = 1 mu g center dot L-1; ibuprofen = 5 mu g center dot L-1; and novobiocin = 0.1 mu g center dot L-1) when compared with control organisms. The predicted "no environmental effect" concentration/measured environmental concentration results showed that the selected pharmaceuticals are toxic at environmental concentrations and need further assessment. LMS monitoring in crabs is a sensitive tool for evaluating exposure to concentrations of selected drugs under laboratory conditions and provides a robust tier 1 testing approach (screening biomarker) for rapid assessment of marine pollution and environmental impact assessments for analyzing pharmaceutical contamination in aquatic environments.

AB  - Ecological parameters (soil invertebrates, microbial activity, and plant community) were assessed in a metal contaminated site in an abandoned lead smelter and non-contaminated reference sites, as part of an ecological risk assessment (ERA). Vegetation cover inside the smelter area was lower and presented a more homogenous species composition than outside. A more simplified and less abundant vegetation community within the smelter area also simplified the habitat conditions, which in addition to metal toxicity, impaired the soil microbial and faunal communities. A significant reduction in the feeding activity was observed within the smelter area. Also a significant change in community composition of surface dwelling invertebrates was observed at those sites when compared to sites outside the smelter area. Moreover, basal respiration, microbial biomass C. dehydrogenase and phosphatase activity also decreased in several of these points under the smelter area. As a result, a significant impairment of organic material decomposition in the most contaminated sites was observed. Metal contamination affected the ecological status of the site, leading to a risk for ecosystem functioning and provisioning of ecosystem services like organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling, even 17 years after the end of smelting activities. Regarding the sensitivity of the ecological parameters assessed, most were able to distinguish sites within the smelter area boundaries from those outside. However, only bait lamina (feeding activity), basal respiration and microbial biomass carbon presented high capacity to distinguish the level of soil contamination, since they were significantly correlated with metal loadings, and thus are promising candidates to be integrated in the Ecological Line of Evidence of an ERA.

AB  - In this study, the amounts of antioxidant vitamins (A, E and C), selenium (Se), reduced glutathione (GSH)/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratio and malondialdehyde (MDA) that is the indicator of lipid peroxidation were determined in Lemna gibba L plants placed in the secondary clarifier and grown in natural water. The amounts of antioxidant vitamins (A, E and C) GSH, GSSG and MIDA were determined with HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) and the amounts of Se were determined fluorimetrically. While significant decrease in amounts of antioxidant vitamins (A, E and C) and Se takes place between the first and the second or third day depending on species and insignificant decrease takes place after that day, the amount of GSH/GSSG ratio decreases until the second day (p < 0.05) and insignificantly increases after that day. Amounts of vitamins (A, E and C), Se and GSH/GSSG ratio for the plants placed in the secondary clarifier are much less than that for control group while an opposite trend was observed in MDA level. The MIDA for the plants placed in secondary clarifier has maximum value at the second day, which can be considered as the maximum stress occurring at that day. Consequently, the first two days of treatment time can be taken as acclimation time and after the acclimation time the plant lives in the hostile environmental condition with the certain amount of oxidative stress. As a result, it is determined that wastewater decreases the lifetime of plant by causing metabolic stress on it and affects antioxidant capacity. The lifetime of the plants in the secondary clarifier was determined to be five days since fading toward yellow color (necrosis) in the plants was observed at the fifth day. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) diet is an important indicator of prevailing environmental conditions and resource availability. In this study, dietary variation within and between years was studied with fatty acid signature analysis (FASA), stomach content analysis (SCA) and stable isotope analysis (SIA). We profiled the fatty acid (FA) composition of whole blood collected from adult penguins throughout the breeding season, and from chicks during the crehe period, in 2001 and 2002. Differences were detected in FA profiles between years, breeding stage and age (adults vs. chicks). These patterns broadly corresponded to those observed from SCA and SIA, with a mix of krill and fish consumed in the early part of the breeding season in both years, krill dominating the diet during the chick-rearing periods in 2001, and fish in 2002. Different metabolic and physiological demands between stages, and ages, may also influence FA profiles but warrants further investigation. In-situ calibrations of adult FA blood profiles were made using corresponding stomach samples to quantify diet composition. Using linear discriminate function analysis, we classified adult FA profiles into 3 meal-types: krill, fish or mixed. A higher proportion of adults had fish-like profiles during the arrival and guard periods. Krill-like profiles dominated during the incubation and crehe periods, although there were a relatively high proportion of fish-like and mixed profiles as well. These patterns corresponded to results from SCA and SIA. This study demonstrates that FASA has the potential to be integrated with other dietary tools to enhance diet monitoring studies, which are currently integral to ecosystem management and conservation measures. The in-situ calibration method used offers a simple and effective alternative to more rigorous calibration techniques developed elsewhere. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Microbial association with particles can significantly affect the fate and transport characteristics of microbes in aquatic systems as particle-associated organisms will be less mobile in the environment than their free phase (i.e. unattached) counterparts. As such, similarities or dissimilarities in the partitioning behavior of indicator organisms and pathogens may have an impact on the suitability of a particular indicator to act as a surrogate for a pathogen. This research analyzed the partitioning behavior of two pathogens (Cryptosporidium, Giardia) and several common indicator organisms (fecal coliform, Escherichia coli, Enterococci, Clostridium perfringens spores, and coliphage) in natural waters under both dry and wet weather conditions. Samples were taken from several streams in two distinct sampling phases: (i) single grab samples; and (ii) intrastorm samples obtained throughout the duration of four storms. Partitioning behavior varied by microbial type, with 15-30% of bacterial indicators (fecal coliform, E. coli, and Enterococci) associated with settleable particles compared to 50% for C. perfringens spores. Both pathogens exhibited similar levels of particle association during dry weather (roughly 30%), with increased levels observed during wet weather events (Giardia to 60% and Cryptosporidium to 40%). The settling velocities of particle-associated microbes were also estimated, with those of the bacterial indicators (fecal coliform, E. coli, and Enterococci), as well as C. perfringens spores, being similar to that of the Giardia and Cryptosporidium, suggesting these organisms may exhibit similar transport behavior. With respect to intrastorm analysis, the highest microbial concentrations, in both particle-associated and free phase, occurred during the earlier stages of a storm. The total loadings of both indicators and pathogens were also estimated over the course of individual storms. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We investigated the response of litter-dwelling arthropods to the effects of four forestry thinning intensities (Control, Light Thin, Light Thin with Gap, and Heavy Thin). With the balance between timber demand and maintaining biodiversity in the forest ecosystem in mind, we examined the effects of thinning on the abundance, richness, and diversity of arthropods as an indicator of how ecological processes affect forest litter-dwelling fauna. Study sites were 40- to 60-year-old stands of typical Douglas-fir plantation in the Willamette National Forest, Oregon, USA. To examine the seasonal response of the litter-dwelling arthropods, litter debris and humus samples were collected in October 2000 (wet late-growing season, Late 2000), June 2001 (wet early-growing season, Early 2001), and August 2001 (dry mid-growing season, Mid 2001) and extracted with Tullgren funnels. The abundance and diversity of litter-dwelling arthropods decreased as thinning intensity increased. The decreases in both abundance and diversity of arthropods with limited mobility within the two heaviest thinnings were correlated with an increased heterogeneity of disturbance to the forest floor (patchy litter and moss cover removal), rather than responses to thinning itself at the scale of the entire stand. The litter-dwelling fauna correlated positively with litter moisture. Under control conditions, the abundance of predators and detritivores increased during the dry summer in August. Non-metric multidimensional scaling results showed distinct clusters for the three growing seasons. The wet early-growing season clustered with the dry mid-growing season, but not with the wet late-growing season. Moisture correlated highly with the ordination axes. This study showed that litter-dwelling arthropods were correlated with stand density and seasonal litter moisture of the forest floor.

AB  - The organic matter contained in municipal solid waste (MSW) and in the MSW fractions obtained by mechanical separation has strong environmental impact when the waste is used as landfill. This is partly due to the biological activity that occurs under anaerobic conditions. Negative effects on the environment include unpleasant odors, biogas, leachate and biomass self-heating. Measuring the biological reactivity of waste with the help of indicators is an important tool to prevent waste impact. The aim of this study was to develop an index capable of describing the aerobic reactivity of waste, using both biological and chemical indicators. To develop this index, 71 MSW and MSW-product samples, including biologically treated MSW and mechanically separated MSW fractions, were analyzed. Fifty of the 71 samples analyzed represented MSWs and their derived products collected from a number of Italian waste plants and sites. The remaining 21 were MSW samples collected at different times during 8 different full-scale aerobic biological processes in four treatment plants used to reduce the biological reactivity of wastes. Five of these processes used the entire (unsorted) MSW, while the remaining three used the organic fraction of the MSW obtained by mechanical pre-treatment (waste sieving). Respirometric activity (Dynamic Respiration Index, DRI) and eluates characterization (chemical oxygen demand - COD, and S days biological oxygen demand - BOD5) were used as indicators of waste strength, as they had previously been reported to be indirect measures of waste impact on landfill. Summarizing all studied indicators, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to develop the Putrescibility Index (Ip). The results revealed Ip index of 204 +/- 33 (mean +/- standard deviation) and 159 +/- 14 for the organic fraction of MSW and MSW untreated waste respectively, and of 106 +/- 16 and 101 +/- 22 for the corresponding biologically treated waste.

AB  - Zinc concentrations in 19 species of marine macroalgae and a lichen from western Ireland (Spiddal, Co. Galway) were analysed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Algae were collected from a single site but occupied different shore levels and belonged to distinct phylogenetic groupings and to different (previously recognised) morphological groups. Concentrations ranged from 15-115 mug g(-1) dry weight. The greatest variation in concentration occurred amongst the red algal species, containing both maximum and minimum concentrations. Zn concentrations in brown and green algae were generally lower than those in red algae. When grouped according to thallus morphology, thin, branched sheets (which consisted mainly of red algae) contained the highest Zn concentrations. In filamentous algae, Zn levels were higher than in thick-leathery or coarsely branched algae. However, all green algal species examined had similar Zn concentrations, despite their different morphologies. In brown algae, the highest Zn levels were detected in mid-shore fucoids (Fucus vesiculosus and Fucus serratus), while thicker, subtidal and low-shore brown algae (Laminaria digitaia, Halydris siliquosa) exhibited lower Zn concentrations. The lowest Zn concentrations were detected in high-intertidal species (Fucus spiralis, Pelvetia canaliculata), the only marine lichen examined (Ramalina siliquosa) and a red crustose alga (Corallina officinalis). In all morphological groups. red algal representatives contained relatively higher levels of Zn, the exception being Corallina officinalis. Zn levels in 4 species from a second, estuarine site in Galway Bay exhibited the same relative differences amongst species, but were all consistently higher than in algae from Spiddal. It is concluded that Zn accumulation in macroalgae is closely related to ecological growth strategies, following a functional-form model. However, the phylogenetic origin of species which determines carbohydrate and phenol composition, and responses to ambient environmental conditions ultimately determine, the availability of binding sites for polyvalent cations.

AB  - Temperate grassy woodlands were once the dominant vegetation across many agricultural regions of south-eastern Australia, but most of these are now highly degraded and fragmented. Adequate conservation of these woodlands is dependent on successful ecological restoration; however, ecological barriers often limit ecosystem recovery once degrading processes are removed. To help identify these barriers, we used a state and transition framework to compare topsoils of little-disturbed (reference) and variously degraded remnants of grassy Eucalyptus albens Benth. and E. melliodora Cunn. ex Schauer woodlands. Topsoils of degraded remnants showed a repeated pattern, with the most compacted, most acidic and most depleted topsoils occurring in remnants dominated by Aristida ramosa R. Br. or Austrodanthonia H. P. Linder and Austrostipa scabra (Lindl.) S. W. L. Jacobs J. Everett; the least compacted and most nutrient rich topsoils in remnants dominated by annual exotics; and generally intermediate topsoils in remnants dominated by Bothriochloa macra (Steud.) S. T. Blake or Austrostipa bigeniculata (Hughes) S. W. L. Jacobs & J. Everett. Surprisingly, topsoils beneath trees in reference sites (supporting Poa sieberiana Spreng.) were similar to topsoils supporting annual exotics for most soil properties. Chemical properties of topsoils from open areas of reference sites [supporting Themeda australis (R. Br.) Stapf] were usually intermediate and similar to Bothriochloa macra and Austrostipa bigeniculata topsoils. The most striking exception to these trends was for soil nitrate, which was extremely low in all reference topsoils and showed a high correlation with annual exotic abundance. We discuss the potential for positive feedbacks between soil nitrogen cycling and understorey composition and the need for intervention to assist possible nitrate-dependent transitions between annual and perennial understorey states. Dominant grasses, trees and annual weed abundance may be useful indicators of soil conditions and could inform selection of target sites, species and techniques for restoration projects.

AB  - Restoring self-sustaining tropical forest ecosystems on surface mined sites is a formidable challenge that requires the integration of proven reclamation techniques and reforestation strategies appropriate to specific site conditions, including landscape biodiversity patterns. Restorationists working in most tropical settings are usually hampered by lack of basic information on the wide variety of native tree species that characterize the pre-disturbance forests, as well as insufficient understanding of the ecology of disturbance and natural recovery to design effective restoration programs. A notable exception to this is the forest restoration program developed since the early 1980s by a Brazilian bauxite mining company operating at Trombetas in Para State in central Amazonia. A systematic nursery and field research strategy was used to develop a reforestation program based on mixed plantings of mon than 70 native old-growth forest tree species. This technique has been used to replant about 100 ha of deforested minelands each year over the past 15 years. Research in recent years has evaluated this approach and other, generally simpler, reforestation methods used at a smaller scale at this site. Post-plantation biodiversity development and other indicators of restoration success or sustainability were recorded. The results of these studies have shown the overwhelming importance of careful site preparation and topsoil handling/replacement practices in determining both future productivity and biodiversity of the redeveloping forests, irrespective of the complexity of the planting design used. The inclusion of a wide variety of forest species, particularly later successional species, was very important for long-range restoration owing to limitations on natural recovery processes that inhibit seed dispersal and subsequent colonization of many old-growth forest species. Many of the: lessons learned at this site an applicable to improve the design of mineland rehabilitation and forest restoration programs worldwide. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The spatial heterogeneity and influence factors of public lifespan have been reported worldwide at the national level or typical longevous areas. However, few sub-national studies considering the living environment and socio-economic level together have been explored in the imbalanced developed region with a huge population base and deteriorated air quality. In this paper, spatial heterogeneity of lifespan integrating environment and socio-economic influence factors was investigated in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region of China using geographically weighted regression (GWR). Five indicators were constructed to determine the lifespan based on the three national censuses (1990-2010) in the BTH region. The results showed that the areas with higher CH (centenarians per 100,000 inhabitants) and centenarity index (CI) exhibited changing distribution in the BTH region, whereas those with lower CH and CI and extreme value of the ultra-octogenarian index (UOI) and LI (> 90/> 65) maintained a relatively stable feature through time. But as lifespan indicators increase overall, the differences between the counties/districts widen. Furthermore, remarkable spatial heterogeneity was detected for the associations between the significant environmental and socio-economic variables and lifespan indicators. Although the natural geographic condition (altitude) still exhibited a negative influence on the longevity of the population, the socio-economic factors (GDP(pc) and income level) showed a more dominant influence on the extension of the elderly and longevity population. Correspondingly, the widened unbalance of population lifespan (UOI, LI, CH) was considered closely related to the socio-economic polarization, and the adverse effects of air pollution on life expectancy at birth (LEB) have also emerged. To further improve the overall lifespan level and narrow the lifespan gap in the BTH region, future work on cleaner air and more balanced development is still needed.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to establish a spatial multi-scale integrated assessment framework for critical areas of ecosystem service supply and demand, in order to provide theoretical support for regional ecological protection planning and refined management. Taking the typical hilly area of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in China as an example, based on the assessment matrix of land use and ecosystem services, we used the method of spatial heterogeneity assessment and self-organizing feature mapping (SOFM) to explore the identification and regionalization of critical areas of ecosystem services at regional and small scales. The results show that there was spatial heterogeneity and scale effects of ecosystem services under the two scales. The small-scale supply-demand pattern was greatly affected by microtopography and land use patterns, and the importance of ecosystem services was as follows: forest area in the upper part of the mountain > orchard and dry area in the middle and lower part of the mountain > valley farming area > flat town and farming area. The regional-scale supply-demand pattern was greatly affected by landscape structure, location conditions and social economy, and the importance of ecosystem services was as follows: south > west > north > central. The SOFM network quantitatively identified four types of ecological areas with clear dominant functions at regional and small scales. The balance between supply and demand in the studied ecosystem service areas was I < II < III < IV, in which IV was the critical area in terms of supply and I was the critical area in terms of demand. This assessment framework can improve the spatial accuracy and objectivity of the quantification and mapping of ecosystem services, and provide new ideas for multi-scale identification and expression of ecosystem services.

AB  - Ecosystem indicators track information about states and trends in ocean systems and are a valuable tool for ecosystem assessment and management. To ensure that indicators are used appropriately in both science and management contexts, it is important to understand the extent to which they represent broader spatial patterns. In the Northern California Current (NCC) off the Oregon and Washington state coasts in the USA, copepod metrics derived from data collected at a well-sampled station on the Newport Hydrographic (NH) Line ('NH05', five nmi offshore from Newport, OR, USA) are commonly used as indicators of the region's general ocean conditions. Using correlation analyses, we examined the utility of NH05 as a sentinel station (i.e. representative of a broader region) with respect to the abundance and biomass of warm-water and cold-water copepods in the NCC. Copepod correlations between NH05 and other locations in the NCC were higher for the warm-water copepods than the cold-water group, with correlations being slightly higher for abundance than biomass. Paracalanus parvus had the highest NH05 correlations among the warm-water copepod species, and Acartia longiremis had the highest NH05 correlations among the cold-water copepod species. We also broadened our analysis to evaluate other sampling sites as sentinel stations and found that some sites were equally or more representative of copepod dynamics in the NCC than NH05, though none of these sites tend to be sampled as often as NH05. This analysis emphasized that the warm-water copepods tend to be more similarly distributed in the NCC than the cold-water copepods, and thus their changes through time are better captured by most stations. In contrast, correlations among the cold-water copepods in the NCC vary by location and appear to be strongly related to depth, with the highest correlations at mid-shelf stations.

AB  - Background Anthropogenic disturbance can negatively affect an animal's energy budget by evoking movement responses. Existing research focuses mainly on immediate displacement as a disturbance effect, since this can be easily observed in the field. However, effects on movement over longer timescales are poorly examined and it is largely unknown if and to what extent they reflect immediate responses. Longer-term responses could for example be larger than immediate responses if birds, after disturbance, return to the original location and thereby travel twice the immediate disturbed distance. Methods We combined GPS tracking data with observational data to quantify the effects of anthropogenic (air force and walkers) and non-anthropogenic disturbances on distances travelled by roosting Eurasian Oystercatchers (Haematopus ostralegus) during the non-breeding season. We compared immediate displacement after a disturbance with distance travelled during the entire high tide period (longer-term response), while accounting for environmental factors. Additionally, we calculated energy expenditure due to disturbance based on observed disturbance frequencies. Results Disturbance resulted in an immediate displacement response of similar to 200 m (median). Air force disturbances tended to yield larger immediate responses than walker and, especially, than non-anthropogenic disturbances. Longer-term responses and immediate responses were approximately similar, suggesting that, over longer timescales, spatial disturbance effects in the study area remain confined to immediate effects. However, disturbances were infrequent (0.17 disturbances per bird per hour) and most disturbances were of natural origin (62%). Consequently, anthropogenic disturbance of roosting oystercatchers in the study area on average costs 0.08% of the daily energy expenditure. Conclusions Our results suggest that immediate spatial responses to disturbance can be a useful proxy for spatial responses over longer timescales. Over the non-exhaustive range of conditions investigated, energetic consequences of spatial disturbance responses for an oystercatcher in the study area are marginal due to low disturbance levels.

AB  - The pressure drop between the gas transportation grid and local networks can be exploited to generate electricity by means of a turbo expander. However, a lack of performance indicators leads to incomprehension and underestimation of the actual benefits in terms of energy savings and carbon emission reductions, thus limiting the diffusion of such smart, energy-saving technology. For this reason, in this study, key performance indicators are proposed for natural gas pressure regulation stations with energy recovery. The waste energy recovery index is introduced by considering the possibility of system thermal integration and a reference theoretical sideways process, where a Joule-Thompson expansion occurs. Furthermore, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is evaluated through the carbon emission recovery index that quantifies the environmental benefits of the energy saving action. Different key performance indicator values have been calculated by means of custom prediction models based on system characteristics. Finally, in order to assess the accuracy of such models, a parallel simulation is conducted using UniSime Design Suite software. Here, the two system configurations are implemented: one related to the case study and one related to the reference sideways process. The results show that the model successfully predicts the heat needs of pressure reduction stations and, for a typical system configuration, characterised by an expansion ratio of 4.8, a maximum waste energy recovery of about 69% could be achieved when the system is operating at nominal conditions. Proposed KPIs turned out to be a helpful tool to manage design development and system operations. Moreover, the simplicity of the performance indexes makes them easy to implement in software for process control and simple to interpret for system operators.

AB  - Why is a type of rangeland grass called "the soul of the Hortoba ' gy steppe'' by a local herder deemed to be of low value by range scientists? In this paper I examine how herders see wild forage and fodder plants "through the mouths of the animals,'' what kind of indicators they use, and how these indicators affect folk taxonomy. I focus on the Poaceae and Cyperaceae families (grasses, sedges, and their relatives), underrepresented taxa in ethnobiological studies. The Hortoba ' gy is a salt steppe with low predictability of rain and pasture conditions. I conducted participatory field work and interviews with 92 herders. Herders have a special term for the consumable biomass of a pasture/meadow, "mez} o.'' They distinguished between 28 types of hay and 30 types of mez} o and listed 34 plant folk taxa as important forage or fodder. I documented 13 different grazing-related indicators (plant traits), including nutritional value, interannual variation, and resprouting ability. The seasonal change in grazing value was a key indicator. Grazing value was an important, but not the only, factor in the folk taxonomy of grasses and sedges. Certain plant traits which are often used by ecologists, such as clonality, plant architecture, and belowground traits, were not used by herders. Herders and animals practiced reciprocal learning, with herders closely monitoring the feeding behavior of their animals. Herders used indicators to plan grazing routes and shortterm transhumance movements. Herders provided their animals with the greatest care possible, even in this unpredictable environment. Folk indicators may give us a better understanding of pastoral grassland and livestock management and herders' "monitoring'' activities, and help us maintain and develop sustainable land-use systems.

AB  - Despite mounting evidence of the harm associated with excessive nutrient loading to estuaries, tools to translate this body of knowledge into sound environmental management and planning practices in data poor environments are lacking. In this paper, a design science approach is adopted to develop a screening (box) model for the water quality assessment of South African estuaries. The key design principles are first distilled from literature on the nutrient dynamics and hydro-morphological functioning of small, dynamic, bar-blocked estuaries. The proportional volume contribution of land-based flows (river inflows, diffuse inflows from the peri-catchment, point source discharges) is determined; a water quality class is allocated to each of the inflows, and the overall water quality class for the land-based inflows to an estuary is determined. Taking the percentage mouth closure and the perched nature of the estuaries into account, a WQ Similarity rating is allocated. This similarity rating reflects the degree of similarity of the water quality in the estuary to the reference (natural) water quality. The entire water quality assessment uses readily available information such as land-cover data, legal limits for disposal and water quality monitoring data where they exist, making it suitable for a data-poor environment. The screening model is calibrated and validated on a selection of South African estuaries for which official health condition assessments exist. Results are promising, and the screening model is deemed appropriate for assessing the water quality of individual estuaries and for comparing the sensitivity of multiple estuaries to changes in the volume and nutrient loading of land-based inflows. As such, the screening model can be employed at a regional or national scale for strategic assessments of water quality in small, dynamic estuaries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although little evidence existed to support that view, European countries and in particular France, have regarded echinoderms, including sea urchins, as low risk in terms of feacal contamination. It is hypothesized that the sea urchins mode of feeding, which is based on grazing and differs from bivalve molluscs, would prevent it from concentrating high levels of Escherichia coli. Here, we monitored E.coli levels in sea urchins (Paracentrotus lividus) and in filter-feeder mussels (Mytillus galloprovincialis), collected concurrently from the same natural area over a 1-year period to verify this assumption. Sea urchins were collected on the seafloor, whereas mussels were collected from the water column at a depth of 4m. Our results showed heavy bacterial loading of sea urchins in a natural growing environment. Moreover, we highlighted that E.coli contamination of sea urchins could, in certain conditions, be higher than those detected in filter-feeding mussels collected at the same location. Finally, the results showed a significant correlation between rainfall and E.coli concentrations in sea urchins, suggesting that the bacterial safety of sea urchin could be linked to the quality of the surrounding water.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyThe European regulation requires competent authorities to monitor the sanitary status of shellfish, including live echinoderms, through faecal indicator organisms. In the French Mediterranean, sea urchin production is significant. Until now, as no data showed significant E.coli contamination levels, no monitoring programs focused on this species. This study demonstrates that sea urchins are more vulnerable to faecal contamination than previously hypothesized, especially during heavy rainfall. In consequence, the European authority general approach to microbiological management of shellfish should be applied to sea urchins.

AB  - Reduction of complexity and capacity to evaluate management strategies are important considerations when modelling complex ecosystems. Models of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem assessments (MICE) achieve this by representing interactions among a restricted number of crucial species in the ecosystem considered. MICE applications are question-driven, heavily dependent on available data for conditioning and aimed at addressing tactical issues. Here we present the development of a MICE for the central Adriatic Sea. This area is important ecologically and economically because it supports a commercial stock of Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus), and a nursery ground for European hake (Merluccius merluccius), as well as being subjected to high levels of fishing pressure. Here, Italian and Croatian bottom trawl fisheries mainly target Norway lobster while impacting juvenile hake. Single-species stock assessments for the target species indicate fluctuating trends between 2006 and 2013, as do the survey biomass trends of most of their prey, underlining the need for a multispecies management plan. The diet of the target species were examined and prey items partitioned into four groups. Consumption of prey groups by predators was modelled using a Holling Type II functional response. A modified biomass dynamic model was used to represent the prey dynamics, projecting them into the future for 10 years (2013-2022) and testing different management strategies, including a discard ban. The most effective management option was the protection of larger individuals, which led to a clear improvement in the stock abundance and spawning stock biomass of both hake and Norway lobster without significant adverse effects on their prey. The discard ban scenario appeared to have knock-on effects on both predators and some of their prey. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The marine recreational fishing (MRF) represents one of the most popular activities along the coasts of numerous countries around the world, in particular in the Mediterranean Sea. Despite the evidences of potential effects on the marine biodiversity and commercially exploited stocks, a sound information base and adequate management plans are still lacking, both at the national and basin level. An analysis of the MRF on the West coasts of the Adriatic Sea was carried out, in 2014, by using a standardized questionnaires approach, aiming to describe the state of the art and to preliminarily assess catches, in comparison with the commercial ones, at the regional scale. Gilt-headed seabream, European seabass, cuttlefish, squid and Atlantic bluefin tuna resulted the anglers' preferred species, even if the top five in term of caught biomass were bluefin tuna, seabream, cuttlefish, common dolphinfish and little tunny, in the order (accounting up to 60% of total catches). The exploitation level resulted to be significant, as confirmed by the comparison with commercial fisheries, being the MRF captures 30% or 45% of the artisanal fishery in the same area, with some species, such as bluefish, bonito, pandora and picarel, showing larger values. The preliminary assessment of ecological effects, highlighted that the exploitation use about 10%-16% of energy fixed by the primary production (Primary Production Required to sustain fishery), but the ecosystem effects are still sustainable (Lindex and probability to be sustainable fished). However, combining catches by MRF with those by small scale fishery completely changes the situation, showing an unsustainable condition, suggesting the need for taking into the account also MRF in the future management planning for the Adriatic coastal area.

AB  - Premise of the study: Quantitative measurements of water's effects on the tension response of plant tissue will assist in understanding the regulatory mechanism underlying expansive growth. Such measurements should be multiscale in nature to account for plants' hierarchical structure.
   Methods: Outer onion epidermal tissues were cut and bonded to uniaxial displacement-controlled mechanical loading devices to apply and measure the force on the sample. Fluorescent polystyrene beads (500 nm in diameter) were dispersed on the sample surface under various levels of tensile load conditions to obtain displacement maps with a confocal fluorescent microscope. The resulting strain was measured using a digital image correlation technique by tracking individual bead displacements. The applied forces were obtained by measuring the displacement of the calibrated force-sensing device. Tissue- and cell-scale mechanical properties were quantified by calculating the applied stress and the corresponding global and local strains.
   Key results: The Young's modulus values of individual cell walls of dehydrated and rehydrated samples were 3.0 +/- 1.0 GPa and 0.4 +/- 0.2 GPa, respectively, and are different from the Young's modulus values of the global tissue-scale dehydrated and rehydrated samples, which were 1.9 +/- 0.3 GPa and 0.08 +/- 0.02 GPa, respectively. Poisson's ratio increased more than 3-fold due to hydration.
   Conclusion: The results on global, cell-to-cell, and point-to-point mechanical property variations suggest the importance of the mechanical contribution of extracellular features including the middle lamella, cell shape, and dimension. This study shows that a multiscale investigation is essential for fundamental insights into the hierarchical deformation of biological systems.

AB  - delta N-15 signals in plant and soil material integrate over a number of biogeochemical processes related to nitrogen (N) and therefore provide information on net effects of multiple processes on N dynamics. In general little is known in many grassland restoration projects on soil-plant N dynamics in relation to the restoration treatments. In particular, delta N-15 signals may be a useful tool to assess whether abiotic restoration treatments have produced the desired result. In this study we used the range of abiotic and biotic conditions provided by a restoration experiment to assess to whether the restoration treatments and/or plant functional identity and legume neighborhood affected plant delta N-15 signals. The restoration treatments consisted of hay transfer and topsoil removal, thus representing increasing restoration effort, from no restoration measures, through biotic manipulation to major abiotic manipulation. We measured delta N-15 and %N in six different plant species (two non-legumes and four legumes) across the restoration treatments. We found that restoration treatments were clearly reflected in delta N-15 of the non-legume species, with very depleted delta N-15 associated with low soil N, and our results suggest this may be linked to uptake of ammonium (rather than nitrate). The two non-legume species differed considerably in their delta N-15 signals, which may be related to the two species forming different kinds of mycorrhizal symbioses. Plant delta N-15 signals could clearly separate legumes from non-legumes, but our results did not allow for an assessment of legume neighborhood effects on non-legume delta N-15 signals. We discuss our results in the light of what the delta N-15 signals may be telling us about plant-soil N dynamics and their potential value as an indicator for N dynamics in restoration.

AB  - In the field of sediment quality assessment, increased support has been expressed for using multiple species that represent different taxa, trophic levels, and potential routes of exposure. However, few studies have compared the bioaccumulation potential of various test species over a range of sediment contaminants (hydrophobic organics and metals). As part of the development and standardization of a laboratory bioaccumulation method for the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, the oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus, mayfly nymph Hexagenia spp., and juvenile fathead minnow Pimephales promelas were exposed to a variety of field-contaminated sediments (n = 10) to evaluate their relative effectiveness for accumulating different contaminants (e.g., dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane [DDT] and metabolites, polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans [PCDD/Fs), and heavy metals). Bioaccumulation was usually highest in L. variegatus but. also most variable within and (relative measures) between sediments. Bioaccumulation was similar between L. variegatus and Hexagenia spp. in most of the sediments tested. Significant differences in bioaccumulation between species were observed for DDT, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD), PAHs, and PCDD/Fs. The present study indicates that species-specific differences in bioaccumulation may, but do not always, exist and can vary with contaminant and sediment type. The choice of test species or combination to use in a standard test method may depend on the objectives of the sediment quality assessment and data requirements of an ecological risk assessment. The results of the present study provide insight for selection of test species and validation of laboratory methods for assessing bioaccumulation with these species, as well as valuable information for interpreting results of bioaccumulation tests.

AB  - Populus alba L. var. pyramidalis Bge. (Populus) is a main tree of the farmland shelter-belt system in the arid region of Northwest China. However, soil moisture cannot satisfy the water requirements of normal Populus growth under local natural conditions, thus studying the transpiration characteristics of irrigated Populus and its relationship with the environmental factors and growth parameters is very important to the growth of the trees in this region. In this study, the sap flow of two irrigated Populus trees was measured during May to September from 2005 to 2008 using the heat-pulse technique. The results show that the maximum and minimum daily sap fluxes in Populus were 15.7-24.0 and 3.0-4.0 L day(-1), respectively. And the sum of sap fluxes from June to August accounted for approximately 63-69% of the total sap flux during May to September (almost the whole growing season). The order of the meteorological factors affecting the daily sap flux of Populus was: vapor pressure deficit > solar radiation > mean air temperature > wind speed. Furthermore, a highly linear relationship between the ratio of daily sap flux to the reference evapotranspiration (SF/ET0) and the amount of soil water in the 0-2.0 m layer was found, indicating that the amount of soil water at this layer was quite important to the growth of Populus in this region. Especially, the amount of soil water in the 0.5-1.0 m soil layer contributed to most of the plant transpiration as the highest coefficient of determination at this layer. Based on the environmental factors and leaf area index influencing sap flux, an empirical transpiration model was constructed to estimate daily transpiration.

AB  - When fuelwood is harvested at a rate exceeding natural growth and inefficient conversion technologies are used, negative environmental and socio-economic impacts, such as fuelwood shortages, natural forests degradation and net GHG emissions arise. In this study, we argue that analyzing fuelwood supply/demand spatial patterns require multi-scale approaches to effectively bridge the gap between national results with local situations. The proposed methodology is expected to help 1) focusing resources and actions on local critical situations, starting from national wide analyses and 2) estimating, within statistically robust confidence bounds, the proportion of non-renewable harvested fuelwood. Starting from a previous work, we selected a county-based fuelwood hot spot in the Central Highlands of Mexico, identified from a national wide assessment, and developed a grid-based model in order to identify single localities that face concomitant conditions of high fuelwood consumption and insufficient fuelwood resources. By means of a multicriteria analysis (MCA), twenty localities, out of a total of 90, were identified as critical in terms of six indicators related to fuelwood use and availability of fuelwood resources. Fuelwood supply/demand balances varied among localities from -16.2 +/- 2.5 Gg y(-1) to 4.4 +/- 2.6 Gg y(-1), while fractions of non-renewable fuelwood varied from 0 to 96%. These results support the idea that balances and non-renewable fuelwood fractions (mandatory inputs for Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) cookstoves projects) must be calculated on a locality by locality basis if gross under or over-estimations want to be avoided in the final carbon accounting.

AB  - The most common anthropogenic disturbance on exposed sandy beaches are recreational activities and destruction of sand dunes.To take decisions on manegment of this ecosystems, we must have effective environmental tools, to reduce impacts. The numbers of open burrows of the ghost crab Ocypode quadrata (Fabricius, 1787) should indicate the presence of animals, and in recent years it had been shown that this species is usefull as a tool in rapid assessment of human impacts. To test the hypotesis that anthropogenic impact on sandy beaches reduce the abundance of ghost crabs,the relative abundance (number of burrows/m(2;) N = 60) of the ghost crab O. quadrata were compared in three beaches of Santa Catarina Is.,southern Brazil. In each one of the beaches,low and strong conditions of human impact were selected. Two levels in the intertidal were analysed, lower and upper midlittoral. The samples were taken in winter/2002 and summer/2003. In winter and summer there were significantly fewer burrows on that beaches with the higher levels of impact. Ingleses beach showed the higher abundances of the ghost crab in both winter and summer. In winter and summer there were significantly fewer burrows at Barra da Lagoa beach. In the summer the lower intertidal showed significantly higher abundances of the ghost crab. The results evidenced that Ingleses beach with high recreational impact had more ghost crabs, probably due to the nocturnal behavior and the fortuitous use of the food detritus left in the beach. In the beach with strong impact of cars and fisheries activities there were no ghost crabs. This study discuss the utility of the world-wide genus Ocypode for a rapid assessment tool of human impacts on exposed sandy beaches.

AB  - Nilufer Stream is an important water source in the industrial and metropolitan city of Bursa, Turkey. The stream catchment has been influenced by high human impact. The downstream receives sewage water from households and industry, whereas the headwater of the stream has a source of high-quality drinkable water.
   In this paper, abundances of epipelic diatom taxa, faecal coliforms (FC), total coliforms (TC) and total bacteria ( TB) were studied in relation to measured environmental variables (T, pH, DO, BOD5, EC, TDS) for the period July 1997 to June 1998 at six stations in the heavily polluted Nilufer Stream catchment. It is observed that the physicochemical variables and bacterial abundances varied seasonally at all stations, and the level of pollution reached at its highest point in the summer.
   The results of Kruskal-Wallis and one-way ANOVA indicated that DO gradually decreased, whereas BOD5, EC, TDS, TB, FC and TC gradually increased from upstream to downstream. The ordination method of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was carried out for both biologic and physicochemical variables, and the results were supported by the former statistical procedures.
   The frequency of occurrence of dominant diatoms was examined in relation to the spatial variations in chemical constituents. Both diatoms and bacteria showed strong correlations with the measured physicochemical variables. In Canonical Correlation Analysis (CANCORR) measures of bacterial abundances also displayed strong correlations with abundances of 11 diatom taxa.
   The results showed that the stream catchment is polluted gradually from upstream to downstream. In addition, pollution load in the stream catchment has been gradually increased, compared with recent years. Urbanisation and industrialisation of the city have affected increasing pollution in Nilufer Stream. The results also indicated that diatoms are not affected by environmental variables such as bacteria. Bacteria are more sensitive to organic pollution, while diatoms are indicators of different environmental conditions.

AB  - The area of free radical biology is of increasing interest for marine organisms since the enhanced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a common pathway of toxicity induced by stressful environmental conditions. In polar environments responses of the antioxidant system could be useful as an early detection biomarkers of unforeseen effects of human activities which are progressively increasing in these remote areas. However, the characterization of antioxidant defences in appropriate sentinel species is of particular value also in terms of a possible adaptation to this extreme environment. The scallop, Adamussium colbecki, is a key species for monitoring the Antarctic environment and, besides single antioxidants, the total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC) assay has been recently used for quantifying the overall ability of this organism to neutralize peroxyl radicals (ROO.), hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-.) and peroxynitrite (HOONO). The aim of this work was to obtain a better characterization of these biological responses which can indicate the occurrence of biological disturbance; in this study the total oxyradical scavenging capacity was further analyzed to assess the presence of seasonal fluctuations in the susceptibility to oxidative stress in this species. The capability to neutralize peroxyl radicals and hydroxyl radicals increased at the end of December, while resistance towards peroxynitrite did not show any significant variations during the Antarctic summer. These results suggest the occurrence of metabolic changes which mainly influence intracellular formation of ROO. and .H-O, with more limited effects on HOONO. Despite the limited time window analyzed, as a typical constraint in Antarctic research at Terra Nova Bay, an increased resistance to these specific oxyradicals might be related to the period of highest feeding activity, or to other intrinsic factors in the animals' physiology such as the phase of reproductive cycle.

AB  - Key message Habitat fragmentation influences leaf morphology, quantity and quality of plant resources to herbivores, which in turn affects the patterns of fluctuating asymmetry and herbivory in Quercus deserticola. Forest fragmentation has negative effects on biodiversity by modifying environmental conditions, ecological processes and biotic interactions. We analyzed the effects of forest fragment size and habitat type (forest edge x interior) on the amount of plant resources and their quality for herbivores, leaf morphology, fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and herbivory on Quercus deserticola at the Cuitzeo Basin in Mexico. Six forest fragments, where Q. deserticola occurs were classified as (i) small (<= 10 ha); (ii) medium (>= 25 ha); and (iii) large (>= 65 ha). In each forest fragment, four parallel transects of 5 x 50 m were sampled, two located at the edge and two in the interior of the fragments. Chlorophyll content, leaf area, canopy cover and tree size were greater in small than in larger fragments. Leaves of individuals in small fragments and in forest edges were more elongated and wider than in large and in the interior of fragments. Our results also showed higher levels of FA and insect herbivory in the small fragments and forest edges. Insect herbivory was positively correlated with FA in small forest fragments, indicating that the mechanisms driving their interaction are scale-dependent and vary among habitat types according to fragment size. Our findings do not support the idea that the fluctuating asymmetry is a reliable biomarker to detect environmental stress in Q. deserticola in fragmented habitats, but FA may be a good biomarker of plant stress caused by the amount of herbivory damage.

AB  - The appeal to Russian religious thinkers is relevant due to the fact that modern consumer trends in the development of society have a destructive impact on the human personality. In these conditions, the relevance of moral and anthropological reflections of the past, which were carried out in the Russian religious thought of the 19th century, increases. Dostoevsky's oeuvre goes beyond the boundaries of fiction, it includes a deep philosophical search in social and moral-religious spheres. His literary heroes strive to find meanings that can fill their lives. The writer believed that these meanings can be found in the sphere of Christian consciousness. This was his philosophical path, presented in the figurative sphere of literature. His contemporary Vladimir Solovyov solved the same problem in the field of philosophical theoretical consciousness. Both thinkers pointed to the primacy of the moral sense for a person, which is later comprehended in moral philosophy. Solovyov calls shame, pity (altruism), and reverence the fundamental manifestations of morality. Religion does not generate moral principles, but gives them expression. The thinkers point to the active nature of moral meanings manifested both in individual and social behavior of a person. In Dostoevsky's works, the actions of the heroes are determined by their moral experiences. Solovyov points to the limitations of abstract subjectivism in morality and to the moral progress of society as an indicator of its historical development. It is important for Solovyov to consider the manifestation of moral principles in human economic activity, which, as he believed, should also be an organized realization of good. The philosophical heritage of Russian thinkers remains significant for the modern secular consciousness, which is looking for the roots of morality in symbolic behavior programs set by culture. In this context, morality appears as a fundamental culture-species program that consolidates the human community as a global cultural and biological species.

AB  - Visualization of NAPLs in multiphase systems in porous media is important for determining contaminant transport in the environment. In this study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to confirm the recent observations of mobilisation of a light non aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) trapped in wet sand under natural drying conditions of the wet porous medium. Visualization of LNAPL (motor oil) and water mobility during the drying of wet glass beads (0.5 mm) in a cylindrical glass column (15 mm ID, 45 mm long) was obtained using spin echo-based NMR microimaging performed at 500 MHz, corresponding to a field of ca. 11.75 T. Sagittal and axial images of LNAPL and water in the porous medium were obtained at a spatial resolution of 59 mu m/pixel at different time intervals. A rise of 15-20 mm was observed in the presence of evaporation of water as compared to a 2-3 mm rise in the absence of evaporation in a time span of about 1400 min. The spatio-temporal MRI scans of the water and LNAPL in the glass column reveals that LNAPL rise occurs when the water evaporation front reaches the LNAPL layer. This implied that the enhanced LNAPL rise was strongly linked to the process of water evaporation. A linear correlation of the MRI signal intensities of LNAPL and water with reference to different saturation levels of LNAPL and water in the porous media was obtained. This calibration information was used to quantify the saturation levels of the LNAPL and water during the drying process. These findings show the application of non-invasive techniques such as MRI in quantifying and understanding the mechanism of fate and transport of LNAPLs in porous media, towards effective environmental quality assessment.

AB  - In plant communities, changes in composition driven by the dominance of weed species have been used as ecological indicators to predict the anthropic impacts on these species. Nevertheless, anthropic disturbances do not act directly on species composition, but their effects depend on the species' functional responses. Hence, anthropic effects follow a logical sequence, in which disturbances act at different levels. In order to understand the sequence of the changes in the community there is a need to develop functional and compositional integrated indicators. In order to integrate them we suggest a method based on inference by abduction, to reduce the complexity in predicting the anthropic effects on species functional responses. With this method we develop functional indicators of responses to anthropic disturbances and the effect on composition changes. The method involves building structural equation models (SEMs), through which we evaluate the anthropic and environmental effects on the functional response of species and composition changes in an integral way. From these causal paths, we select the best-fitting model with plausible functional indicators to explain the anthropic effects, according to Akaikes information criterion (AIC). This research develops a methodological proposal to build up functional indicators with foliar attributes associated to resource acquisition and use strategies of herb and shrub species in the temperate Abies religiosa forest in the Magdalena river basin in Mexico City. The built indicators demonstrate for the first time and in a simultaneous way, that characteristic species (original component) and native weeds (component established under perturbation conditions) have different responses to anthropic perturbations as well as different contributions to community composition changes. This result represents a methodological contribution in the evaluation of anthropic impacts and the use of native weed species as functional indicators.

AB  - Dam sedimentation is a crucial issue that interferes with flood control and electric power generation. To address this, sediment dredging, bypass tunnel, flushing, and sluicing have been applied. Despite the potential impacts of these operations on stream environments, few studies have explored the environmental/ecological consequences of such regime shifts in sediment dynamics. Specifically, impacts of sediment sluicing on stream fauna have never been reported. This study assessed primary impacts of sediment sluicing events operated with the two cascade dams (the Saigo and Ouchibaru Dams) on stream insects in the lower Mimi River, Japan. The sediment sluicing, accompanied by a major flooding event in the river, was first operated in September 2017. Stream insect data downstream of the four cascade dams, including the two sluicing dams and a reference river, were collected yearly or biyearly in winter and summer from 2010 to 2018. Following the initiation of retrofitting the Saigo Dam for optimizing sediment sluicing, a downstream reach of the dam experienced marked perturbations in terms of both individual density and species richness. The density and richness dramatically decreased and the community significantly differed in winter 2017 from pre-impact conditions. The density, richness, and community composition subsequently recovered in winter 2018, even after the sediment sluicing impact, suggesting that the anticipated negative ecological impacts of the sluicing are limited. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and permutational multivariate analysis of variance revealed distinct differences in communities between summer and winter samples at non-regulated sites or sites farther downstream of the dam that are characterized by fewer Simuliidae in summer and relatively abundant Heptageniidae. This could serve as a reference for assessments of ecological consequences of sediment sluicing in the region.

AB  - Architectural limestone surfaces are particularly susceptible to decay from natural and anthropogenic acidifying gases and particulates. This investigation evaluates environmental conditions, air quality, and decay patters on Istria stone surfaces of four palaces in Venice (Italy): Ca' Bembo, Ca' Bottacin, Ca' Foscari, Ca' Dolfin. Climate parameters and air quality indicators are used to discuss the atmospheric influence on limestone and to calculate the related theoretical recession rate. Graphic assessment, surface profiling, digital microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and x-ray fluorescence are used to assess stone surface textures and degradation patterns associated with stone decay. The morphological analysis via surface profiling using silicon mould, digitization and statistical analysis of the roughness is proposed for the assessment of stone deterioration. In particular, the methodology is used for understanding stone morphological variations in relation to parameters such as sites, exposure (sheltered or exposed area), and location (overlooking a Canal or inner court).
   In relation to increasing rain amount and intensity, decreasing SO2 and increasing NOx concentrations, theoretical limestone recession rate compatible with an urban environment (around 8 mu m/year) are calculated. The morphological analysis of the sites evidences the role of the stone original texture and finish, the facade location and the specific exposure on the formation of crusts or eroded area. Buildings not recently restored (Ca' Bottacin and Ca' Bembo) present thick dendritic crusts, in particular on court side and in sheltered positions. Ca' Foscari surfaces, subjected to cleaning intervention after 2000s, show thin grey crust only in sheltered areas, reflecting the reduced presence of SO2. Large eroded areas have been found on exposed surfaces in relation to the rain wash-out action and to high levels of NOx.

AB  - A series of peat monoliths was collected from Hjalmarvik, Kuoa and Baegistaoir, three abandoned farm sites located on a transect extending from the coast to 18km inland in the Svalbarostunga region (northeastern Iceland) in order to document the impact of human occupation and patterns of land use on landscape change and vegetation. Svalbarostunga is of considerable interest because of the geographical and ecological features that distinguish it from other regions of Iceland, in particular by the more direct influence of the cold East Greenland Current (EGC). Plant and insect macrofossils and diatoms identified in peat monoliths provided proxy indicators of human settlement and land use that in some cases corroborate, and in others expand upon, existing archaeological and historical dates. Based on the presence of ecofacts (calcined bones, fish bones and charcoal), synanthropic insects and some anthropogenic plant-indicators (e.g. weeds), we showed that there was a consistent occupation and use of the coastal site of Hjalmarvik since AD 970. At Kuoa, the scenario is quite different. Two periods of occupation or land use were identified: from prior to c. AD 960 to 1190 and from c. AD 1650 to 1870. In the 15th and into the 16th centuries, the decrease in the deposition of traces of fuel wastes around the inland farm sites (Kuoa and Baegistaoir) suggests that they were used much less frequently. The decline of such proxies for human occupation occurred shortly before the occurrence of the coldest conditions from the 16th to the 17th centuries as well as prior to the V1477 eruption, suggesting that these natural factors may not have been the primary or unique driver of changing modes of tenancy. A scenario of famine-related depopulation would have played a significant role in this decrease in the human impact on vegetation.

AB  - Sedentary and mobile organisms grow profusely on hard substrates within the coastal zone and contribute to the deterioration of coastal engineering structures and the geomorphic evolution of rocky shores by both enhancing and retarding weathering and erosion. There is a lack of quantitative evidence for the direction and magnitude of these effects. This study assesses the influence of globally-abundant intertidal organisms, barnacles, by measuring the response of limestone, granite and marine-grade concrete colonised with varying percentage covers of Chthamalus spp. under simulated, temperate intertidal conditions. Temperature regimes at 5 and 10 mm below the surface of each material demonstrated a consistent and statistically significant negative relationship between barnacle abundance and indicators of thermal breakdown. With a 95% cover of barnacles, subsurface peak temperatures were reduced by 1.59 degrees C for limestone, 5.54 degrees C for concrete and 5.97 degrees C for granite in comparison to no barnacle cover. The amplitudes of short-term (15-30 min) thermal fluctuations conducive to breakdown via 'fatigue effects were also buffered by 0.70 degrees C in limestone, 1.50 degrees C in concrete and 1.63 degrees C in granite. Furthermore, concentrations of potentially damaging salt ions were consistently lower under barnacles in limestone and concrete. These results indicate that barnacles do not enhance, but likely reduce rates of mechanical breakdown on rock and concrete by buffering near-surface thermal cycling and reducing salt ion ingress. In these ways, we highlight the potential role of barnacles as agents of bioprotection. These findings support growing international efforts to enhance the ecological value of hard coastal structures by facilitating their colonisation (where appropriate) through design interventions.

AB  - Epiphytic lichen and bryophyte Floristic Richness (FR) and distribution were investigated in Lisbon and the adjacent southern riverbank, in the centre-west of Portugal within the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (LMA). Field studies were carried out in the years 2010-2011 to replicate research conducted 30 years ago in 1980-1981.
   Compared to previous surveys, we confirm that the overall environmental condition has largely improved, with higher epiphyte richness. The two areas have been recolonized during the last 30 years by sensitive species mainly due to changes in SO2 levels. However, the traffic-related NO2 and dust deposition have become the main pollutants and the increase of nitrophilous and saxicolous/terricolous taxa reflects this influence. But, besides air pollution, the important variable affecting the epiphytic flora of LMA, currently updated to more than 200 taxa, is the influence of arborisation system type, road type and road proximity of the new surveys, in addition to urbanization (calculated in an Index of Human Impact - IHI).
   According to their current epiphyte diversity, with Floristic Richness (RF) ranging from 4 to more than 90 taxa (lichens and bryophytes), five zones were identified in LMA and related with air quality.
   As a conclusion, significant changes in the Floristic Richness (FR) were observed over the past 30 years, not only the value but also the spatial pattern which differs greatly between the two areas, linked significantly with air quality and other human influences.
   Due to the few number of available air quality monitoring stations, in particularly for NO2 values, the important contributions of epiphytic flora in defining the distribution range and spatial patterns of urban disturbance imply that FR may be a practical and useful indicator of air quality in LMA.

AB  - Dune plants both modify the wind field around them and are impacted by various stress factors, among them sand erosion and sand deposition. As coastal dunes are being either stabilized or remobilized, in response to the changes in the rates of sand and dune movement, the vegetation cover and composition are expected to vary reflecting the differences in the sedimentary conditions. In this field study 315 quadrats of 100 m(2), in which the perennial plant species were sampled, were analysed with respect to annual rates of sand erosion and deposition that were measured using erosion pins. A visual exploratory data analysis was introduced, based on selective filtering of samples according to their vegetation cover. This method, combined with established statistical tools, enabled the authors to uncover the inclination and indicative power of nine perennial dune plants to either a stabilized or a mobile environment, and to establish whether they are more prevalent in places undergoing sand erosion or sand burial. Two species were found to be clear indicators of a stabilized environment, Stipagrostis lanata, and Retama raetam. Of the species indicating a mobile environment, only one may be stated as a clear indicator of sand erosion: Silene succulenta, with Cyperus macrorrhizus coming close to being an indicator of a less mobile erosive environment. The best indicator species for sand burial was found to be, as expected, Ammophila arenaria, with Artemisia monosperma also indicating high rates of sand mobility especially when its relative cover is higher than 80%. Such information can be used to monitor natural processes of dune stabilization or reactivation, or to assess the success of a management plan that aims at stabilizing a dune, or at remobilizing it by removing vegetation.

AB  - Intertidal organisms are often assumed to live close to their thermal limits, and have emerged as potential early indicators of the effects of climate change. We compared our survey of the 2004-2006 geographic distribution of the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides to its distribution in 1872, 1955, 1963, 1971, and 1985, from surveys by Fischer, Crisp, Fischer-Piette, Barnes, Powell, and Southward. The southern geographic limit has retreated 300 km in France since 1872, at a rate of 15 to 50 km per decade. We compared our 2006 survey of the geographic distribution of the polychaete Diopatra neapolitana to its distribution in 1893-1923, from surveys by Saint-Joseph and Fauvel, and its distribution in 1969-1976 from surveys by Glemarec. The northern geographic limit of this species has advanced 300 km in France since 1893 at similar rates to Semibalanus. We used NOAA weather reanalysis data and our mechanistic simulation model of intertidal animal body temperatures to hindcast the thermal environmental change near historical geographic limits in Europe for the past 55 years. Results indicate that changes in the southern limit of S. balanoides are due to intolerance of winter body temperatures above 10 degrees C, leading to reproductive failure. Results for Diopatra are ambiguous: based on the northern extension of its range, either cold winters or cool summers limit its range, while gaps in its distribution are consistent with limitation by cooler summer conditions. The parallel shifts of D. neapolitana on sedimentary shores and Semibalanus on rocky shores suggest that similar climatic factors control the geographic limits of both species. The intertidal zone is a model system for examining the effects of climate change on biogeographic change both because of the rapidity of its response, and because the rich historical record allows direct tests of hypotheses.

AB  - This study provides the first assessment of carabid beetle diversity in a natural forest context that encompasses a complete black spruce (Picea mariana) natural succession. Boreal forest conservation has been based on several assumptions about forest age that only consider species richness without accounting for species composition. It has also been guided by studies of incomplete chronologies that do not include naturally burned or old-growth stages. Twenty-one forest stands of different ages following fire - from recently burned to old-growth stages (0-340 years of age) - were sampled, revealing a strong relationship between age of forest and diversity of Carabidae. Over time, species richness followed a parabolic U-shaped pattern both with observed (Obs) and predicted richness (ACE). Chronological clustering identified four groups of species in the succession: the 'burned' group characterized 0-2-year-old forests, 'regenerating' (21-58 year), 'mature' (70-170 year) and 'old-growth' (177-340 year). The time spans corresponding to each of these assemblages lengthen with age of forest at an exponential rate. Ward's and K-means (clustering without constraint) provided support for the four assemblages but showed variation between individual successions, particularly for the 'regenerating' assemblage, identified as the most heterogeneous. The IndVal method identified characteristic species in every stage of the succession, particularly Sericoda spp. in the burned stage and Dromius piceus and Platynus mannerheinmii associated with old-growth stands. The results obtained here show that diversity of Carabidae varies in primeval conditions according to age of forest and such variation should be taken into account when conservation issues are involved.

AB  - Organisms in aquatic ecosystems must often tolerate variable environmental conditions, including an uncertain risk of predation. Individuals that can maintain plastic defenses against predation will increase their survival when predators are present, but Will not incur the costs of these defenses when the risk of predation is low and the defense is not induced. Larvae of the pond-breeding anuran Hyla chrysoscelis develop a conspicuous phenotype in the presence of predators consisting of a brightly colored tail and a deeper tail fin. In this study, I attempted to identify the Source of the chemical signal that induces this defensive morphology in this species. I tested whether metabolites alone, originating from the prey but passing through the predator, were able to induce the same morphological response as the combination of alarm signals released directly by attacked conspecifics, and metabolites. I used morphometric and tail conspicuousness data to assess tadpole response to the perceived risk of predation by larval odonate predators (Anax junius). I also tested whether this inducing cue could be recognized across species by measuring the morphological response of H. chrysoscelis tadpoles exposed to cues emitted when tadpoles of a closely related genus (Pseudacris crucifer) were consumed. Tadpoles exhibited a clean morphology in response to all cues corresponding to their relative reliability as indicators of a risk of predation. H. chrysoscelis tadpoles were also able to respond to cues emitted when tadpoles of a closely related genus were consumed by predators. These results illustrate that tadpoles of this species are able to respond to metabolites alone without alarm signals, and that interspecific chemical communication is a primary mechanism for predator avoidance in this inducible defense system.

AB  - We analyzed how near-surface zooplankton are distributed in the northern California Current, not only in space and time but also with reference to species assemblages, habitat characteristics, and environmental factors. The community structure, spatial distribution patterns, and environmental associations of near-surface zooplankton from June and August 2000 GLOBEC cruises were examined. Crab megalopae, hyperiid amphipods, euphausiids, and chaetognaths dominated the near-surface zooplankton community during both cruises. A geostatistical approach was used to deter-mine that near-surface zooplankton concentrations differed spatially and quantitatively between June and August. Near-surface zooplankton concentration was spatially patchy during June, with the highest levels occurring nearshore in various locations throughout the study region. In August, zooplankton concentration was more uniformly distributed; however, higher concentrations were observed north of Cape Blanco. During June, zooplankton species richness was spatially patchy, whereas in August, species richness was more uniformly distributed throughout the study area. Highest values were observed during June in localized areas along the coast, with lowest values observed further offshore near the shelf break at 200 m. During August, species richness was highest nearshore south of Cape Blanco; yet in the north, higher values extended across the shelf and further offshore. To explore patterns in community structure, we applied cluster analysis, indicator species analysis, and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination to both data sets. Cluster analyses differentiated taxa by inshore and offshore location in the first division and by latitude in the second division. Results from NMS confirmed the cross-shelf zonation of near-surface zooplankton, with seasurface temperature the most consistent environmental parameter explaining the distributions. An offshore assemblage of zooplankton was entrained in an eddy and transported onto the shelf in August. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A new liquid chromatographic (LC) method with automated on-line solid phase extraction was developed to determine caffeine at sub-microgram per litre concentrations in waters. The filtered sample was pre-concentrated in a pre-column, which was backwashed with acidic water at pH of 2.70. The concentrated caffeine was separated using a C-18 column with a gradient of water-acetonitrile and detected by diode array detection (DAD) at 210 nm. Four different pre-columns: C18, PRP-1, PLRP-s and Env were evaluated for the on-line solid phase extraction of caffeine. The PLRPs pre-column allowed the enrichment of up to 100mL of environmental water sample with highest recovery. The procedure was validated by recovery experiments in water spiked at 0.5 1.0 and 4.0 mug/L. Average recoveries were between 92.1 +/- 5.2% and 97.8 +/- 2.6%. Detection limits as low as 0.1 mug/L from 50 ml of sample were achieved. The proposed method has the advantages of higher reliability and sensitivity, simpler sample preparation and shorter analysis time in comparison with off-line solid-phase extraction. The utility of the method was demonstrated at two field sites: Bolivar and Halls Head (Australia). At Bolivar, the treatment process included 6-week lagoon storage which is believed to have attenuated caffeine, and thus limited its use as an environmental tracer of reclaimed water. At the Halls Head site, where the storage period is shorter, caffeine was detected in both the treated sewage effluent and in groundwater near ponds where the reclaimed water is at similar concentrations. These results suggest that the environmental conditions under which caffeine is conservative require better definition. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Knowledge of changes in marine primary productivity and export production in high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll regions of the subarctic NW Pacific Ocean is vital for understanding glacial-interglacial pCO(2) variations induced by the biological pump mechanism. We conducted a multi-proxy of geochemical and biological productivity study of sedimentary core LV63-4-2, from the subarctic NW Pacific Ocean, spanning the last similar to 230 kyr (since similar to MIS 7). The measurements included total organic carbon (TOC), opal, biogenic barium, and CaCO3 content as indicators of biological productivity; and the stable carbon isotope composition of TOC and trace elemental abundances to indicate sources of organic matter and redox conditions. The results reveal cyclic changes in paleoproductivity, with higher export production corresponding to periods of low Earth orbital obliquity and high winter insolation. Opal accumulation in core LV63-4-2 was higher during MIS 7, MIS 5d, and MIS 4, which differs from records from the Bering Sea, Okhotsk Sea, and the region to the south of the site LV63-4-2, but it is consistent with records from the Gulf of Alaska. We suggest that export production in the region is controlled by the combined effects of regional vertical convection associated with the formation of North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW), and the local iron supply sourced from the Gulf of Alaska. High export production is promoted by the coupling of weakened NPIW formation and an increased iron supply caused by enhanced upwelling in the Gulf of Alaska due to a strengthened Aleutian Low during warmer winters. By contrast, stronger NPIW formation dominated reduced export production during MIS 6 and MIS 2, despite an increased iron supply. Our results highlight the heterogeneity of export production in the subarctic North Pacific and the significant role of the local environment on productivity.

AB  - Lightning matters to human life and natural fires so much that monitoring and predicting lightning are highly important. A simple proxy for climatic cloud-to-ground (CG) density is evaluated defined as the product of convective available potential energy (CAPE) and precipitation rate using data from 2005 to 2017 in Sichuan of Southwest China. CAPE times precipitation rate (CP) relates the monthly distribution and magnitude of negative lightning in the basin region more closely, while CP describes the monthly distribution and magnitude of positive lightning in the plateau region more appropriately. Except for individual years, the annual variation trend and magnitude of CP and positive and negative lightning are relatively consistent in the basin region, while the description of the annual variation trend and magnitude of lightning by CP in the plateau region is insufficient, especially for negative lightning. CP represents the high-value areas of the positive and negative lightning in the basin and southern Sichuan reasonably, but misses the lightning belt in the plateau region. In general, the performance of CP for lightning in the basin is superior to that in the plateau, this may be caused by two factors, one is the particularity and complexity of lightning in the plateau resulted from special topographic and meteorological conditions, the other one is the limitation of CP caused by the fact that CP does not take into account other environmental factors contributing to lightning. The ability of this simple proxy to describe CG lightning in Sichuan is limited by vertical wind shear in the middle and lower troposphere, zero degree height, and liquid water path, mainly because the proxy does not have the ability to generalize these factors that play a key role in lightning activity.

AB  - Heat stability (HS) is substantial technology property of raw milk. Analysis of sources of HS variation and its regular monitoring can contribute to creating higher added value in the dairy industry. The goal of this analysis was to assess the practice sources of raw cow milk HS variability on the results of an extensive data set of bulk tank milk samples. There was implemented neither a compositional technology modification nor acidity adjustment of milk, just original raw milk was used for the analysis. A total 2634 HS analyses were performed, including other milk indicators, during three years of an experimental period. The log HS mean and standard deviation were 1.273654 +/- 0.144189, equal to the HS geometric mean of 18.8 min. Explanation of the HS variability through the linear model used was 41.1% (p < 0.0001). According to the results of the variance analysis, the milk HS was influenced (p = 0.0033 and mostly <0.0001) by all the farm factors such as year; season; calendar month; altitude; total annual rainfall; herd size by the number of cows; milk yield; cow breed; type of milking; litter type in the stable; summer grazing application; farm effect. During the calendar months (p < 0.0001), milk HS values suggest similar seasonal dynamics with the somatic cell count, total count of mesophilic microorganisms, coli bacteria count and urea and lactose concentration and opposite configuration pattern to fat, crude protein, solids-not-fat and total solids content and milk freezing point depression. Here performed quantification of these effects by analyzing the variance may allow efficient raw milk selection to be processed into specific dairy products.

AB  - Monitoring seabird diet can provide insights into marine ecosystems that are logistically difficult or costly to observe with traditional fisheries survey methods. Using digital photography, we described the diet of greater crested terns (Thalasseus bergii) breeding on Montague Island (36 degrees 15' S, 150 degrees 13' E), a colony located in an oceanographically dynamic region of southeast Australia. We investigated how the type and size of prey brought back to the colony changed in relation to both breeding stage and variation in local environmental conditions. 2469 prey items were identified to species or family level over 35 consecutive days of photo-sampling in 2018. Australian anchovy (Engraulis australis), a surface-schooling clupeid fish, was the most abundant prey returned to the colony during all breeding stages (84.5%). The proportion of anchovy increased from 77.0% when birds were provisioning their adult partners during incubation, to 92.4% when they were provisioning chicks, suggesting selective foraging behaviour on this energy-rich species to facilitate rapid chick growth. Anchovy size was significantly larger during incubation (91.1 +/- 14.9 mm), smaller during early chick provisioning (71.8 +/- 11.0 mm), and increased slightly during mid provisioning (79.6 +/- 11.9 mm), indicating adaptive prey selection that is matched to the physical requirements of different breeding stages. The proportion of anchovy prey was also influenced by sea surface temperature (SST), with anchovy becoming more dominant with increasing local SSTs, up to similar to 17.5 degrees C. This study gives new insight into the types of prey that are seasonally available to predators in this region. The strong specialisation by greater crested terns for one energy-rich species of schooling fish (anchovy) suggests that variation in the size and composition of their prey may serve as an indicator of change in the pelagic ecosystem off southeast Australia.

AB  - Drylands count among the most globally extensive biomes, and while many desert and dry rangeland ecosystems are under threat, genetic structures of dryland species are still rarely studied. Artemisia frigida is one of the most widely distributed plant species in the temperate rangelands of Eurasia and North America, and it also dominates in many habitats of Mongolia due to its tolerance to low temperatures, drought and disturbance. Local environmental conditions and grazing pressure can influence species performance and affect spatial patterns of genetic diversity in contrasting ways, and our study set out to evaluate such effects on the genetic diversity and structure of A. frigida. We first developed new species-specific Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) markers using whole genome sequencing. We then analysed 11 populations of A. frigida that had been sampled along a large climatic gradient in Mongolia, which were sub-structured according to three levels of grazing intensity. Estimates of genetic diversity at the population level were high (H-O = 0.56, H-E = 0.73) and tended to increase with higher precipitation and soil nutrient availability. Grazing had no effect on genetic diversity, however, a high number of grazing-specific indicator alleles was found at grazed sites. Genetic differentiation among populations was extremely low (global G(ST) = 0.034). Analysis of Molecular Variance revealed 5% variance between populations along the climatic gradient, with 3% of the variance being partitioned among different grazing intensity levels. We found no relationship between geographic and genetic distances, and thus no isolation by distance in this widely distributed species. The relatively low genetic structuring suggests that considerable gene flow exists among A. frigida populations across the rangelands of Mongolia, in spite of the pervasive grazing in the region.

AB  - The purpose of the research was to identify the factors determining the improvement of the sustainable energy management strategy in the process of building lasting value for stakeholders, identifying key activities supporting the process of improving the sustainable energy management strategy, and analyzing the degree of use of environmental indicators by organizations in Poland. In the research process, to achieve the assumed research goals, it was decided to use the following research methods: The "Delphic Method" and the CAWI method (Computer-Assisted Web Interview). The research was carried out on a sample of 102 organizations in Poland. The study identifies goals for the sustainable development of the organization, activities supporting the process of sustainable energy management, and indicators in the field of energy management. The key factors for the improvement of energy management strategies have been identified, including implementation of modern technologies, reduction of energy consumption, development of procedures, increase of employee awareness, and clearly defined goals in the field of energy management. The strategy of the organization's future actions towards achieving sustainable development determines the process of creating value for stakeholders. Dialogue with stakeholders is one of the basic conditions for proper planning and implementation of the organization's strategy and taking actions in the field of sustainable energy management. Effective energy management becomes a necessity. Organizations must take a number of steps to achieve maximum resource efficiency. This can only be achieved through a holistic approach to the process of formulating the goals of the organization, which is necessary in decision-making processes and in the approach to energy management. The Polish economy has been built on coal and other fossil fuels. So far, the majority of polish organizations have not cared about the natural environment and energy management, which is why the research on redefining their strategies is a novelty.

AB  - Ceratophyllum demersum, an ubiquitous submerged aquatic plant, was tested as a passive bioindicator of trace metal pollution. The content and bioaccumulation ability of the wide range of trace metals (Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Li, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Rb, Ti, V and Zn) in this species growing in areas with different type and intensity of anthropogenic activity was analyzed and a synthetic pollution index was calculated to assess the level and spatial distribution of trace metal contamination. The results of Bioaccumulation Factor exceeding index of 103 for Ba, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Rb and Zn showed considerably high trace metal uptake ability of C. demersum and makes it a good metal accumulator. Moreover, multivariate statistics of trace metal content in C. demersum and the Nemerow Pollution Index allowed to indicate the type of land use in the surrounding of reservoirs: recreational; urban and agricultural; or urban with direct impact of industrial pollution. Plants growing in areas with agriculture, intensive housing and vehicle traffic contained significantly more Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Li, Mn, Ni, Pb, Rb, Ti, V and Zn than plants from recreational areas, while the industrial areas distinguished from other urban areas by particularly high content of Li and Ti. The differences in level of pollution between study sites were highlighted by the Nemerow Pollution Index, which was proved to indicate silimar gradient of pollution for water and plants. Therefore, we concluded that the NPI could be a recommended tool helping to analyse ecological condition of the environment and C. demersum may be utilized as a relevant biomonitor of trace metal pollution in areas with diversified and multifactor man-made influence.

AB  - Background: Synthetic organism-based biotechnologies are increasingly being proposed for environmental applications, such as in situ sensing. Typically, the novel function of these organisms is delivered by compiling genetic fragments in the genome of a chassis organism. To behave predictably, these chassis are designed with reduced genomes that minimize biological complexity. However, in these proposed applications it is expected that even when contained within a device, organisms will be exposed to fluctuating, often stressful, conditions and it is not clear whether their genomes will retain stability.
   Results: Here we employed a chemostat design which enabled us to maintained two strains of E. coli K12 under sustained starvation stress: first the reduced genome synthetic biology chassis MDS42 and then, the control parent strain MG1655. We estimated mutation rates and utilised them as indicators of an increase in genome instability. We show that within 24 h the spontaneous mutation rate had increased similarly in both strains, destabilizing the genomes. High rates were maintained for the duration of the experiment. Growth rates of a cohort of randomly sampled mutants from both strains were utilized as a proxy for emerging phenotypic, and by association genetic variation. Mutant growth rates were consistently less than rates in non-mutants, an indicator of reduced fitness and the presence of mildly deleterious mutations in both the strains. In addition, the effect of these mutations on the populations as a whole varied by strain.
   Conclusions: Overall, this study shows that genome reductions in the MDS42 did not stabilize the chassis under metabolic stress. Over time, this could compromise the effectiveness of synthetic organisms built on chassis in environmental applications.

AB  - The fire hazards induced by the spontaneous combustion of sulphide ores pose safety, environmental, and economic concerns to the mining and metallurgical industries and have become one of the most important problems in mining, particularly when sulphide ores have to be stored for a long time or transported for a long distance. The first purpose of this paper is the selection of a suitable detection indicator for running through the entire process of spontaneous combustion from oxidation to fire and accurately determining the position of the fire source of the spontaneous combustion of sulphide ore stockpiles at an early stage. We conducted on-site and laboratory experiments by using five indices to assess the oxidation characteristics of sulphide ores. Experimental results show that the change of surface temperature on sulphide ore stockpiles could indirectly reflect the nature of sulphide ore oxidation and is closely related to the various stages of spontaneous combustion. On the basis of the temperature anomaly analyses and infrared thermal imaging technology, a new fire source detection method, which can monitor the highest temperature point on the surface of self-igniting ores, was proposed. The investigation result shows that the maximum temperature differences are 0,5; 0,16 and 0,04 degrees C at the detection depths of 2, 3, and 5 m, respectively, and a scope of 1 x 1 m when close to the self-ignition duration. Under the same condition, the maximum temperature differences are 1,39; 0,53 and 0,14 degrees C at a scope of 2 x 2 m. Therefore, the infrared thermal imaging system with a sufficiently high accuracy can be used to measure the temperature differences on the surface of ore stockpiles, thus resulting in the determination of fire source position.

AB  - AimOur understanding of potential ranges for native and non-native species is often based on their current geographic distributions. Non-native species have had less time than co-occurring native species to expand their ranges following introduction, so non-native ranges may under-represent suitable conditions. Therefore it is often assumed that species distribution models will predict disproportionately smaller potential ranges for non-natives than natives. We compare the distributions of native, endemic, alien and invasive plants to determine how the different range attributes of these groups might influence ecological forecasting.
   LocationContinental USA.
   MethodsWe compared the geographic ranges of 13,575 plant species (9402 native, 2397 endemic, 1201 alien and 755 invasive) using (1) US only and (2) global distribution data from herbarium records. We calculated US longitudinal and latitudinal range extents as potential indicators of range-limiting factors, modelled potential range based on climate using principal components analysis, and calculated occupancy of potential ranges (range infilling).
   ResultsContrary to expectations, modelled potential ranges were significantly larger for non-natives than natives, even for species with few occurrences. Distributions of native species, not invasive species, appeared strongly limited longitudinally. However, invasive plants occupied substantially less area within their climatically suitable ranges than native plants (lower range infilling).
   Main conclusionsInvasive plant distributions were consistently broader, both climatically and geographically, than comparable native species. This suggests that invasive plant distribution models at regional scales are not underpredicting potential ranges relative to models for native species. In contrast, the comparatively limited longitudinal ranges of native species suggest a high degree of non-climatic limitation, which is likely to cause distribution models to underpredict the potential ranges of native species. Invasive plants have not achieved the degree of range infilling expected relative to natives. Thus, plants introduced to the US still have plenty of space to invade.

AB  - Soil quality indicators are measurable soil attributes that reveal the soil productivity response or soil-environment functionality that are used to know whether soil quality is improving, remain constant, or declining. These characteristics could be assessed by different indices such as sustainability index approach (SI) based on the threshold levels of soil indicators and cumulative rating approach (CR) based on crop production limitations, which show the sustainability of soil ecosystem in terms of soil degradation. Since Iran is situated in arid and semi-arid climatic conditions, this research was conducted in agriculture fields of southeast of Mashhad, Iran for comparing these two approaches. Sixty three soil samples (0-30 cm) were collected and nine soil properties such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), soil organic carbon (SOC), soil particle-size distribution, available water holding capacity (AWHC), bulk density (BD), air capacity (AC), relative field capacity (RFC) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) were measured. All these measurements were considered as total data set (TDS). Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to select more effective indicators to conform the minimum data set (MDS). There was a strong correlation between SI and CR (R-2=0.69, p <0.05). Only six soil indicators selected as MDS (pH, SOC, AWC, BD and SAR) were correlated (p<0.01) significantly with SI and CR. These SI and CR results showed more promising effects on soil sustainability. PCA was found a suitable method for selecting the more effective indicators having R-2=0.77 (p <0.05) (CR-MDS versus CR-TDS) comparable with R-2=0.80 (p <0.05) (CR-MDS versus SI) to use less soil data input in assessing soil quality in arid zone.

AB  - Optimal control models of biological movements are used to account for those internal variables that constrain voluntary goal-directed actions. They, however, do not take into account external environmental constraints as those associated to social intention. We investigated here the effects of the social context on kinematic characteristics of sequential actions consisting in placing an object on an initial pad (preparatory action) before reaching and grasping as fast as possible the object to move it to another location (main action). Reach-to-grasp actions were performed either in an isolated condition or in the presence of a partner (audience effect), located in the near or far space (effect of shared reachable space), and who could intervene on the object in a systematic fashion (effect of social intention effect) or not (effect of social uncertainty). Results showed an absence of audience effect but nevertheless an influence of the social context both on the main and the preparatory actions. In particular, a "localized" effect of shared reachable space was observed on the main action, which was smoother when performed within the reachable space of the partner. Furthermore, a "global" effect of social uncertainty was observed on both actions with faster and jerkier movements. Finally, social intention affected the preparatory action with higher wrist displacements and slower movements when the object was placed for the partner rather than placed for self-use. Overall, these results demonstrate specific effects of action space, social uncertainty and social intention on the planning of reachto-grasp actions, in particular on the preparatory action, which was performed with no specific execution constraint. These findings underline the importance of considering the social context in optimal models of action control for human robot interactions, in particular when focusing on the implementation of motor parameters required to afford intuitive interactions.

AB  - This study defines criteria for the use of benthic foraminifera (protists) as a quick and efficient biomonitoring tool to implement marine legislation. Various sampling and preparation procedures are investigated in an attempt to find the optimal methodology for environmental monitoring using soft-sediment foraminifera with the objective of assessing ecological quality status (EcoQS). Twenty-seven sampling stations in silled basins along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast, NE North Sea, are investigated for environmental parameters and living (stained, including soft-shelled forms) and dead benthic foraminifera. Diversity, expressed as the effective number of species (exp H'(bc)) and community composition are used to evaluate EcoQS using living (stained) benthic foraminifera. Correlation studies show that bottom-water dissolved oxygen concentration at the time of sampling ([O-2](tos)) is the main environmental factor controlling variation in diversity. Variables such as grain size, C/N, TOC and TN are less important. Correlation between foraminiferal diversity and [O-2](tos), as well as correlation between community data and [O-2](tos), suggest that benthic foraminifera represent an efficient bio-monitoring tool to evaluate EcoQS. A clear pattern from "bad" to "high" EcoQS is established using the strong link between the benthic foraminiferal diversity and the bottom-water oxygen gradient. The study shows that EcoQS can be evaluated quickly and accurately using the following method: sample the top 1 cm of sediment, dry-pick about 250 living (stained) individuals of >125 mu m-sized fossilisable (i.e. most of those remaining subsequent to drying) foraminifera from each of three replicates. exp(H'(bc)) based on living benthic foraminifera is a promising tool to assess EcoQS. For fossil assemblages, exp(H'(bc)) has potential for evaluating temporal changes in in situ PaleoEcoQS and for defining reference conditions from pre-impacted times. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Several studies have shown that soil biotic communities from organically managed fields are more diverse and exhibit higher activity levels compared to conventionally managed fields. The impact of these different soil communities on plant productivity and the provision of soil ecosystem services are, however, still unclear. Here, we test the effects of soil inoculation from each of three organic and three conventional maize fields on maize productivity and nutrient loss during leaching events induced by simulated rain. In particular, we examine whether differences in productivity and nutrient loss are related to the abundance and species composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. We hypothesized that soil biota from organically managed fields would improve maize growth and reduce nutrient leaching significantly more than those from conventionally managed fields. In contrast to our hypothesis, we found that plant productivity was negatively affected by soil inoculation, and this effect was stronger with inoculum from organic fields. Plant productivity was inversely correlated with AMF abundance, suggesting that enhanced carbon allocation to AMF is at least in part responsible for plant growth reduction under our experimental conditions. However, soil inoculation did alter the ecological functioning of the system by reducing phosphorus leaching losses after simulated rain. Moreover, these leaching losses were lower with increased hyphal density and were related with abundance of particular AMF types, suggesting that abundance of AMF and their community composition may be useful indicators of phosphorus leaching losses. The results demonstrate that soil communities from different agricultural fields vary in their impact on plant productivity and nutrient leaching losses. The results further indicate that there is a potential tradeoff between positive effects of soil communities on sustainability and negative effects on crop productivity.

AB  - In recent years, the urban impervious surface has been recognized as a key quantifiable indicator in assessing urbanization impacts on environmental and ecological conditions. A surge of research interests has resulted in the estimation of urban impervious surface using remote sensing studies. The objective of this paper is to examine and compare the effectiveness of two algorithms for extracting impervious surfaces from Landsat TM imagery; the multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) and the support vector machine (SVM). An accuracy assessment was performed using the high-resolution WorldView images. The root mean square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the coefficient of determination (R-2) were calculated to validate the classification performance and accuracies of MLPNN and SVM. For the MLPNN model, the RMSE, MAE, and R-2 were 17.18%, 11.10%, and 0.8474, respectively. The SVM yielded a result with an RMSE of 13.75%, an MAE of 8.92%, and an R2 of 0.9032. The results indicated that SVM performance was superior to that of MLPNN in impervious surface classification. To further evaluate the performance of MLPNN and SVM in handling the mixed-pixels, an accuracy assessment was also conducted for the selected test areas, including commercial, residential, and rural areas. Our results suggested that SVM had better capability in handling the mixed-pixel problem than MLPNN. The superior performance of SVM over MLPNN is mainly attributed to the SVM's capability of deriving the global optimum and handling the over-fitting problem by suitable parameter selection. Overall, SVM provides an efficient and useful method for estimating the impervious surface. (C) 2011 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE). [DOI: 10.1117/1.3539767]

AB  - The delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) is an endangered pelagic fish species endemic to the Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary (CA, USA), and considered an indicator of ecosystem health. Copper is a contaminant of concern in Californian waterways that may affect the development and survival of this endangered species. The experimental combination of molecular biomarkers with higher level effects may allow for interpretation of responses in a functional context that can be used to predict detrimental outcomes caused by exposure. A delta smelt microarray was developed and applied to screen for candidate molecular biomarkers that may be used in monitoring programs. Functional classifications of microarray responses were used along with quantitative polymerase chain reaction determining effects upon neuromuscular, digestive, and immune responses in Cu-exposed delta smelt. Differences in sensitivity were measured between juveniles and larvae (median lethal concentration = 25.2 and 80.4 mu g/L Cu(2+), respectively). Swimming velocity declined with higher exposure concentrations in a dose-dependent manner (r= -0.911, p < 0.05), though was not statistically significant to controls. Genes encoding for aspartoacylase, hemopexin, a-actin, and calcium regulation proteins were significantly affected by exposure and were functionally interpreted with measured swimming responses. Effects on digestion were measured by upregulation of chitinase and downregulation of amylase, whereas downregulation of tumor necrosis factor indicated a probable compromised immune system. Results from this study, and many others, support the use of functionally characterized molecular biomarkers to assess effects of contaminants in field scenarios. We thus propose that to attribute environmental relevance to molecular biomarkers, research should concentrate on their application in field studies with the aim of assisting monitoring programs.

AB  - Consistent, repeatable and broadly applicable land use, land cover data is needed across the Lake Superior basin to facilitate ecosystem condition assessment and trend analysis. Such a data set collected regularly through time could inform and focus field monitoring efforts, and help prioritize restoration and mitigation efforts. Unfortunately, few data sets exist that are bi-nationally consistent in time, classification method, or resolution. To this end, we integrated land cover data across both the Canadian (Ontario Provincial Land Cover data) and US portions (National Land Cover Data) of the Lake Superior basin for two time steps (approximately 1992 and 2001) roughly one decade apart. After harmonizing landcover classes across the two datasets we compared the explicit amount and relative amount (total hectares and proportion of each area as percents) for each of the common land cover classes that occurred across the two time steps for the entire Lake Superior basin, for the U.S. portion of the Lake Superior basin only, and for the Canadian portion of the Lake Superior basin only. We also compared land cover change for the entire basin within a 1 km and a 10 km buffer of the Great Lakes shoreline. We then summarized and compared these land cover types for each time period across a common set of watersheds derived from elevation data (Hollenhorst et al., 2007) for the entire Lake Superior basin. This allowed us to identify and quantify the types of change occurring generally across the entire basin, more specifically across both the U. S. and Canadian portions of the basin, and more explicitly for near coastal areas and watersheds across the entire basin. Noteworthy changes were detected across the basin, particularly an increase in mixed forest types and a corresponding decrease in coniferous forest types.

AB  - This study examined trace-element concentrations in 39 sediment samples collected in the vicinity of the abandoned Coval da Mo mine. and evaluated the anthropogenic contaminant effects and other environmental variables in the taxonomic composition. structure and morphological changes of benthic diatom communities.
   The results show the existence of extremely high contamination in Pb, Zn and Cd (the mean values exceed the background values 376, 96 and 19 times, respectively) on the first 2.5 km in the water flow direction. Also Co, Cu, Mn and Ni are present in high concentrations. Dilution by relatively uncontaminated sediment reduces metal concentrations downstream, but Zn concentrations increase downstream Filvida stream, as a result of several factors such as sewage and agriculture.
   To evaluate the biological effects caused by Pb, Cd and Zn, three sites were selected. In the stressed environment near the mining area (C232), diatoms were extremely rare. however there was a slight recovery at site C79 located 2 km downstream. Fragilaria capucina var. rumpens, Fragilaria cf. crotonensis and Achnanthidium minutissimum showed abnormal valves which may be related to high levels of metals.
   Six km downstream. in Filvida stream (C85), an increase in species richness and diversity was registered while the relative percentage of valve teratologies was lower. In the absence of OM, nutrients and low pH the diatom community patterns must be attributed to the metal concentration at some sites. Considering that community diversity can be affected by abiotic and biotic variables and valve deformations are caused by a small number of variables, basically metals, and acid conditions, we consider the presence of teratologies as an indication of the presence of metals.

AB  - As fire is inherent to boreal forest, sustainable forest management should consider emulating this disturbance type, taking into account the natural fire regime and the historical impact of humans. Fire often removes the dominant species and reveals mineral soil, which allows new species to spread on burned areas. Variable conditions provide habitat for many different species. Fire is sometimes necessary for the retention of species which do not regenerate in the absence of fire. Fire-damaged forest stands are often salvage logged. The necessity of this procedure can be disputed, as the cleaning may decrease biodiversity, favour pioneer herbs and shrubs which are highly competitive with tree regeneration, and disturb the ecosystem's nutrient cycle. The effect of burning and post-fire cleaning was studied. Ground vegetation was investigated during three subsequent years, 2004-2006, in Fire-damaged pine forest areas in North-western and Southeastern Estonia, both dry and wet site types. Fire occurred 10-12 years prior to the inventories in the first and 2-4 years in the latter. The vegetation survey took place on 2x2m squares undergoing three different treatments: Burnt and Cleaned (BC), Burnt and Uncleaned (BU) and Control (CO). Floral composition differed significantly between the treatments. Biodiversity was higher on burnt plots than in control plots in humid areas and lower in dry areas. On dry sites, Molinea caerulea and Calluna vulgaris benefit from cleaning, which may hamper pine regeneration. Prescribed burning on such sites can reduce the fire risk. On wet sites, there was no significant difference between pioneer and shade-tolerant species between cleaned and uncleaned areas. Whether cleaning after fire should be maintained as a management action therefore depends greatly on the forest site type and other circumstances, such as management objectives and surrounding stands.

AB  - We present benthic foraminiferal assemblage data from an exhumed Miocene canyon and fan system from the Tabernas Basin (SE Spain). The presence of good indicator taxa and unique assemblages occupying specific environments allows the distinction of slope, canyon and fan environments within the Tabernas Basin by foraminiferal assemblages alone. Five assemblages are defined on the basis of the occurrence of the indicator taxa. Primary control on the distribution of these assemblages is consistent with trends of physical disturbance and consequent defaunation. Barren samples, which are predominantly found in high-energy parts of the proximal canyon, are recognized as representing recently defaunated substrates (i.e. early successional assemblages). High diversity assemblages containing a high abundance of agglutinated taxa are recognised in the undisturbed slope sequences as being the regional equilibrium ("climax") fauna. Intermediate between these end-members are assemblages with low diversity, dominated by calcareous taxa typically found in the relatively low-energy canyon and fan environments, which are recognized as representing the middle phases of the ecological succession. Two further assemblages, a low diversity assemblage typified by Cassidulina laevigata and Bulimina costata and a very low diversity assemblage dominated (> 10% of all benthic tests) by Globobulimina spp., are restricted to low-energy parts of the canyon and fan, and are absent from the proximal canyon and slope. The composition of these assemblages indicate that nutrient supply/oxygenation is a secondary control on the palaeoecology of the canyon system. A conceptual model for the recolonisation of defaunated substrates in El Bubo Canyon is proposed, in which either an oligotrophic climax assemblage or a eutrophic climax assemblage can be achieved at the completion of recolonisation of defaunated substrates, depending on environmental conditions.

AB  - Ni and Cu mining and ore processing in Hitura, Western Finland, have resulted in emissions of metal-rich wastewaters into the nearby Kalajoki River since 1970. The wastewaters are discharged into the river 3 km upstream from the eutrophic Lake Pidisjarvi, which is a widening of the river by the town of Nivala. The water level of the lake was elevated by 1.5 m and the extensive macrophyte stands were cut in 1979, profoundly changing the environmental conditions. The effects of the decreasing metal emissions and nutrient concentrations since 1979 on the now open 3.9 km(2) lake were studied with paleolimnological techniques. A 2-m sediment core was taken from the lake in February 2004 and analysed for sediment chemistry and diatom assemblages. At the coring site, 13 cm of sediment had been deposited since 1979, on top of a bed of undecomposed macrophyte remains. When the sediment chemistry was compared with records of decreasing metal loading since 1979, no correlation was found because post-depositional mobility and changes in sediment characteristics affect the sediment metal profiles. Thus, the reduced emissions from the mine and the lower lake water phosphorus levels have not caused a corresponding decrease in sediment metal and P concentrations. However, both of these environmental variables accounted for a statistically significant percentage of variation in the sedimentary diatom assemblages in a redundancy analysis constrained to a single variable. This relationship persisted for Ni loading even in a partial analysis, while the importance of nutrients was confirmed by the good correlation between diatom-inferred and measured P concentrations. The results suggest that reductions in metal and nutrient loading have had an effect on the algal assemblages even though the sediment concentrations of Ni, Cu or P have not decreased.

AB  - Ecological risk assessment (EcoRA) provides both a process and a framework to evaluate the potential for adverse ecological effects occurring as a result of exposure to contaminants or other stressors. EcoRA begins with problem formulation/hazard identification, progresses to effects and exposure assessment, and culminates with risk characterization (an estimate of the incidence and severity of any adverse effects likely to occur). Key components of EcoRA include determining: stressors/contaminants of concern; sensitive, exposed biota: and, appropriate tests and organisms for evaluating effects. Aquatic oligochaetes are not generally used directly in EcoRA because of three major perceptions. First, EcoRA personnel are generally not familiar with or comfortable using this group of organisms. Second. there is believed to be a paucity of widely accepted toxicity tests with these organisms. Third. their taxonomy is considered difficult and uncertain. In fact. aquatic oligochaetes potentially have great utility and relevance to EcoRAs because of factors including: their importance in the aquatic food chain (e.g. prey to fauna including fish and waterfowl; as a vector for contaminant movement through the food chain from bacteria); many species are widely distributed and well studied, representatives include fresh. estuarine and marine species: as a group, they range from sensitive to insensitive over a wide range of environmental insults, they have a long history of use in pollution monitoring and assessment: and. relevant toxicity and biaccumulation tests exist. Toxicity testing under defined conditions is appropriate for problem formulation while more realistic testing for effects assessment (e.g. microcosms) is logistically easier with this group of organisms than with others due to their relatively small size. The importance of aquatic oligochaetes for EcoRA, in particular of sediments. is particularly compelling.

KW  - DEFINITION
AB  - The objective of concepts to assess and implement sustainability in agriculture is to consolidate the complex and diverse principles of the theoretical paradigm and to transform them into recommendations for agricultural practice. Since only goal-oriented concepts show a high adaptation to different conditions and target groups, their fundamental strategy was highlighted and their suitability for successful operationalisation was worked out. Seven goal-oriented concepts, representing the main current methods of sustainability assessment, were evaluated regarding potential and drawbacks for a successful transfer of the theoretical paradigm into practice.
   A principal strategy of goal-oriented concepts has been identified in all concepts: goal definition, indicator selection, evaluation based on indicator sets and final formulation of management advice. In most of the seven reviewed concepts, the protection of the agricultural production system itself is postulated as a major aim. Consequently, indicator sets mainly consist of production-oriented indicators and eco-balancing predominantly represents the methodological framework. Six of the seven selected concepts base sustainability assessment on an evaluation strategy with estimated threshold values or margins of tolerance.
   Three main drawbacks of goal-oriented concepts have been identified that restrict to transfer the theoretical sustainability paradigm into agricultural practice: (1) the lack of systemic and transferable indicators which characterise agricultural and other eco-systems regarding all dimensions of sustainability; (2) the deficit of an adequate evaluation of agro-ecosystems; and (3) the lack of principal guidelines for the formulation of management advice for practical application. Goal-oriented concepts based on models fur agronomy and management show a high potential to overcome these drawbacks and therefore represent a promising tool to bridge the gap between theory and practice of sustainability in agriculture.

AB  - The risk assessment of genetically-modified plants pursuant to Annex LI B of EU Directive 94/15/EC assumes that it is possible to infer the environmental impacts of a crop plant from its characteristics, so most of Annex II should also be applicable to conventional plants. To test this, we surveyed reports on the ecological impacts of the cultivation of non-transgenic crop plants with novel or improved traits and, in three cases, investigated whether Annex II B would have been adequate to indicate the effects. Such an assessment appears to be feasible only if the time frame on which it is based is short, so that long-term effects cannot be assessed. Secondly, the plant must be genetically homogenous which is not always granted, e.g. with forest-trees. Thirdly, the cultivation area must be defined. Differences in the behaviour of foreign plants between their original and cultivation habitats may be ecologically relevant and should be assessed. In the (few) cases where direct inference of the observed effects was possible from inherent traits, these effects often correlated with poor adaptation to local environmental conditions. The ecological impacts of traits that had been introduced in order to overcome poor adaptation may differ widely according to the way in which the traits are exploited. In practice, the effects of agricultural measures are more important than the effects of gene transfer and invasiveness, although the latter currently play a major role in risk assessment. In the light of these deliberations, a modification of Annex II B of EU Directive 94/15/EC is suggested.

AB  - With the objective of searching physiological plant traits associated to phosphorus (P) deficiency, growth parameters were evaluated during the early vegetative phase of development in two dicotyledonous wild species with different growth habits, but coexisting in the same environment. Ruellia tuberosa L. and Euphorbia heterophylla L. were grown from seeds collected from nearby unfertilized areas. Sand culture experiments were conducted under greenhouse conditions using 950 mt pots which were irrigated every second day with 100 mt of either the nutrient solution containing 1.0 or 0.01 mM P (KH2PO4) or with water. In a preliminary experiment, seedling development was studied in order to determine the time for seedling establishment to produce plants of appropriate size for the P experiments. The time was 17 days for Euphorbia and 24 for Ruellia plants. After seedling establishment, the duration of the P experiments was fixed at 3 weeks within the exponential growth phase of each species. Three plants from each P treatment were harvested every two days for leaf area and biomass determinations. Relative growth rates (RGR) and relative leaf area expansion rates (RLAER) were examined as physiological indicators of plant performance and mean and maximum rates calculated by fitting a growth function to the natural logarithms of dry weight and leaf areas for the whole experimental period. Large differences in RGR and RLAER were observed between the high and low P plants of each species, as well as in shoot to root ratios and total root length. It was found that P deficiency primarily affected growth by reducing total leaf area and root length and that RGR, RLAER, and shoot to root ratios were adequate physiological indicators of P deficiency, therefore, they may be useful tools if used in screening procedures. The implications of the small size of the seeds are discussed as related to nutrient concentration in the dry seed and seedling growth.

AB  - THE most common and the most primitive pathway of the three different photosynthetic pathways used by plants is the C3 pathway, or Calvin cycle, which is characterized by an initial CO2 carboxylation to form phosphoglyceric acid, a 3-carbon acid. The carbon isotope composition (deletaC-13) of C3 plants varies from about -23 to -35 parts per thousand1-3 and averages about -26 parts per thousand. Virtually all trees, most shrubs, herbs and forbs, and cool-season grasses and sedges use the C3 pathway. In the C4 pathway (Hatch-Slack cycle), CO2 initially combines with phosphoenol pyruvate to form the 4-carbon acids malate or aspartic acid, which are translocated to bundle sheath cells where CO2 is released and used in Calvin cycle reactions1-4. The carbon isotope composition of C4 plants ranges from about -10 to -14 parts per thousand, averaging about -13 parts per thousand for modern plants1-3. Warm-season grasses and sedges are the most abundant C4 plants, although C4 photosynthesis is found in about twenty families5. The third photosynthetic pathway, CAM, combines features of both C3 and C4 pathways. CAM plants, which include many succulents, have intermediate carbon isotope compositions and are also adapted to conditions of water and CO2 stress. The modern global ecosystem has a significant component of C4 plants, primarily in tropical savannas, temperate grasslands and semi-desert scrublands. Studies of palaeovegetation from palaeosols and palaeodiet from fossil tooth enamel indicate a rapid expansion of C4 biomass in both the Old World and the New World starting 7 to 5 million years ago. We propose that the global expansion of C4 biomass may be related to lower atmospheric carbon dioxide levels because C4 photosynthesis is favoured over C3 photosynthesis when there are low concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

AB  - The occurrence of periplasmic aminopeptidase and alkaline phosphatase (APase) was studied in a Gram-negative bacterium (designated S8) isolated from the surface waters off the Southern California coast. We tested the hypothesis that processing of polymeric substrates (e.g. protein) by marine bacteria involves ectohydrolases both on the cell surface and in the periplasmic space but small substrates (e.g. sugar phosphates) are hydrolytically processed only in the periplasm. Optimum conditions for cold osmotic shock were established to maximize protein release (14.3 +/- 2.2 % of the total cellular protein) without significant release of cytoplasmic protein (using glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase as cytoplasmic indicator). Only 4.2 +/- 4.0 % aminopeptidase but 63.4 +/- 4.8 % APase was shockable. An additional 17 % APase was released by a second shock. Although not shockable, the majority of aminopeptidase (67 %) was periplasmic [not accessible to bovine serum albumin (BSA)]; 33 % was considered surface bound (accessible to BSA). The cellular distribution of aminopeptidase activity is consistent with the model that cell surface aminopeptidase generate oligomers which diffuse into the periplasm where they are monomerized by the high aminopeptidase activity in an environment where the monomers may interact with substrate binding protein or directly with the permeases. While most APase was periplasmic we were unable to determine whether any APase was also present on the cell surface. In S8 the fluorogenic substrates (leucine AMC and MUF-P) did not measure the cytoplasmic enzymes but did measure periplasmic activities. If these results can be extrapolated to natural marine assemblages, then ectoenzyme measurements using the fluorogenic substrates represent the sum of cell surface and periplasmic (but not cytoplasmic) pools of the enzymes. Since ectohydrolase distribution may be important in substrate processing and bacteria-organic matter coupling, future environmental studies of ectoenzymes should distinguish between the 'surface ectoenzymes' and 'periplasmic ectoenzymes'.

AB  - Situated in the sub-Antarctic region, Beagle Channel represents a unique marine ecosystem due to the connection between the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans, and its proximity to the Antarctic Peninsula. Ushuaia city, the biggest settlement on the channel, exerts an increasing anthropogenic pressure by discharges of urban and industrial effluents. In the present work, we use Patagonotothen tessellata, one of the most abundant and widespread species in the channel, as a bioindicator species in order to evidence anthropic impact from Ushuaia Bay and surrounding areas. We first analyzed and characterized real time gene expression of androgen receptor, estrogen receptor and different forms of vitellogenin (VTG), under laboratory conditions. This was achieved by induction with estradiol of P. tessellata males. Then, the selected genes were used as biomarkers for an environmental biomonitoring study. Morphometric indices and circulating sex steroids (estradiol and testosterone) were also quantified in male fish collected from different sites. The qPCR analysis showed that vtgAb form is more inducible than vtgAa or vtgC forms after estrogen induction. The field survey revealed the up-regulation of vtgAb and the androgen receptor in fish from sites with higher anthropogenic influence. Sex steroids followed seasonal variations according to their reproductive cycle, with higher levels of estradiol and testosterone in winter and summer seasons. The use of biomarkers such as gene expression of VTG demonstrates that fish from Ushuaia Bay are likely to be exposed to endocrine disrupting compounds. To our knowledge, this research is the first attempt to assess the endocrine disruption associated to anthropic impact in a widespread fish of the Beagle Channel and contributes to a better understanding of the reproductive physiology of sub Antarctic ichthyofauna.

AB  - Aim Species living in a shared environment face similar selective pressures and often evolve adaptive divergence to avoid competition. Quantifying phenotypic divergence and its genetic parallelism among sympatric species is important for understanding of ecologically moderated biodiversity. Here, we integrate ecologic, phenotypic and genomic datasets to study to what extent three sympatrically snowfinches (Montifringilla adamsi, Pyrgilauda ruficollis and Onychostruthus taczanowskii) differ in their adaptations in order to co-exist in a shared environment. Location Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Methods We used principal component analysis to summarize and compare environmental and phenotypic divergence. We compared phenotypes relevant to body and beak sizes (n = 68) because they are indicators of niche and food segregation, thus critical for establishing co-existence of sympatric birds. We used comparative genomics (n = 33) to identify genetic loci that are highly divergent between species as well as loci unique for each of species. Using vector analyses, we integrated correlation and permutation to quantify parallelism between phenotypic and genetic divergences. Results We found that body and beak sizes are significantly different among three snowfinches. The phenotypic differentiations are greater in species that share similar ecological conditions than in those that do not. We showed that genes related to developmental process are over-represented within highly divergent genomic regions and unique genetic loci of each species. We found that the extent of phenotypic divergence between snowfinch pairs is more strongly correlated with the magnitude of divergence in developmental genes than in the whole genome. Main conclusions Adaptive divergence of sympatric snowfinches is highly constrained on developmental genes. As this genetic divergence is strongly correlated with divergence of the traits related to segregation in niche and food resources, this correlation reflects either causal effects or indirect consequences of ecological mediated changes. Our study provides novel insights into the mechanisms underlying evolutionary versatility and ecological success among sympatric species.

AB  - Dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory provides a model of the intrinsic energetic trade-offs that shape life histories, in terms of fluxes of energy through biological processes. In these models, life histories are a function of environmental conditions and of fundamental traits of the organism relating to the acquisition, allocation and use of energy. These traits are described by the parameters of the DEB model, which are typically estimated from multiple data sources. DEB parameters have been estimated for over 2,500 species, and recent work has aimed to compare species on the basis of differences in parameter values. However, little is known about intraspecific variation in DEB parameters, and the reliability of comparisons between parameter sets is rarely tested. We estimated DEB parameters for 16 populations of Trinidadian guppy. Our objectives were to determine whether DEB theory could characterise known life-history differences between populations, and to assess whether differences in parameter values between populations were reliable indicators of biological differences. We found substantial intraspecific variation in parameter values. The models accurately reproduced biological processes, and also predicted differences in resource allocation and metabolic rate consistent with known life-history differences among these populations. However, parameter estimates varied substantially as an artefact of the amount and types of data used to fit the models. This bias appeared to be systematic, influencing estimates for multiple populations in a comparable fashion. We show that similar patterns of growth and reproduction can be reproduced with very different parameter sets. Our results imply that comparisons of DEB parameters between models fit with different types of data may reflect artefactual rather than biological differences.

AB  - In Co<SIC>te d'Ivoire, more than 80% of the original forest cover has disappeared due to slash-and-burn shifting agricultural practices, uncontrolled logging, and large-scale land conversion for cash crop cultivation. Yet the demand for timber continues to grow and cannot be met by the scarcity of tree plantations. Despite the widespread presence of secondary forests of various ages in Ivorian landscapes, little is known about recovery trajectories of timber resources and the environmental factors that influence recovery rates. We set up 96 0.2 ha forest plots, along a chronosequence of 1 to 40 years and including 7 controls, on which all commercial trees larger than 2.5 cm in diameter at breast height were inventoried. We modelled the recovery trajectories of four complementary indicators of timber resources (basal area, tree density, size of big trees, bole volume) in a Bayesian framework. Our results show that the four indicators recover at different rates, with tree density recovering in less than 15 years while bole volumes need more than a hundred years to recover. Among the local, landscape, and historical factors studied, the number of remnants and proximity to old-growth forests have a positive impact on recovery rates, with, under good environmental conditions, the density, basal area and size of big trees being almost completely recovered in less than 25 years. Our results demonstrate the very high resilience of the timber resource, but also suggest that the landscape management of these post-forest areas must be differentiated according to the landscape context and the presence of isolated trees, which are the last vestiges of the former forest.

AB  - Background The tiller number per unit area is one of the main agronomic components in determining yield. A real-time assessment of this trait could contribute to monitoring the growth of wheat populations or as a primary phenotyping indicator for the screening of cultivars for crop breeding. However, determining tiller number has been conventionally dependent on tedious and labor-intensive manual counting. In this study, an automatic tiller-counting algorithm was developed to estimate the tiller density under field conditions based on terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data. The novel algorithm, which is named ALHC, involves two steps: (1) the use of an adaptive layering (AL) algorithm for cluster segmentation and (2) the use of a hierarchical clustering (HC) algorithm for tiller detection among the clusters. Three field trials during the 2016-2018 wheat seasons were conducted to validate the algorithm with twenty different wheat cultivars, three nitrogen levels, and two planting densities at two ecological sites (Rugao & Xuzhou) in Jiangsu Province, China. Result The results demonstrated that the algorithm was promising across different cultivars, years, growth stages, planting densities, and ecological sites. The tests from Rugao and Xuzhou in 2016-2017 and Rugao in 2017-2018 showed that the algorithm estimated the tiller number of the wheat with regression coefficient (R-2) values of 0.61, 0.56 and 0.65, respectively. In short, tiller counting with the ALHC generally underestimated the tiller number and performed better for the data with lower plant densities, compact plant types and the jointing stage, which were associated with overlap and noise between plants and inside the dense canopy. Conclusions Differing from the previous methods, the ALHC proposed in this paper made full use of 3D crop information and developed an automatic tiller counting method that is suitable for the field environment.

AB  - Water status is an important indicator of ecosystem health. Based on the spectral signatures of liquid water and other land surface features (e.g., soil and vegetation), many water-related spectral reflectance indices (WIs) have been developed to characterize the presence of liquid water. These WIs are widely used in agricultural and ecological applications including surface water body characterization, vegetation water status estimation, soil water content assessment, and wetland (e.g., paddy rice) monitoring. However, choosing the correct WIs for specific studies is confusing due to arbitrary selections of WIs in respective applications and the mixing of WIs names in different studies. To increase the clarity of appropriate usage of WIs in specific conditions, this study reviewed the principles, developments, and applications of various WIs to identify the suitability of WIs for different applications. We started with the discussion of the underlying principles and developments (e.g., from ratio to normalized difference of two bands) of different WIs, based on the spectrum features of water, vegetation, and soil from widely used spectral libraries. Applications from different studies, in each category, were then compared to show the performances of different Wls. This is followed by a brief summary about the terminology of WIs in different studies to further reduce the confusion caused by the mixed use of WIs terms. A field experiment was designed to investigate the dynamics of various WIs in response to different mixing ratios of water and soil or plant. The effectiveness of combining WIs and greenness indices for detecting surface water body and wetland were evaluated using the field experiment data. Finally, we identified the major gaps and pointed out the potential improvements for the future.

AB  - The ecosystem processes underlying the discard rates of the demersal otter-trawl fishery in the Alboran Sea, Western Mediterranean are investigated. We evaluate whether environmental and climatic variability, measured from operational oceanographic data, allow assessment of discarded species abundances. Monthly data collected by onboard fishery observers during 2011 and 2012 in the Northern Alboran Sea served as a case study of the trawling fishery's dynamics. The study area was split into west and east zones to account for differences in the Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea water influences, for distinct geomorphology and for species composition of catches. Sixteen species divided in three groups were analysed: species without discards, those partially discarded and those completely discarded. Applying Gaussian Generalized Additive Models (GAM), we tested the relationships of standard oceanographic data products and climatic variability with discard abundances. These variables were sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll a (chl-a) from satellite imagery, as indicators of environmental conditions, and the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO) as a climatic indicator. Models were applied for target and bycatch species partially discarded. These were the following species: gadoid like European hake (Merluccius merluccius), Blue Whiting (Micromesistius poutassou), Seabreams (Pagellus acarne, and Pagellus erythrinus), and Mackerels (Trachurus mediterraneus, Trachurus picturatus and Trachurus trachurus). Surface seawater temperature was a relevant variable in coastal and eastern, more haline Mediterranean waters. Climatic variability represented by NAO was useful for assessing discard rates in the more productive western zone. Chlorophyll a showed less relevance for discard prediction models, but it was more related in the coastal zones. Including oceanographic data products and climatic patterns in GAM models of fishery discards provides a new perspective that may improve our predictive capabilities for management decisions.

AB  - Community-level climate change indicators have been proposed to appraise the impact of global warming on community composition. However, non-climate factors may also critically influence species distribution and biological community assembly. The aim of this paper was to study how fire-vegetation dynamics can modify our ability to predict the impact of climate change on bird communities, as described through a widely-used climate change indicator: the community thermal index (CTI). Potential changes in bird species assemblage were predicted using the spatially-explicit species assemblage modelling framework - SESAM - that applies successive filters to constrained predictions of richness and composition obtained by stacking species distribution models that hierarchically integrate climate change and wildfire-vegetation dynamics. We forecasted future values of CTI between current conditions and 2050, across a wide range of fire-vegetation and climate change scenarios. Fire-vegetation dynamics were simulated for Catalonia (Mediterranean basin) using a process-based model that reproduces the spatial interaction between wildfire, vegetation dynamics and wildfire management under two IPCC climate scenarios. Net increases in CTI caused by the concomitant impact of climate warming and an increasingly severe wildfire regime were predicted. However, the overall increase in the CTI could be partially counterbalanced by forest expansion via land abandonment and efficient wildfire suppression policies. CTI is thus strongly dependent on complex interactions between climate change and fire-vegetation dynamics. The potential impacts on bird communities may be underestimated if an overestimation of richness is predicted but not constrained. Our findings highlight the need to explicitly incorporate these interactions when using indicators to interpret and forecast climate change impact in dynamic ecosystems. In fire-prone systems, wildfire management and land-use policies can potentially offset or heighten the effects of climate change on biological communities, offering an opportunity to address the impact of global climate change proactively.

AB  - Lake sediments are integrators of watershed wide environmental information that includes bedrock geology, glacial overburden, vegetation, hydrology and land use. Lake sediments were collected from an area covering approximately 13,600 km(2) from the Gowganda and Temagami regions to determine the geochemical background conditions representing different bedrock types. For the entire dataset, the median value for arsenic in lake sediment was 2.6 mg/kg, well within the prescribed limits indicating that the Canadian national objective for arsenic in sediments for the protection of aquatic life (17 mg/kg). Overall, the vast majority of lake sediment samples (97.2%) were below the 17 mg/kg Canadian objective for the protection of aquatic life, however, catchments with Nipissing Diabase had the highest background levels for arsenic (10 mg/kg) with some lakes ranging up to 30 mg/kg. The major geological controls influencing changes in lake sediment geochemistry were determined using random forest classification and principal component analysis (PCA). Random forest classification was able to identify which geological province the samples were derived from and the dominant rock types in the sample catchment with respectable accuracy. PCA revealed strong spatial relationships between lake sediment geochemistry and bedrock geology, particularly a strong relationship between Nipissing Diabase in the watershed of the lake and the cobalt-type mineralization indicator elements in the lake sediment including naturally higher levels of arsenic. Within the samples that exceeded regulatory standards, over half the samples that exceeded the regulatory objectives were located in watersheds that contained Nipissing Diabase in their catchment. This study demonstrates that unique geochemical assemblages can be associated with specific geological areas which is of interest to exploration geologists, for target generation and prospecting, and to environmental policy makers, for site-specific restoration targets.

AB  - Riparian ecosystems along streams naturally harbour a high plant diversity with many increasingly endangered species. In our current heavily modified and fragmented catchments, many of these species are sensitive to dispersal limitation. Better understanding of riparian plant dispersal pathways is required to predict species (re-) colonization potential and improve success rates of stream and riparian zone conservation and restoration. Dispersal by water (hydrochory) is an important mechanism for longitudinal and lateral dispersal of riparian species. Crucially for recruitment potential, it also influences the elevation along the riparian hydrological gradient where seeds become deposited. Due to the complex interplay between abiotic and biotic factors, however, it remains unclear how exactly patterns in seed deposition are formed. We compared hydrochorous and non-hydrochorous seed deposition, and quantified patterns of seed deposition along the bare substrate of newly created stream riparian gradients. Water levels were monitored and seed deposition was measured with seed traps along the full range of riparian hydrological conditions (from permanently flooded to never flooded). Average seed numbers and species richness were significantly higher in flooded than in non-flooded seed traps (5.7 and 1.5 times higher, respectively). Community-weighted trait means indicated that typically water-dispersed seeds were more dominant in flooded than in non-flooded seed traps and gradually decreased in concentration from the channel to the upland. Moreover, highly buoyant seeds accumulated at the average water line, and clear elevational sorting of non-buoyant seeds occurred within the floodplain. These results establish a critical role of flooding in shaping patterns of seed deposition along the riparian gradient, delivering many seeds of typical riparian species to riparian zones and depositing them at species-specific elevations as influenced by seed traits, suggesting species-specific dispersal pathways. This shows that hydrochory likely has important consequences for riparian vegetation development and that flooding forms a key process for successful restoration.

AB  - In recent ecosystem service studies, historical data have gained importance as basis for analysing temporal trends and for adapted land management strategies; however, the total number of such studies remains small. Contributing to recent efforts, the primary objective of this study was to assess local ecosystem service products historically used in Germany and to link their distribution patterns to environmental gradients and traditional land-use systems. From maps and detailed regional descriptions of regionally distinct historic farmsteads, building materials used and village types we extracted information on ecosystem service products appropriated in 1950 and before. A spatial model was used to test the derived ecosystem service diversity against topo-climatic conditions. Regional service richness was further compared to the type of traditional land-use system (i.e. focus on crops, focus on livestock or mixed systems). We were able to identify hot spots of historical ecosystem service provisioning in Northern and Southern Germany, whereas significantly lower service numbers were recorded in Eastern Germany. The strong spatial differences in the diversity of historical service products could be explained best by (high) precipitation during the vegetation period. Furthermore, traditional livestock keeping, which relied on various fodder sources and fertilisation techniques to improve poor soil quality, and mixed systems mostly co-occurred with higher regional ecosystem service richness. The baseline of historical ecosystem service provisioning analysed here aids our understanding of current land-use patterns in Germany. Furthermore, a change of perception for specific landscape elements became apparent from our analyses. For example, hedges planted to separate livestock and to provide fuel in the past are today appreciated as important elements for biodiversity conservation. Furthermore, our study helps to preserve knowledge "about locally sourced ecosystem services thereby increasing the understanding of cultural landscapes which may help to maintain their remnants.

AB  - Urban soil is influenced by both the natural and anthropogenic factors. Their impacts, therefore, amend the concentration of heavy metals in urban soils. In this study, the concentration of selected heavy metals including Cu, Zn, Pb, Fe and Cr in urban soils was assessed in the megacity of Karachi, Pakistan. Variability of metal concentration across distinct urban land uses, and through seasonal interventions was used as an indicator of the factors involved. For spatial analysis, soil samples were collected from 30 different locations, belonging to 6 distinct land uses dominant in the megacity. For temporal investigations, the samples were collected in both pre-monsoon (PRM) and post-monsoon (POM) conditions. The results revealed that the mean concentrations were in the order Fe >> Zn > Pb > Cu > Cr, in both the seasons. Increase in concentration of Pb and Fe, after rain, seems to be the result of sinking of aerial metal and relocation by flood runoffs. The concentration of Cu and Zn decreased in the POM season possibly due to dilution by rainwater. The spatial variation in the concentration of Cu, Zn and Pb metals seemed to be the result of point sources and vehicle emissions. Fe, despite of its very high average concentration in soil, shows moderate spatial variation (Variance <50%) which indicates the non-point nature of its sources. Cu, Zn and Pb showed their common sources (through anthropogenic activities) and the relationship have been proved by both the multivariate and spatial analyses. However, Cr seemed to have least affected by anthropogenic activities due to weaker and/or no correlation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The contaminated sediment serves as a long-term source of toxic elements, since that mobility and transport in the environment of these elements are strongly influenced to associated solid phase. In this study, the modified Tessier sequential extraction procedure was applied for the fractionation of Cd, As, Hg, Cu, Zn, Cr, Pb, Ni and V in the sediments (Tisa River and canal sediments - Danube alluvial formation), to obtain an overall classification of trace element pollution in these areas through its spatial distribution. Investigations of this region are important due to the widespread occurrence of metal mining activities throughout the Tisa and Danube drainage basins and possibilities of contamination with toxic elements at studies localities. Five steps of the sequential extraction procedure partitioned elements into CH3COONH4 extractable (F1), NH2OH center dot HC carbonate extractable and easily reducible (F2), H2C2O4/(NH4)2C2O4 moderately reducible (F3), H2O2-HNO3 organic extractable (F4), and HCl acid soluble residue (F5). Analyses of the extracts were performed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. To indicate the degree of risk of toxic elements, risk assessment code and contamination factor have been used. The results of partitioning study indicate that more easily mobilized forms (metals in adsorbed/exchangeable/carbonate forms or bound to amorphous Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides and Fe and Mn oxides) were predominant for copper, zinc, cadmium and lead, which can be used as indicators for input from anthropogenic source. In contrast, the largest amount of chromium and nickel were associated with the inert fraction, which reduced their solubility and rendered them immobile under natural conditions and indicative of natural origins. Most of remaining portion of metals was bound to ferromanganese oxides fraction. It is concluded that sequential extraction results proved useful to distinguish between anthropogenic and geochemical sources of elements in the sediments.

AB  - Questions What is the role of nutrient limitation of dominant species in maintaining plant species diversity at small spatial scales, particularly in biodiversity hotspots? Location Southwest of Western Australia. Methods The extent of nutrient limitation was determined by measuring variation in the foliar nutrients of dominant plant species and total above-ground biomass in relation to soil N and P across 16 plots. Plant species richness and evenness for the same plots were then regressed against foliar N:P and d15N of the dominant species. Results Foliar N and P content as well as above-ground biomass increased, while foliar N:P decreased with increasing soil N and P, suggesting that dominant species are limited by both N and P in southwest Australia. In contrast, foliar d15N values only increased with decreasing soil P, indicating that d15N enrichment reflects low P availability. Species richness increased at sites where foliar N:P was higher and d15N more enriched, suggesting that a relatively greater number of rare plant species co-exist where the growth of dominant vegetation is more nutrient-limited. Conclusions The mechanisms that allow an exceptionally high number of plant species to co-exist at small spatial scales in a southwest Australian biodiversity hotspot are linked to the extent to which the dominant plant species are limited in N and P. In addition, on nutrient-impoverished soils, a foliar N:P ratio >16 can reflect N as well as P limitation. While foliar d15N also reflects availability of soil P, it is not necessarily a reliable indicator of nutrient limitation in southwest Australia, and perhaps in other environments where plants are highly adapted to low-nutrient conditions.

AB  - It is becoming increasingly important to improve spatial resolutions of soil maps as a fundamental information layer for studying ecological processes and to tackle land degradation. There is growing interest in the use of remote sensing technologies to assist the identification and delineation of spatial variation in soils. This paper investigates whether selected properties of extensively weathered, low fertility soils can be predicted using high-resolution reflectance spectra over the range 400-2500 nm. Clay content, carbonate concentration, organic carbon content and iron oxide content were analysed for 300 soil samples collected from the Jamestown, Belalie district, South Australia. The paper also examines the efficacy of this soil analysis methodology to supplement or replace traditional soil sampling in soil survey to increase sampling density and improve the spatial resolution of soil maps.
   Reflectance spectra were obtained from air-dried samples under controlled laboratory conditions using an ASD FieldSpec Pro spectroradiometer. Partial least squares regression was used to examine relationships between soil mineralogy, clay content and organic carbon and the reflectance spectra and identify the wavelengths contributing to prediction of these soil properties. Results show that it is possible to predict clay content, soil organic carbon, iron oxide content and carbonate content. Cross-validation R-2 values for all analyses were above 0.5 and the residual prediction difference (RPD) was acceptable for all soil properties. Carbonate and clay content were more accurately predicted than iron oxide and organic carbon. All samples were collected from the same geographical area such that they represented physical properties over a naturally occurring range and provide a prediction that could be related to subsequent image analysis or be used to carry out local scale soil survey. A rapid and reliable form of soil mapping could be developed from this methodology. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - If fractional crystallization coupled with some crustal assimilation (AFC) is the dominant process for generating evolved magmas in the Earth's crust, large quantities of igneous cumulates must be present in the rock record. However, despite some reported occurrences, intermediate to silicic rocks characterized by an unambiguous crystal accumulation signature have remained elusive. The signature is expected to be subtle in viscous silicic magmas, and sensitive criteria need to be developed to test whether these cumulates are truly rare or simply difficult to discern. We propose models that use specific trace element concentrations and ratios (Zr, Ba, Eu/Eu*, and Zr/HO within a well-constrained framework for the physical extraction of liquid from crystals (mostly occurring between 50 and 70 vol.% crystals) to identify silicic cumulates. The results of these models indicate that crystal accumulation (or melt extraction) has occurred in multiple natural examples around the world (both in plutonic and volcanic realms). However, these examples were selected because they represent conditions that are most favorable (high amount of melt extraction, well-constrained initial liquid compositions) for unambiguously identifying cumulate residue; in many cases, we show that the trace element signature for crystal accumulation will remain largely concealed. In addition, the different liquid lines of descent related to the various tectonic settings on Earth (dry-reduced in hot spots-divergent margins and wetter-more oxidizing in arc environments) will lead to different trace element evolution and each criterion must be applied on a case-by-case basis. Despite these limitations, the undeniable but subtle presence of silicic cumulates in the mid- to upper-crust lends support to the idea that igneous differentiation is dominantly driven by melt extraction from partially crystalline reservoirs. 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A collection of sepia photographs, taken during Great Britain's military expedition to Abyssinia in 1868, are the oldest landscape photographs from northern Ethiopia, and have been used to compare the status of vegetation and land management 140 years ago with that of contemporary times. Thirteen repeat landscape photographs, taken during the dry seasons of 1868 and 2008, were analyzed for various environmental indicators and show a significant improvement of vegetation cover. New eucalypt woodlands, introduced since the 1950s are visible and have provided a valuable alternative for house construction and fuel-wood, but more importantly there has also been locally important natural regeneration of indigenous trees and shrubs. The situation in respect to soil and water conservation measures in farmlands has also improved. According to both historical information and measured climatic data, rainfall conditions around 1868 and in the late 19th century were similar to those of the late 20th/early 21st century. Furthermore, despite a ten-fold increase in population density, land rehabilitation has been accomplished over extensive areas by large-scale implementation of reforestation and terracing activities, especially in the last two decades. in some cases repeat photography shows however that riparian vegetation has been washed away. This is related to river widening in recent degradation periods, particularly in the 1970s-1980s. More recently, riverbeds have become stabilized, and indicate a decreased runoff response. Environmental recovery programmes could not heal all scars, but this study shows that overall there has been a remarkable recovery of vegetation and also improved soil protection over the last 140 years, thereby invalidating hypotheses of the irreversibility of land degradation in semi-arid areas. in a highly degraded environment with high pressure on the land, rural communities were left with no alternative but to improve land husbandry: in northern Ethiopia such interventions have been demonstrably successful.

AB  - Vegetative cover plays an important role for the quality of soil especially in hilly and mountainous areas such as Azad Jammu and Kashmir where erosion is a major threat to the ecosystem and productivity. The study focuses on the impact of land-use types on soil quality by measuring the differences in chemical and physical properties at three sites in adjacently located natural forest land ( forest), fallow grassland ( grass) and arable land ( arable). Soil samples from 0 - 15 and 15 - 30 cm depth were collected and examined for particle distribution, dry bulk density, organic matter ( OM), pH, macro- and micro-nutrients. Land-use types had a significant effect on primary soil particle distribution. Highest clay content was found in forest and highest sand content in arable. Forest had relatively the highest levels of OM, macro- and micro-nutrients and arable the lowest. Most of the properties of the 0 - 15 cm surface level of grass were similar to those observed in the 15 - 30 cm level in forest. Arable exhibited lowest nutrient status and poorest physical conditions, indicating a degrading effect of arable cultivation practices on soil. Grass and arable showed, compared to forest, a 30 - 60% average increase in bulk density and 26 - 66% average decrease in OM. Regression analysis showed a significant correlation of OM with available phosphorus and potassium while it had negative correlation with dry bulk density and pH. Natural vegetation appeared to be a main contributor of soil quality as it maintained the organic carbon stock, and increased the nutrient status of soil and is therefore important for sustainable development of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and other similar areas. Furthermore, OM was shown to be an important indicator of soil quality.

AB  - The sublethal toxicity associated with exposure of adult lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) to diets containing 0, 10, 100, and 1000 mug Ni per g for 10, 3 1, and 104 days was assessed through the measurement of responses, through a range of levels of biological organization. The accumulation and distribution of Ni in these fish are described in the previous manuscript (Ptashynski and Klaverkamp, 2001. Aquat. Toxicol. in press). Hematological parameters, including concentrations of glucose and hemoglobin and hematocrit, were not different between control and treated fish. Organ and whole organism parameters, including LSI, growth, and condition factor, were also unaffected. Histopathological lesions in kidney and liver proved to be the most sensitive and reliable indicators of Ni exposure. In livers of treated fish, areas of focal necrosis and altered bile ducts were observed. Histological alterations were observed throughout the posterior kidneys, in glomeruli, tubules, collecting ducts, and hematopoietic tissue, in fish fed medium and high dose diets. In whitefish kidneys, the frequency (%) of altered distal tubules and fields of views with alterations increased with the dose and duration of exposure. Significant increases in metallothionein concentrations were observed in intestine of whitefish fed the high dose diet on day 10, but these increases were not sustained. Significant increases in lipid peroxide concentrations were also observed in plasma of whitefish fed the high dose diet on day 31, but were not observed on day 104. These biochemical responses to dietary Ni require further evaluation. To evaluate exposure of natural populations of fish to Ni, analysis of Ni in kidney and liver and assessment of renal and hepatic histopathology are recommended for use in field bio-monitoring programs.

AB  - This paper illustrates the potential and also the complexity of using Au-Ag alloys (the mineral electrum) as petrogenetic indicators of ore-forming processes. Thermodynamic calculations indicate that the solubility of gold is highly dependent on the composition, or fineness, of naturally occurring Au-Ag alloys. Alloy composition, in turn, is a complex function of the temperature, a(S2), a(O2), Cl- concentration, pH, and total Au/Ag content of the system in question. Hydrothermal solutions with low salinity, near-neutral pH, and high dissolved sulfide concentration have relatively high gold solubilities and Au/Ag solubility ratios. In contrast, more saline brines have lower gold solubilities and very low Au/Ag solubility ratios. Alloys formed from either type of fluid may be Au rich or Au poor, depending on the temperature, chemical environment, and mechanism of ore deposition. The compositions of both solid solution and aqueous solution may change drastically during reaction progress, resulting in deposits which are mineralogically zoned, either on a microscopic (individual electrum grain) or mesoscopic (ore deposit) scale. Dynamic modeling calculations are presented to illustrate these effects, using either open-system (Rayleigh fractionation) or closed-system boundary conditions.
   Coprecipitation with other Au- or Ag-bearing minerals (e.g., argentite, chlorargyrite, sulfosalts, tellurides, or selenides) places additional thermodynamic constraints on electrum composition. For example, the composition of electrum in equilibrium with argentite may be used as a geothermometer, provided an independent estimate of as, is available. Thermodynamic analysis indicates that Au-rich argentite may be a very important primary ore mineral, especially in deposits formed at high temperature, high a(S2), and/or high ratios of dissolved Ag/Au. Textural and compositional information recorded in parageneses containing electrum and other precious metal minerals must be interpreted with caution, especially if there is reason to suspect that ore deposition was rapid, or if there is evidence of postmineralization weathering, metamorphism, or other forms of reequilibration.

AB  - Spatial variations of maximum canopy height are key indicators of many ecosystem processes such as aboveground biomass and productivity. With rapid advances in remote sensing techniques, such as airborne laser scanning (ALS), we can now measure canopy height, tree density, and canopy gaps from local to large scales. But these data are yet to be fully exploited for a better understanding of canopy height variations in relation to fine topographical heterogeneities and neighborhood conditions at the landscape level (>100 km2). In this study, we analyzed ALS data to extract spatial variations in canopy height and topographic features for a forest-dominated area of 230 km2 in Kyoto, Japan. The study area spanned an elevational range from 70 to 1000 m a.s.l and included four forest types, i.e., cedar or cypress plantations (PL), natural evergreen needle leaf forests (ENF), deciduous broadleaved forests (DBF), and evergreen broadleaved forests (EBF). PL had a greater mean canopy height than ENF, both of which were taller than DBF and EBF. Canopy height exhibited a hump-shaped relationship with elevation with the peak value at mid-altitude (461-560 m) in all forest types. Canopy height was greater by 5-10 m in the concave valleys than on the convex slopes and ridges. Trees were taller at greater distances from forest gaps and with lower tree density in the neighborhood. Local tree density, distance from the nearest canopy gap, and topographic curvatures were the most significant predictors in the best-fitted model (Random Forest: R2 = 0.41). The analytical approach developed in this study provides a useful tool for planning proper land use and maintaining a healthy forest stand at the regional scale.

AB  - Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by plants are essential indicators of their physiological response to environmental conditions. But evidence of natural variation in VOC emissions and their contributing factors is still limited, especially for non-cultivated species. Here we explored the natural volatile emissions of Dracophyllum subulatum Hook.f., an endemic shrub to the North Island Central Plateau of New Zealand, and determined some environmental factors driving the plant's emissions. Volatile emissions of D. subulatum were measured on four separate occasions from December 2017 to September 2018 using the "push-pull" headspace sampling technique and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). D. subulatum was classified based on the volatiles measured on each sampling occasion using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). On each sampling occasion, we also recorded and compared ambient air temperature, herbivory damage, total soil nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and soil moisture content. The relationship between environmental variables that differed significantly between sampling occasions and volatile emissions were estimated using generalized linear models (GLMs). Based on VOCs measured on each sampling occasion, we were able to distinguish different chemical profiles. Overall, we found that total emission and the relative proportions of all major chemical classes released by D. subulatum were significantly higher during summer. The GLMs reveal that differences in environmental factors between the four sampling occasions are highly associated with changing emissions. Higher temperatures in summer had a consistently strong positive relationship with emissions, while the impacts of soil moisture content, P and K were variable and depended on the chemical class. These results are discussed, particularly how high temperature (warming) may shape volatile emissions and plants' ecology.</p>

AB  - Freshwater riverbeds are a major repository of microplastics (MPs) from inland activities. Benthic macroinvertebrates that live in close contact with sediments seem to ingest a considerable amount of such plastic particles. The effects of MPs on life-history traits are relatively well-known, but the suborganismal mechanisms underlying such effects remain unclear. This study addressed the potential effects of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) MPs on Chironomus riparius larvae at cellular and molecular levels. Fourth instar C. riparius larvae were exposed to 0.025 and 2.5 g/kg LDPE of dry sediment (sizes: <32 and 32-45 mu m; with irregular shape) under laboratory conditions for 48 h. These short-term exposures to environmental concentrations of LDPE MPs induced changes in the energy reserves (mostly by decreasing carbohydrates and increasing lipids), increased antioxidant and detoxification responses (tGSH, CAT, and GST), and induced increases in the activity of AChE (related to neurotransmission). In addition, at the gene level, exposure to MPs modified mRNA levels of InR, Dis, EcR, Dronc, Met (endocrine system), Def (immune system), PARP, ATM, NLK, and Decay (DNA repair), generating important alterations in the C. riparius development and response to unfavorable situations. This study provides new evidence of the effects of LDPE MPs at the suborganismal level, filling the gap in knowledge regarding the mechanisms underlying the toxicity of MPs and spotlighting gene expression analyses as early indicators of MP toxicity in C. riparius which were confirmed by Integrated biomarker response analyses highlighting the gene expression as sensible and useful endpoints for LPDE pollution in freshwaters. These results, coupled with previous investigations on responses at the organismal level, emphasizes the potential adverse effects of LDPE MPs on C. riparius, which may compromise freshwater benthic communities, considering its ecological role within these habitats.

AB  - Farmland ponds are a highly threatened freshwater habitat which has undergone dramatic losses during the last 200 years due to land drainage schemes and agricultural intensification. Agri-environment schemes (AES) incentivize farmers to adopt farming methods to benefit biodiversity, yet there are a paucity of data evaluating the success of artificially created AES ponds as analogues of natural ponds in an attempt to recreate lost environments. We examined variation in environmental parameters and aquatic and terrestrial invertebrate communities between 38 natural ponds and 91 artificial ponds that were created in south-west Ireland (n = 129). Artificial ponds in agricultural grassland did not replicate natural ponds in adjacent semi-natural habitats differing significantly in size, pH, conductivity, productivity (indicated by submerged and emergent plant cover including algae) and surrounding vegetation structure that is, sward height. These differences significantly influenced aquatic and terrestrial invertebrate community structure with a suite of indicator taxa in both natural and artificial ponds. The conservation value of artificial ponds in agricultural grasslands should not be underestimated as they had 43% higher aquatic species richness and 33% higher aquatic species abundance than natural ponds in adjacent semi-natural habitats. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate that artificial agri-environment scheme ponds created in agricultural grasslands, whilst not direct analogues of natural ponds in adjacent semi-natural habitats, do fulfil a role in preserving high local biodiversity albeit representing a different community of species. Creation of ponds in farmland as well as in adjacent natural habitats could provide a wider range of environmental conditions and richer associated macroinvertebrate communities, increasing landscape connectivity and further enhancing regional biodiversity.

AB  - (1) Background: In agro-ecosystems, the success of the crops has a strong connection to biodiversity in the landscape. In the face of climate change, it is important to understand the response to environmental variation of weed species by means of their distribution. In the last century, biodiversity has been impacted due to a variety of stresses related to climate change. Although the composition of vegetation tends to change at a slower rate than climate change, we hypothesize species present in weed communities are distributed in diverse patterns as a response to the climate. Therefore, the general aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of temperature, using latitude as an indicator, on the composition and distribution of weed communities in agro-ecosystems. (2) Methods: Weeds were monitored in georeferenced cereal fields which spanned south and central Spanish regions. The graphic representation according to latitude allowed us to identify groups of weeds and associate them to a temperature range. We classified weeds as generalist, regional, or local according to the range of distribution. (3) Results: The monitoring of species led to the classification of weeds as generalist, regional or local species according to latitude and associated temperature ranges. Three weed species that were present in all latitude/temperature regions, were classified as generalist (Linaria micrantha(Cav) Hoffmanns & Link,Sonchus oleraceousL., andSysimbrium iriumL.). The species were classified as regional or local when their presence was limited to restricted latitude/temperature ranges. One weed,Stellaria media(L.) Vill., was considered a local species and its distribution dynamics can be considered an indicator of temperature. (4) Conclusions: The novel methodology used in this study to assign weed distribution as an indicator of climatic conditions could be applied to evaluate climate gradients around the world.

AB  - New challenges arise in risk assessment when genetically engineered (GE) plants can persist and propagate in the environment as well as produce viable offspring. Next generation effects can be influenced by heterogeneous genetic backgrounds and unexpected effects can be triggered in interaction with environmental conditions. Consequently, the biological characteristics of the original events cannot be regarded as sufficient to conclude on hazards that may emerge in following generations. Potential hazards identified by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) include exacerbating weed problems, displacement and even extinction of native plant species. However, there are reasons for concern that might escape the environmental risk assessment (ERA) because EFSA only takes into account the characteristics of the original events, leaving aside unintended or unexpected next generation effects emerging from spontaneous propagation and gene flow. From our review of the publications available and the analysis of risk assessment as performed, we conclude that the risk assessment of GE organisms able to persist and spontaneously propagate in the environment actually suffers from a high degree of spatio-temporal complexity causing many uncertainties. To deal with this problem, we recommend establishing 'cut-off criteria' in risk assessment that include factual limits of knowledge. It is proposed that these criteria are applied in a specific step within risk assessment, i.e. 'spatio-temporal controllability' that uses well-defined biological characteristics to delineate some of the boundaries between known and unknowns. This additional step in risk assessment will foster robustness in the process and can substantially benefit the reliability and overall conclusiveness of risk assessment and decision-making on potential releases.

AB  - Air pollution is the single largest environmental health risk. It significantly impacts human life and the condition of ecosystems. One type of dangerous pollutant is particulate matter (PM). All EU countries, especially Poland, should take intensive actions to achieve the necessary standards of air quality. These actions should be aimed at reducing emissions on the one hand, and on the other, at reducing the PM concentrations in the air. To achieve this, identification of the factors influencing air pollution is needed. In this study, the landscape pattern, climate and emissions around PM monitoring points were recognized. Climate factors, particularly wind speed, prove to be most important for PM pollution. In addition, the landscape pattern modifies the concentration significantly, especially in the case of PM2.5. The presence in the landscape of green areas with a large surface and complex shape is connected to the lesser concentration of PM. The importance of emissions, although statistically significant, was rather small. In particular, the relationship between the distance to large point sources and PM concentration was not demonstrated, meaning that the pollution from high chimneys is strongly dispersed and does not affect the concentrations of PM in their vicinity. It is concluded that the landscape indicators provide new information to explain the PM concentration and that it is very important to shape the landscape with consideration of green areas as a pollutant filter. Taking into account the green areas together with pollution sources in spatial planning can significantly support the effectiveness of air protection, and at the same time, can increase the comfort of life by providing a whole range of ecosystem services, both regulating and cultural. The landscape approach best suits the needs of spatial planning, especially in cities where the highest anthropogenic pressure and increased demand for ecosystem services are evident.

AB  - Research and development agencies, as well as policy makers and agri-food enterprises, need reliable data to support informed decisions that can improve the sustainability of agricultural landscapes. We present a review of agricultural sustainability assessment frameworks (ASAF) that identifies the features most relevant to monitoring progress towards sustainability goals for agricultural landscapes. This qualitative review considers a variety of approaches for defining goals and for selecting stakeholders, spatial and temporal boundaries, indicators, and analytical approaches. We focused on assessment frameworks that (i) include environmental, social, and economic implications of agriculture; (ii) are applicable to multiple, non-specified farm system types; (iii) are described in an English language, peer-reviewed publication; (iv) have been developed for use at a farm system to regional spatial scale; (v) engage stakeholders; (vi) provide case studies; and (vii) could be used in a variety of contexts across the globe. Based on the review, we provide recommendations for further development and use of assessment frameworks to better address the needs of agricultural research, extension, and development organizations. We recommend an agroecosystem approach to help stakeholders identify appropriate indicators for their situation. Assessment methods need to be flexible enough for adaptation to a spectrum of agricultural landscapes and changing environmental conditions, and remain relevant as farmers and other stakeholders acquire new information, resources, and different management techniques. We find that to address information gaps across different scales from farm to region will require creativity and some reliance on local knowledge systems to support adaptive management. Assessment results should communicate relationships among ecosystem services and socio-economic activities affected by agricultural landscapes. Visualization tools can facilitate understanding of trade-offs and synergies among sustainability goals as reflected by individual indicators.

AB  - There have been significant regime shifts in the ecosystem structure and function in a large number of lakes worldwide due to the increasing human disturbance and climate change in recent decades. It has become a critical issue in lake conservation and management to identify the characteristics of regime shifts in lakes and explore potential early-warning signals prior to regime shifts. However, research on identifying and predicting regime shifts in lakes is still a difficult task since recent modelling approaches cannot fully grasp the non-linear processes among multiple ecosystem components and the ecological time series data are too scarce to support the detection in most lakes. In this study, multi-proxy paleolimnological records were used to obtain long time-series ecological data and determine the inflection points of regime shifts in the Baiyangdian Lake, northern China. First, the sediment chronology was established, and macrophyte pollen as well as nutrient conditions in each dated sediment layer were identified. Then the heuristic segmentation algorithm and Pettitt test were used to determine the most significant inflection points of regime shifts. Additionally, multiple early-warning indicators including variance, autocorrelation and skewness were used to test their ability to forecast the major ecosystem regime shift. Results show that the most important abrupt change in the Baiyangdian Lake occurred in the early 19605. The increasing variance coupled with decreasing autocorrelation and skewness started in 1-16 years before this regime shift, which is consistent with a flickering phenomenon rather than critical slowing down. The detection results of regime shifts and early-warning signals can provide valuable reference in- formation for the lake management and aquatic ecosystem conservation.

AB  - In this study, stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in the samples of pine needles collected in 2013 and 2014 from heavily urbanized area in close proximity to point-source pollution emitters, such as a heat and power plant, nitrogen plant, and steelworks in Silesia (Poland), were analyzed as bio-indicators of contemporary environmental changes. The carbon isotope discrimination has been proposed as a method for evaluating water-use efficiency. The measurement of carbon and nitrogen isotopes was carried out using the continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer. The isotope ratio mass spectrometer allows the precise measurement of mixtures of naturally occurring isotopes. The delta N-15 values were calibrated relative to the NO-3 and USGS34 international standards, whereas the delta C-13 values were calibrated relative to the C-3 and C-5 international standards. The strong year-to-year correlations between the delta C-13 in different sampling sites, and also the inter-annual correlation of delta N-15 values in the pine needles at each of the investigated sampling sites confirm that the measured delta 13C and delta N-15 and also intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) trends are representative of the sampling site. Diffuse air pollution caused the variation in delta C-13, delta N-15, and iWUE dependent on type of emitter, the localization in the space (distance and direction) from factories and some local effect of other human activities. The complex short-term variation analysis can be helpful to distinguish isotopic fractionation, which is not an effect explainable by climatic conditions but by the anthropogenic effect. Between 2012 and 2014, an increase in iWUE is observed at leaf level.

AB  - Climate conditions significantly affect vegetation growth in terrestrial ecosystems. Due to the spatial heterogeneity of ecosystems, the vegetation responses to climate vary considerably with the diverse spatial patterns and the time-lag effects, which are the most important mechanism of climate-vegetation interactive effects. Extensive studies focused on large-scale vegetation-climate interactions use the simultaneous meteorological and vegetation indicators to develop models; however, the time-lag effects are less considered, which tends to increase uncertainty. In this study, we aim to quantitatively determine the time-lag effects of global vegetation responses to different climatic factors using the GIMMS3g NDVI time series and the CRU temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation datasets. First, this study analyzed the time-lag effects of global vegetation responses to different climatic factors. Then, a multiple linear regression model and partial correlation model were established to statistically analyze the roles of different climatic factors on vegetation responses, from which the primary climate-driving factors for different vegetation types were determined. The results showed that (i) both the time-lag effects of the vegetation responses and the major climate-driving factors that significantly affect vegetation growth varied significantly at the global scale, which was related to the diverse vegetation and climate characteristics; (ii) regarding the time-lag effects, the climatic factors explained 64% variation of the global vegetation growth, which was 11% relatively higher than the model ignoring the time-lag effects; (iii) for the area with a significant change trend (for the period 1982-2008) in the global GIMMS3g NDVI (P < 0.05), the primary driving factor was temperature; and (iv) at the regional scale, the variation in vegetation growth was also related to human activities and natural disturbances. Considering the time-lag effects is quite important for better predicting and evaluating the vegetation dynamics under the background of global climate change.

AB  - We introduce a volume recovery index (VRI), the fraction of inventoried (alternatively felled) tree volume that can be recovered and commercialized. The new index improves on the traditional marketing coefficient used in the Congo Basin, through a systematic assessment of wastage at logging and preprocessing stages. Statistically, the new index is more reliable: its two proposed versions are both accurate (absence of bias) and precise (small mean square error). Practically, VRI gauges the ATO/ITTO indicator 2.3.4 stating that "[wastage should be] minimized at all stages of production and processing". VRI actually encapsulates three sub-indicators of that indicator and complements a fourth sub-indicator on using "felling methods [that] optimize the volume of usable timber". Thus, VRI is useful in assessing the ecological and socioeconomic sustainability of timber production of all forest types, with particular relevance for reduced-impact logging (RIL) and carbon (or biomass) storage. We examine the qualities of VRI as sustainability indicator, set forth a principle for sustainable logging, and discuss the limitation effects of (i) ecology (species growth conditions, spatial distribution, and stand structure), (ii) management (polycyclic logging, species selection and diversification, logging operations, logging intensity, and conservation constraints) and (iii) policy (legislation on timber processing and export products, incentive allocation, property rights definition and enforcement) on volume recovery, together with possible remedies. We recommend: (i) using the spatialized VRI jointly with other pressure indicators in discriminating between genuine environmental limitations and mining exploitation; (ii) adopting RIL techniques to their fullest potential, given current low logging intensities in Congo Basin; (iii) allowing transfer of user rights in salving damaged trees and low quality timber; (iv) promoting recovery and utilization of residue to increase timber transformation rate, curb resource dissipation, reduce the rate of desertification, improve distribution of forest benefits, and contribute to poverty alleviation.

AB  - Marine protist species have been used for several decades as environmental indicators under the assumption that their ecological requirements have remained more or less stable through time. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that marine protists, including several phytoplankton species, are in fact highly diverse and may quickly respond to changes in the environment. Predicting how future climate will impact phytoplankton populations is important, but this task has been challenged by a lack of time-series of ecophysiological parameters at time-scales relevant for climate studies (i.e. at least decadal). Here, we report on ecophysiological variability in a marine dinoflagellate over a 100-year period of well-documented environmental change, by using the sedimentary archive of living cysts from a Scandinavian fjord (Koljo Fjord, Sweden). During the past century, Koljo Fjord has experienced important changes in salinity linked to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). We revived resting cysts of Pentapharsodinium dalei preserved in the fjord sediments and determined growth rates for 18 strains obtained from 3 sediment core layers at salinity 15 and 30, which represent extreme sea-surface conditions during periods of predominantly negative and positive NAO phases, respectively. Upper pH tolerance limits for growth were also tested. In general, P. dalei grew at a higher rate in salinity 30 than 15 for all layers, but there were significant differences among strains. When accounting for inter-strain variability, cyst age had no effect on growth performance or upper pH tolerance limits for this species, indicating a stable growth response over the 100-year period in spite of environmental fluctuations. Our findings give some support for the use of morphospecies in environmental studies, particularly at decadal to century scales. Furthermore, the high intra-specific variability found down to sediment layers dated as ca. 50 years-old indicates that cyst-beds of P. dalei are repositories of ecophysiological diversity.

AB  - The worldwide occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms makes it necessary to perform environmental risk assessment procedures to monitor the effects of microcytins on fish. Oxidative stress biomarkers are valuable tools in this regard. Considering that zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a common model species in fish toxicology and the zebrafish gill is potentially useful in screening waterborne pollutants, this study investigated the oxidative stress response in zebrafish gill exposed to subchronic microcystin-LR (MCLR) concentrations (2 or 20 mu g/l) via measurement of toxin accumulation, protein phosphatase (PP) activity, and the antioxidant parameters (glutathione-S-transferase-GST; glutathione-GSH; superoxide dismutase-SOD; catalase-CAT; glutathione peroxide-GPx; glutathione reductase-GR), as well as levels of hydroxyl radical (OH) and lipid peroxidation (LPO). The results showed that after 30 days exposure, MCLR accumulated in zebrafish gill and MCLR exposure induced PP activity in gill. A linear inhibition of GST activity and GSH content was observed in the gills, revealing that they were involved in the first step of MCLR detoxification. The 2 mu g/l MCLR treatment neglectably affected OH content and the antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GPx, and GR), however oxidative stress was induced under the 20 mu g/l MCLR treatment in which an enhanced OH content and alterations of the antioxidant enzymes were observed in the treated gills, although both treatments exerted little effect on LPO level. The principal component analysis results indicated that the most sensitive biomarkers of MCLR exposure were GST and GSH in zebrafish gill. So, D. rerio could be regarded as a suitable bioindicator of MCLR exposure by measuring CAT, GR, GST, and GSH as biomarkers.

AB  - We studied the levels and patterns of genetic variability in eight species of native fishes from the Valdivia River Basin (Region de los Rios, Chile), with the aim to estimate microevolutionary differences in species with similar ecological and historical conditions. The species considered were Diplomystes camposensis, Percilia gillissi, Galaxias platei, G. maculatus, Basilichthys australis, Percichthys trucha, Aplochiton zebra and A. taeniatus. We compared genetic diversity indexes both intra and inter-zones, and genetic structure, based on sequences of the control region for different sections along the river. In addition, we recovered relationships among haplotypes and their spatial distribution for each species, based on statistical parsimony networks. Estimators of past demographic behavior (D Tajima, Fs-Fu and mismatch analysis were also obtained. The results suggest that both patterns of genetic diversity in the river such as demographic responses are species specific. The most variable and strongest structured species in the river were G. maculatus and A. taniatus. P trucha showed high structure values but its genetic variation was lower than the first two species. The less variable and less subdivided species were D. camposensis and P gillissi. The remaining species showed levels of variability and structure intermediate between the two extreme patterns mentioned above. The differences among species are attributed to idiosyncratic biological attributes such as level of specificity in the use of aquatic habitat, population abundances, and historical migration patterns. In the case of G. maculatus, high levels of variability are attributed to the historical maintenance of high and stable effective population sizes, due to the ability to use both marine and freshwater habitats. Low levels of genetic diversity and indicators of historical reduction in effective population size, suggests that D. camposensis and P.gillissi were more sensitive and more exposed to population reduction. Results are discussed regarding ecological, biological, and historical factors.

AB  - The Predicted No-Effect Concentration (PNEC) is a key for ecological risk assessment. In this paper, the aquatic species existing widely in the Taihu Lake were selected, and their toxicity data to 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP), 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) and pentachlorophenol (PCP) were collected. The PNECs of 2,4-DCP; 2,4,6-TCP; and PCP were derived using three different approaches, i.e., the assessment factor (AF), species sensitivity distribution (SSD) as well as an eco-toxicological model (AQUATOX). As the results, PNECAFs were 2.18 g L-1, 2.53 g L-1 and 0.26 g L-1, and PNECSSDs were 77 g L-1, 197 g L-1 and 10 g L-1, respectively for 2,4-DCP; 2,4,6-TCP; and PCP respectively. Based on the aquatic conditions of the Taihu Lake, the derived site-specific PNECAQUATOXs were 15 g L-1, 67 g L-1 and 4 g L-1, respectively. In general, the PNECs for three chlorophenols derived from different approaches followed the declined order of PNECSSD PNECAQUATOX PNECAF. The ratios of PNECAF to PNECSSD and PNECAQUATOX to PNECSSD for three chlorophenols were 0.013-0.028 and 0.19-0.4, respectively. It indicated that PNECs obtained using different approaches may vary and the one based on the AF was the lowest. Therefore, PNECAF can be seen as overprotective. The PNECAQUATOX values for three chlorophenols were less than the corresponding PNECSSD values, mostly because the indirect effects were considered in the ecological model.

AB  - The state of soil degradation/regeneration in abandoned agricultural terraced fields over pumiceous tuffs has been assessed in this paper. In an initial stage, the relationships between soil types, surface microfeatures as indicators of soil degradation, physicochemical properties, plant colonization and vegetation structure were studied by means of multivariate statistical analyses (PCA, DCA, CCA and TWINSPAN (R)). Aerial photographs interpretation, DEMs and field surveys allowed us to identify 47 different environments for abandoned fields along 7 altitudinal transects (33 abandoned field terraces). In each study site, an inventory of the existing plant species and of morphological surface microfeatures were also made, by the line-intercept method.
   Plant colonization in the field plots studied relates to the variation of soils properties according to a climatic altitudinal gradient. The soil properties most closely related to the abandonment age (decrease of soil salinity and clay content, and increase of soil alkalinity and total organic C and N), have contributed to the growth of plant communities with a high degree of climacity.
   The protection degree offered to the soils by the different vegetation types as a function of their structure and life-forms strongly determines the occurrence of the different soil surface microfeatures as indicators of soil degradation or recovery.
   The acceleration of the early stages of succession by active planting of seeds from shrub species in the lower and upper areas, followed by reforestation in the latter ones, may be the best improvement practices to achieve an effective ecological recovery of the fields and simultaneously to attenuate soil degradation. The reassuming of agriculture may be desirable in those fields placed in middle heights, provided they show the best soil and climate conditions. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - 1. Fine-scale physical and chemical gradients and deep photosynthetic microbial populations were assessed to provide an initial characterisation of a small, thermally stratified reservoir (Cross Reservoir, Kansas, U.S.A.) and its deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM). Factors were identified that may affect vertical positioning of subepilimnetic photosynthetic sulphur bacteria (PSB) in lakes.
   2. Results indicate that Cross Reservoir is a mesotrophic, dimictic lake with large subepilimnetic chlorophyll maxima containing dense layers of PSB. Characteristics of the deep PSB community of Cross Reservoir strongly correlate with both light and nutrient gradients.
   3. The deep bacterial community mostly contained single-celled and aggregating green sulphur bacteria, specifically free-living Chlorobium limicola and the conspicuous motile ectosymbiotic consortium known as 'Chlorochromatium aggregatum'. The bacteria were within the anaerobic hypolimnion, beneath a metalimnetic plate of Cryptomonas spp. and within very low sulphide and light conditions [mean of 67 mugS L-1 and 0.05% photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)]. Pigment concentrations and fluorescence trends indicate that the bacteria made up a larger proportion of the DCM biomass than did phytoplankton in 1996.
   4. Cross Reservoir shares characteristics with natural lakes world-wide that also include a deep PSB community containing dense layers of 'C. aggregatum'. Correlation analyses indicate that PSB community positioning and density are related to light, sulphide supply, redox potentials and pH. A 2-factor principal components analysis (PCA) and other data trends supported these interpretations and indicated that PSB are sensitive to the thermal stability of the water column, are nitrogen limited and regulated more by sulphide or sulphide to light ratios than local levels of light. The sensitivity of these deep photosynthetic bacteria to environmental gradients, and their significance to some aquatic systems, demonstrate their potential as indicators of environmental disturbance.

AB  - 1. In the absence of historical water chemistry data, predictive biological indicator groups preserved in lake sediments can be employed to reconstruct the history of lake eutrophication. Diatoms are well established in this role, but to augment diatom-based inferences of nutrient status we investigate the potential use of chironomid midges (Insecta: Chironomidae).
   2. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of modern chironomid assemblages in surface sediments from 44 lakes in the English Midlands and Wales, U.K., shows that five environmental variables (total phosphorus (TP), bottom dissolved oxygen, maximum lake depth, Secchi depth and surface water temperature) make a statistically significant (P < 0.05) contribution to explaining the variance in the chironomid data, of which TP makes the largest contribution (29%).
   3. The relationship is used to develop a series of weighted averaging (WA) and partial least squares (PLS), (WA-PLS) models to infer log(10)TP. The models are evaluated by leave-one-out (jack-knifing) cross-validation. The simplest minimal adequate model is provided by WA with unweighted inverse deshrinking of root mean square error of prediction (RMSEPjack = 0.34 and r(jack)(2) = 0.60).
   4. Using this model, the trophic history of Betton Pool, Shropshire, U.K., is reconstructed from the mid-19th century to the present day and the results from the chironomid-TP model are compared with inferences from a diatom-TP model (Bennion, Juggins & Anderson, 1996). Both reconstructions suggest that there was a gradual rise in TP since 1850 AD until about 1974, followed by a more pronounced and rapid increase that has continued until the present. Inferred TP values from the WA chironomid inference model agree with diatom-inferred values.
   5. The study demonstrates that fossil chironomid assemblages can be used to investigate quantitatively the trophic history of lakes.

AB  - Effects of larval and algal culture density and diet, composition on development and survival of temperate asteroid larvae were studied in the laboratory at Santa Cruz, California, USA, during summer and fall of 1990. Larvae of Asterina miniata were reared at two densities, 0.5 or 1.0 ml(-1), and fed one or two species of cultured phytoflagellates-Dunaliella tertiolecta alone or mixed with Rhodomonas sp. - at three concentrations of 5x10(2), 5x10(3), and 5x10(4) total cells ml(-1). Algal concentration strongly influenced larval development: however, larval density also had a marked effect. Development progressed further with increasing algal concentration. Larval growth and differentiation were sometimes uncoupled, i.e., growth measures were directly related to food level, while differentiation indicators were less so. At the lowest food level, growth was negative and differentiation was arrested at early precompetent stages; these larvae never formed juvenile rudiments or brachiolar attachment structures. Development times of larvae given more food ranged from 26 to 50 d and depended directly on food availability. Development time to metamorphosis at the highest food concentration was similar for siblings fed D. tertiolecta alone or mixed with Rhodomonas sp. In contrast, when food level was an order of magnitude lower, larvae fed the algal mixture metamorphosed significantly earlier than larvae fed the unialgal diet. This suggests interactive effects of food quantity and food quality. Survival was little affected by larval or food density, except at the lowest ration. Feeding experiments in well-controlled laboratory conditions are useful to predict and compare the physiological or developmental scope of response of larvae to defined environmental factors; however, results from such studies should not be extrapolated to predict rates and processes of larval development in nature.

AB  - The ratio of dibenzothiophene to phenanthrene and the ratio of pristane to phytane, when coupled together, provide a novel and convenient way to infer crude oil source rock depositional environments and lithologies. Such knowledge can significantly assist in identifying the source formation(s) in a basin thereby providing valuable guidance for further exploration. The ability to infer this information from analysis of a crude oil is especially valuable as frequently the earliest samples in a new area may be shows and/or drill stem test samples from exploratory wells which are characteristically drilled on structural highs stratigraphically remote from the source formation(s).
   A cross-plot of dibenzothiophene/phenanthrene versus the pristane/phytane ratios measured on seventy-five crude oils from forty-one known source rocks ranging in age from Ordovician to Miocene consistently classified the oils into the following environment/lithology groups: marine carbonate; marine carbonate/ mixed and lacustrine sulfate-rich; lacustrine sulfate-poor; marine and lacustrine shale; and fluvial/deltaic carbonaceous shale and coal. The dibenzothiophene/phenanthrene ratio alone is an excellent indicator of source rock lithology with carbonates having ratios > 1 and shales having ratios < 1.
   The dibenzothiophene to phenanthrene and the pristane to phytane ratios can also be used to classify source rock paleodepositional environments. The classification scheme is based on the premise that these ratios reflect the different Eh-pH regimes resulting from the significant microbiological and chemical processes occurring during deposition and early diagenesis of sediments. The dibenzothiophene/phenanthrene ratio assesses the availability of reduced sulfur for incorporation into organic matter and the pristane/phytane ratio assesses the redox conditions within the depositional environment. Interpretation of these ratios has been aided by quantitative biomarker analysis and by carbon isotope data for pristane and phytane obtained by gas chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry.

AB  - Over recent decades, the South Branch Potomac River, West Virginia, has experienced fish kills and episodes of suppressed health in adult fish that have spanned small stretches to nearly 120 km of contiguous habitat. Although factors such as endocrine disruption, chemical contaminants, and infectious agents have been detected, no single causal mechanism has been identified. To gain information about the temporal nature of abnormalities, differences in life stage impacts, and potential risk factors, investigations of rank scores of macroscopic fish health indicators were conducted utilizing seasonal and annual boat electrofishing surveys for Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu (SMB) and Golden Redhorse Moxostoma erythrurum (GDR). Gill and body abnormalities were assigned rank scores for each fish based on visual severity and were tested for correlation with seasonal climatic (flow and stream temperature) and environmental (stream pH, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity) factors. Comparisons between juveniles and adults for these species indicated that body lesions were more common for adult GDR and gill lesions were more common for adult SMB. Significantly higher rank sums of adult gill abnormalities corresponded with heavy annual mortality of SMB between ages 2 and 3 (86%), the period during which this species transitions from juvenile to adult length. Higher ranks were frequently assigned to fish of both species for gill and body/fin lesions in summer and fall samples. Low stream discharge and lower pH correlated with elevations of body raised lesions (GDR) and body erosions (GDR and SMB) as well as erosions of the gill lamellae (SMB). This study connects the disciplines of fisheries management, fish health, and environmental monitoring, providing information gained through tracking the macroscopic conditions of these two indicator species to focus future studies and better understand risks to fish health.

AB  - Forestry harvesting represents an important economic activity around the world. Habitat degradation due to forest harvesting contributes to biodiversity loss; therefore, it is necessary to implement logging management aimed at reducing its impact. Forest management by reduce-impact logging (RIL) involves cutting trees following regulations focused on diminishing the impact on biodiversity by following harvesting plans based on forestry inventories and participation of trained workers. In Mexico, RIL is applied mainly in temperate habitats and its effectiveness has been assessed based on vascular plants. In this study, we analyzed the diversity and community structure of terrestrial and epiphytic mosses in managed (sites number = 3) and conserved (sites number = 3) sites in the temperate forest of Sierra Juarez, Oaxaca, Mexico. Likewise, we evaluated the potential function of mosses as indicators of habitat degradation. Environmental variables were also quantified at local (canopy coverage, altitude, daily temperature, and light) and regional (total annual rainfall, orientation, and slope) scales to evaluate potential relationships with the community and species diversity. We documented 70 mosses species with a diversity (alfa, beta) and community structure similar between managed and conserved sites. For terrestrial mosses, we found marginal differences in their communities, likely related to species coverture variation in managed sites. The diversity and community structure epiphytic mosses were not statistically different in managed and conserved sites. Only the daily variation in light intensity was positively related to the variation of alpha diversity of epiphytic mosses. The species Dicranum sumichrastii Duby and Leptodontium viticulosoides (P. Beauv.) Wijk & Margad. can be considered as ecological indicators for conserved and managed sites, respectively, likely due to their relationship with light and humidity conditions. Our results suggest that that forest management by RIL could be considered as a promising tool to balance timber production and moss diversity.

AB  - For a number of well-documented watersheds and their adjacent coastal zones, a simplified, but generic approach was developed to explore current nutrient deliveries to their corresponding marine system, characterized by their flushing rate/residence time and morphology. An indicator of eutrophication was defined derived from both the C:N:P:Si stoichiometry of the riverine nutrient delivery and the physical features of the receiving marine bay (B_ICEP). Results show that the morphological and hydrological conditions characterizing coastal zones are the main determinants of the manifestation of eutrophication caused by an imbalance of nitrogen (and/or phosphorus) with respect to silica in the river nutrient loading. Action on the structure of the agro-food system of the upstream watershed, which determines the nitrogen losses to the hydrosystem, is identified as the most efficient control for attenuating coastal eutrophication. A comprehensive and generic concept of the systemic processes responsible for river and coastal water degradation can be achieved with a chain of nested models, describing the terrestrial agro-food system of the watershed, the river network, including the biogeochemical processes responsible for water quality, and the ecological functioning of the receiving marine area, in terms of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and silica cycles. This leads to a land-to-sea continuum view, promoting interdisciplinarity and dialogue among the various scientific communities and their modeling approaches. This would also help the actors in multiple sectors (farming, fisheries, tourism, etc) and policy-makers make harmonized choices for a sustainable environment through an economically and socially viable way of life for all citizens.

AB  - Ore mineral extraction involves stripping of topsoils that can lead to eradication of soil biota, including nematodes. Hence, rehabilitation is needed to assist in the recovery of damaged soil ecosystems. In many developing countries, e.g., the Philippines, rehabilitation of soils is mostly carried out through addition of organic amendments and development of aboveground vegetation. Rehabilitation success is often judged based on the survival or growth rate of plants, (e.g., Acacia sp.). This may not be sufficient since tree species used for rehabilitation can tolerate harsh soil conditions. In the present study, we instead examined the response of soil nematodes that are often considered the most abundant soil taxa and play important roles in soil functioning. We assessed the re-establishment of nematode communities in 'rehabilitated' areas between 8 and 13 years after the onset of their rehabilitation by comparing nematode community descriptors (e.g., abundance, evenness and diversity indices) and genus composition of four different sites (three rehabilitated and one reference) between two time periods (2012 vs. 2014). Nematodes were collected in 2012 and 2014, and identified to the genus level using a traditional approach (morphology-based identification). Results show that despite the development of vegetation, there was an overall low abundance in all of the sampling sites in Sibutad probably due to a naturally extremely acidic soil pH in the area. Hints of recovery of nematode communities, however, were manifested by the increase in nematode abundance and genus richness, and by the appearance of 'sensitive' nematode genera in rehabilitated areas after two additional years of rehabilitation. Using the 2012 data, our results show that high Pb concentrations and a lack of organic matter in the topsoils influenced nematode genus composition; this can provide valuable information for the optimization of rehabilitation measures for disturbed soils.

AB  - In recent decades, the economic processes at both micro and macro levels have been affected significantly by the globalization, resulting in strengthening the ties and interaction between economies, promoting industrial development, tougher sector-wide competition and scientific and technological advancement. It has become increasingly challenging for many businesses to sustain a stable market position, not to mention business growth. It is beyond doubt that by focusing on growth and sustainability, economic entities develop the economy in general. However, it can affect other areas too. For example, expansion of production has a negative ecological impact, causing resource depletion and environmental pollution; and the desire to reduce costs often affects the working conditions and the wellbeing of employees. Recently, economic entities all over the world have been paying special attention to the environmental impact and social responsibility of business, which are two of the three main components of sustainable development. Therefore, the concept of sustainable development has been playing an increasingly significant role in every country in the world.
   Undoubtedly, many economic entities of today strive to adhere to the principles of sustainable development of business, which include economic success, environmental protection, and social wellbeing.
   The definition of "sustainable development" was first introduced in 1987 by the International Commission on Environment and Development. Despite this, the process of introducing the postulates of the International Commission into the activities of modern economic entities is still ongoing. Undoubtedly, many modern economic entities strive to adhere to the strategy of sustainable development, shaping their activities in the framework of compliance with the principles of financial success, causing the least damage to the environment and taking into account the social component.
   It is worth noting that the implementation of the concept of sustainable development in the management of a business entity requires the use of effective tools.

AB  - The inundation areas of floodplains are crucial to wetland ecosystems, especially in supporting biodiversity. Accurately identifying the spatial and temporal patterns of inundation areas is important for understanding floodplain ecosystem processes. Here, lakes in the Yangtze River Floodplain were divided into two types according to hydrological conditions: the natural connected lakes (Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake) with natural water level fluctuations and the isolated lakes (lakes in Jianghan Plain) with stable water levels. We established a method to identify inundation areas using multi-sources remote sensing data based on the Google Earth Engine. The dynamics of inundation areas were determined, and the relative indices were calculated in common year (2017) and a drought year (2018). The differences between the connected lakes and the isolated lakes were analyzed, and impacts of hydrological fluctuations on inundation area and habitat quality were evaluated. The results show that lakes with natural hydrological fluctuations have a greater regulative flexibility, with both patch density (PD) and submerged elasticity index (SEI) values higher than that of isolated lakes. The trend of the vegetation index in the connected lakes and in the isolated lakes is also different. The mean EVI in Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake showed a U-shaped trend which is similar to the shape of the trend of PD. The trend of mean enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the isolated lakes is the opposite and has a lower range of variation over a year. This study provides new indicators and rapid methods for habitat quality assessment in floodplains, as well as presenting scientific information useful for improving wetland management in the middle and lower Yangtze River.

AB  - The avoidance reaction by fish in front of an approaching vessel is a major source of bias in direct biomass assessment and ecological studies based on fisheries acoustics data. An experiment was carried out to compare echosounder data obtained using a small speedboat and a research fisheries vessel generating significant higher noise above conventional reduced-noise standard. The results show that there was no significant difference between the individual fish target strength distributions, and the numbers of schools recorded by both boats, these schools having similar areas and perimeters. However, the schools detected by the noisier vessel were significantly deeper, and unexpectedly had a significantly higher energy level. These findings suggest that noise-reduced vessels trigger a different vessel avoidance reaction. The noise-reduction standard is not sufficient to reduce avoidance behavior. It is also to take into consideration the ambient noise, which could impair perception of the platform by the fish, and the probability that the acoustic stimuli could be less important than visual perception under some local conditions. The paper introduces the concept of partial avoidance and presents a conceptual diagram of the strength of the avoidance reaction. Last, it is not recommended, because of noise reasons, that vessels routinely used for pelagic stock assessment surveys be changed. Indeed standardized time series, which could be disrupted when switching to a new vessel, are more important than the hypothetical gain from change to quieter vessels. Obviously, all long-term surveys must change vessels; best practice will be to estimate the vessel effect before any change to avoid disrupting the time series and/or perform vessel intercalibration surveys.

AB  - Concentrations of airborne chemical and biological agents from a hazardous release are not spread uniformly. Instead, there are regions of higher concentration, in part due to local atmospheric flow conditions which can attract agents. We equipped a ground station and two rotary-wing unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) with ultrasonic anemometers. Flights reported here were conducted 10 to 15 m above ground level (AGL) at the Leach Airfield in the San Luis Valley, Colorado as part of the Lower Atmospheric Process Studies at Elevation-a Remotely-Piloted Aircraft Team Experiment (LAPSE-RATE) campaign in 2018. The ultrasonic anemometers were used to collect simultaneous measurements of wind speed, wind direction, and temperature in a fixed triangle pattern; each sensor was located at one apex of a triangle with similar to 100 to 200 m on each side, depending on the experiment. A WRF-LES model was used to determine the wind field across the sampling domain. Data from the ground-based sensors and the two UASs were used to detect attracting regions (also known as Lagrangian Coherent Structures, or LCSs), which have the potential to transport high concentrations of agents. This unique framework for detection of high concentration regions is based on estimates of the horizontal wind gradient tensor. To our knowledge, our work represents the first direct measurement of an LCS indicator in the atmosphere using a team of sensors. Our ultimate goal is to use environmental data from swarms of sensors to drive transport models of hazardous agents that can lead to real-time proper decisions regarding rapid emergency responses. The integration of real-time data from unmanned assets, advanced mathematical techniques for transport analysis, and predictive models can help assist in emergency response decisions in the future.

AB  - Despite significant efforts to restore dryland ecosystems worldwide, the rate of success of restoration is extremely low in these areas. The role of cyanobacteria from soil biocrusts in reestablishing soil functions of degraded land has been highlighted in recent years. These organisms are capable of improving soil structure and promoting soil N and C fixation. Nevertheless, their application to restore functions of reconstructed soils in dryland restoration programs is yet to be harnessed. In this study, we used microcosms under laboratory conditions to analyse the effects of inoculating soil substrates used in post-mine restoration with a mixture of N-fixing cyanobacteria isolated from soil biocrust (Nostoc commune, Tolypothrix distorta and Scytonema hyalinum) on i) the recovery of the biocrust, and ii) the carbon sequestration and mineralisation rates of these substrates. Soils were collected from an active mine site in the mining-intensive biodiverse Pilbara region (north-west Western Australia) and consisted of previously stockpiled topsoil, overburden waste material, a mixture of both substrates, and a natural soil from an undisturbed area. Our results showed that cyanobacteria rapidly colonised the mine substrates, with biocrust coverage ranging from 23.8 to 52.2% and chlorophyll a concentrations of up to 12.2 mu g g(-1) three months after inoculation. Notably, soil organic C contents increased 3-fold (P < 0.001) in the mine waste substrate (from 0.6 g kg(-1) to 1.9 g kg(-1)) during this period of time. Overall, our results showed that cyanobacteria inoculation can rapidly modify properties of reconstructed soil substrates, underpinning the potential key role of these organisms as bio-tools to initiate recovery of soil functions in infertile, reconstructed soil substrates.

AB  - Corn (Zea mays L.) is an important cereal grain in many states and typically receives large N fertilizer inputs, irrespective of historical management. Tailoring N inputs to soil-specific conditions would help to increase efficiency of N use and avoid environmental contamination. A total of 47 trials were conducted on research stations and private farms in four different regions of North Carolina and Virginia from 2014 to 2016 to associate soil N availability with yield response to sidedress N application. Corn grain yield was 10.6 +/- 3.4 Mg ha(-1) on 36 sites and silage yield was 44.6 +/- 8.2 Mg ha(-1) on 11 sites. There was positive association between relative yield (i.e., yield without sidedress N application divided by yield with full fertilization) and levels of both plant available N (residual inorganic N + net N mineralization during 24 d) and the flush of CO2 following rewetting of dried soil during 3 d. Economically optimum N fertilizer requirement (EONR) at sidedress declined with increasing level of plant available N and soil-test biological activity (i.e., the flush of CO2). The scalable N factor for production at EONR declined from 20 kg N Mg-1 of grain (i.e., 1.1 lb N bu(-1)) with no soil biological activity to no N required with soil-test biological activity of 600 mg CO2-C kg(-1) in a 3-d period (depth of 0-10 cm). The flush of CO2 when determined in spring at or prior to planting corn was considered an ideal soil-test indicator of soil biological activity due to its simple, rapid, and reliable characteristics related to potential soil N mineralization and corn yield responses to applied N fertilizer.

AB  - The forms of zinc, cadmium, lead and copper in the snow cover of Chita were determined. According to the numerical ecological-geochemical and sanitary-hygienic indicators, it was revealed that the city territory is characterized by an average and high level of pollution of snow cover. The main load of toxic ions accounts for the dust fraction of snow. By the dust load Pn the most unfavorable were Central (more than 12 t * km2 * day.) and East (more than 7 t.km2.day.) part of the city of Chita. This is probably due to the high anthropogenic load and the predominant direction of air masses. In addition, the relief and climatic factors that increase the retention of dust and toxic substances in the formation of dense smog are of great importance. The calculated average total load of the studied metals from the dust fraction (Zp = 76,295) corresponds to the low level of pollution, but there were also anomalies where there was a high level of this indicator. The share of water-soluble forms of pollutants does not exceed an average of 0.3% of the total amount of heavy metals. By the average value of the total load index (ZC) the share of water-soluble forms was 10.9%. However, the danger of this polluting factor is high, and when calculating the coefficient of contamination, it is necessary to dilute the melt water with clean water 84 times for fishing purposes and 15 times for economic and drinking use. For all forms of pollutants, the main sources of environmental revenues are thermal power and motor transport enterprises. A significant accumulation of toxic elements in the snow cover of Chita is associated with an unsuccessful location of the main industrial enterprises, the terrain of the territory and specific climatic conditions.

AB  - Epidemiological observations of urban inhalation exposures to diesel exhaust (DE) and ozone (O-3) have shown pre-clinical cardiopulmonary responses in humans. Identifying the key biological mechanisms that initiate these health bioindicators is difficult due to variability in environmental exposure in time and from person to person. Previously, environmentally controlled human exposure chambers have been used to study DE and O-3 dose-response patterns separately, but investigation of co-exposures has not been performed under controlled conditions. Because a mixture is a more realistic exposure scenario for the general public, in this study we investigate the relationships of urban levels of urban-level DE exposure (300 mu g/m(3)), O-3 (0.3 ppm), DE + O-3 co-exposure, and innate immune system responses. Fifteen healthy human volunteers were studied for changes in ten inflammatory cytokines (interleukins 1 beta, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 12p70 and 13, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha) and counts of three white blood cell types (lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils) following controlled exposures to DE, O3, and DE+O-3. The results show subtle cytokines responses to the diesel-only and ozone-only exposures, and that a more complex (possibly synergistic) relationship exists in the combination of these two exposures with suppression of IL-5, IL-12p70, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha that persists up to 22-hours for IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. The white blood cell differential counts showed significant monocyte and lymphocyte decreases and neutrophil increases following the DE + O3 exposure; lymphocytes and neutrophils changes also persist for at least 22-hours. Because human studies must be conducted under strict safety protocols at environmental levels, these effects are subtle and are generally only seen with detailed statistical analysis. This study indicates that the observed associations between environmental exposures and cardiopulmonary effects are possibly mediated by inflammatory response mechanisms.

AB  - This study discusses a new use of DEA environmental assessment to measure a possible occurrence of desirable congestion, or eco-technology innovation, in electric power plants. The phenomenon is compared with an occurrence of undesirable congestion in this study. The identification of undesirable congestion is important to avoid a cost increase and a shortage of generation. However, the identification of desirable congestion is much more important than that of undesirable congestion from the perspective of environmental assessment. This study looks for a sustainable economic growth by identifying eco-technology innovation that can be effectively used to reduce the amount of air pollution so that electric power companies satisfy a governmental standard on environmental protection. The proposed approach is applied to evaluate the performance of coal-fired power plants in the United States. This study finds two policy implications. First, power plants operated by bituminous coal (i.e., black coal) outperform those with sub-bituminous coal (i.e., brawn coal). The result implies that power plants with sub-bituminous coal should be replaced by bituminous coal. Second, the undesirable congestion, due to a line limit between points of power generation and consumption, may occur on most of coal-fired power plants. In contrast, desirable congestion, due to eco-technology innovation, may occur on a limited number of power plants. Thus, the identification of desirable congestion assists us in selecting which technology, or the type of power plant, should be invested to facilitate eco-technology innovation and its related engineering management for a future sustainable economic growth.

AB  - Heavy metal pollution is a major environmental problem worldwide because of the longstanding toxicity and bioaccumulation of metals. The risk is pronounced in the environment adjacent to large industrial complexes and cities historically located along rivers. The aim of this paper was the application of multivariate statistical techniques: cluster analysis (CA), principal component analysis (PCA), and discriminant analysis (DA) to evaluate spatial and temporal variations of the heavy metals fraction of Pb, Cu, Zn, Fe, Ni, Cr, and Al during monitoring of surface water of Wadi El Bey in northern part of Tunisia. Water samples were collected seasonally from 13 sites along the Wadi during 2 years (2012-2013). Results indicated that the concentrations and distribution of heavy metals appear to be largely controlled by natural processes, anthropogenic activities, and climatic conditions. CA classified the sampling sites into three clusters: Lowly Polluted sites "LP" (S2, S3 and S6-S11), Moderately Polluted sites "MP" (S4 and S5), and Highly Polluted Site "HP" (S1) based on similarities of water quality characteristics. PCA applied to the data-sets indicated that the total variance of water quality in the HP, MP, and LP sites were about 94.91, 91.06, and 80.14%, respectively. DA results seem to identify Cu, Fe, Zn, and Al as the most significant parameters for discrimination between seasons; whereas, Pb, Cu, Ni, Cr, and Al were the most significant parameters used to control the spatial variation. Thus, DA allowed reduction in dimensionality of the large data-set, delineating a few indicator parameters responsible for large variations in water quality. This study presents necessity and usefulness of multivariate statistical techniques for evaluation and interpretation of large complex data-sets with a view to get better information about the water quality and design of monitoring network for effective management of water resources.

AB  - A pilot-scale open-water unit process wetland was monitored for one year and found to be effective in enhancing sunlight inactivation of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). The removal of Escherichia coli and enterococci in the open-water wetland receiving non-disinfected secondary municipal wastewater reached 3 logs and 2 logs in summer time, respectively. Pigmented enterococci were shown to be significantly more resistant to sunlight inactivation than non-pigmented enterococci. A model was developed to predict the inactivation of E. coli, and pigmented and non-pigmented enterococci that accounts for endogenous and exogenous sunlight inactivation mechanisms and dark processes. Endogenous inactivation rates were modeled using the sum of UVA and UVB irradiance. Exogenous inactivation was only significant for enterococci, and was modeled as a function of steady-state singlet oxygen concentration. The rate constants were determined from lab experiments and an empirical correction factor was used to account for differences between lab and field conditions. The model was used to predict removal rate constants for FIB in the pilot-scale wetland; considering the variability of the monitoring data, there was general agreement between the modeled values and those determined from measurements. Using the model, we estimate that open-water wetlands at 400 latitude with practical sizes can achieve 3-log (99.9%) removal of E. coli and non-pigmented enterococci throughout the year [5.5 ha and 7.0 ha per million gallons of wastewater effluent per day (MGD), respectively]. Differences in sunlight inactivation rates observed between pigmented and non-pigmented enterococci, as well as between lab-cultured and indigenous wastewater bacteria highlight the challenges of using FIB as model organisms for actual pathogens in natural sunlit environments.

AB  - The impacts of silvicultural disturbance (felling and burning) on lichens, mosses and liverworts in Eucalyptus obliqua-dominated wet forest in Tasmania were investigated. The study was based on presence-absence data for 452 taxa from 52 sampling events, spanning unlogged forest and disturbed, regenerating forest about 1, 3 and 5 years after disturbance. Three aspects of species composition were compared: total species richness, occurrence of pre-disturbance species in the post-disturbance flora and relative richness of ecological groups in the flora. Total species richness was the least reliable measure for evaluating changes due to disturbance.
   Felling and burning in different combinations were represented in a range of silvicultural treatments applied in the study area. They produced different levels of disturbance and different microhabitats, and thereby defined the character of the cryptogamic flora. The most severe impacts occurred at burnt sites, regardless of whether the forest had been felled or not, and the least impact was found in standing, unburnt forest.
   The consequences of severe disturbance were a substantial change in species composition, with a reduction, in particular, of mature wet forest species in favour of species associated with disturbance or brightly lit, exposed environments. In the lichens, the loss of old tree indicators, old forest indicators, foliicolous species, rare species of conservation significance and species indicative of a succession towards cool temperate rainforest was especially severe. Mosses and liverworts also showed a very pronounced loss of mature wet forest species. In the mosses, the presence of newcomers, represented mostly by disturbance species or species typical of open drier conditions, masked the extent of these losses. In the liverworts, there were few newcomers and the composition of the post-disturbance flora was much depleted.

AB  - A comprehensive probabilistic terrestrial ecological risk assessment (ERA) was conducted to characterize the potential risk of mosquito control insecticide (i.e., naled, it's metabolite dichlorvos, and permethrin) usage to adult butterflies in south Florida by comparing the probability distributions of environmental exposure concentrations following actual mosquito control applications at labeled rates from ten field monitoring studies with the probability distributions of butterfly species response (effects) data from our laboratory acute toxicity studies. The overlap of these distributions was used as a measure of risk to butterflies. The long-term viability (survival) of adult butterflies, following topical (thorax/wings) exposures was the environmental value we wanted to protect. Laboratory acute toxicity studies (24-h LD50) included topical exposures (thorax and wings) to five adult butterfly species and preparation of species sensitivity distributions (SSDs). The ERA indicated that the assessment endpoint of protection, of at least 90% of the species, 90% of the time (or the 10th percentile from the acute SSDs) from acute naled and permethrin exposures, is most likely not occurring when considering topical exposures to adults. Although the surface areas for adulticide exposures are greater for the wings, exposures to the thorax provide the highest potential for risk (i.e., SSD 10th percentile is lowest) for adult butterflies. Dichlorvos appeared to present no risk. The results of this ERA can be applied to other areas of the world, where these insecticides are used and where butterflies may be exposed. Since there are other sources (e.g., agriculture) of pesticides in the environment, where butterfly exposures will occur, the ERA may underestimate the potential risks under real-world conditions.

AB  - The Water Framework Directive (WFD) strengthened the need for the protection and enhancement of Ecological Quality Status (EQS) in water bodies of EU Member States. However, in terms of the EQS assessment, there is a lack of detailed studies that assess the consequences of dredging, especially concerning macrobenthic communities. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the EQS assessment, as important need to WFD, based on diversity and ecological quality indices after dredging activity.
   Data was collected in Mondego estuary, Portugal, between October 2007 and November 2008, within and around the area to be dredged (3 ha): one dredging occasion and ten sampling dates along one year. Physical chemical changes were examined. The relative performance of Margalef, Shannon-Wienner, AMBI-AZTI Marine Biotic Index and the multimetric BAT-Benthic Assessment Tool (BAT) were analyzed before and after dredging.
   In the first days, dredging increased the share of fine and coarse sand sediment and had changed TSS, POM and SOM, affecting the macrofauna assemblages. Two months after the dredging, the number of taxa, density, diversity and ecological indices showed similar values to pre-dredging conditions and one year later the number of species and density values almost duplicated. However, the macrofauna composition and structure were still significantly different in relation to pre-dredging and the biomass values did not return to the original values. Nevertheless, BAT was sensitive to the changes that occurred in the area, showing that the system recovered to pre-dredging values after one year, in terms of EQS. The present work reinforced the robustness of BAT as an accurate ecological quality assessment tool. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The South African government has publicized plans to install one million solar water heaters in households throughout South Africa by the year 2014, with the goals of reducing strain on existing electricity resources, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, creating employment and alleviating poverty. This paper examines two existing solar water heater installation projects with the aim of investigating the social contribution of the installation of solar water heaters in low-income households in South Africa. The Sustainable Urban Livelihoods approach (SULA) was adjusted to provide an analytical framework for the development of suitable indicators of social change in the context of renewable energies and energy poverty. Increases in household capital and the reduction of household vulnerability to shocks, stressors and seasonal variability as the result of solar water heater installation were investigated in projects in low-income housing developments in the cities of Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, South Africa.
   Data collected from paired household surveys (before and after installation) in over 600 households and qualitative information (Most Significant Change stories) show that the provision of a constant, cheap source of heated water contributed positively to the alleviation of energy poverty. Household capitals (categorised as Human, Social, Financial, Physical, Natural and Gender capital), including aspects such as health benefits and time and financial savings, were all positively effected by the installation of solar water heaters. In addition, improved energy security greatly reduced household vulnerability to shocks, stressors and seasonal variability. Comparison between the two projects revealed that the geographical setting (climatic conditions in particular), and the approach and strategies adopted by the implementers of the solar water heater installation project, greatly determine the extent to which benefits to the households are realised.

AB  - Following the USAF B-52 bomber accidents at Palomares, Spain in 1966 and at Thule, Greenland in 1968, radioactive particles containing uranium (U) and plutonium (Pu) were dispered into the environment. To improve long-term environmental impact assessments for the contaminated ecosystems, particles from the two sites have been isolated and characterized with respect to properties influencing particle weathering rates. Low Pu-239/U-235 (0.62-0.78) and Pu-240/Pu-239 (0.055-0.061) atom ratios in individual particles from both sites obtained by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) show that the particles contain highly enriched U and weapon-grade Pu. Furthermore, results from electron microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and synchrotron radiation (SR) based micrometer-scale X-ray fluorescence (mu-XRF) 2D mapping demonstrated that U and Pu coexist throughout the 1-50 mu m sized particles, while surface heterogeneities were observed in EDX line scans. SR-based micrometer-scale X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure Spectroscopy (mu-XANES) showed that the particles consisted of an oxide mixture of U (predominately UO2 with the presence of U3O8) and Pu ((III)/(IV), (IV)/(V) or (III), (IV) and (V)). Neither metallic U or Pu nor uranyl or Pu(VI) could be observed. Characteristics such as elemental distributions, morphology and oxidation states are remarkably similar for the Palomares and Thule particles, reflecting that they originate from similar source and release scenarios. Thus, these particle characteristics are more dependent on the original material from which the particles are derived (source) and the formation of particles (release scenario) than the environmental conditions to which the particles have been exposed since the late 1960s.

AB  - In the natural environment, hibernating sciurids generally remain dormant during winter and enter numerous deep torpor bouts from the time of first immergence in fall until emergence in spring. In contrast, black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) remain active throughout winter but periodically enter short and shallow bouts of torpor. While investigating body temperature (T-b) patterns of black-tailed prairie dogs from six separate colonies in northern Colorado, we observed one population that displayed torpor patterns resembling those commonly seen in hibernators. Five individuals in this population experienced multiple torpor bouts in immediate succession that increased in length and depth as winter progressed, whereas 16 prairie dogs in five neighboring colonies remained euthermic for the majority of winter and entered shallow bouts of torpor infrequently. Our results suggest that these differences in torpor patterns did not result from differences in the physiological indicators that we measured because the prairie dogs monitored had similar body masses and concentrations of stored lipids across seasons. Likewise, our results did not support the idea that differences in overwinter T-b patterns between prairie dogs in colonies with differing torpor patterns resulted from genetic differences between populations; genetic analyses of prairie dog colonies revealed high genetic similarity between the populations and implied that individuals regularly disperse between colonies. Local environmental conditions probably played a role in the unusual T-b patterns experienced by prairie dogs in the colony where hibernation-like patterns were observed; this population received significantly less rainfall than neighboring colonies during the summer growing seasons before, during, and after the year of the winter in which they hibernated. Our study provides a rare example of extreme plasticity in thermoregulatory behaviors of free-ranging prairie dogs and provides evidence contrary to models that propose a clear delineation between homeothermy, facultative torpor, and hibernation.

AB  - We have previously documented that faecal indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli, faecal coliform, enterococci) recommended by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to establish recreational water quality standards are naturally found in high concentrations in the surface and subsurface of soils in Hawaii. Rain. the source of all streams in Hawaii, washes the soil sources of faecal bacteria into all the streams of Hawaii, at concentrations which consistently exceed the USEPA recreational water quality standards. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that faecal bacteria are able to establish themselves in the soil environments of tropical islands by conducting the same study in Guam, a tropical pacific island with warmer temperatures and higher humidity than Hawaii. The same methods and study design used in Hawaii was used in Guam. The results of the study conducted in Guam revealed that all streams contain consistently high concentrations of faecal coliform, E, coli, and enterocci which exceeded the old USEPA recreational water quality standard of 200 faecal coliform/100 mi as well as the new water quality standards of 126 E, coli/100 mi or 33 enterococci/100 mi. These same faecal indicator bacteria were recovered in high concentrations in surface and subsurface (18-36 cm depth) soil samples in Guam. Limited coastal water analysis showed that most coastal marine waters contain low concentrations of faecal bacteria but coastal waters impacted by stream run-off showed elevated levels of faecal bacteria. The results of this study support the hypothesis that environmental conditions in the tropical areas of the world can support the growth and establishment of populations of faecal bacteria in the soil. Thus, soil becomes an environmental, non-faecal source of faecal indicator bacteria. These results indicate that USEPA water quality standards may not be directly applicable to tropical island environments.

AB  - A detailed Pan-European sclerochronological study was carried out on two Jurassic corals, Thamnasteria concinna (Goldfuss) and Isastraea explanta (Goldfuss), the aim of which was firstly, to identify the controls on the deposition of growth bands, on both a regional and local scale, and secondly, to assess the potential value of Mesozoic sclerochronology as a tool for palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic interpretations.
   The results indicate that Isastraea explanata was the faster growing of the two species with growth rates reaching 4.0 mm/yr where conditions were optimal for coral growth (compared with 2.8 mm/yr for Thamnasteria concinna in the same environment). In deep-water environments, growth rates of both corals were considerably lower. This reduction in growth rate is accompanied by a change in growth form from dome-shaped colonies in shallow water to plate-shaped forms in deeper water. Both the reduction in growth rate and change in growth form are interpreted as a response to a reduction in light availability in the deep-water reefs. However, although Thamnasteria concinna had the lower growth rate of the two corals it showed a substantially greater variability in its growth rate between different reef environments (up to 50 per cent. of its optimal growth rate).
   Data from similar reef types have been compared from different palaeolatitudes in an attempt to identify a palaeoclimatic gradient. No systematic palaeolatitudinal changes in the nature of the growth banding or the growth rate are seen. This is inferred to be a consequence of a Jurassic climate more equable than at present. Reefs from high palaeolatitudes have low growth rates and L/H (low/high) density band ratios. It is suggested that this is a response to low solar radiation. The study therefore shows that these corals can provide useful data for palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic work and should be included, where possible, in such investigations.

AB  - Desert locust plagues can easily cause a regional food crisis and thus affect social stability. Preventive control of the disaster highlights the early detection of hopper gregarization before they form devastating swarms. However, the response of hopper band emergence to environmental fluctuation exhibits a time lag. To realize the dynamic forecast of band occurrence with optimal temporal predictors, we proposed an SVM-based model with a temporal sliding window technique by coupling multisource time-series imagery with historical locust ground survey observations from between 2000-2020. The sliding window method was based on a lagging variable importance ranking used to analyze the temporal organization of environmental indicators in band-forming sequences and eventually facilitate the early prediction of band emergence. Statistical results show that hopper bands are more likely to occur within 41-64 days after increased rainfall; soil moisture dynamics increasing by approximately 0.05 m(3)/m(3) then decreasing may enhance the chance of observing bands after 73-80 days. While sparse vegetation areas with NDVI increasing from 0.18 to 0.25 tend to witness bands after 17-40 days. The forecast model combining the optimal time lags of these dynamic indicators with other static indicators allows for a 16-day extended outlook of band presence in Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya. Monthly predictions from February to December 2020 display an overall accuracy of 77.46%, with an average ROC-AUC of 0.767 and a mean F-score close to 0.772. The multivariate forecast framework based on the lagging effect can realize the early warning of band presence in different spatiotemporal scenarios, supporting early decisions and response strategies for desert locust preventive management.

AB  - Dam removal is an increasingly important method of stream restoration, but most removal efforts are under-studied in their effects. In order to better understand the effects of such removals on the stream ecosystem, we examined changes in stream macroinvertebrate communities from 2011-2016. Comparisons were focused above, below, and before and after the October 2012 removal of the Brown Bridge Dam on the Boardman River in Michigan (USA), as well as to new channel sites created in its former reservoir (2013-2015). Using linear mixed-effect models on the percent abundance of ecologically sensitive taxa (% Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera (EPT)), total density of all macroinvertebrates, overall taxa richness, and Functional Feeding Groups, along with multivariate analyses on the community matrix, we examined differences in community composition among sites and years. EPT declined downstream of the dam immediately after dam removal, but recovered in the second year, becoming dominant within 2-4 years. Downstream sites before removal had different community composition than upstream sites and downstream sites after removal (p<0.001), while upstream and downstream sites after removal converged towards similarity. New channel (restored) %EPT, density, and taxa richness were not different from upstream sites in any year following removal, but new channel sites were the most distinct in community composition, possessing multiple indicator taxa characteristic of unique new conditions. The invasive New Zealand mud snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) was absent from all sites prior to dam removal, but appeared at low densities in upstream sites in 2013, had spread to all sites by 2015, and showed large increases at all sites by 2016. Managers employing dam removal for stream restoration should include post-removal monitoring for multiple years following removal and conduct risk analysis regarding potential effects on colonization of invasive invertebrate species.

AB  - The Turquoise-fronted Amazon Amazona aestiva is one of the most extensively poached species as a result of illegal trade in Brazil. Reintroduction programs have been increasingly used in the management of these animals in captivity. Several preparatory procedures should be carried out during the pre-release period to characterize the group of animals and subsequently increase the success of reintroduction programs. The most important procedures are temperament assessment and environmental enrichment training, which is expected to influence the behavior of the released birds. This study aimed to assess the temperament of the amazons in captivity and its influence on a reintroduction program. The temperaments of 50 parrots were classified from shy to bold and monitored during five phases of activity throughout the study: environmental enrichment training in captivity, a period of acclimatization in an aviary placed in the release area, the offer of fruit from the release region, dependence on the aviary after it was opened, and post-release food supplementation. Once the animals were released, they were monitored for 18 months. Temperament assessment supported the reintroduction project, because through this information it was possible to predict the individual behaviors of reintroduced animals when dealing with environmental challenges. The purpose of the pre-release environmental enrichment training was to encourage individual amazons to increase exploratory behaviors, and was effective in enhancing the natural behavior of the species and reducing stereotypies. Animals classified as shy required a longer intervention period to achieve the same results since they exhibited greater dependence on the aviary and, consequently, took longer to explore the release area. In the medium term, no significant difference was observed between shy and bold parrots in their departure after opening the aviary, use of supplementary feeding, or survival. Therefore, the activities performed prior to release adequately promoted similar habituation conditions for both profiles.

AB  - This paper takes random machines breakdowns and the two-stage assembly flow shop problem into consideration as a realistic assumption in industrial environments. In practical manufacturing environment, disruptions and unforeseen incidents occur, so a schedule being built based on deterministic information is not practical and may lead to poor performance. In this paper, machines in manufacturing and assembly stages are not always available due to random machines breakdowns which occur during processing of each operation. The goal is to minimize the expected the weighted sum of makespan and mean of completion time. Owning to its problem complexity and since the problem belongs to NP-hard class, use of meta-heuristic algorithms is justified to tackle the potential complexity of the problem considered, and hence, we proposed four meta-heuristics algorithms entitled: genetic algorithm, imperialist competitive algorithm, cloud theory-based simulated annealing and new self-adapted differential evolutionary (NSDE) to solve it. Machine breakdown and dynamic nature of the problem, the structural complexity increases markedly. In this regard, to overcome this form of complexity, simulation techniques are typically employed. Eventually, since the proposed problem has both types of complexities (algorithm complexity and structural complexity), simulation is integrated into the proposed meta-heuristic approaches to handle the complexities. We apply artificial neural network as a tuning tool for predicting the input parameters of each proposed meta-heuristics algorithms in uncertain condition. Also, we suggest Taguchi method as one the most important adjusting approaches for analyzing the effect of input parameters in each algorithm. The computational results show which proposed NSDE statistically is better than other proposed meta-heuristics algorithms according two important indicators: quality of solution and computational time.

AB  - Alternative scheme is the most important section in the environmental impact assessment (EIA). And the optimization of alternative schemes are the focus research fields in EIA. This paper define the content of alternatives of basin hydropower planning EIA (HPEIA), including the alternative generation about development patterns (single high stage dam or multistage dams) and development scales (dam height, installed capacity). The multi-objective model for alternatives generating of HPEIA has been built, which aims to reduce the impacts on socio-economic development and to increase the generated energy. Objectives of the model include ecological landscape change rate, installed capacity, cultivated field inundation area, and resettlement population, and water level is the decision variable. The basic data is obtained by remote sensing images and processed in ARCGIS: (1) obtain the water level-water surface area curve based on the DEM; (2) divide the landscape patterns in submerged area; (3) decide the centralism population distribution scope and their elevation boundary in the map. Moreover, multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO), by which the non-inferior solution sets of the multi-objective model are made, and combining with PSO and grey relational analysis. This model is tested in the hydropower planning alternativesgenerating in Hei Shanxia reach, Yellow River. The comparative analysis of the three optimal sequences was investigated. One is to get the theoretical solution which presents the highest relativity, the other is obtain the solution on the condition of maximum installed capacity, and the third is to achieve the practical solution that is consistent with the decision objectives. The results of the above analysis show that the multi-objective model of alternatives generating of HPEIA can meet the competitive principle. Application of the PSO is suggested to be a helpful tool that solve the multi-objective model. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fish parasites are widely used as biological tags of stocks and populations of their hosts at large spatial scales, but less frequently at small geographical scales. The application of this methodology at small scales requires heterogeneity in the availability of infective stages of parasites and hosts with high site fidelity. Here we tested the value of parasite tags at both large and small spatial scales using the Argentine silverside, Odontesthes argentinensis (Valenciennes, 1835) as a model. This is a marine fish that can tolerate a wide range of salinities and has great phenotypic plasticity, which has promoted adaptive divergences at reduced spatial scales across populations, in the absence of geographical barriers isolating them, which could be reflected in their parasite assemblages. A total of 142 specimens were examined for parasites. Samples were collected at two close localities from each of two different biogeographical regions of the south-western Atlantic. The structure and composition of both parasite infracommunities and component communities were analysed through uni and multivariate statistics. All sites were significantly different in their infracommunity structure, even those that were at shorter distances from each other. However, infracommunity composition and component community structure showed higher similarities within each region than between samples from different ones. These results proved that fish parasites are valuable tools to assess fine-scale population structure of their hosts when site fidelity and adaptations to local conditions prevail. The inclusion of parasite indicators as complementary tools in such kind of studies can provide valuable evidence for those resources requiring stock assessments and management at fine-scale, in order to prevent negative impacts over exploited populations.

Also, we adopted the standard live staining technique to assess the ecological responses of copepods to oxygen-deficient waters. Based on 18 weekly/biweekly sampling sessions in the nearshore-waters along the Southwest coast of India, spanning over the Pre-Southwest Monsoon (April) to Late-Southwest Monsoon (September) of 2014, this study showed a noticeable decrease in the total abundance of copepods in the hypoxic subsurface waters associated with coastal upwelling. This feature was noticed particularly during the Peak Southwest Monsoon (July-August), which was contrary to the usual temporal abundance pattern of copepods in the aerated surface waters. During the Southwest Monsoon, the percentage of dead copepods was noticeably high in the study area, especially in the subsurface waters, due to the physiological stress from hypoxic waters. Indicator Value (IndVal) analysis of copepods demarcated 8 indicator species (IndVal > 40) under different environmental conditions. During the Pre-Southwest Monsoon, the indicator species were Acartia erythraea, A. danae, Centropages orsini and C. furcatus, whereas Oithona similis was the indicator during the Peak-Southwest Monsoon. Pseudodiaptomus serricaudatus and Centropages tenuiremis were the indicators during the Late Southwest Monsoon, whereas Temora turbinata was an indicator during both the Early- and Late- Southwest Monsoon periods. The overall pattern in the distribution of copepods evidenced the dominance of calanoids during the Pre-Southwest Monsoon and that of cyclopoids (O. similis, Oithona sp.,) during the Peak-Southwest Monsoon. Multivariate analysis showed that the observed temporal shift in the composition and increase in the number of dead individuals of copepods in the study region were mainly governed by the coastal upwellingassociated hydrographical settings.

AB  - In developing countries, the protection of biodiversity and ecosystemservices (ES) rests on the hands of millions ofsmall landowners that coexistwith large properties, in a reality of highly unequal land distribution. Guiding the effective allocation of ES-based incentives in such contexts requires researchers and practitioners to tackle a largely overlooked question: for a given targeted area, will single large farms or several small ones provide the most ES supply? The answer to this question has important implications for conservation planning and rural development alike, which transcend efficiency to involve equity issues. We address this question by proposing and testing ES supply-area relations (ESSARs) around three basic hypothesized models, characterized by constant (model 1), increasing (model 2), and decreasing increments (model 3) of ES supply per unit of area or ES "productivity". Data to explore ESSARs came from 3384 private landholdings located in southern Chile ranging from 0.5 ha to over 30,000 ha and indicators of four ES (forage, timber, recreation opportunities, and water supply). Forage provision best fit model 3, which suggests that targeting several small farms to provide this ES should be a preferred choice, as compared to a single large farm. Timber provision best fit model 2, suggesting that in this case targeting a single large farm would be a more effective choice. Recreation opportunities best fit model 1, which indicates that several small or a single large farmof a comparable size would be equally effective in delivering this ES. Water provision fitmodel 1 ormodel 2 depending on the study site. The results corroborate that ES provision is not independent fromproperty area and therefore understanding ESSARs is a necessary condition for setting conservation incentives that are both efficient (deliver the highest conservation outcome at the least cost) and fair for landowners.

AB  - Foot health represents an issue in wild avifauna breeding practices. In particular, prevalence of digital ulceration (DU) and foot pad dermatitis (FPD) are valid indicators of welfare in wildlife conservation centres and may be interpreted as to fitness for bird's reintroduction into the wild. This study meant to test the effects of raising practices on foot pad health in captive Sardinian partridges (Alectoris barbara barbara Bonnaterre, 1790) reared for biodiversity conservation, to assess welfare and fitness to reintroduction into nature. A total of 22 couples were allotted into two experimental groups. In one group, 10 couples were housed in 10 cages for breeding partridges, consisting of two animals each, with metal wire flooring system, above trays where droppings were collected. The remaining 12 couples were housed in six aviaries, consisting of four animals each, on natural (earth and stones) ground. In both groups, partridges were fed identical diets. No significant differences of food pad scoring were found between birds housed in cages (2.3 +/- 0.4) and those reared in aviaries on natural ground (2.5 +/- 0.6). Moreover, scores of male foot pads for both groups (2.4 +/- 0.6) had no significant differences in comparison with female foot pads, independently on housing (2.5 +/- 0.4). Body mass (BM) was higher (+4.36%) than average BM reported for wild Sardinian partridges. Digital ulceration was found in the 20% of females, exclusively from the cage group. Body mass of females in cages with metal wire flooring appeared to be significantly (p<.001) and negatively correlated (r=-.528) with DU prevalence. These results suggest that housing conditions impacts differently on behaviour of females and males in one same couple, and this relates to foot health, in particular as to DU prevalence.

AB  - Background: Autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis represent the three major autoimmune liver diseases (AILDs). Their management is highly specialized, requires a multidisciplinary approach and often relies on expensive, orphan drugs. Unfortunately, their treatment is often unsatisfactory, and the care pathway heterogeneous across different centers. Disease-specific clinical outcome indicators (COIs) able to evaluate the whole cycle of care are needed to assist both clinicians and administrators in improving quality and value of care. Aim of our study was to generate a set of COIs for the three AILDs. We then prospectively validated these indicators based on a series of consecutive patients recruited at three tertiary clinical centers in Lombardy, Italy.
   Methods: In phase I using a Delphi method and a RAND 9-point appropriateness scale a set of COIs was generated. In phase II the indicators were applied in a real-life dataset.
   Results: Two-hundred fourteen patients were enrolled and followed-up for a median time of 54 months and the above COIs were recorded using a web-based electronic medical record program. The COIs were easy to collect in the clinical practice environment and their values compared well with the available natural history studies.
   Conclusions: We have generated a comprehensive set of COIs which sequentially capture different clinical outcome of the three AILDs explored. These indicators represent a critical tool to implement a value-based approach to patients with these conditions, to monitor, compare and improve quality through benchmarking of clinical performance and to assess the significance of novel drugs and technologies.

AB  - Earthworms, as ecosystem engineers, help to mineralize soil organic matter, construct and maintain soil structure, and often stimulate plant growth and protect plants from pests. The aim of this study was (i) to determine the connection between earthworm traits and indicators of soil ecosystem services and (ii) to identify earthworm "response" traits, which are selected by the landscape or changes in the soil, and "effect" traits, which contribute to soil processes. In the southern portion of the state of Para (eastern Brazilian Amazonia), we sampled earthworms at 135 points distributed among 3 locations, 9 sub locations and 27 farms (5 sampling points per farm). At each point, three 25 cm x 25 cm soil samples were hand-sorted for earthworms. We measured eight functional traits in 1148 individuals: relative gizzard size, type of typhlosole, length and type of caudal setae, pigmentation, overall length, thickness of septa and musculature in anterior segments. We found a significant, although relatively low, relationship between landscape classes and trait proportions. Earthworm trait proportions significantly covaried with soil parameters and indicators of soil ecosystem services. We did not find significant covariation between earthworm morphospecies and soil ecosystem services. We identified earthworm "response" traits that had been selected and assessed consequences of these changes on effects of earthworm communities (via their "effect" traits) on soil processes and ecosystem services. Typhlosole type, gizzard size and septa thickness were identified as "response" traits selected by soil and landscape conditions. These traits were also identified as "effect" traits for their influence on soil structure. Results indicated a connection between earthworm traits and landscape degradation and soil services, which is a new step toward conceptualizing earthworm ecological studies that go beyond the species level.

AB  - 1.Recent advances in the understanding of lamprey migrations have led to concerns over the impacts of obstructions on the demography of many species. This study investigated sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) larvae (ammocoetes) in two adjacent but contrasting rivers, both designated Special Areas of Conservation under the EC Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC), one (the River Wye) with a small number of potential migration obstructions in its upper reaches and one (the River Usk) with obstacles along its course. The geographical distributions, densities and age structures of the ammocoete populations were examined in relation to the locations of potential obstructions to the spawning migrations of anadromous adults.
   2. A minimum of three age classes was recorded as far as 200 km upstream of the mouth of the River Wye (93% of the length of the mainstem), demonstrating that adults regularly migrate to the upper reaches of the catchment (downstream of a natural waterfall). By contrast, sea lamprey ammocoetes appeared to be absent (in suitable habitat) from 20 km (17%) of the River Usk, and there was a reduction in density, prevalence and the number of age classes upstream of two putative spawning-migration obstructions.
   3. This study highlights some of the potential impacts of habitat fragmentation by obstructions on the spawning migrations of anadromous species, as inferred from ammocoete demography. When used in combination to compare contiguous reaches, ammocoete densities, prevalence and age structure may be a useful indicator of which structures are likely to be important migration obstructions, and where further studies or mitigation efforts should be focused. It is likely that passage past some obstructions is enhanced if high river levels occur during the spawning migration, but there is a need to facilitate passage during all conditions, to improve access to under-exploited spawning and nursery areas.

AB  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is an essential component of the biogeochemical marine system, effecting biological and chemical reactions that take place in the sea. DOC represents a dynamic component of the global carbon cycle.
   This paper reports 25 years of measurements of DOC content and distribution at seven stations along the transect Po River delta - Rovinj in the northern Adriatic (NA). The results show strong, temporal and spatial variability: (1) The highest average DOC concentrations were observed in 1998 and 2002 (143 mu mol/L and 137 mu mol/L, respectively); (2) The minimum average DOC was recorded in 2006 (88 mu mol/L) and (3) The short-term DOC accumulation (up to 203, average 102 mu mol/L) for the years 2009 to 2012, was observed during the summer and autumn months followed by unusually low DOC concentrations during the winter and spring. The DOC results from the more recent monitoring at the same stations indicate primarily oligotrophic characteristics of the NA seawater (88 mu mol/L).
   The results of DOC variability and distribution in the NA appears to be strongly influenced by complex circulation patterns. This paper provides a "link" between the Ionian circulation and the NA ecosystem as a part of the recently identified Adriatic-Ionian Bimodal Oscillating System (BiOS). A good agreement between the BiOS oscillation and other variables related to the DOC concentration, like the NA A and B winter types, the Po River discharge, salinity, chlorophyll a, occurrence of hypoxic-anoxic conditions, eutrophication and oligotrophication, suggests that DOC might be a good tool and indicator of global change.

AB  - Humans have grazed on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) for many thousands of years. In recent decades, the intensity of grazing has increased and several new management strategies have been put into place to address the resulting changes in rangeland condition. Effective management of grazing activities in this region requires understanding the impact of livestock grazing across the diverse array of alpine grassland ecosystems present in the QTP, but recent studies have identified a number of critical uncertainties in the ecological science that underlies these management principles. To address these uncertainties, we carried out a synthesis analysis of the effect of livestock grazing on 26 indicators of ecosystem structure and function based on 61 studies from 88 independent research sites within the QTP. Our synthesis results indicate that livestock grazing exerts complex controls on ecosystem structure and function, which vary according to local landscape characteristics. We found that grazing contributes to greater plant species diversity (Shannon-Wiener index, Simpson dominance index, and Pielou evenness index significantly increased 0.18, 0.05, and 0.03, respectively, due to grazing), but decreased aboveground biomass (47.15%), soil organic carbon (12.41%), soil total nitrogen (12.75%), and microbial biomass carbon (9.42%). Further, ecosystem function is controlled by interactions between grazing and other landscape characteristics such as elevation and mean annual temperature. The management regime currently in place in the QTP, which involves complete exclusion of grazing in some areas, can have variable effects on grassland health. Therefore, the complexity of these responses is an indication that livestock and grassland management may benefit from a more nuanced management regime than is currently utilized in the QTP.

AB  - Lake Chaohu is one of the most eutrophic lakes in China. Research on this lake's seasonal and spatial variations in phytoplankton diversity is needed to understand the distribution of eutrophication, as well as to find appropriate comprehensive biodiversity indices to assess the eutrophication status of the lake. The present study indicated that the Margalef index of all samples was as low as 0.799 +/- 0.543 in summer (August 2011) and as high as 1.467 +/- 0.653 in winter (February 2012). The Margalef index of the river samples had a high mean value and substantial variation compared with the lake samples. The Peilou index of the lake samples was higher than that of the river samples in summer and autumn (November 2011) but lower than that of the river samples in winter. In spring (May 2012), the Peilou index of the western samples was lower than that of the eastern samples. The spatial distribution of the Shannon-Wiener index was more similar to that of the Peilou index in autumn and winter, while in spring and summer, the spatial distribution was affected by both species richness and evenness. High eutrophication levels occurred in the western lake in spring and summer, whereas high levels occurred in the eastern lake, especially in the middle of the lake, in autumn and winter. The total trophic state index (TSI) in all samples exhibited a significant negative correlation with the Margalef (r = -0.726) and Peilou (r = -0.530) indices but a significant positive correlation with the Shannon-Wiener (r = 0.654) index. The partial correlation analysis results implied that these phytoplankton biodiversity indices could serve as synthetic ecological indicators to assess the eutrophication condition of Lake Chaohu.

AB  - AimPalaeoendemics are clades that are ancient but geographically restricted, often because they have been selected against in other areas. Ecological similarities among palaeoendemics may be indicators of ancient environments. We determine the environmental ranges of the remarkable palaeoendemic plants of Tasmania to deduce whether they indicate the long-term persistence of particular environmental conditions.
   LocationTasmania, Australia, a global centre of plant palaeoendemism, containing some of the world's most relictual plant lineages.
   MethodsPalaeoendemic clades in Tasmania were identified using a scoring system of clade age divided by the square root of the number of 10kmx10km grid cells occupied globally. Total palaeoendemism scores for 1199 30 grid cells were calculated by summing scores for individual clades, and modelled against climate, topography, geology and vegetation type using Random Forest models. Palaeoendemic and non-palaeoendemic species richness in climate space was measured. The global distribution of climates favoured by palaeoendemics was assessed.
   ResultsTwenty-nine phylogenetically and ecologically diverse palaeoendemic clades (51 species) were identified. High levels of palaeoendemism occurred widely in western Tasmania, but the highest scoring areas were at or slightly above the tree line in relatively undisturbed vegetation. Palaeoendemism scores were strongly predicted by constantly moist climates lacking extreme temperatures, and by open vegetation types with rare or no fire. The palaeoendemics occupied a climate space that is globally rare and very different from that of non-palaeoendemics.
   Main conclusionsThese patterns suggest the persistence since the Cretaceous of open vegetation in constantly moist areas with equable temperatures and few or no fires. This conclusion is consistent with an increasing body of fossil and phylogenetic evidence for the antiquity of open vegetation. The methods here produce quantitative values of palaeoendemism that can be compared among regions.

AB  - Assessments of the impact of construction, operation, and removal of large infrastructures and other human activities on the marine environment are limited because they do not fully quantify the background baseline conditions and relevant scales of natural variability. Baselines as defined in Environmental Impact Assessments typically reflect the status of the environment and its variability drawn from published literature and augmented with some short term site specific characterization. Consequently, it can be difficult to determine whether a change in the environment subsequent to industrial activity is within or outside the range of natural background variability representative of an area over decades or centuries. An innovative approach that shows some promise in overcoming the limitations of traditional baseline monitoring methodology involves the analysis of shell material (sclerochronology) from molluscs living upon or within the seabed in potentially affected areas. Bivalves especially can be effective biomonitors of their environment over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. A rapidly expanding body of research has established that numerous characteristics of the environment can be reflected in morphological and geochemical properties of the carbonate material in bivalve shells, as well as in functional responses such as growth rates. In addition, the annual banding pattern in shells can provide an absolute chronometer of environmental variability and/or industrial effects. Further, some species of very long-lived bivalves can be crossdated back in time, like trees, by comparing these annual banding patterns in their shells. It is therefore feasible to develop extended timeseries of certain marine environmental variables that can provide important insights into long temporal scales of baseline variability. We review recent innovative work on the shell structure, morphology, and geochemistry of bivalves and conclude that they have substantial potential for use as monitors of environmental variability and the effects of pollutants and disturbance.

AB  - High mountains are humid islands in arid central Asia, and alpine vegetation is sensitive to climate change, especially to temperature variations. Here we present a palynological sequence and discuss the past vegetation and climate changes based on core BY10A from the Swan Lake, an alpine lake situated at an inter-montane basin in the central Tienshan Mountains, Xinjiang, northwestern China. We collected 52 modern pollen surface samples at different elevations to aid in the interpretation of fossil-pollen data, which provide a reconstruction of vegetation and climate history for the last 8.5 ka (1 ka = 1000 cal yr BP). Artemisia and Amaranthaceae (= Chenopodiaceae) are the main pollen types in desert steppe zone below 1800 m elevation, while Poaceae and Picea dominate the mid-elevation forest steppe zone (1800-2800 m). Cyperaceae is the main indicator of high alpine meadows (>2800 m). From 8.5 to 6.9 ka, the vegetation was steppe meadow suggesting relatively warm climate. From 6.9 to 2.6 ka generally high values of Cyperaceae and peaty sediments indicate a fen environment and cooler, more humid conditions. Interrupting this mid-Holocene period is a 5.5-4.5 ka millennium of lacustrine sediments with lower Cyperaceae, higher Poaceae and Artemisia, and high values of Myriophyllum and Pediastrum indicating higher water levels and warmer temperatures. After 2.6 ka, pollen data indicate alpine steppe and warmer climate. The mid-Holocene pattern of cooler climate interrupted by a warmer period is consistent from other regional records from Xinjiang, including the Guliya ice core and Kesang Cave speleothem record. During the cooler periods, the regional record indicates that a weakened summer Asian monsoon is countered to some extent by a stronger winter monsoon. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of the work is to present the possibility of increase in water resources and creation of new non-productive forest functions by restoration of the non-existent forest lakes. Ten currently non-existent natural forest lakes were randomly selected in northern Poland and their extent and volume of the water deposited in their basins were determined. The analysis was performed in two stages. At first, based on the cartographic materials (1:25 000) from XIX and XX century, the location of the lakes before their complete disappearance was determined and their surface were calculated. Bathymetric plans were reconstructed based on the 1:10 000 topographic map. Obtained contour lines constituted the isobaths necessary to calculate the volume of the using Penck method. The results show a large-scale transformation of the natural environment in the forests. The total area of the analyzed lakes before their disappearance amounted to nearly 800 ha, and the total volume of water was estimated to 12 million m(3). The main activities aimed at achieving the foregoing goal include damming of rivers and lakes, construction of artificial reservoirs, etc. At this point the possibility of restoring the natural hydrographic network elements to their original condition should be considered. Such an approach would certainly be less harmful to the environment than artificial structures, whose long-term impact on the environment is not always possible to determine. Yet another issue is the possibility of adaptation of the reconstructed forest lakes and their surroundings in order to achieve the objectives related to the non-productive forest functions. Based on the preliminary information on the location, area and volume of the lakes, more detailed analysis should be made taking into account natural needs (changing the species composition of the forest, increasing biodiversity, etc.) and economic aspects (e.g. leisure and recreational facilities).

AB  - Water and benthic diatom samples were collected in different climatic and geological areas of Spain. Seventy-two sites were sampled in Atlantic Galicia (NW mainland) and 47 sites in the Mediterranean Balearic Islands (NE) in spring season during 2004 and 2006 to identify the most important environmental factors influencing water composition. Furthermore, spring samples were explored to assess differences among diatom assemblages. Streams were selected to cover a wide range of environmental variability. Overall, the Atlantic streams had higher discharge and the Mediterranean streams had higher conductivity. In second instance, in both areas water chemistry was most importantly influenced by diffuse agriculture and local point source organic inputs, leading to high contents of nitrate, ammonium and phosphate. Two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) produced five diatom groups with different species composition in each study area. The unpolluted streams in the Balearic Islands were characterized by the presence of Cymbella microchepala and Cymbella vulgata, while in Galicia Eunotia subarcuatoides) E. intermedia and Surirella roba characterized minimally disturbed streams. Achnanthidium minutissimum sensu lato appeared in high abundance in both studied areas. Taxa inhabiting organic polluted Mediterranean streams were Cocconeis euglypta, Navicula veneta, Nitzschia inconspicua and Planothidium frequentissimum, while organic loading led to a dominance of Cocconeis euglypta and Eolimna minima in Atlantic streams. The first two CCA axes explained 82 and 69% of total variance in diatom distribution in Galicia and the Balearic Islands, respectively. In spite of the presence of different diatom communities across Mediterranean-Atlantic streams in undisturbed conditions predictable changes in diatom assemblages do occur in response to organic and nutrient loading gradients.

AB  - The ecological responses of large rivers to human pressure can be assessed at multiple scales using a variety of indicators, but little is known about how the responses of ecological indicators vary over small spatial scales. We sampled phytoplankton, zooplankton and macroinvertebrates and measured river metabolism and cotton strip breakdown rates (loss in tensile strength) in contrasting habitats along a 21-km urban-industrial reach on a constrained section of the Waikato River, New Zealand's longest river. Rates of gross primary production (2.8-7.8g O-2/m(2)/d) and ecosystem respiration (3.5-12.7g O-2/m(2)/d) did not differ consistently between near-shore (2-3m from river side) and far-shore (ca. 10m from side) locations, urban and industrial reaches or between autumn and spring sampling occasions. Rates of cotton decay (-k) ranged from 0.014 to 0.112 per day and were typically faster at far-shore locations and in the section of river receiving industrial inputs, but slower in spring compared with autumn. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis of phytoplankton and zooplankton data did not reveal spatial patterns relating to pressure or location (embayment, edge, mid-river). However, the macroinvertebrate ordination suggested distinct communities for the mid-river benthos compared with near-shore communities and a distinction between sites in the urban reach and the industrial reach. Our results suggest that large-river macroinvertebrate communities and cotton decay rates can be influenced to varying degrees by reach-scale pressures and local habitat conditions.

AB  - This study describes the impact of the first passage of two types of bottom-towed fishing gear on rare protected shellfish-reefs formed by the horse mussel Modiolus modiolus (L.). One of the study sites was trawled and the other was scallop-dredged. Divers collected HD video imagery of epifauna from quadrats at the two study sites and directed infaunal samples from one site. The total number of epifaunal organisms was significantly reduced following a single pass of a trawl (90%) or scallop dredge (59%), as was the diversity of the associated community and the total number of M. modiolus at the trawled site. At both sites declines in anthozoans, hydrozoans, bivalves, echinoderms and ascidians accounted for most of the change. A year later, no recovery was evident at the trawled site and significantly fewer infaunal taxa (polychaetes, malacostracans, bivalves and ophuroids) were recorded in the trawl track. The severity of the two types of impact reflected the undisturbed status of the habitats compared to previous studies. As a 'priority habitat' the nature of the impacts described on M. modiolus communities are important to the development of conservation management policy and indicators of condition in Marine Protected Areas (EU Habitats Directive) as well as indicators of 'Good Environmental Status' under the European Union Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Conservation managers are under pressure to support decisions with good quality evidence. Elsewhere, indirect studies have shown declines of M. modiolus biogenic communities in fishing grounds. However, given the protected status of the rare habitat, premeditated demonstration of direct impact is unethical or illegal in Marine Protected Areas. This study therefore provides a unique opportunity to investigate the impact from fishing gear whilst at the same time reflecting on the dilemma of evidence-based conservation management.

AB  - The high degree of physical factors in intertidal estuarine ecosystem increases material processing between benthic and pelagic compartments. In these ecosystems, microphytobenthos resuspension is a major phenomenon since its contribution to higher trophic levels can be highly significant. Understanding the sediment and associated microphytobenthos resuspension and its fate in the water column is indispensable for measuring the food available to benthic and pelagic food webs. To identify and hierarchize the physical/biological factors potentially involved in MPB resuspension, the entire intertidal area and surrounding water column of an estuarine ecosystem, the Bay des Veys, was sampled during ebb tide. A wide range of physical parameters (hydrodynamic regime, grain size of the sediment, and suspended matter) and biological parameters (flora and fauna assemblages, chlorophyll) were analyzed to characterize benthic-pelagic coupling at the bay scale. Samples were collected in two contrasted periods, spring and late summer, to assess the impact of forcing variables on benthic-pelagic coupling. A mapping approach using kriging interpolation enabled us to overlay benthic and pelagic maps of physical and biological variables, for both hydrological conditions and trophic indicators. Pelagic Chl a concentration was the best predictor explaining the suspension-feeders spatial distribution. Our results also suggest a perennial spatio-temporal structure of both benthic and pelagic compartments in the ecosystem, at least when the system is not imposed to intense wind, with MPB distribution controlled by both grain size and bathymetry. The benthic component appeared to control the pelagic one via resuspension phenomena at the scale of the bay. Co-inertia analysis showed closer benthic-pelagic coupling between the variables in spring. The higher MPB biomass observed in summer suggests a higher contribution to filter-feeders diets, indicating a higher resuspension effect in summer than in spring, in turn suggesting an important role of macrofauna bioturbation and filter feeding (Cerastoderma edule).

AB  - The rate-determining step in the overall turnover of the bc(1) complex is electron transfer from ubiquinol to the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (ISP) at the Q(o)-site. Structures of the ISP from Rhodobacter sphaeroides show that serine 154 and tyrosine 156 form H-bonds to S-1 of the [2Fe-2S] cluster and to the sulfur atom of the cysteine liganding Fe-1 of the cluster, respectively. These are responsible in part for the high potential (E-m,E-7 similar to 300 mV) and low pK(a) (7.6) of the ISP, which determine the overall reaction rate of the bc(1) complex. We have made site-directed mutations at these residues, measured thermodynamic properties using protein film voltammetry to evaluate the E-m and pK(a) values of ISPs, explored the local proton environment through two-dimensional electron spin echo envelope modulation, and characterized function in strains S154T, S154C, S154A, Y156F, and Y156W. Alterations in reaction rate were investigated under conditions in which concentration of one substrate (ubiquinol or ISPox) was saturating and the other was varied, allowing calculation of kinetic terms and relative affinities. These studies confirm that H-bonds to the cluster or its ligands are important determinants of the electrochemical characteristics of the ISP, likely through electron affinity of the interacting atom and the geometry of the H-bonding neighborhood. The calculated parameters were used in a detailed Marcus-Bronsted analysis of the dependence of rate on driving force and pH. The proton-first-then-electron model proposed accounts naturally for the effects of mutation on the overall reaction.

AB  - The phenotype of an organism is determined by the genes, the environment and stochastic developmental events. Although recognized as a basic biological principle influencing life history, susceptibility to diseases, and probably evolution, developmental variation (DV) has been only poorly investigated due to the lack of a suitable model organism. This obstacle could be overcome by using the recently detected, robust and highly fecund parthenogenetic marbled crayfish as an experimental animal. Batch-mates of this clonal crayfish, which were shown to be isogenic by analysis of nuclear microsatellite loci, exhibited surprisingly broad ranges of variation in coloration, growth, life-span, reproduction, behaviour and number of sense organs, even when reared under identical conditions. Maximal variation was observed for the marmorated coloration, the pattern of which was unique in each of the several hundred individuals examined. Variation among identically raised batch-mates was also found with respect to fluctuating asymmetry, a traditional indicator of the epigenetic part of the phenotype, and global DNA methylation, an overall molecular marker of an animal's epigenetic state. Developmental variation was produced in all life stages, probably by reaction-diffusion-like patterning mechanisms in early development and non-linear, self-reinforcing circuitries involving behaviour and metabolism in later stages. Our data indicate that, despite being raised in the same environment, individual genotypes can map to numerous phenotypes via DV, thus generating variability among clone-mates and individuality in a parthenogenetic species. Our results further show that DV, an apparently ubiquitous phenomenon in animals and plants, can introduce components of randomness into life histories, modifying individual fitness and population dynamics. Possible perspectives of DV for evolutionary biology are discussed.

AB  - On the Estonian islands the woodlands have been used as pastures, hay meadows or temporary fields throughout the history of human settlement. Signs of earlier traditional agricultural practices stretching back centuries may be found in the plant cover and soil characteristics of forest ecosystems. The aim of the study was to find associations between biophysical factors (absolute elevation, geographical location), forests' historical land use (forest continuity types) and present floristic composition on the islands of Saaremaa and Muhu in western Estonia. Canonical Correspondence Analysis, Kruskal-Wallis multiple comparison of mean ranks for all groups, frequency tables with Chi-Square tests and indicator species analysis were used. The Ellenberg values and hemerophoby degrees of the indicator species in forest continuity types were compared.
   Natural forests are associated with the areas of greatest absolute height and hence, in conditions of post-glacial land uplift, of the greatest age, while afforested former semi-natural plant communities are associated with lower (post-glacially younger) and western areas. Semi-natural woodlands covered mainly with deciduous trees, are relatively well preserved in eastern areas. The sensitive indicators of field layer vascular plant flora are the dwarf shrubs typically found in natural forests. The abundance of species sensitive to human activities (including orchids) is highest in natural forests, but also great in semi-natural woodlands pointing to the high value of these habitats. Knowledge derived from the observed relations between different land use practices and forest vegetation can be used to more precisely determine the conservation value of stands, to forecast the course of their succession, and to choose suitable management methods to support timber production or conservation.

AB  - Under certain environmental conditions, nocturnal transpiration can be relatively high in temperate and tropical woody species. We have previously shown that nocturnal sap flow accounts for up to 28% of total daily transpiration in woody species growing in a nutrient-poor Brazilian Cerrado ecosystem. In the present study, we assessed the effect of increased nutrient supply on nocturnal transpiration in three dominant Cerrado tree species to explore the hypothesis that, in nutrient-poor systems, continued transpiration at night may enhance delivery of nutrients to root-absorbing surfaces. We compared nocturnal transpiration of trees growing in unfertilized plots and plots to which nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) had been added twice yearly from 1998 to 2005. Three independent indicators of nocturnal transpiration were evaluated: sap flow in terminal branches, stomatal conductance (g(s)), and disequilibrium in water potential between covered and exposed leaves (Delta Psi(L)). In the unfertilized trees, about 25% of the total daily sap flow occurred at night. Nocturnal sap flow was consistently lower in the N- and P-fertilized trees, significantly so in trees in the N treatment. Similarly, nocturnal g(s) was consistently lower in fertilized trees than in unfertilized trees where it sometimes reached values of 150 mmol m(-2) s(-1) by the end of the dark period. Predawn g(s) and the percentage of nocturnal sap flow were linearly related. Nocturnal Delta Psi(L) was significantly greater in the unfertilized trees than in N- and P-fertilized trees. The absolute magnitude of Delta Psi(L) increased linearly with the percentage of nocturnal sap flow. These results are consistent with the idea that enhancing nutrient uptake by allowing additional transpiration to occur at night when evaporative demand is lower may avoid excessive dehydration associated with increased stomatal opening during the day when evaporative demand is high.

AB  - Using simple models derived from spectral reflectance, we mapped the patterns of ecosystem CO2 and water fluxes in a semi-arid site in southern California during a period of extreme disturbance, marked by drought and fire. Employing a combination of low (similar to 2 km) and high (similar to 16 km) altitude images from the hyperspectral Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), acquired between April 2002 and September 2003, and ground data collected from an automated tram system, several vegetation indices were calculated for Sky Oaks field station, a FLUX-NET and SpecNet site located in northern San Diego County (CA, USA). Based on the relationships observed between the fluxes measured by the eddy covariance tower and the vegetation indices, net CO2 and water vapor flux maps were derived for the region around the flux tower. Despite differences in the scale of the images (from similar to 2 in to 16 m pixel size) as well as marked differences in environmental conditions (drought in 2002, recovery in early 2003, and fire in mid 2003), net CO2 and water flux modeled from AVIRIS-derived reflectance indices (NDVI, PRI and WBI) effectively tracked changes in tower fluxes across both drought and fire, and readily revealed spatial variation in fluxes within this landscape. After an initial period of net carbon uptake, drought and fire caused the ecosystem to lose carbon to the atmosphere during most of the study period. Our study shows the power of integrating optical and flux data in LUE models to better understand factors driving surface-atmosphere carbon and water vapor flux cycles, one of the main goals of SpecNet.

AB  - The aim of this experimental study was to investigate the usefulness of non-radioactive mono-isotopic metal tracer "spikes" for studying metallic contamination in the environment. These spikes are commonly used in Earth Sciences. Because of their unique non-natural isotopic composition, these tracers are readily distinguishable from the metals initially present in an organism and hence, the evolution of both the "natural" and the "added" metals can be quantified during the same measurement by ICP-MS. The concentrations used in this study allow us to simulate conditions similar to those found in nature, but without the potential dangers associated with the use of radioactive tracers. Mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis, commonly used in environmental surveys, were collected in a lagoon (Thau, S. France) and kept for 14 days in clean seawater tanks, to which Zn-66 (20 mug l(-1)), Cd-111 (1 mug l(-1)), Pb-207 (1 mug l(-1)) tracers were added. The concentrations of these metals and their isotopic compositions were regularly analyzed in the mantle, gills and digestive gland of the mussels. Even though the tracer concentrations were relatively low in the tanks, a significant uptake by the 3 organs was observed from the first day. The dynamics of this uptake are similar in all 3 organs but specific for each metal. The spikes are found to be superimposed on metals initially present and could be stored or excreted by the mussels. At the end of the experiment, the tracer concentrations reached 17% of the total Zn, 67% of the Cd, and 36-58% of Pb in the studied organisms. The differing reponse of the mussels to each metal contamination suggests the possibility of using various biomonitoring strategies in environmental surveys. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The literature on structural brain abnormalities in schizophrenia is examined to determine whether these abnormalities represent viable candidate markers of vulnerability to the disorder. A majority of studies agree in finding that schizophrenia patients as a group have significantly larger ventricles and smaller limbic brain structures than normal control subjects, but about 50 percent of patients fall within the range of control subjects on these measures. This result has been interpreted to suggest that structural abnormalities characterize only a subgroup of patients. However, given the substantial degree of normal variability in brain structure between families, the use of biologically unrelated individuals as controls is misleading. Studies that have compared schizophrenia patients with their unaffected first-degree relatives have found a much higher sensitivity rate for ventricular enlargement and reduced limbic volumes (i.e., 70%-100%). This high within-family sensitivity, together with evidence from metaanalytic reviews of a substantial relationship between ventricular enlargement and severity of illness, argues in favor of a continuous distribution of the brain pathology in schizophrenia and against a model in which the pathology characterizes only a subgroup of patients. The structural abnormalities observed in both younger and older patients have been found to be highly correlated with familial risk for schizophrenia and obstetric complications, suggesting that some part of the deviance may be present in the premorbid state and that it may reflect both genetic and environmental etiologic processes. The evidence for specificity of the deficits to schizophrenia is equivocal, but no study has yet compared the within-family sensitivities of morphological measures among the major psychiatric conditions. Additional studies using first-degree relatives and well-defined neuroanatomical measurements are needed to determine which brain regions have the highest sensitivities as indicators of schizophrenia in families.

AB  - In Western Europe, Ixodes ricinus has been recognized as the vector of several animal and human diseases. The last discovered nosological entity linked with that species is Lyme Borreliosis, whose repartition is to date badly known. It then becomes important to have a comprehensive view of the vector distribution in order to know what areas are propitious to the disease. The tick is an exophile species and lives more particularly in wooded areas.
   For mapping the species in France, we have conceived a method L using the different vegetation types as ecological indicators, each << series >> having homogeneous environmental conditions. The successive steps in the accomplishment of the study (from the zoning of the territory to the tick sampling) are presented here (Use of small and medium scale vegetation maps, fixing the forest stations to be prospected, standardization of the flagging technique). Some results are analysed here in order to give an idea and the limits of the method. In this purpose, the authors point out the results obtained in two different areas.
   In South-Western France, the vegetation series can be easily distinguished and are largely variable from one area to another. In the present study, the tick frequencies are also proved to be varying from one << series >> to an other. In this case, the vegetation can be considered as an efficient indicator. The acarological data are obviously in connection with the ecological variability of the territory. As regard of Brittany (North-Western, France) because the homogeneity and uniformity of the area, the vegetation series cannot be distinguished continuously. So the use of the vegetal indicator from the reason that has been exposed, can be thought of little interest.

AB  - Recently, studies have increasingly focused on the occurrence of plastic leachate and its effects on aquatic environments. However, few studies have aimed to identify microplastic-derived dissolved organic matter (MPDOM) from environmental samples that are often enriched with natural organic matter (NOM). In this study, three MP-DOM (EPS-DOM, PVC-DOM, and PET-DOM) and eight aquatic NOM samples, and their mixtures, were used to identify a unique optical surrogate for MP-DOM within background NOM. Three major fluorescence peaks (peaks P, H, and L) were identified in the excitation emission matrix (EEM) spectra of both DOM sources (i. e., MP-DOM and NOM). The first two peaks were more pronounced for MP-DOM than for aquatic NOM, whereas peak L showed the opposite trend. The summed intensity ratio of the ranges of the first two peaks relative to peak L, namely, (H + P)/L, clearly distinguished between MP-DOM and NOM samples. The MP-DOM source discrimination capability was compared for several selected spectroscopic indices by tracking their changes in the mixtures of two source groups with increasing fraction of MP-DOM via end-member mixing analysis. This was further evaluated based on the three criteria built on the significance of the difference between the two groups, the correlation coefficients of the regressions, and the minimum fraction of MP-DOM in mixtures that can be distinguished from 100% NOM samples. Irrespective of the plastic type and leaching conditions (i.e., UVirradiated or not), the new optical index, (H + P)/L, was superior at distinguishing MP-DOM from the mixtures when compared to other commonly used optical indices. The new index can serve as a sensitive, robust, and reliable fluorescence indicator with minimal interference from NOM for detecting plastic leachate in aquatic samples.

AB  - Seagrass habitats are recognised as providing essential ecosystem services and being indicators of estuarine health, and are under increasing threat globally. This study examined the spatial and temporal variability of four dominant seagrass genera (Posidonia, Zostera, Halophila and Ruppia) among five geomorphic estuary types and four levels of estuarine maturity in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, over a 40-year period. While there was a decline in total seagrass area across NSW over the last 40 years, this was mostly attributed to Ruppia, the genus with the greatest temporal variability. The composition of seagrasses differed among estuary types and with the maturity of Barrier estuaries. Posidonia was found to be the least temporally variable genus over the last 40 years. The greatest overall annual rate of decline was 1.85% year(-1) for Ruppia which is considerably less than the global estimated rate of 5% year(-1) over the same time period. Average annual rates of decline were greater over the last 18 years than the last 40 years, but only for the most transient genera and only in some estuary types. Recent declines in Posidonia were greater than those over the last 40 years in two of the most heavily urbanised estuaries. The temporal variability of Zostera differed significantly among estuary types and decreased with increasing water depth across all estuaries. No relationships were found between catchment disturbances, measured as land use or population density, and seagrass change or temporal variability at the estuary scale. Our results highlight the importance of distinguishing among seagrass genera when interpreting changes over time and considering factors such as estuary type, which is effectively a surrogate for environmental conditions.

AB  - A novel system of solar-driven supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of microalgae for ammonia synthesis and power production was proposed to achieve chemical hydrogen storage with ammonia carrier. The system units mainly include SCWG, ammonia synthesis in supercritical water (SCW), power generation by supercritical water mixing fluid, organic Rankine circulating power generation, gas separation and circulating compression, and steam methane reforming. The system design and process simulation were implemented using Aspen plus. The thermodynamic performance of the system was analyzed. The life cycle environmental impact was evaluated with Simapro software. The results of thermodynamic analysis revealed that the energy efficiency, exergy efficiency, and energy consumption per ton of ammonia of the system were closely related to the microalgae concentration designed for the system. The simulation results presented the highest energy efficiency of 42.62% and exergy efficiency of 44.27% with the lowest energy consumption per ton of ammonia of 48.79 GJ/t. The circulating gas compressor was the largest electricity consumer and the heat loss of the coolers was the main reason for the energy loss of the system, indicating the direction of system optimization in the future. The evaluation of the life cycle environmental impact assessment showed that the plant operation stage contributed little to the overall environmental impact compared with the construction and dismantling stage. The values of the main midpoint indicator global warming potential (GWP) and endpoint indicator Human health could be as low as 0.69 kg CO2-eq.kg(-1) NH3 and 8.17 x 10(-5), respectively, under suitable design conditions. Compared with other ammonia synthesis routes, this work has great advantages in terms of thermodynamics and environmental impact, while it faces both opportunities and challenges. This research reveals the feasibility of SCWG of algae for ammonia synthesis and provides theoretical guidance for biomass cleaning conversion.

AB  - On the Parana coast, the municipalities of Matinhos and Pontal do Parana represent more than 50% of the coast and they are potential areas for tourist and industrial activities. The region faces several problems related to the intensification of erosion, mainly since the 1980s, which caused damages and losses in environmental and socioeconomic terms. In this scenario, this research aims to determine the coastal erosion risk on the Parana coastline based on the analysis of spatio-temporal indicators (shoreline position, backshore width, density of natural washouts, rain water galleries, sediment transport trends). Collected data were integrated with map algebra techniques attributing values to each of the analyzed variables, according to their negative or positive relationship with the coastal erosion risk. The results show that approximately 70% of the municipality of Matinhos has a high risk of erosion, while Pontal do Parana has one high risk area. Critically eroded areas along Matinhos coastline refer to places where coastal defense structures were carried away and where backshore width is less extensive or non-existent (Riviera, Flamingo and Praia Brava). With regard to backshore width, temporal analysis of shoreline variation and density of natural and anthropic washouts (rain water galleries) are the most effective indicators in risk assessment. In the other hand, the sediment transport trends has some limitation as an indicator, since its monitoring campaigns take place during different season conditions, therefore it is not possible to evaluate a sediment transport pattern along these beaches. The methodology presented in this research contributes to guidelines that provide advice and may be used for decision-making in the coastal region of Parana. It is worth mentioning that the methodology must be improved, such as incorporating data sets from a larger temporal scale, contributing to the advancement of scientifical research in the coastal zone.

AB  - Carbon and nitrogen from soil microbial biomass (MCB & MNB) are bio-indicators that have the potential to show changes in soil of ecosystems, and are conditioned, by moisture available in the soil. In this work we evaluated how MCB, MNB and heterotrophic respiration (RH) vary, as a function of moisture in soils of the Dry Magallanic Steppe of Santa Cruz, Argentina. The trial consisted in 3 treatments: a) Control, without variations in precipitation, used as reference, b) irrigation, equivalent to a 54% increase in precipitation compared to the annual average, and c) drought, equivalent to a 54% decrease in precipitation compared to the annual average. MBC was estimated by the fumigation-extraction method. Significant differences were found in MCB between treatments, irrigation had the highest value. MCB were: 505.3 (+/- 81.4), 406.7(+/- 39.2) and 380.4 (+/- 98.4) mu g C g(-1) dry soil for soil under irrigation, drought and control, respectively. No differences were found in the MNB between treatments and values were: 93.3 (+/- 13.5), 82.8 (+/- 68.9) and 80.7 (+/- 31.1) mu g N g(-1) dry soil for drought, control and irrigation, respectively. In addition, RH values were: 13.04 (+/- 3.32), 11.17 (+/- 1.47) and 10.60 (+/- 1.29) mg CO(2)Kg(-1)day(-1) for control, irrigation and drought, respectively. Only MCB showed a relevant change when soil was subjected to drought, meanwhile the other variables did not show significant differences. Results indicate that moisture is an important factor for C in MB, so it is important to continue monitoring in order to establish how changes in precipitation can alter the microbial biomass in these southern environments.

AB  - This study investigates the combined use of oribatid mites and diatoms in pine forest riparian zone soils. We focus on these organism groups as bioindicators of long-term anthropogenic disturbances of various origins categorized as two contamination levels: 1) moderate level that integrates the effects of sulphate-rich mining water contamination and alkaline air pollution that affected the area in the 1980s; 2) mild level that has been affected only by the alkaline air pollution. Additionally, the oribatid mite and diatom communities of these two groups of study sites were compared to another study area, which has similar natural conditions but is uninfluenced by these anthropogenic pollutants.
   Changes in oribatid mite abundance and the presence or absence of specific diatom species were the most significant differences in comparison of the two contamination levels and the area with very low human impact. Based on the community dissimilarities, both bioindicators had difficulty differentiating between the contamination levels when viewed separately. However, when the community data of the two groups were pooled, their ability to indicate the studied contamination levels improved noticeably. The sulphate-rich mining water contamination showed no strong influence on the communities, therefore the full indicative potential of these two groups may not have been reached. Nevertheless, this study provided new information about the soil communities inhabiting riparian areas and through that helped us understand some of the dynamics in diatom and oribatid mite communities brought on by long-term but weak disturbances. Some promising species were proposed from both groups that might help predict the effects of sulphate-rich mining water contamination or alkaline air pollution. Also, the taxonomic list of oribatid mites provides a valuable insight into the Estonian riparian forest soil oribatid fauna.

AB  - Benthic deep-sea communities are largely dependent on particle flux from surface waters. In the Arctic Ocean, environmental changes occur more rapidly than in other ocean regions, and have major effects on the export of organic matter to the deep sea. Because bacteria constitute the majority of deep-sea benthic biomass and influence global element cycles, it is important to better understand how changes in organic matter input will affect bacterial communities at the Arctic seafloor. In a multidisciplinary ex situ experiment, benthic bacterial deep-sea communities from the Long-Term Ecological Research Observatory HAUSGARTEN were supplemented with different types of habitat-related detritus (chitin, Arctic algae) and incubated for 23 days under in situ conditions. Chitin addition caused strong changes in community activity, while community structure remained similar to unfed control incubations. In contrast, the addition of phytodetritus resulted in strong changes in community composition, accompanied by increased community activity, indicating the need for adaptation in these treatments. High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and 16S rRNA revealed distinct taxonomic groups of potentially fast-growing, opportunistic bacteria in the different detritus treatments. Compared to the unfed control, Colwelliaceae, Psychromonadaceae, and Oceanospirillaceae increased in relative abundance in the chitin treatment, whereas Flavobacteriaceae, Marinilabiaceae, and Pseudoalteromonadaceae increased in the phytodetritus treatments. Hence, these groups may constitute indicator taxa for the different organic matter sources at this study site. In summary, differences in community structure and in the uptake and remineralization of carbon in the different treatments suggest an effect of organic matter quality on bacterial diversity as well as on carbon turnover at the seafloor, an important feedback mechanism to be considered in future climate change scenarios.

AB  - China's 2008 8.0 Ms Wenchuan earthquake and subsequent secondary geo-hazards caused widespread damage to vegetation-soil system in northwest China. In order to evaluate changes in soil quality status after damage, we established four treatments in the earthquake-affected area, including disturbed and treated sites in a dry hot climate (D-t), undisturbed sites in a dry hot climate (D-ud), disturbed and treated sites in a subtropical humid monsoon climate (S-t), and undisturbed sites in a subtropical humid monsoon climate (S-ud). Forty-eight soil samples were collected and analyzed for 27 soil physical, chemical, and biological properties. Principal components analysis (PCA) was conducted with 26 variables in significant differences except total potassium among D-t, D-ud, S-t, and S-ud. A minimum data set of soil indicators was established with available potassium (AK), K+, total salt content (TSC), and total phosphorus (TP) based on PCA results. Using the Integrated Quality Index (IQI) equation, we calculated the soil quality index (SQI). S-ud, S-t, D-ud, and D-t had mean SQI scores of 0.566, 0.275, 0.537, and 0374, respectively. Our results showed that undisturbed sites had better soil quality compared to disturbed and treated sites based on their superior physical indicators, superior nutrient conditions, and higher microbial carbon source metabolic diversity, especially in the subtropical humid monsoon climate with frequent rainfall. The SQI reflects the variations observed in earthquake-affected area and may be considered as a suitable technique for detecting changes in soils. Our results will also supply the fundamental data for evaluating the effects, design, and implementation of restoration programs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Magnetic and geochemical parameters of soils are determined with respect to geology, pedogenesis and anthropopression. Depending on local conditions these factors affect magnetic and geochemical signals simultaneously or in various configurations. We examined four type of soils (Entic Podzol, Eutric Cambisol, Humic Cambisol and Dystric Cambisol) developed on various bedrock (the Tumlin Sandstone, basaltoid, amphibolite and serpentinite, respectively). Our primary aim was to characterize the origin and diversification of the magnetic and geochemical signal in soils in order to distinguish the most reliable methods for correct interpretation of measured parameters. Presented data include selected parameters, both magnetic (mass magnetic susceptibility - chi, frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility - chi(fd) and thermomagnetic susceptibility measurement T - SM), and geochemical (selected heavy metal contents: Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn). Additionally, the enrichment factor (EF) and index of geoaccumulation (I-geo) were calculated. Our results suggest the following: (1) the chi/Fe ratio may be a reliable indicator for determining changes of magnetic signal origin in soil profiles; (2) magnetic and geochemical signals are simultaneously higher (the increment of chi and lead and zinc was noted) in topsoil horizons because of the deposition of technogenic magnetic particles (TMPs); (3) EF and I-geo evaluated for lead and zinc unambiguously showed anthropogenic influence in terms of increasing heavy metal contents in topsoil regardless of bedrock or soil type; (4) magnetic susceptibility measurements supported by TSM curves for soil samples of different genetic horizons are a helpful tool for interpreting the origin and nature of the mineral phases responsible for the changes of magnetic susceptibility values.

AB  - The impacts of climate change on marine species are often compounded by other stressors that make direct attribution and prediction difficult. Shy albatrosses (Thalassarche cauta) breeding on Albatross Island, Tasmania, show an unusually restricted foraging range, allowing easier discrimination between the influence of non-climate stressors (fisheries bycatch) and environmental variation. Local environmental conditions (rainfall, air temperature, and sea-surface height, an indicator of upwelling) during the vulnerable chick-rearing stage, have been correlated with breeding success of shy albatrosses. We use an age-, stage- and sex-structured population model to explore potential relationships between local environmental factors and albatross breeding success while accounting for fisheries bycatch by trawl and longline fisheries. The model uses time-series of observed breeding population counts, breeding success, adult and juvenile survival rates and a bycatch mortality observation for trawl fishing to estimate fisheries catchability, environmental influence, natural mortality rate, density dependence, and productivity. Observed at-sea distributions for adult and juvenile birds were coupled with reported fishing effort to estimate vulnerability to incidental bycatch. The inclusion of rainfall, temperature and sea-surface height as explanatory variables for annual chick mortality rate was statistically significant. Global climate models predict little change in future local average rainfall, however, increases are forecast in both temperatures and upwelling, which are predicted to have detrimental and beneficial effects, respectively, on breeding success. The model shows that mitigation of at least 50% of present bycatch is required to offset losses due to future temperature changes, even if upwelling increases substantially. Our results highlight the benefits of using an integrated modeling approach, which uses available demographic as well as environmental data within a single estimation framework, to provide future predictions. Such predictions inform the development of management options in the face of climate change.

AB  - The "2800' sandstone'' of the Olla oil field is an oil and gas-producing reservoir in a coal-bearing interval of the Paleocene-Eocene Wilcox Group in north-central Louisiana, USA. In the 1980s, this producing unit was flooded with CO2 in an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) project, leaving similar to 30% of the injected CO2 in the 2800' sandstone post-injection. This study utilizes isotopic and geochemical tracers from co-produced natural gas, oil and brine to determine the fate of the injected CO2, including the possibility of enhanced microbial conversion of CO2 to CH4 via methanogenesis. Stable carbon isotopes of CO2, CH4 and DIC, together with mol% CO2 show that 4 out of 17 wells sampled in the 2800' sandstone are still producing injected CO2. The dominant fate of the injected CO2 appears to be dissolution in formation fluids and gas-phase trapping. There is some isotopic and geochemical evidence for enhanced microbial methanogenesis in 2 samples; however, the CO2 spread unevenly throughout the reservoir, and thus cannot explain the elevated indicators for methanogenesis observed across the entire field. Vertical migration out of the target 2800' sandstone reservoir is also apparent in 3 samples located stratigraphically above the target sand. Reservoirs comparable to the 2800' sandstone, located along a 90-km transect, were also sampled to investigate regional trends in gas composition, brine chemistry and microbial activity. Microbial methane, likely sourced from biodegradation of organic substrates within the formation, was found in all oil fields sampled, while indicators of methanogenesis (e.g. high alkalinity, delta C-13-CO2 and delta C-13-DIC values) and oxidation of propane were greatest in the Olla Field, likely due to its more ideal environmental conditions (i.e. suitable range of pH, temperature, salinity, sulfate and iron concentrations).

AB  - Seawater reverse osmosis desalination concentrate may have chronic and/or acute impacts on the marine ecosystems in the near-field area of the discharge. Environmental impact of the desalination plant discharge is supposedly site- and volumetric- specific, and also depends on the salinity tolerance of the organisms inhabiting the water column in and around a discharge environment. Scientific studies that aim to understand possible impacts of elevated salinity levels are important to assess detrimental effects to organisms, especially for species with no mechanism of osmoregulation, e.g., presumably corals. Previous studies on corals indicate sensitivity toward hypo- and hyper-saline environments with small changes in salinity already affecting coral physiology. In order to evaluate sensitivity of Red Sea corals to increased salinity levels, we conducted a long-term (29 days) in situ salinity tolerance transect study at an offshore seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) discharge on the coral Fungia granulosa. While we measured a pronounced increase in salinity and temperature at the direct outlet of the discharge structure, effects were indistinguishable from the surrounding environment at a distance of 5 m. Interestingly, corals were not affected by varying salinity levels as indicated by measurements of the photosynthetic efficiency. Similarly, cultured coral symbionts of the genus Symbiodinium displayed remarkable tolerance levels in regard to hypo- and hypersaline treatments. Our data suggest that increased salinity and temperature levels from discharge outlets wear off quickly in the surrounding environment. Furthermore, F. granulosa seem to tolerate levels of salinity that are distinctively higher than reported for other corals previously. It remains to be determined whether Red Sea corals in general display increased salinity tolerance, and whether this is related to prevailing levels of high(er) salinity in the Red Sea in comparison to other oceans.

AB  - We review the scientific literature based on ichthyoplankton research conducted in the northern California Current (NCC) north of Cape Mendocino, California to northern Washington. A total of 69 papers have been written on ichthyoplankton research in the NCC region from 1940 to 2012, with several more currently in the process of publication. Although there were some extended California Cooperative Fisheries Investigation (CalCOFI) cruises in the 1950s conducted as far north as northern California, the first dedicated larval fish survey in this region was made by Ken Waldron of the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries in 1967. Extensive cruises were conducted starting in 1969 and continuing through the 1970s by William Pearcy at Oregon State University (OSU) and the ichthyoplankton were analyzed by Sally Richardson and her colleagues. Much new information on larval taxonomy, spatial and temporal distributions, and relationships to environmental conditions was generated as part of these studies. Nearshore studies continued in the early 1980s by OSU focusing on the recruitment and connections of mainly flatfish species to the local estuaries. At the same time, there were a series of eight joint U.S.-Soviet large-scale cruises covering the entire region organized by Art Kendall of NMFS, with the data analyzed primarily by Miriam Doyle. After a hiatus in the early to mid-1990s, sampling began anew by NMFS and OSU focusing initially off the central Oregon coast, but by the mid-2000s was expanded over a broader area of the NCC over multiple years and seasons to provide information to managers on the outlook for future recruitment. We discuss current gaps in our knowledge, and give examples of applications of ichthyoplankton data to fisheries management and to improving our understanding of ecosystem processes and their relationships to environmental variability.

AB  - Periphyton communities are an integral component of freshwater ecosystems and the desire to include data from toxicity testing with these organisms for ecological risk assessment is growing. This study developed sampling, storage, and exposure methods for the consistent and effective characterization of acute response and recovery of field-derived periphyton to photosystem II (PSII) inhibiting herbicides, particularly atrazine. Pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry was used to assess PSII quantum yield. For the method development phase, periphyton samples were collected from lotic and lentic systems in the Guelph, Ontario, Canada area during the summer of 2011. Following method development, native periphyton communities from three agricultural streams from the midwestern U.S. were sampled and exposed to atrazine (10-320 mu g/L) and assessed for inhibition of PSII quantum yield (from 2 up to 24 h) and subsequent recovery upon cessation of exposure (up to 48 h post-exposure). Sensitivity to atrazine (EC10 and EC50 values) varied slightly (typically less than twofold difference) by site, date of sampling, and exposure interval. Only the highest initial test concentrations (160 or 320 mu g/L) demonstrated greater than similar to 5 % inhibition at 48 h post-exposure; however all other test concentrations recovered to within 5 % of control levels, typically within 24 h. The rapid physiological recovery of periphyton communities upon atrazine removal supports the conclusion that acute exposure will not likely result in significant or sustained impacts on either structure or function of periphyton in lotic ecosystems. For ecological risk assessment, this suggests the current approach of relying on direct effects data for the most sensitive single species alone may result in overly conservative estimates of potential effects, especially for complex communities of primary producers.

AB  - Anthropogenic introduction of steroidal estrogens and synthetic estrogenic compounds to aquatic environments has increased interest in assessment of the endocrine-disrupting effects of these compounds on aquatic organisms, including mollusks. For gonochoristic freshwater snails in the family Pleuroceridae, little is known about the spatial and temporal variation in population sex ratios or potential relationships between sex ratios and exposure to estrogenic compounds. Population sex ratios of Leptoxis (Rafinesque, 1819) spp., were evaluated within the Shenandoah River watershed (Virginia, U.S.A.), where agricultural operations are a source of estrogenic compounds to streams, and in four other river basins in Virginia. Proportions of females varied among streams within the Shenandoah River watershed, with overall mean proportions from four sampling periods ranging from 0.46-0.87. Sex ratios were consistently female-biased at nine of fifteen stream sampling sites. There was little within-site variation across generations of snails or when the same generation was examined in two different seasons. Proportions of females were not directly related to in-stream concentrations of estrogenic compounds or watershed densities of agricultural operations, but were negatively related to mean summer temperature at the sampling sites. Population sex ratios of Leptoxis spp. were female-biased at two of six sites in the Shenandoah River and one of five sites outside the basin. At the river sampling sites, proportions of females were only related to summer-specific conductivity. Overall, results suggest that site-specific factors can affect population sex ratios of Leptoxis spp. However, until more is known regarding mechanisms of sex determination and sexual differentiation in gastropods, population sex ratios should not be used as indicators of potential biological effects of estrogenic compounds.

AB  - Environmental flow releases have been advocated as a useful rehabilitation strategy for improving river condition but assessments of their success have typically focused on surface water quality and biota. In this study, we investigated the impacts of an environmental flow release on water temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and nitrate concentrations in surface and subsurface (hyporheic) water at upwelling and downwelling zones in three sites along the Hunter River, New South Wales, Australia. We hypothesised that the flow pulse would 'flush' the sediments with oxygenated water, stimulating hyporheic microbial activity and nitrification, enhancing nitrate concentrations over time. Surface and subsurface samples were collected before, 7 days after, and 49 days after an environmental flow release of 5000 MI for a period of 3 days. No lasting effects on dissolved oxygen or conductivity were evident at most sites although dissolved oxygen declined over time at the downwelling site at Bowmans Crossing. At the downwelling zones at all sites, hyporheic nitrate concentrations declined initially following the release, but then rose or leveled off by Day 49. This initial drop in concentration was attributed to flushing of nitrate from the sediments. At two sites, nitrate concentrations had increased by Day 49 in the upwelling zones while at the third site, it fell significantly, associated with very low dissolved oxygen and likely reductive loss of nitrate. Electrical conductivity data indicate that potential inputs of agriculturally enriched groundwater may contribute to the nitrogen dynamics of the Hunter River. This study highlights the spatial heterogeneity that occurs in the hyporheic zone within and among sites of a regulated river, and emphasises the need for multiple-site surveys and an understanding of groundwater dynamics to assess physicochemical responses of the hyporheic zone to environmental flow releases.

AB  - The structure of the mycoflora in the montane and subalpine zone of the Algovian Alps is extremely variable, though the majority of the fungal remains (spores and hyphae) remain widespread in most soils. The study addresses the following questions: (1) To which extent can environmental heterogeneity be recognised by qualitative changes in species richness or quantitative shifts in structure diversity within the mycoflora of different permanent plots? (2) May the ecological tolerance of fungi be assessed by means of (non-)linear models?
   The abundance of many fungal genera clearly points to the Ellenberg indicator values (averages calculated upon a vascular plant list of 555 local species). A multivariate analysis revealed that altitude-related microclimate, dung-related nitrogen and vegetation carpet play an important role in the ecological amplitude of the soil flora in calcareous scree communities, alpine grasslands and meadows. Especially the below-ground mycoflora of moist calcareous soils shows evident biodiversity shifts due to charged ledge communities, while the sporocarps of mutualistic macrofungi of the timberline appear to be extremely sensitive to full sun light and UV. As expected, the mycocoenoses of forest communities is strongly related to higher average temperatures. Multiple General Linear Modelling (GLM) inferred the actual ecological requirements of 30 taxa and five morpha with respect to the combined action of light, temperature, moisture, soil reactivity and N-availability. As demonstrated by a multifactorial Monte Carlo simulation, the possibility for increased competition of mycelium growth and spore dispersal of individual species are only favoured by specific conditions in each of the predictor variables (lower threshold). This evaluation can yield new perspectives in future prognostic efforts by improving the evidential value of bottom-up forces in food web models.

AB  - Drought is a complex natural hazard caused by a combination of atmospheric and hydrological processes. Many different drought indicators have been developed, with each indicator varying in its calculation and its focus on different types of drought (e.g., meteorological, agricultural, hydrological, socio-economic, etc.). Despite this, drought still remains poorly understood. The objective of this study is to compare different drought indicators and highlight their similarities, differences, strengths and weaknesses. To do this, 11 drought indicators were calculated for different parts of Australia, a country that is prone to droughts. Three periods of major drought including the Federation drought (1895-1902), World War II drought (1937-1945), and the Millennium drought (1997-2010) were examined in detail. The results demonstrate that different indicators say very different things about the onset, severity, and end of drought conditions for a given location or area. This is especially the case for drought indicators that use precipitation as their only input and highlights that drought is more than just a lack of rainfall. Further, the use of varying temporal resolution in the calculated drought indicators also leads to large differences in the quantification of drought persistence. Our ability to manage the impact of drought on society and the environment is dependent on our ability to successfully identify and characterize drought. As such, it is important to understand sensitivities and uncertainties associated with: (a) the choice of drought indicator(s) and (b) the choice of time step used to calculate the drought indicator(s). To properly characterize drought, and to successfully quantify and manage the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of drought, the drought indicators employed must realistically capture all the different types of drought and how they evolve.

AB  - The BCR sequential extraction scheme (SES), initially developed for soils and sediments, is frequently adopted to evaluate the environmental risks of municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ash. Within the procedure, metals are liberated from the matrix hosting them relying on the selectivity of the chosen chemical reagents or operation conditions. However, the effect of the high content of alkaline substances in MSWI fly ash on the selectivity of acetic acid to acid-soluble fraction metals was ignored. In this study, the feasibility of the BCR SES for evaluating MSWI fly ash was assessed by adjusting the acetic acid washing times in the acid-soluble extraction step. The metal fractionation, as well as mineralogy, morphology, and surface chemistry of the residues after three successive acid washing processes, were analyzed. The results reveal that only easily soluble salts, but not hydroxides, are entirely extracted after the first acid washing (pH similar to 12.0). Importantly, carbonates (generally reported as an indicator of the complete release of acid-soluble metals) are mostly decomposed only after the third acid washing (pH similar to 3.8). The incomplete dissolution of calcium carbonates in a single-step acid washing may convey misleading results of metal fractionation and underestimates the environmental risk of potentially toxic elements. Therefore, complete removal of carbonates should be employed as the endpoint of the acidsoluble fraction extraction step in the evaluation of MSWI fly ash. This work can help in selecting proper strategies for fly ash management and developing proper sequential extraction schemes for similar high-alkalinity hazardous waste risk assessment.

AB  - Background Predicting the possibility of severe effects of global warming on animals is important for understanding the ecological consequences of climate change on ecosystem. Spring is the season during which birds have to physiologically prepare for the subsequent breeding period, and unusual spring temperature rising probably becomes a heat stress to the birds which have adapted to the low spring temperature. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the physiological effect of spring warming on the temperate birds. Methods Using the activities of blood anti-oxidative enzymes (SOD, CAT, GPx) and the concentrations of serum immunogloblins (IgA, IgY, IgM) as indicators, we compared the anti-oxidative and immune functions of Asian Short-toed Larks (Calandrella cheleensis) captured between 10 and 15 March, 2015 and housed under conditions of 21 degrees C and 16 degrees C. Results The SOD activities of birds in 21 degrees C group were significantly lower than those in 16 degrees C group on all the treatment days. The CAT activities of the birds in 21 degrees C group were significantly lower than those in 16 degrees C group on the 1st, 5th, 13th, 17 treatment days. The GPx activities of the birds in 21 degrees C group were signifthicantly lower than those in 16 degrees C group on the 1st, 13th and 17th, but significantly higher on the 21st treatment day. The IgA, IgY and IgM concentrations of birds in 21 degrees C group were significantly lower than those in 16 degrees C group on all the treatment days. Conclusions This study shows that spring temperature rising negatively influences antioxibative and humoral immune functions, which indicates that spring climate warming might reduce the fitness of the temperate passerine birds which have adapted to the low spring temperature.

AB  - Genotoxic analyses are commonly used in ecotoxicological studies as early biomarkers to investigate the potential effects of environmental contaminants on biological models. Several pollutants can induce DNA damage and, therefore, counting micronuclei and other nuclear abnormalities are efficient tools to evaluate genotoxicity. Some pollutants such as 4-nonylphenol (NP), a detergent used mainly in industries, and Cyproterone Acetate (CPA), an antiandrogenic medicine, have already shown genotoxic effects on some vertebrates. However, although amphibians are considered bioindicators of environmental quality and their populations are declining worldwide, the effects of these compounds on anurans are not yet known and, therefore, we believe that it is important to investigate such effects on anurans. Since water contamination is one of the ultimate causes of amphibian decline, ecotoxicological studies are important to discuss the appropriate solutions to avoid species extinction. Thus, this study investigates the genotoxic effects on Rana catesbeiana tadpoles and juveniles after being exposed to 1,10 and 100 mu g/L NP and 0.025, 0.25 and 2.5 ng/L CPA, by counting the nuclear abnormalities after exposure. The laboratory experiments lasted 28 days. The experimental conditions were the same except for the water volume since tadpoles and juveniles exhibit different habits at different developmental stages. Compared to juveniles, tadpoles were more susceptible to both compounds as indicated by the increased nuclear abnormalities observed in the highest NP concentration and all tested CPA concentrations. The juveniles, on the other hand, responded only to the two highest CPA concentrations. We concluded that CPA, even at very low concentrations, is extremely harmful to both anuran developmental stages and, particularly, to tadpoles. The significant effects observed on tadpoles is an important outcome of this study since 100 mu g/L or higher NP concentrations are frequently detected in the environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A paleolimnological and environmental reconstruction of the volcanic Lake Boquete, in the northern highlands of Panama, was produced based on diatom, sediment, and charcoal analyses. The main aim of this study is to contribute to the understanding of the long-term anthropogenic effect in Lake Boquete and its watershed, a unique space (Gran Chiriqui region) where human occupation and nature have interacted since similar to 7000 yr BP (years Before Present). Our results indicate two main periods of environmental change. In the first period, from similar to 2840 to 1740 cal yr BP (calibrated years Before Present), the lake was under the influence of high-energy flow regimes and high erosion rates. Water pH was gradually changing from neutral to alkaline. There's evidence of fires with four main events, some appear to be natural as indicated by the proxies, while others seem to be associated with anthropic causes most likely related to intense periods of cultivation; a particularly intense fire event is identified at similar to 2607 cal yr BP. We infer that during this period the lake and its watershed were under intense human impact. In the second period, from similar to 1740 to 197 cal yr BP, the lake was under a steady low-energy flow regime, submerged vegetation was more abundant, and pH became more acidic, fire events were less frequent. We infer that these conditions were the result of land abandonment due to human migration to the lowlands. Notwithstanding intense and frequent dry climate spells during the second period, Lake Boquete water levels were not affected, and thus, this record suggest that the main cause of environmental and limnological change in Lake Boquete and its watershed has been anthropogenic activities.

AB  - Environmental impact assessment models are readily available for the assessment of pollution-related impacts in life cycle assessment (LCA). These models have led to an increased focus on water pollution issues resulting in numerous LCA studies. Recently, there have been significant developments in methods assessing freshwater use. These improvements widen the scope for the assessment of wastewater treatment (WWT) technologies, now allowing us to apprehend, for the first time, a combination of operational (energy and chemicals use), qualitative (environmental pollution) and quantitative (water deprivation) issues in wastewater treatment. This enables us to address the following question: Is water consumption during wastewater treatment environmentally significant compared to other impacts? To answer this question, a standard life cycle inventory (LCI) was performed with a focus on consumptive water uses at plant level, where several WWT technologies were operating, in different climatic conditions. The impacts of water consumption were assessed by integrating regionalized characterization factors for water deprivation within an existing life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) method. Results at the midpoint level, show that water deprivation impacts are highly variable in relation to the chosen WWT technology (water volume used) and of WWTP location (local water scarcity). At the endpoint level, water deprivation impacts on ecosystem quality and on the resource damage categories are significant for WWT technologies with great water uses in water-scarce areas. Therefore, our study shows the consideration of water consumption related impacts is essential and underlines the need for a greater understanding of the water consumption impacts caused by WWT systems. This knowledge will help water managers better mitigate local water deprivation impacts, especially in selecting WWT technologies suitable for arid and semi-arid areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A high-level aseptic environment must be maintained in bio-cleanrooms used for the manufacture of sterile products. In the past, formaldehyde gas was most commonly used to sterilize bio-cleanrooms, but due to strict residual limitations there has been a need to develop a less toxic alternative choice. The authors have developed a revolutionary new sterilization system using a high concentration of ozone gas and used this system to sterilize an actual bio-cleanroom. This system integrates the ozone gas generator with the air conditioning system by proper control. The design specifications for the system included an ozone gas concentration of 200ppm or more, relative humidity of 80% or more, and a sterilizing time of 120min. Blow vents and suction ports were placed to ensure a uniform airflow which would extend through the entire room during ozone gas sterilization. Tests regarding long-term material exposure to ozone gas were conducted when the system was introduced to distinguish usable and unusable materials. In an actually constructed cleanroom, simulations were used to predict the evenness of the diffusion of ozone gas concentration and relative humidity during ozone gas sterilization, and measurements of the actual indoor ozone gas concentration, temperature and relative humidity during sterilization revealed that the ozone concentration and relative humidity needed for sterilization had been achieved generally throughout the entire environment. In addition, the CT value (mg/m(3)(=ppm) x min), derived by multiplying the ozone gas concentration during ozone gas sterilization by the sterilization time, was equal to or greater than the target value of 24 x 10(3) (ppm . min). When the results of sterilization in a cleanroom were confirmed using a biological indicator (BI), negative results were obtained at all measurement points, demonstrating that sterilization was being performed effectively in the actual factory at which the ozone gas sterilization system had been introduced.

AB  - Magnesium is a commonly measured element in otolith chemistry analysis and is often included in the suite of elements used to discriminate fish from different environments. Poor relations between Mg in water and otolith chemistry are, however, often found. We examined the uptake of Mg into the otoliths of a freshwater fish (silver perch Bidyanus bidyanus), to determine the extent to which this element can be used to record previous environmental conditions. Silver perch fingerlings were reared for 30 days in water with four concentrations of Mg (14.5, 36.6, 52.1 and 69.6 mg L-1) and fed on a diet supplemented with a combination of natural Mg and enriched Mg-26 at five concentrations (1496, 1626, 1902, 2005 and 2036 mu g g(-1)). Enriched Mg-26 was added to the diet to achieve a Mg-26/Mg-25 ratio that was different from the natural ratio, such that the relative contribution of water and diet to Mg incorporated into otoliths could be determined. Enriching the diet with Mg-26 resulted in an isotope shift in the otolith of silver perch from the natural Mg-26/Mg-25 ratio of 1.10-1.42; however, this was not as high as the ratio in the diet (> 3.7) suggesting that the fish did not fully incorporate Mg from the diet. Water was the primary source of otolith Mg, contributing on average > 80% to otolith Mg (range 74-95%). The fact that Mg concentrations in the otolith did not change in response to Mg concentrations in the water or diet, indicates that Mg is likely physiologically regulated and therefore is not a reliable environmental indicator.

AB  - Being filter-feeding organisms, bivalves present a potential health hazard to consumers due to pathogens which may be present in the marine environment. The simultaneous effect of temperature and salinity on the rate of concentration of indicator microorganism Escherichia coli (EC) in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and oysters (Ostrea edulis) was studied in experimental conditions with different concentrations of EC in seawater. The experiments were carried out in 3000 L tanks and were performed within the natural range of temperature (12 degrees C, 18 degrees C and 24 degrees C) and salinity (37 psu and 32 psu) and within the common range of EC concentration in the coastal Adriatic Sea. In order to determine the influence of temperature and salinity on the rate of concentration of EC in bivalves, we used short-time experiments confined by the periods of linear increase of concentration of EC in bivalves which lasted between 1 and 3 hrs. The results clearly showed that the rate of EC concentration in mussels and oysters depended on the concentration of EC in the surrounding seawater and on the rate of filtration of seawater by bivalves highly controlled by temperature and salinity. Moreover, the effect of temperature and salinity on concentration rate affected one another regardless the concentration of EC in tanks. The rate of EC concentration was significantly higher in mussels than in oysters. In mussels, variations in salinity had more effect than variations in temperature in bringing about changes of the concentration rate, whereas in oysters the result was reversed. Furthermore, in mussels, temperature had stronger effect in changing concentration rate at salinity of 37 psu than at salinity of 32 psu, whereas in oysters the result was the opposite.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that partial oxidation by advanced oxidation processes (AOP) is able to transform hard-to-degrade compounds and increase their biodegradability. In this work, anaerobic treatment was followed by ozonation, UV radiation and ozonation in the presence of UV radiation, to treat bleaching effluents from a cellulose kraft Pulp plant. The anaerobic reactor (horizontal anaerobic immobilized Sludge bed, HAISB) was Used as a pretreatment to reduce the efficient organic load before applying ACIP. The ozone treatments were applied in three different pH environments (3, 8 and 10) with retention times of 10, 30, 45 and 60 min. COD and adsorbable organic halogens (AOX) removal efficiencies at the HAISB were approximately 50%, while the BOD removal efficiency reached 80%. Ozonation promoted further removal of AOX and COD so that the combined efficiency reached 96% for AOX and 70% for COD. In the oxidation process, BOD was either removed in small quantities or actually increased, as intended, so that a second biological treatment would be able to complete the treatment. The maximum increase in the BOD5/COD ratio (biodegradability indicator) Occurred at pH 8, reaching 104% for ozonation at a dosage of 1540 mg(O3).L-1. Applying UV radiation alone resulted in lower values: a 34% increase ill the BOD5/COD ratio and a 76% AOX removal efficiency. These results indicate that the combination of anaerobic treatment with ozonation or ozonation/UV radiation improves the treatability of cellulose pulp bleaching efficients and that the resulting wastewater is suitable for further biological treatment under aerobic conditions with a low level of toxic compounds from the halogenated family.

AB  - To quantify the interaction between climate and woodland continuity in determining the bioclimatic response of lichen epiphytes.
   Northern Britain (Scotland).
   Indicator-species analysis was used to pre-select lichen epiphytes along parallel gradients in climate and the extent of old-growth woodland. Nonparametric multiplicative regression was used to describe in a predictive model the individualistic response of selected species, which were projected based on climate-change scenarios and contrasting patterns of simulated woodland loss or gain. Species with a similar response were grouped using a novel application of cluster analysis to summarize the potentially huge number of projected outcomes. Projected patterns of occurrence under climate-change scenarios were examined for different levels of old-growth woodland extent.
   Forty-two lichen species were statistically significant indicator species in oceanic woodlands, and old-growth indicators under suboptimal climatic conditions. Responses to climate-change scenarios were contrasting, with one group comprising species projected to increase in extent in response to climate warming, and other response groups projected to decrease in occurrence, possibly in response to shifting rainfall patterns. The occurrence of all response groups had a positive relationship with old-growth woodland extent.
   An 'oceanic' biogeographical group of epiphytes identified using the baseline climatic and present-day woodland setting comprised species with a cyanobacterial photobiont or tropical phytogeographical affinities. However, within this group the individual species responses to climate-change scenarios were contrasting. Additionally, group responses may be poorly matched with simple ecological traits. However, the studied interaction between climate and habitat continuity suggests that the impact of climate change might be offset for certain lichen epiphytes by appropriate management of woodland resources, for example, expansion of native woodland around remnant old-growth stands.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Forest management and the selection of its methods should be adjusted to social needs. All forests are potentially multipurpose, but some forest uses are compatible, others are not (e. g., timber production and nature conservation). During a given time period, we use in monitored forests the functions that have been defined as necessary. The principle of equal and non-equal values requires the division of forest into different categories, depending on the combination of forest function and their role, and on set management targets.
   Material and Methods: This paper identifies the values and value principles apllied in evaluation of naturalresources. The processed data are related to the Management Unit >> Gaj >> of the forest management branch of Nasice, Croatia. Using the potential method and the eigenvector method, we analyzed the biological parameters that participate in calculation of total value of the natural forest resources. The premise was that current methods have not been sufficiently exact, so that the new dynamic model should be used in the attempt to establish forest value.
   Results: The results obtained by using the potential method and the eigenvector method coincided considerably, suggesting that the use of the two methods results in similar values for an analyzed forest entity. The obtained values are within the limits of the previously calculated values of generally beneficial forest functions of the analyzed polygon, which amounted to about 200, 000 Kuna/ha (the data for year 2000). Using comparisons and estimates, experts in individual fields ranged the parameters for the establishment of natural resource values.
   Conclusion: The developed dynamic model for evaluating a management unit considers the forest potential properties, and monitors the dynamics of the development of stand conditions, supporting the models of sustainable forest management. The method supports modern evaluation trends in forestry, using available computer program for developing dynamic models.

AB  - The decline of insectivorous farmland passerines has been attributed mostly to global decrease in arthropod availability, as a result of intensification of agricultural practices. The diminution of the Alpine Whinchat, once a widespread insectivorous passerine, has been ascribed to nest losses due to earlier and more frequent mowings. However, potential conjugated effects of deteriorated arthropod food availability had yet to be investigated. We compared food supply and nestling diet in intensively vs. traditionally managed grassland. Abundance and diversity of arthropods were much lower in intensive areas, where small-sized invertebrates, which do not enter nestling diet, were also predominant. Parents breeding in intensive habitats fed less biomass to nestlings than adults from traditional habitats. Nestling diet was less diverse and dominated by less profitable prey items in intensive than in traditional habitats. Feeding rate did not differ between the two habitats, but foraging distances from nest tended to be greater in intensive farmland. There were no significant differences in clutch sizes and hatching success with respect to management intensity, but fledging success was higher in traditional habitats. The recent intensification of farming practices has led to a decrease in the availability of grassland invertebrates, and of important Whinchat nestling food in particular, affecting parents' foraging efficiency and reproductive success. Conservation actions must not only reduce nest losses by postponing mowing, but should also promote grassland farming that is less detrimental to invertebrates. Dominant at the study site, organic grassland farming does seemingly not provide sufficient conditions for Alpine Whinchats. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Land deterioration does not occur uniformly over time or over a landscape. The differential use of preferred areas in the landscape results in uneven distribution of animal impact, and periods of below average precipitation compound the effects of herbivory, providing periods of accelerated deterioration. This study investigates whether rotational grazing during a drought cycle allows reduction of deterioration caused by patch-selective grazing in large (1800-2100 ha) paddocks by providing adequate rest between grazing events. From 1995 through 2000, herbaceous and bare ground changes were measured on adjacent heavily grazed and lightly grazed patches in rotationally and continuously grazed paddocks. The weather interacted with grazing treatment (p < 0.0001), species (p < 0.0001) and the combined effects of the other factors (p < 0.0014), indicating the dominant effect of weather, particularly precipitation, on changes in herbaceous basal area. When summer growing conditions were favorable, the rotational grazing treatment resulted in greater increases of perennial herbaceous basal areas (p < 0.05) and lower proportions of bare ground (P < 0.10) than the continuously grazed treatment. Although rotational grazing did not prevent deterioration in basal area and bare ground with the series of four drought years, it did decrease the rate of deterioration. The changes in basal area were primarily due to changes in summer growing perennial C-4 midgrasses and C-4 shortgrasses. Grazing treatment did not influence species aerial biomass composition (p > 0.1). When monitoring to effect sustainable use, the commonly used parameter of species composition appears to be a much less sensitive indicator of change than bare ground and basal area. This study provides evidence that, in large paddocks in this environment, rotational grazing can reduce the deterioration and allow improvement of both shortgrass and midgrass patches.

AB  - The sister chromatid exchange (SCE) test is a widely used method to detect chemically induced genetic damage. This method has been applied in some aquatic species to monitor genetic pollutants in estuarine and marine environments. Dose response to 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was investigated in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis Lmk. Experimental assays were carried out by incorporating 4, 10, 20 and 40 mu g ml(-1) BrdU in asynchronously growing mussel gill cell populations. SCE frequency was dose dependent both for mussel cells labelled with BrdU for a first round of replication followed by a second round without BrdU (24+36 h), and for mussel cells labelled with BrdU for 2 consecutive rounds of replication (60 h). For every dose assayed, significant differences in SCE frequencies were also found between these 2 kinds of BrdU treatments. The relationship between the duration of the BrdU treatment and the frequency of SCEs was also investigated in M. galloprovincialis. We tested the effect of in vivo BrdU incorporation for either the first cell cycle, or the first and second cell cycles in mussel gill cells. This paper shows that SCE frequencies remain constant for the different BrdU exposures (12+36, 12+48, 24+24, 24+36 and 36+24 h) assayed to obtain first cell cycle labelling, but a striking increase was noted in BrdU treatments (48, 60, 72, 84 and 96 h) for 2 consecutive cycles of labelling. A monthly study of SCE frequencies occurring in 2 natural populations from NW Spain was also performed during 1993. Significant differences in the frequency of SCE were detected both between populations and among months in the mussel populations. In most of the cases, noticeable interindividual variations in SCE frequencies were detected in mussels exposed to the same BrdU conditions.

AB  - In the past decade, a large volume of peer-reviewed papers has examined the potential impacts of oil and gas resource extraction in the Canadian oil sands (OS). A large proportion focuses on terrestrial biology: wildlife, birds, and vegetation. We provide a qualitative synthesis of the condition of the environment in the oil sands region (OSR) from 2009 to 2020 to identify gaps and progress cumulative effects assessments. Our objectives were to (1) qualitatively synthesize and critically review knowledge from the OSR; (2) identify consistent trends and generalizable conclusions; and (3) pinpoint gaps in need of greater monitoring or research effort. We visualize knowledge and terrestrial monitoring foci by allocating papers to a conceptual model for the OS. Despite a recent increase in publications, focus has remained concentrated on a few key stressors, especially landscape disturbance, and a few taxa of interest. Stressor and response monitoring is well represented, but direct monitoring of pathways (linkages between stressors and responses) is limited. Important knowledge gaps include understanding effects at multiple spatial scales, mammal health effects monitoring, focused monitoring of local resources important to Indigenous communities, and geospatial coverage and availability, including higher attribute resolution in human footprint, comprehensive land cover mapping, and up-to-date LiDAR coverage. Causal attribution based on spatial proximity to operations or spatial orientation of monitoring in the region is common but may be limited in the strength of inference that it provides.

AB  - In food packaging, smart indicator films based on natural resources have greatly attracted researchers to minimize the environmental issues as well as to satisfy consumer preferences for food safety. In this research, pH-sensitive films were prepared using purple-fleshed sweet potato starch (SPS) and sweet potato peel (SPP). Two categories of the film (i) SPS and (ii) SPS/SPP, were fabricated via solvent casting technique, incorporating different concentrations of commercial purple sweet potato anthocyanin (CA) at 0%, 1%, 1.5%, and 2% (w/v) and the physicochemical, mechanical, thermal, and morphological properties of the films were investigated. The thickness, water solubility, and swelling degree of the films increased with the increment of CA, whereas there were no significant changes in the water content (WC) of the films. Water vapor permeability (WVP) was decreased for SPS films while statistically similar for SPS/SPP films. The addition of CA reduced the tensile strength (TS) and tensile modulus (TM) yet increased the elongation at break (EaB) of the films as compared to films without CA. The FTIR results confirmed the immobilization of anthocyanin into the film. In SEM images, roughness in the surfaces of the CA-associated films was observed. A reduction of thermal stability was found for the films with anthocyanin except for the SPS/SPP CA 2% film. Furthermore, the CA-associated films showed a remarkable color response when subjected to pH buffers (pH 1 to 12) and successfully monitored chicken freshness. The fastest color migration was observed in acidic conditions when the films were immersed into aqueous, acidic, low fat, and fatty food simulants. The findings of this work demonstrated that the developed pH indicator films have the potential to be implemented as smart packaging to monitor food freshness and quality for safe consumption.

AB  - Private wells in Ireland and elsewhere have been shown to be prone to microbial contamination with the main suspected sources being practices associated with agriculture and domestic wastewater treatment systems (DWWTS). While the microbial quality of private well water is commonly assessed using faecal indicator bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, such organisms are not usually source-specific, and hence cannot definitively conclude the exact origin of the contamination. This research assessed a range of different chemical contamination fingerprinting techniques (ionic ratios, artificial sweeteners, caffeine, fluorescent whitening compounds, faecal sterol profiles and pharmaceuticals) as to their use to apportion contamination of private wells between human wastewater and animal husbandry wastes in rural areas of Ireland. A one-off sampling and analysis campaign of 212 private wells found that 15% were contaminated with E. coli. More extensive monitoring of 24 selected wells found 58% to be contaminated with E. coli on at least one occasion over a 14-month period. The application of fingerprinting techniques to these monitored wells found that the use of chloride/bromide and potassium/sodium ratios is a useful low-cost fingerprinting technique capable of identifying impacts from human wastewater and organic agricultural contamination, respectively. The artificial sweetener acesulfame was detected on several occasions in a number of monitored wells, indicating its conservative nature and potential use as a fingerprinting technique for human wastewater. However, neither fluorescent whitening compounds nor caffeine were detected in any wells, and faecal sterol profiles proved inconclusive, suggesting limited suitability for the conditions investigated.

AB  - The primary objective of this study was to use ecosystem services in land allocation across Gharehsoo watershed in Golestan Province, north of Iran. Hence, land suitability was assessed using multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) methods to develop forestry, agriculture, range management, construction, and conservation land uses. Ecosystem services including water yield, habitat quality, and aesthetic quality were also quantified using integrated valuation of environmental services and tradeoffs (InVEST) and MCE methods. Next, the land allocation was investigated under five scenarios developed based on the land suitability and ecosystem services, namely land suitability, water yield, habitat quality, aesthetic quality and integration scenarios. The scenarios were then implemented using particle swarm optimization algorithm and compared to each other, based on the spatial land use variability and land use fragmentation. The results revealed that there is an obvious difference between the northern and southern parts of the region in terms of their land suitability and ecosystem services. An almost increasing trend was also observed for the allocated area to forestry, range management, and conservation land uses in the following order of scenarios: land suitability, aesthetic quality, water yield, integration, and habitat quality. However, an almost decreasing trend was obtained for agriculture and construction land uses in the same order of scenarios. Besides, range management and agriculture land uses had the highest and lowest spatial variability in all the scenarios, respectively. The results also clarified that the land use fragmentation decreased more in the water yield scenario than the other scenarios. This study indicated that using ecosystem services in land allocation can improve land use pattern and arrangement, consequently, helping take into account the ecosystem conditions in land use planning. In conclusion, this approach can help land managers to make appropriate decisions for maintaining ecosystem services in any region.

AB  - The fungus Ophiocordyceps sinensis is endemic to the vast region of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau (QTP). The unique and complex geographical environmental conditions have led to the "sky island" distribution structure of O. sinensis. Due to limited and unbalanced sample collections, the previous data on O. sinensis regarding its genetic diversity and spatial structure have been deemed insufficient. In this study, we analyzed the diversity and phylogeographic structures of O. sinensis using internally transcribed spacer region (ITS) and 5-locus datasets by a large-scale sampling. A total of 111 haplotypes of ITS sequences were identified from 948 samples data of the fungus O. sinensis, with representing high genetic diversity, and 8 phylogenetic clades were recognized in O. sinensis. Both the southeastern Tibet and the northwestern Yunnan were the centers of genetic diversity and genetic differentiation of the fungus, and they were inferred as the glacial refugia in the Quaternary. Three distribution patterns were identified to correspond to the 8 clades, including but not limited to the coexistence of widely and specific local distributive structures. It also revealed that the differentiation pattern of O. sinensis did not fit for the isolation-by-distance model. The differentiation into the 8 clades occurred between 1.56 Myr and 6.62 Myr. The ancestor of O. sinensis most likely originated in the late Miocene (6.62 Myr) in the northwestern Yunnan, and the Scene A-C of the Qinghai-Tibetan movements may have played an important role in the differentiation of O. sinensis during the late Miocene-Pliocene periods. Our current results provide a much clearer and detailed understanding of the genetic diversity and geographical spatial distribution of the endemic alpine fungus O. sinensis. It also revealed that the geochronology resulting from paleogeology could be cross-examined with biomolecular clock at a finer scale.

AB  - Plants regulate soils and microclimate, provide substrate for heterotrophic taxa, are easy to observe and identify and have a stable taxonomy, which strongly justifies their use as indicators in monitoring and conservation. However, there is no consensus as to whether plants are strong predictors of total multi-taxon species richness. In this study, we investigate if general terrestrial species richness can be predicted by vascular plant richness and bioindication. To answer this question, we collected an extensive dataset on species richness of vascular plants, bryophytes, macrofungi, lichens, plant-galling arthropods, gastropods, spiders, carabid beetles, hoverflies, and genetic richness (operational taxonomic units = OTUs) from environmental DNA metabarcoding. We also constructed a Conservation Index based on threatened red list species. Besides using richness of vascular plants for prediction of other taxonomic groups, we also used plant-derived calibration of the abiotic environment (moisture, soil fertility and light conditions) as well as the degree of anthropogenic impact. Bivariate relationships between plant species richness and other species groups showed no consistent pattern. After taking environmental calibration by bioindication into account, we found a consistent, and for most groups significant, positive effect of plant richness. Plant species richness was also important for richness of fungal OTUs, Malaise OTUs and for the Conservation Index. Our multiple regression analyses revealed (a) a consistently positive effect of plant richness on other taxa, (b) prediction of 12%-55% of variation in other taxa and 48% of variation in the total species richness when bioindication and plant richness were used as predictors. Our results justify that vascular plants are strong indicators of total biodiversity across environmental gradients and broad taxonomic realms and therefore a natural first choice for biodiversity monitoring and conservation planning.

AB  - The Environmental Impact Assessment (ETA) is one of the important means of environmental management worldwide, and the EIA follow-up is one of the crucial measures to ensure the concrete implementation of the EIA. In this research, systematic reviews of EIA follow-up for projects in China were conducted to comprehensively appraise the implementation of the EIA follow-up and to identify the potential to improve the practice of an EIA follow-up. First, the EIA follow-up reports were collected through various sources. In total, there were 74 EIA follow-up reports that were identified and acquired. Second, a reviewing framework, containing 16 different indicators, was developed to systematically document and classify these EIA follow-up reports. Third, these EIA follow-up reports were grouped into several categories according to various indicators and then were analyzed to recognize their key features, including sources of data, analytic tools adopted, spatial-temporal distribution, industrial distribution, triggering causes, content, structure and effectiveness. The results showed that there were considerable disparities in the quality and the rigor of EIA follow-ups conducted. These features, along with some existing deficiencies of EIA follow-up, such as the lack of corresponding monitoring and management, can greatly limit the overall application and effectiveness of EIA follow-up in China. However, a number of good practices were identified. For example, a list of projects subject to mandatory ETA follow-up was promulgated, and the conditions for projects subject to EIA follow-up were explicitly stipulated in regulations. These good practices would be very helpful for the international EIA community to advance the practice of EIA follow-up, to reduce the disparities in the quality and the rigor of EIA follow-up, to improve the overall effectiveness of EIA follow-up and to promote the future implementation and development of EIA follow-up.

AB  - How environmental change affects a species' phenotype is crucial not only for taxonomy and biodiversity assessments but also for its application as a palaeo-ecological and ecological indicator. Previous investigations addressing the impact of the climate and hydrochemical regime on ostracod valve morphology have yielded contrasting results. Frequently identified ecological factors influencing carapace shape are salinity, cation, sulfate concentrations, and alkalinity. Here, we present a thorough approach integrating data with the carapace outline and surface details of the ubiquitous Neotropical cytheroidean ostracod species Cytheridella ilosvayi, as well as several climatic and hydrochemical variables, in order to investigate a potential link between morphology and environmental conditions. A recent study previously demonstrated considerable biogeographical variation in valve morphology among Floridian, Mexican and Brazilian populations of this species. We hypothesize that the climatic differences between the regions it inhabits and associated differences in hydrochemical regimes have influenced valve morphology and eventually led to biogeographically distinctive groups. Generalized least-squares Procrustes analyses based on outline and structural features were applied to the left and right valves of adult females and males. The analyses identified relative carapace length and shape symmetry as most important morphological characteristics representing shape differences across all datasets. Two-block partial least-squares analyses and multiple regressions indicate strong relationships between morphological and environmental variables, specifically with temperature seasonality, annual precipitation and chloride and sulfate concentrations. We suggest that increased temperature seasonality slowed down growth rates during colder months, potentially triggering the development of shortened valves with well-developed brood pouches. Differences in chloride and sulfate concentrations, related to fluctuations in precipitation, are considered to affect valve development via controlling osmoregulation and carapace calcification. The factors identified by our analyses represent hitherto unknown drivers for ostracod ecophenotypy in other species and therefore suggest that environmental predictors for morphological variability are not consistent across non-marine ostracods.

AB  - Water regime is regarded as the primary factor influencing the vegetation distribution in natural wetland ecosystems. However, the effect of water regime change induced by large-scale hydraulic engineering on vegetation distribution is still unclear. In this study, multi-temporal TM/ETM+/OLI images and hydrological data from 1995 to 2015 were used to elucidate how the change in water regime influenced the vegetation distribution in the East Dongting Lake (EDTL), especially after the operation of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) in 2003. Using unsupervised and supervised classification methods, three types of land cover were identified in the study area: Water and Mudflat, Grass, and Reed and Forest. Results showed that the total vegetation area in EDTL increased by approximately 78 km(2) during 1995-2015. The areas of Reed and Forest and Grass exhibited a contrasting trend, dramatic increase in Reed and Forest but sharp decrease in Grass, particularly after the operation of TGD. The lowest distribution elevations of Grass and Reed and Forest decreased by 0.61 and 0.52 m, respectively. As a result of water level variation, submergence duration increased at 20-21 m and 28 m elevations (1-13 days), but significantly decreased at 22-27 m and 29-30 m elevations (-3 to -31 days). The submergence duration of Grass and Reed and Forest was 246 and 177 days, respectively. This study indicated that wetland vegetation pattern significantly changed after the operation of TGD, mainly as a result of changes in submergence condition. Submergence duration might be an effective indicator to predict the shift of vegetation distribution in EDTL, and which could provide scientific guidance for vegetation restoration and wetland management in this lake.

AB  - Hydrodynamics and sediment transport are key physical processes contributing to habitat structure within the marine environment. Coastal development that results in the alteration of these processes (e.g., changing water flushing and/or sedimentation rates) can have detrimental impacts on sensitive systems. This is a current, relevant issue in Qatar as its coastal regions continue to be developed, not only around the capital of Doha, but in many areas around this Arabian Gulf peninsula. The northeastern Qatari coast is comprised of diverse and sensitive flora and fauna such as seagrass and macroalgae meadows, coral reefs and patches, turtles, and dugongs that tolerate harsh environmental conditions. In the near future, this area may see a rise in anthropogenic activity in the form of coastal development projects. These projects will add to existing natural stresses, such as high temperature, high salinity, and low rates of precipitation. Consequently, there is a need to characterize this area and assess the potential impacts that these anthropogenic activities may have on the region. In the present study, a novel sediment transport model is described and used to demonstrate the potential impact of altering hydrodynamics and subsequent sediment transport along the northeastern Qatar nearshore marine environment. The developed models will be tested using potential scenarios of future anthropogenic activities forecasted to take place in the area. The results will show the effects on water and sediment behavior and provide a scientific approach for key stakeholders to make decisions with respect to the management of the considered coastal zone. Furthermore, it provides a tool and framework that can be utilized in environmental impact assessment and associated hydrodynamic studies along other areas of the Qatari coastal zone. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB  - Biomonitoring tools are useful to assess the impact of environmental changes on the functioning of ecosystems. Existing tools mostly require species identification, thus allowing to estimating changes in biodiversity, and possibly inferring ecosystem functioning, using functional diversity and traits based approaches.
   Testate amoebae are good indicators of surface moisture conditions in Sphagnum peatlands and are routinely used in palaeoecology. Their shells (tests), on which identification is based, can also be used to define functional traits and thus to infer changes in ecosystem functioning.
   We investigated the response of testate amoeba communities to manipulated water table depth (wet: 4 cm, intermediate: -15 cm, and dry: -25 cm) over time (seven time points, 19 months) using mesocosms by comparing two approaches: community structure and functional traits responses, using a combination of morphological (biovolume, length, aperture size and position) and physiological (mixotrophy/heterotrophy, shell material) traits.
   This is the first study investigating the effect of water table depth on testate amoeba assemblages over time using a mesocosm approach. Taxonomical and functional approaches showed similar response patterns, confirming that water level acted as a strong environmental filter. After one year Hyalosphenia papilio decreased in the dry treatment, and the community structure shifted towards a dominance of dry indicators (Nebela tincta complex, Corythion dubiurn, Euglypha compressa) and the selected functional traits (smaller, heterotrophic, compressed species, with a ventral aperture) corresponded to drought adaptations.
   In line with recent observational and transfer function studies exploring the use of testate amoebae functional traits, our experimental results illustrate how well-selected traits could be used to monitor the impact of present and past climatic changes on Sphagnum peatlands.

AB  - An ecological time-series study is conducted to quantify health-effect coefficients associated with climate-sensitive variables namely temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, and wind speed and estimate environmental burden of diseases attributed to temperature as the main climatic variable together with climate change in Nepal. The study is based upon daily data of climate-sensitive variables and hospitalizations collected for 5 years between 2009 and 2014. Generalized linear model is used to estimate health-effect coefficients accounting distributed lag effects. Results show 3.08%, 10.14%, and 3.27% rise in water-borne, vector-borne, and renal disease hospitalizations, respectively, and 3.67% rise in water- and vector-borne disease deaths per 1 degrees C rise in average temperature. Similarly, 2.45% and 1.44% rise in heart disease hospitalization and all-cause mortality, respectively per 1 degrees C rise in absolute difference of average temperature with its overall average (20 degrees C). The computed attributable fractions are 0.3759, 0.6696, 0.2909, and 0.1024 for water-borne, vector-borne, renal, and heart disease hospitalizations, respectively, and 0.0607 and 0.4335 for all-cause mortality and disease-specific mortality of water- and vector-borne diseases, respectively. The percent change in attributable burdens due to climate change are found to be 4.32%, 4.64%, 7.20%, and -2.29% for water-borne, vector-borne, renal, and heart disease hospitalizations, respectively, and -1.39% and 6.55% for all-cause deaths and water-borne and vector-borne disease deaths, respectively. In conclusion, climate-sensitive variables have significant effects on many major health burdens in Nepal. In the context of changing climatic scenarios around the world including that of Nepal, such changes are bound to affect the health burden of Nepalese people.

AB  - Dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTL) is an organotin compound that has been widely detected in aquatic environments. However, the ecological risk assessment for DBTL is hard to perform due to the absence of water quality criteria (WQC) and lack of toxicity data. In this study, toxicity data were obtained from acute and chronic toxicity tests using aquatic species resident in China. Based on the species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) constructed from these test data, the acute water quality criterion (AWQC) and chronic water quality criterion (CWQC) were then derived to be 132 p.g/L and 31.mu g/L for DBTL. In order to valid the predicted data in the application to the protective criteria development and hazard assessment, the web -based interspecies correlation estimation (Web-ICE) system was used to estimate acute toxicities. Here two acute toxicity data groups for surrogate species were chosen from experimental data and QSAR Toolbox-predicted data separately, giving estimated data for prediction species using Web-ICE software. According to Kolmogorov Smirnov test results, Web-ICE -based SSDs and measurement-based SSD were not significantly different. The results showed that the differences between measurement-based (132 mu g/L) and Web-ICE -based AWQCs (39.7 mu g/L and 58.5 mu G/L) were statistically acceptable. Under certain conditions, it is therefore worth considering using the QSAR Toolbox plus Web-ICE method here to provide a beneficial supplement for developing preliminarily screen level toxicities in WQC when little or no relevant information are available. Besides, the geographic distribution of species was demonstrated not to be a significant factor in SSD establishment and WQC derivation.(C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Transportation played a significant role in energy consumption and pollution subsequently. Caused by the intense growth of greenhouse gas emission, efficient and sustainable improvement of the transportation sector has elevated the concern in many nations including Malaysia. Bioethanol is an alternative and renewable energy that has a great potential to substitute for fossil gasoline in internal combustion engine (ICE). Although bioethanol has been widely utilized in road transport worldwide, the production and application of bioethanol in Malaysia is yet to be considered. Presently there is comprehensive diversity of bioethanol research on distillation, performance and emission analysis available worldwide. Yet, the study on techno-economic and feasibility of bioethanol fuel in Malaysia condition is unavailable. Thus, this study is concentrated on bioethanol production and techno-economic analysis of cassava bioethanol as an alternative fuel in Malaysia. Furthermore, the current study attempts to determine the effect of bioethanol employment towards the energy scenario, environmental and economy. From the economic analysis, determined that the life cycle cost for 54 ktons cassava bioethanol production plant with a project life time of 20 years is $132 million USD, which is equivalent to $0.11 USD per litre of bioethanol. Furthermore, substituting 5 % of gasoline fuel with bioethanol fuel in road transport can reduce the CO2 emissions up to 2,038 ktons in year 2036. In case to repay the carbon debt from converting natural forest to cassava cropland, cassava bioethanol required about 5.4 years. The cassava bioethanol is much cheaper than gasoline fuel even when 20 % taxation is subjected to bioethanol at current production cost. Thus, this study serves as a guideline for further investigation and research on bioethanol production, subsidy cost and other limitation factors before the extensive application of bioethanol can be implemented in Malaysia.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) are important tools for forecasting the potential impacts of future environmental changes but debate remains over the most robust modelling approaches for making projections. Suggested improvements in SDMs vary from algorithmic development through to more mechanistic modelling approaches. Here, we focus on the improvements that can be gained by conditioning SDMs on more detailed data. Specifically, we use breeding bird data from across Europe to compare the relative performances of SDMs trained on presence-absence data and those trained on abundance data. Species distribution models trained on presence-absence data, with a poor to slight fit according to Cohen's kappa, show an average improvement in model performance of 032 (SE +/- 012) when trained on abundance data. Even those species for which models trained on presence-absence data are classified as good to excellent show a mean improvement in Cohen's kappa score of 005 (SE +/- 001) when corresponding SDMs are trained on abundance data. This improved explanatory power is most pronounced for species of high prevalence. Our results illustrate that even using coarse scale abundance data, large improvements in our ability to predict species distributions can be achieved. Furthermore, predictions from abundance models provide a greater depth of information with regard to population dynamics than their presence-absence model counterparts. Currently, despite the existence of a wide variety of abundance data sets, species distribution modellers continue to rely almost exclusively on presence-absence data to train and test SDMs. Given our findings, we advocate that, where available, abundance data rather than presence-absence data can be used to more accurately predict the ecological consequences of environmental change. Additionally, our findings highlight the importance of informative baseline data sets. We therefore recommend the move towards increased collection of abundance data, even if only coarse numerical scales of recording are possible.

AB  - Successful conservation plans are conditioned by our ability to detect anthropogenic change in space and time and various statistical analyses have been developed to handle this critical issue. The main objective of this paper is to illustrate a new approach for spatial analysis in conservation biology. Here, we propose a two-step protocol. First, we introduce a new disturbance metric which provides a continuous measure of disturbance for any focal communities on the basis of the surrounding landscape matrix. Second, we use this new gradient to estimate species and community disturbance thresholds by implementing a recently developed method called Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis (TITAN). TITAN detects changes in species distributions along environmental gradients using indicators species analysis and assesses synchrony among species change points as evidence for community thresholds. We demonstrate our method with soil arthropod assemblages along a disturbance gradient in Terceira Island (Azores, Portugal). We show that our new disturbance metric realistically reflects disturbance patterns, especially in buffer zones (ecotones) between land use categories. By estimating species disturbance thresholds with TITAN along the disturbance gradient in Terceira, we show that species significantly associated with low disturbance differ from those associated with high disturbance in their biogeographical origin (endemics, non-endemic natives and exotics) and taxonomy (order). Finally, we suggest that mapping the disturbance community thresholds may reveal areas of primary interest for conservation, since these may host indigenous species sensitive to high disturbance levels. This new framework may be useful when: (1) both local and regional processes are to be reflected on single disturbance measures; (2) these are better quantified in a continuous gradient; (3) mapping disturbance of large regions using fine scales is necessary; (4) indicator species for disturbance are searched for and; (5) community thresholds are useful to understand the global dynamics of habitats.

AB  - Characterizing the relationship between different taxonomic groups is critical to identify potential surrogates for biodiversity. Previous studies have shown that cross-taxa relationships are generally weak and/or inconsistent. The difficulties in finding predictive patterns have often been attributed to the spatial and temporal scales of these studies and on the differences in the measure used to evaluate such relationships (species richness versus composition). However, the choice of the analytical approach used to evaluate cross-taxon congruence inevitably represents a major source of variation. Here, we described the use of a range of methods that can be used to comprehensively assess cross-taxa relationships. To do so, we used data for two taxonomic groups, wetland plants and water beetles, collected from 54 farmland ponds in Ireland. Specifically, we used the Pearson correlation and rarefaction curves to analyse patterns in species richness, while Mantel tests, Procrustes analysis, and co-correspondence analysis were used to evaluate congruence in species composition. We compared the results of these analyses and we described some of the potential pitfalls associated with the use of each of these statistical approaches. Cross-taxon congruence was moderate to strong, depending on the choice of the analytical approach, on the nature of the response variable, and on local and environmental conditions. Our findings indicate that multiple approaches and measures of community structure are required for a comprehensive assessment of cross-taxa relationships. In particular, we showed that selection of surrogate taxa in conservation planning should not be based on a single statistic expressing the degree of correlation in species richness or composition. Potential solutions to the analytical issues associated with the assessment of cross-taxon congruence are provided and the implications of our findings in the selection of surrogates for biodiversity are discussed.

AB  - Concerns about the effects of global warming on Arctic environments have stimulated multi-disciplinary research into the history of their long-term climatic and environmental variability to improve future predictions of climate in these remote areas. Here we present the first palaeolimnological study for Southampton Island using analyses of chironomids supported by sedimentological analyses, carried out on a 1 m long core retrieved from a lake located in the northeastern part of the island. This core was made up of marine sediments underneath 65 cm of freshwater lake sediments. A marine shell, humic-acids and chironomid head capsules were used to date this sequence. The Holocene environmental history of the lake consisted of two major contrasting periods. The first one, between about 5570 and 4360 cal. yr BP, was climatically unstable, with common postglacial chironomid taxa such as Corynocera oliveri-type, Paracladius and Microspectra radialis-type. This period also corresponded to the highest chironomid-inferred August air temperature (10 degrees C) for the whole record and to significant increases in major chemical elements as detected by x-ray fluorescence. During the second period, which lasted from about 3570 cal. yr BP until the present, limnological conditions seemed to stabilize after a change to cold oligotrophic chironomid taxa, such as Heterotrissocladius subpilosus-group, with no major variations in the abundance of chemical elements. Inferred August air temperatures ranged between 8 and 9 degrees C. This study provided unique information on the timing of the Holocene Thermal Maximum in the Foxe Basin area, a region with very little information available on long-term climate change. This region showed, so far, relatively few signs of recent climatic change, as opposed to other regions in the High Arctic.

AB  - Recent investigations found high abundances of the fecal indicator Escherichia coli in shoreline sand at freshwater beaches, but it is not known whether these high numbers are due to passive filtration/trapping of the bacteria, or to colonization and growth. This study was initiated to test the hypothesis that high abundance can be explained, at least in part, by the ability of E. coli to persist and grow in beach sand. A combination of laboratory and field studies was used to monitor the densities of environmental isolates of E. coli in beach sand. In controlled laboratory microcosm studies using autoclaved beach sand inoculated with E. coli strains previously isolated from ambient beach sand. E. coli densities increased from 2 CFU/g to more than 2 x 10(5) CFU/g sand after 2 days of incubation at 19 degrees C. and remained above 2 X 10(5) CFU/g for at least 35 days. In field studies utilizing similarly inoculated beach sand in diffusion chambers incubated at a Lake Huron beach E. coli also grew rapidly, reaching high densities (approximately 7.5 x 10(5) CFU/g), and persisting in a cultivable state at high density for at least 48 days. In comparison, E. coli levels iun ambient beach snad adjacent to the chambers always had densities < 100 CFU/g. Lake Huron beach sand clearly provides nutrients, temperature and other conditions needed to support growth of E. coli. The growth of E. coli in sterile sand diffusion chambers to higher levels than occurs in ambient beach sand may indicate the presence in ambient sand of biological controls on bacterial growth, such as predation or competition. higher lei els than occurs ill ambient beach sand ma - v indicate ill(, presence ill ambient sand clfbiolol-ical controls oil bacterial growth, such as predation or competition.

AB  - A diesel engine running on diesel/biodiesel mixtures containing ethylene glycol diacetate (EGDA) was investigated from the exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental viewpoints. Biodiesel was mixed with petrodiesel at 5% and 20% volume ratios, and the resultant mixtures were then doped with EGDA at 1-3% volume ratios. The exergetic sustainability indicators of the engine operating on the prepared fuel formulations were determined at varying engine loads. The indicators were selected to support decision-making on fuel composition and engine load following thermodynamic, economic, and environmental considerations. The engine load markedly affected all the studied exergetic parameters. The highest engine exergetic efficiency (39.5%) was obtained for petrodiesel doped with 1 v/v% EGDA at the engine load of 50%. The minimum value of the unit cost of brake power exergy (49.6 US$/GJ) was found for straight petrodiesel at full-load conditions, while the minimum value of the unit environmental impact of brake power exergy (29.9 mPts/GJ) was observed for petrodiesel mixed with 5 v/v% biodiesel at the engine load of 75%. Overall, adding EGDA to fuel mixtures did not favorably influence the outcomes of both exergetic methods due to its energy-intensive and cost-prohibitive production process. In conclusion, although petrodiesel fuel improvers such EGDA used in the present study could properly mitigate pollutant emissions, the adverse effects of such additives on thermodynamic parameters of diesel engines, particularly on exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental indices, need to be taken into account, and necessary optimizations should be made before their real-world application.

AB  - In this study, the technical, economic and environmental attributes of a full-scale nutrient recovery process connected to the centralized swine wastewater treatment facility (CSWTF) were evaluated. The performance of the process was assessed by introducing influent to the recovery reactor from different components of the CSWTF such as sedimentation tank (swine wastewater) and biological treatment reactor (biologically oxidized material and supernatant of the biologically oxidized material). The results of technical performance assessment revealed that the O-P recovery (87.1-90.7%) and NH4-N removal (66.9-72.1%) efficiencies from the influent of biological treatment reactor were significantly higher than the influent from sedimentation tank (81.7 and 19.8%, respectively, p < 0.05). The economic evaluation elucidated that by increasing the treatment capacity of the recovery reactor from 30 m(3)/d to 100 m(3)/d, operating expenses could be covered through the commercialization of struvite, while it would take around seven years to get back the capital investment. Additional economic savings could also be possible when using the recovered struvite as a fertilizer raw material along with other environmental benefits. Considering the current farming practices in Korea, the complete recovery of O-P from CSWTFs as struvite could drop the soil phosphorus surplus by 40%, minimize the phosphatic fertilizer consumption by 6.4% and ultimately reduce CO2 equivalent emissions of 6522 tons/year in comparison to chemical fertilizer production. However, during the continuous operation of the full-scale nutrient recovery process, influent characteristics need to be incessantly monitored and adjusted to the optimum conditions to improve the economics of recovered products. Overall, the nutrient recovery process at full-scale not only solves the problem of treating highly polluted swine wastewater but also helps to ensure societal and environmental sustainability.

AB  - Recent years, the hydrological connectivity has gained popularity in various research fields, however, its definition and threshold effects at a system scale have not received adequate attention. The current research proposes a promising framework to refine the concept of surface hydrological connectivity by combining hydrodynamic modeling experiments, threshold effects and geostatistical connectivity analysis, exemplified by the flood-pulse-influenced Poyang Lake floodplain system (China). To enhance the inherent linkage between hydrological connectivity and eco-environments, total connectivity (TC), general connectivity (GC), and effective connectivity (EC) were proposed to refine the metrics of hydrological connectivity. The results show that substantial differences between the three connectivity metrics are observed for all target directions, demonstrating that the joint role of water depth and flow velocity may produce more dynamic and complex influences on EC than the other two metrics of TC and GC. Topographically, the connectivity objects/areas within the flood pulse system reveal that the floodplain is a more sensitive area than the lake's main flow channels under different connectivity conditions. The modelling experimental studies show that variations in water depth thresholds are more likely to have a strong effect on connectivity for the dry, rising, and falling limbs, rather than the flooding period, while the flow velocity may exert an opposite threshold effect. The lake-floodplain system is characterized by a dynamic threshold behavior, with seasonally varying water depth and velocity thresholds. This study highlights the importance of redefined connectivity concept for facilitating scientific communication by combining hydrodynamic thresholds and offering recommendations for future connectivity assessments using our proposed metrics of TC, GC, and EC.

AB  - In modern society the night sky is lit up not only by the moon but also by artificial light devices. Both of these light sources can have a major impact on wildlife physiology and behaviour. For example, a number of bird species were found to sleep several hours less under full moon compared to new moon and a similar sleep-suppressing effect has been reported for artificial light at night (ALAN). Cloud cover at night can modulate the light levels perceived by wildlife, yet, in opposite directions for ALAN and moon. While clouds will block moon light, it may reflect and amplify ALAN levels and increases the night glow in urbanized areas. As a consequence, cloud cover may also modulate the sleep-suppressing effects of moon and ALAN in different directions. In this study we therefore measured sleep in barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) under semi-natural conditions in relation to moon phase, ALAN and cloud cover. Our analysis shows that, during new moon nights stronger cloud cover was indeed associated with increased ALAN levels at our study site. In contrast, light levels during full moon nights were fairly constant, presumably because of moonlight on clear nights or because of reflected artificial light on cloudy nights. Importantly, cloud cover caused an estimated 24.8% reduction in the amount of night-time NREM sleep from nights with medium to full cloud cover, particularly during new moon when sleep was unaffected by moon light. In conclusion, our findings suggest that cloud cover can, in a rather dramatic way, amplify the immediate effects of ALAN on wildlife. Sleep appears to be highly sensitive to ALAN and may therefore be a good indicator of its biological effects. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - It is substantiated that mobilization of efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) against the background of the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic provides for a radical rethinking of the priorities of agri-food policy. This concerns the improvement of the social development policy of the countryside and the solution to the problems of sustainable development of rural areas. The specificity of the concept of sustainable development of rural areas as interconnected into a single system of economic, social, and environmental goals and objectives is revealed. These include sustainable growth of the rural economy, diversification of its structure, the achievement of food security; increasing employment, the level and quality of life of the rural population, reducing interregional and intraregional differentiation, eliminating poverty, bringing the countryside closer to urban living standards; rationalization of the use of natural potential and preservation of the natural environment. Solving the problems of social development of the countryside contributes to the transition to an inclusive development model. The author's methodology made it possible to substantiate the criteria and indicators that characterize the level of social inclusion. By this approach, an empirical research base was formed and a comprehensive assessment of the social development of the village was given in the context of the following aspects: poverty of the population, the risk of poverty and poverty fields depending on the place of residence of the population; urban and rural unemployment; resources and final consumption expenditures, on average, per household member; physical and economic accessibility of basic food products for the urban and rural population. Measures have been formulated to facilitate the transition of the agri-food system to an inclusive development model and overcome negative trends in the post-pandemic economy.

AB  - In recent past agroforestry systems have been recognized as sustainable land use system over conventional agriculture. However, the major obstacle in up scaling of this tree based land use systems is the difficulty in quantification and demonstration of the ecological and economical sustainability as compared to agriculture. Nevertheless, energy analysis is being widely used at global, national and regional scale to assess the sustainability of system production as it evaluates the system components on common units and also helps to understand the resource use and production efficiency of tree based farming system. Therefore, the present investigation was undertaken to assess the economics and energy use efficiency of different neem (Azadirachta indicaA. Juss.) and teak (Tectona grandisL.f.) based agroforestry systems in rainfed and irrigated ecosystems respectively in north-eastern dry zone of Karnataka, India. The economic analysis of neem based agroforestry systems under rainfed condition revealed higher net returns and B:C ratio with crop alone (control) (515 $ ha(-1) year(-1), 2.00 respectively) over different agroforestry systems. While, in teak based agroforestry systems under irrigated ecosystem higher B:C ratio were recorded (4.07 to 5.71) over control (2.87). However, energy analysis revealed that both neem (3.99 to 4.15) and teak based agroforestry systems (4.48 to 7.74) were energetically superior to control (3.32 and 4.21 respectively). Energy analysis appeared to be the most appropriate method to assess the agroforestry systems rather than economics or life cycle assessment though intangible benefits of tree based land use system are not considered in the former. Therefore, integrated approach involving both ecological and economical assessment is suggested to quantify the sustainability and productivity across types of system and ecological situations.

AB  - Compared to marine microplastics research, few studies have bio-monitored microplastics in inland waters. It is also important to understand the microplastics' uptake and their potential risks to freshwater species. The Australian glass shrimp Paratya australiensis (Family: Atyidae) is commonly found in fresh waterbodies in eastern Australia, and are sensitive to anthropogenic stressors but have a wide tolerance range to the natural environmental conditions. This study aimed to understand the microplastics' occurrence and types in water samples and the shrimp P. australiensis, and identify if the shrimp could be a suitable bioindicator for microplastic pollution. Surface water and P. australiensis across ten urban and rural freshwater sites in Victoria were sampled. In total, 30 water samples and 100 shrimp were analysed for microplastic content, and shrimp body weights and sizes were also recorded. Microplastics were picked, photographed and identified using FT-IR microscopy: in water samples, 57.9% of items including suspect items were selected to identify; all microplastics found in shrimp samples were identified. Microplastics were present in the surface waters of all sites, with an average abundance of 0.40 +/- 0.27 items/L. A total of 36% of shrimp contained microplastics with an average of 0.52 +/- 0.55 items/ind (24 +/- 31 items/g). Fibre was the most common shape, and blue was the most frequent colour in both water and shrimp samples. The dominant plastic types were polyester in water samples, and rayon in shrimp samples. Even though results from this study show a relatively low concentration of microplastics in water samples in comparison with global studies, it is worth noticing that microplastics were regularly detected in fresh waterbodies in Victoria, Australia. Compared with water samples, shrimp contained a wider variety of plastic types, suggesting they may potentially behave as passive samplers of microplastics pollution in freshwater environments.

AB  - Facilitation processes constitute basic elements of vegetation dynamics in harsh systems. Recent studies in tropical alpine environments demonstrated how pioneer plant species defined as "ecosystem engineers" are capable of enhancing landscape-level richness by adding new species to the community through the modification of microhabitats, and also provided hints about the alternation of different ecosystem engineers over time. Nevertheless, most of the existing works analysed different ecosystem engineers separately, without considering the interaction of different ecosystem engineers. Focusing on the altitudinal limit of Peruvian Dry Puna vegetation, we hypothesized that positive interactions structure plant communities by facilitation cascades involving different ecosystem engineers, determining the evolution of the microhabitat patches in terms of abiotic resources and beneficiary species hosted. To analyze successional mechanisms, we used a "space-for-time" substitution to account for changes over time, and analyzed data on soil texture, composition, and temperature, facilitated species and their interaction with nurse species, and surface area of engineered patches by means of chemical analyses, indicator species analysis, and rarefaction curves. A successional process, resulting from the dynamic interaction of different ecosystem engineers, which determined a progressive amelioration of soil conditions (e.g. nitrogen and organic matter content, and temperature), was the main driver of species assemblage at the community scale, enhancing species richness. Cushion plants act as pioneers, by starting the successional processes that continue with shrubs and tussocks. Tussock grasses have sometimes been found to be capable of creating microhabitat patches independently. The dynamics of species assemblage seem to follow the nested assemblage mechanism, in which the first foundation species to colonize a habitat provides a novel substrate for colonization by other foundation species through a facilitation cascade process.

AB  - Arctic lakes, through their ice cover phenology, are a key indicator of climatic changes that the high-latitude environment is experiencing. In the case of lakes in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA), many of which are ice covered more than 10 months per year, warmer temperatures could result in ice regime shifts. Within the dominant polar-desert environment, small local warmer areas have been identified. These relatively small regions - polar oases - with longer growing seasons and greater biological productivity and diversity are secluded from the surrounding barren polar desert. The ice regimes of 11 lakes located in both polar-desert and polar-oasis environments, with surface areas between 4 and 542aEuro-km(2), many of unknown bathymetry, were documented. In order to investigate the response of ice cover of lakes in the CAA to climate conditions during recent years, a 15-year time series (1997-2011) of RADARSAT-1/2 ScanSAR Wide Swath, ASAR Wide Swath, and Landsat acquisitions were analyzed. Results show that melt onset occurred earlier for all observed lakes. With the exception of Lower Murray Lake, all lakes experienced earlier summer ice minimum and water-clear-of-ice (WCI) dates, with greater changes being observed for polar-oasis lakes (9-24 days earlier WCI dates for lakes located in polar oases and 2-20 days earlier WCI dates for polar-desert lakes). Additionally, results suggest that some lakes may be transitioning from a perennial/multiyear to a seasonal ice regime, with only a few lakes maintaining a multiyear ice cover on occasional years. Aside Lake Hazen and Murray Lakes, which preserved their ice cover during the summer of 2009, no residual ice was observed on any of the other lakes from 2007 to 2011.

AB  - The importance of capturing wild animals for research and conservation projects is widely shared. As this activity continues to become more common, the need to assess its negative effects increases so as to ensure ethical standards and the validity of research results. Increasing evidence has revealed that indirect (physiological and behavioural) effects of capture are as important as direct risks (death or injury) and that different capture methodologies can cause heterogeneous effects. We investigated the influence of chemical immobilisation on Alpine ibex (Capra ibex): during the days following the capture we collected data on spatial behaviour, activity levels of both males and females, and male hormone levels. Moreover, we recorded the reproductive status of each marked female during the breeding seasons of 15 years. Then, by several a priori models we investigated the effects of the capture taking into account biological factors and changes in environmental conditions. Our results showed that chemical immobilisation did not affect either spatial behaviour (for both males and females) or male hormone levels, though both sexes showed reduced activity levels up to two days after the capture. The capture did not significantly affect the likelihood for a female to give birth in the following summer. Our findings highlighted the scarce impact of chemical immobilisation on ibex biology, as we detected alteration of activity levels only immediately after the capture if compared to the following days (i.e., baseline situation). Hence, the comparison of our findings with previous research showed that our methodology is one of the less invasive procedures to capture large mammals. Nonetheless, in areas characterised by high predator density, we suggest that animals released be carefully monitored for some hours after the capture. Moreover, researchers should avoid considering data collected during the first days after the manipulation in order to avoid biased information.

AB  - Body size is a life history trait that determines the reproductive success of a variety of organisms. Changes in body size may have a genetic component when persistent conditions such as season length and climate select for individuals of an optimal body size and an environmental component when it is influenced on an ecological scale by factors such as weather, food availability, or maternal effects. Along elevational gradients that experience seasonality, insects commonly become smaller with increases in elevation. In this study we test the hypothesis that dispersal potential, an indicator of gene flow, impacts the type of size clines exhibited by insects along elevational gradients and that these differences in local adaptation should lead to predictable changes in their reproductive potential and output. Using two short winged grasshopper species, Aeropedellus clavatus and Melanoplus boulderensis, and two long winged species, Camnula pellucida and Melanoplus sanguinipes, we showed that species with low dispersal potential are associated with significant declines in body size with increases in elevation while species with high dispersal potential displayed no size clines. Consistent with short winged species being more locally adapted, we show that reproductive potential, as measured by the proportion of ovarioles that become functional, do not differ among populations of short winged species, but decline with elevation in the long winged species. While our study failed to show that dispersal potential impacts reproductive output in a consistent and predictable manner (as measured by clutch and egg sizes), we address the possibility that clutch size may not reflect changes in total reproductive output and that changes in egg size may be a plastic trait. We concluded that studies exploring the evolution of body size, the reproductive capacity and species level responses to environmental change should note the importance of dispersal potential in influencing these patterns.

AB  - Rapid and invasive urbanization has been associated with depletion of natural resources (vegetation and water resources), which in turn deteriorates the landscape structure and conditions in the local environment. Rapid increase in population due to the migration from rural areas is one of the critical issues of the urban growth. Urbanisation in India is drastically changing the land cover and often resulting in the sprawl. The sprawl regions often lack basic amenities such as treated water supply, sanitation, etc. This necessitates regular monitoring and understanding of the rate of urban development in order to ensure the sustenance of natural resources. Urban sprawl is the extent of urbanization which leads to the development of urban forms with the destruction of ecology and natural landforms. The rate of change of land use and extent of urban sprawl can be efficiently visualized and modelled with the help of geo-informatics. The knowledge of urban area, especially the growth magnitude, shape geometry, and spatial pattern is essential to understand the growth and characteristics of urbanization process. Urban pattern, shape and growth can be quantified using spatial metrics. This communication quantifies the urbanisation and associated growth pattern in Delhi. Spatial data of four decades were analysed to understand land over and land use dynamics. Further the region was divided into 4 zones and into circles of 1 km incrementing radius to understand and quantify the local spatial changes. Results of the landscape metrics indicate that the urban center was highly aggregated and the outskirts and the buffer regions were in the verge of aggregating urban patches. Shannon's Entropy index clearly depicted the outgrowth of sprawl areas in different zones of Delhi. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Water and nitrogen surpluses are major concern for the new intensive olive groves in South of Portugal. In this study, field measurements were integrated with a system model, Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2) to assess the sustainability and environmental impact of fertigation in an intensive olive grove (Olea europaea L. var. Arbeguina). The model provided acceptable predictions of evapotranspiration, soil moisture and nitrate contents. Based on model simulations, under current fertigation practices, 57% of the irrigation applied was lost via drainage, while 71% and 5% of fertilizer N inputs were lost through leaching and denitrification, respectively. The non-fertilizer N input from soil organic matter (OM) satisfied 64% of the crop N needs. The tested model was used to predict the impacts of a full irrigation (FIFC) and two regulated deficit irrigation schemes (RDI75, RDI50) on drainage and N leaching. In FIFC the atmospheric demand was met while the application frequency maintained the water storage below the soil field capacity. In RDI75 and RDI50 the irrigation application amount between stone hardening and onset of ripening was 75 and 50% of FIFC respectively.
   Compared with the current practice, the FIFC decreased drainage and N leaching by 47% and 90% respectively, while maintaining the actual evapotranspiration (ETa). The RDI75 seems to be the most adequate for the studied agro-system since, in relation to the FIFC, it saved 13% of irrigation water with only 5% decrease in ETa. Furthermore, the 15% reduction in leaching, together with the 19% increase in soil OM mineralization optimized the trees N uptake. The study of three different N application rates for each irrigation scenario indicated that, to minimize residual storage, N should be applied according to plant needs, by using a real-time indicator based upon foliar analysis or the chlorophyll meter measurements.

AB  - The sediments of Bed II at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, have received less scientific scrutiny than Bed I strata, likely due to the lower density of fossil hominins in the younger layers. Nevertheless, Bed II provides important contextual information about changes over time in early hominin environments. Mammal fossils from Bed II are separated into older and younger faunas by a regional disconformity under which lies an aeolian tuff, the Lemuta Member, dated to similar to 1.74 Ma (millions of years ago). Differences between the faunal communities above and below the Lemuta Member have been previously noted and interpreted as evidence for distinct environmental change. Here, we investigate the palaeoecological conditions that characterised the transition between older and younger Bed II sites via analysis of their mammalian community ecological niche exploitation profiles, comparing these to known modern habitats. We present a comprehensive species list for both Bed II faunas. An initial correspondence analysis points to palaeoecological differences in pre- and post-Lemuta Member assemblages, although neither is representative of a forest habitat. When taphonomic differences in body mass profiles are taken into account, however, ecological differences appear far less important. Based on a resampling procedure to generate modern locality data with body mass profiles similar to the Bed II faunas, discriminant correspondence analyses liken both fossil assemblages to modern woodland habitats, with Lower Bed II having some affinity to floodplain and marshy woodlands, likely related to the presence of the Olduvai palaeolake in this stratigraphic interval. A comparison of the Bed II faunas to each other suggests that their differences could reasonably be sampled from within a single modern habitat. Although additional evidence points to an increase in aridity subsequent to the Lemuta Member, the importance of woodland habitats throughout Bed II is clear.

AB  - Long-term data are critically important to science, management, and policy formation. Here we describe a number of data collections from arctic Canada that monitor vertebrate population trends of freshwater and marine fish, marine birds, marine and terrestrial mammals. These time series data cover the last ca. 30 years and capture a period from the onset of global changes affecting the Arctic up to recent years with a rapid increase in temperature. While many of these data collections were initiated through a variety of government and university programs, they also include a surge in polar research launched with the recent International Polar Year (2007-2008). We estimated the long-term vertebrate index from our data that summarizes various taxa abundance trends within a global context and observed a continuous decline of about 30 % in population abundance since the 1990s. Though most data collections are biased towards few taxa, we conduct time-series analyses to show that the potential value of long-term data emerges as individual monitoring sites can be spread across space and time scales. Despite covering a handful of populations, the different time series data covered a large spectrum of dynamics, cyclic to non-cyclic, including coherence with the North Atlantic Oscillation, lag effects, and density dependence. We describe a synthesis framework to integrate ecological time-series research and thereby derive additional benefits to management, science, and policy. Future requirements include: (1) continuation of current observation systems; (2) expansion of current monitoring sites to include additional trophic links and taxonomic indicators; (3) expansion beyond the existing program to include greater spatial coverage into less-sampled ecosystems and key representative locations; and (4) integration of circumpolar observations and comprehensive analyses. Development of a circumpolar observation system is necessary for innovative science, large-scale adaptive management, and policy revision essential to respond to rapid global change.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to investigate the short-term effects of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) on juvenile sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.) using a multiparameter approach. At the end of the 96 h of exposure to a range of BaP concentrations (2-256 mu g l(-1)) in laboratorial conditions, a suite of biomarkers involved in biotransformation pathways, oxidative stress and damage, neurotransmission and energetic metabolism were analysed. Levels of BaP metabolites in bile and BaP-type compounds in tissues were also included as biomarkers of exposure, and the post-exposure swimming velocity was used as a toxicity endpoint at a higher level of biological organisation. In addition, a time-series experiment on the levels of bile BaP metabolites was also performed. Increased levels of BaP metabolites in bile and BaP-type compounds in liver and brain of exposed fish were found, indicating BaP uptake, metabolisation and distribution by different tissues. BaP induced oxidative stress and damage, but no significant effects on the post-exposure swimming velocity, neurotransmission and energetic pathways were found. An increase in the levels of BaP metabolites in bile over time was also observed, reaching a threshold similar at all the concentrations tested. Overall, this integrative multiparameter study reflecting different biological responses of D. labrax was suitable to assess the effects caused by the short-term exposure to BaP and may be useful in the marine environmental risk assessment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pollution. The observed toxic effects also highlight the relevance of short-term exposure to relatively high concentrations of chemicals, as can occur in the case of punctual heavy chemical releases, such as oil spills in the marine environment.

AB  - In 2001, 28 acres of the bottom of Ward Cove, AK (USA) were remediated using thin layer placement, to enhance the natural recovery of contaminated sediments. The remediated areas were part of an 80-acre area of concern identified offshore from the site of a former sulfite pulp mill. The primary chemicals of concern were those commonly associated with organic enrichment near pulp mills: ammonia and 4-methylphenol. The primary remedial objectives were to reduce the toxicity of the contaminated sediments and to stimulate colonization of the remediated areas by benthic macroinvertebrates. In 2004, the initial monitoring event for the remediated areas was conducted, and included evaluations of physical/chemical sediment variables (i.e., total organic carbon, grain size distribution, ammonia, and 4-methylphenol), sediment toxicity (i.e., using the 10-day amphipod survival test with Eohaustorius estuarius), and in situ benthic macroinvertebrate communities. Results of the monitoring event showed that conditions in the remediated areas had improved considerably in the 3 years since thin layer placement had occurred. At most stations, concentrations of both ammonia and 4-methylphenol were very low, and amphipod survival was a parts per thousand yen90%. In addition, benthic macroinvertebrates appeared to be rapidly colonizing the remediated areas, based on evaluations of several community metrics (i.e., taxa richness, diversity, and dominance), as well as key indicator species of organic enrichment and associated transitional areas (i.e., primarily the polychaetes Capitella capitata and Nephtys cornuta, and the bivalve molluscs Axinopsida serricata and Parvilucina tenuisculpta). In general, colonization was consistent with the patterns identified for areas recovering from organic enrichment on the continental shelf of southern California and elsewhere. Based on these results, thin layer placement was considered successful in enhancing the natural recovery of the remediated sediments in Ward Cove.

Major differences in well-being among territorial units at subnational level impede the progress of society and may cause economic, social, urban, environmental and political problems. Acknowledging of regional differences in well-being is of key importance for efficient planning and implementation of regional and spatial policy measures. The principal objective of these policies is balanced regional development proven by diminishing differences in economic development and well-being. The paper deals with the measurement of geographical differences of well-being in Slovenia using composite indicators based on principal components. Municipalities were selected as basic units, since presently municipality is the only type of subnational government in Slovenia. They represent the level of government closest to people that provides local public services to community. Well-being was defined by 49 quantitative social, economic, demographic and environmental indicators. The indicators were selected on the basis of relevance for well-being and data availability at the municipality level. In order to verify the validity of the measurement of well being using composite indicators and to enhance the interpretability and usability of the results, several approaches based on multivariate analysis were applied. All approaches clearly show substantial differences in the level of wellbeing of municipalities with prevailing higher level in the Western and lower level in the Eastern part of Slovenia. Besides that, cluster analysis has revealed dual nature of the top well-being group of municipalities. On one side, there is a subgroup of a socially most developed urban centres. On the other side, well-being of the second subgroup of municipalities is characterized by high standards of living and pleasant environmental conditions, although being a step behind on the economic and social scale.

AB  - Mangroves have been observed to possess a tolerance to high levels of heavy metals, yet accumulated metals may induce subcellular biochemical changes, which can impact on processes at the organism level. Six month-old seedlings of the grey mangrove, Avicennia mar ina (Forsk,) Vierh, were exposed to a range of Cu (0-800 mug/g), Pb (0-800 mug/g) and Zn (0-1000 mug/g) concentrations in sediments under laboratory conditions, to determine leaf tissue metal accumulation patterns, effects on photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoids), and the activity of the antioxidant enzyme peroxidase, Limited Cu uptake to leaves was observed at low sediment Cu levels, with saturation and visible toxicity to Cu at sediment levels greater than 400 mug/g. Leaf Pb concentrations remained low over a range of Pb sediment concentrations, up to 400 mug/g Pb, above which it appeared that unrestricted transport of Pb occurred, although no visible signs of Pb toxicity were observed. Zn was accumulated linearly with sediment zinc concentration, and visible toxicity occurring at the highest concentration, 1000 mug/g Zn, Significant increases in peroxidase activity and decreases in photopigments were found with Cu and Zn at concentrations lower than those inducing visible toxicity. Significant increases in peroxidase activity only, were found when plants were exposed to Pb, Positive linear relationships between peroxidase activity and leaf tissue metal concentrations were found for all metals. Significant linear decreases in photosynthetic pigments with increasing leaf tissue metal concentrations were observed with Cu and Zn only. Photosynthetic pigments and peroxidase activity may be applicable as sensitive biological indicators of Cu and Zn stress, and peroxidase activity for Pb stress in A, marina.

AB  - 1. Replacement of artificial riffles in canalized rivers is a widely-used tool in river rehabilitation but its effectiveness is only infrequently evaluated. In this paper artificial riffles, placed in a 2-km length of lowland stream in eastern England, were evaluated using geomorphological, functional habitat, and ecological techniques 3 years after installation.
   2. Mean riffle spacing was approximately double that predicted from first principles, due to several large 'gaps' in the 2-km length where riffles had not been originally reconstructed. Two sequences, of 14 riffles, did approximate to the spacing predicted for natural riffles based upon the relationship with mean annual discharge and with bankfull width. Twenty out of 26 riffles retained their original physical character whilst six were deep, slow flowing and covered with sand or silt.
   3. Shallow riffles in an approximately correct spacing retained their coarse particle dominance and caused the scouring between themselves of deeper pools than were found elsewhere in the stretch. Shallow riffles had high flow velocities which resulted in richness of functional habitats not found elsewhere in the stretch.
   4. Invertebrate colonization showed a clear distinction between communities of shallow, fast-flowing riffles and deeper slow-flowing runs and silted riffles. Indicator taxa of riffles were the genera Baetis, Simulium, Hydropsyche, Eukieferiella, and Rheotanytarsus. Indicator genera of silted riffles and runs were Caenis, Planorbis, Sphaerium, Microtendipes, and Stichtochironomus.
   5. Riffle reinstatement in lowland rivers of low energy will produce desirable geomorphological and ecological changes if the riffles are spaced according to geomorphological 'first principles', and are shallow (< 30 cm depth) under low-flow conditions: thus, simple science can set adequate goals at the design stage. Appraisal using the development of functional habitats at riffle sites provides a rapid technique for post-project appraisal, thus evaluating by ecological success the original hydrological goals.

AB  - Economies that depend on natural resources can experience a resource drag effect when economic growth is limited by constraints on the availability of those resources. Therefore, this study uses panel data and the improved Solow growth model to explore the resource drag effect on China's regional economic growth from 1987 to 2017 and makes innovative contributions to address these four gaps in the previous literature: the resources gap, the consistent measurement gap, the regional gap, and the temporal gap. The empirical results indicate that the resource drag effect reduced China's overall annual economic growth by 0.58% during the study period, with reductions of 1.07%, 0.29%, 0.79%, and 0.46% in the Eastern, Western, Central, and Northeastern regions, respectively. In the meantime, the resources drag effect changed in individual regions and across regions. The results on energy drag are most notable. Policies such as "West-to-East Electricity Transmission" and "West-to-East Gas Transmission" promoted economic growth of the Eastern and Western Region, facilitating continued growth in both regions and attracted the return of labor to the Western region. The results indicate that the policies such as west-to-east energy transfer for helping to even out the economic growth conditions in different regions. Labor force mobility has also been important to alleviate resource dependence of agricultural production in Central regain, while other regions have managed to continually grow through improvements in inefficiency. Also, growth in some regions/provinces continues to depend upon increases in water, land, and energy availability and export. This will become increasingly problematic as the social prices of these inputs rise to account for environmental damage. Therefore, the government should adjust the industrial structure of each region to optimize use of resource endowments, alleviate dependence on natural resources, and achieve sustainable economic development.

AB  - Discussions on the evolutionary process and mechanism of social-ecological landscape resilience play an important role in maintaining the sustainable provision of landscape services. However, studies on the evolutionary process and mechanism of social-ecological landscapes at the microscale have received relatively little attention. The purpose of this research is to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution of social-ecological landscape resilience at the micro-level in Gaoqu Township in Mizhi County, China. A three-dimensional (ecosystem, social system, and production system) indicator was constructed to quantitatively evaluate the social-ecological landscape resilience. The results showed that (1) the spatio-temporal variation in the three subsystems' resilience was extensive from 2012 to 2018. The ecosystem resilience was distributed in the northeast-southwest direction, which was consistent with the distribution of gullies. The social system resilience was spatially high in the northwest and low in the southeast. The production system resilience was low in the middle and high in the peripheral regions. The resilience values of the ecosystem, social system and production system increased by 0.127, 0.122 and 0.101, respectively. (2) The spatio-temporal differentiation of the social-ecological landscape resilience was also significant, and its resilience value increased by 11.44%, which showed a spatial pattern with a low center and high surroundings. (3) Finally, based on the status and trend of the social-ecological landscape resilience, 20 villages in the region can be divided into predominantly advancing areas, predominantly stable areas, predominantly attenuation areas, emerging advancing areas, and sensitive-vulnerable areas. This study can provide the spatial guidance for differentiated sustainable development in the Loess hill and gully region based on the local conditions of the socialecological landscapes.

AB  - The process of identifying tangible actions to conserve important resources in the face of climate change is challenged because of uncertainties regarding future conditions. There is also a lack of existing methods for evaluating the effectiveness of proposed management actions for mitigating negative impacts. For pinon-juniper (PJ) ecosystems within the Southwest U.S., efforts are further hampered by a lack of information on the direction and drivers of changing population trends. PJ ecosystems, while ecologically important, have been the focus of eradication efforts due to perceptions that they are encroaching into important grasslands. However, recent impacts of drought, insect outbreaks, and fire increasingly threaten these ecosystems. It is unclear at this time where and to what extent PJ ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change and other disturbances, challenging management. To develop a method for determining the current and future status of PJ ecosystems, we engaged with local land managers to identify key indicators and drivers of PJ population change and developed a vulnerability assessment approach based on these indicators. Our goal was to use this process to create data products that would assist resource managers dealing with rapidly changing landscapes. Borrowing from other successful assessments strategies, we used Adaptation Forums to facilitate stakeholder input to vet potentially relevant indicators of PJ status and response to climate change and other stressors. Through multiple iterations, we finalized a list of indicators that could be used to quantify vulnerability of PJ ecosystems. We then developed a vulnerability assessment framework that can systematically quantify risks to PJ based on these indicators and applied this framework to two landscapes in the southwestern U.S. This process allows us to support decision making processes by generating information on future PJ status even when data are incomplete.

AB  - The presence of marine pollution in Cartagena Bay (Colombia) is an alarming environmental issue because of the ecotoxicological properties of contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that may affect the biodiversity of coastal ecosystems. In this sense, there is a need to propose alternatives to remediate the environmental pollution of such bodies of water. The aim of this work was to design an adsorption-based treatment process for the removal of PAHs from seawater and sediments. Two design cases were considered: (i) a base process without a PAH desorption unit and (ii) an alternative process including a PAH desorption unit. Both designs were simulated using Aspen Plus to obtain mass and energy balances. A parametric sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine optimum operating conditions for solvent recovery and treatment efficiency. The pressure and temperature of evaporators were selected as key parameters, as well as PAH loads in the influent. The environmental performance of base and alternative designs was also evaluated via waste reduction algorithm (WAR) methodology. A maximum recovered solvent flow rate was found when the evaporator operates at 56 degrees C and 0.81-0.83 atm. In addition, the total generation rate of potential environmental impacts (PEI) reported negative values for cases 1, 3, and 4 (-9.80 x 10(-1), -9.25 x 10(+1), -1.19 x 10(+1), and 1.04 x 10(+1) PEI/h). The major concern derived from this analysis is the high environmental impacts reached by the photochemical oxidation potential (PCOP) category associated with the use of hexane and acetone as solvents during PAH removal from sediments. In general, both designs of seawater and sediment treatment seem to be an environmentally friendly alternative for marine pollution remediation.

AB  - The pre-treatment and pelletisation of oil palm empty fruit bunches (OPEFB) can potentially improve its biofuel properties for efficient thermal energy recovery. Therefore, this paper examines the physicochemical, thermal, kinetic, and thermodynamic properties of OPEFB pellets as a potential feedstock for pyrolysis. Physicochemical analysis revealed high proportions of carbon, volatiles, and fixed carbon compared to nitrogen and sulphur. Morphological analysis showed that the pellet microstructure is comprised of a dense network of polymeric fibres, whereas its ash has consistently shaped agglomerated particles with fine-textured surfaces. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed the OPEFB pellets experienced significant mass loss (M-L = 72.8-80.4%) and residual mass (R-M = 19.6-27.2%) during thermal decomposition from 30 to 800 degrees C. The DTG plots revealed thermal decomposition occurred in three stages: I (30-150 degrees C), II (150-600 degrees C), and III (600-800 degrees C) due to drying, devolatilization, and char degradation, respectively. Kinetic analysis showed the activation energy,E-a, ranged from 76.87 to 195.78 kJ/mol, while frequency factor,A, was from 4.77 x 10(01)to 1.22 x 10(18) min(-1)for the Flynn-Wall Ozawa and Kissinger-Akahira Sunose models. The highest kinetic parameters were observed at alpha = 0.40, indicating the rate-determining step for OPEFB pellets decomposition under pyrolysis condition occurs at 40% conversion. Thermodynamic analysis showed that thermal decomposition of OPEFB pellets was characterised by the formation of an activated complex, high reactive multiphase first-order reactions, and short reaction times. In conclusion, the results indicate that OPEFB pellets is a potentially suitable feedstock for pyrolysis owing to its excellent fuel properties and environmentally friendly nature.

AB  - Fisheries are constrained by ecosystem productivity and management effectiveness. Climate change is already producing impacts on marine ecosystems through overall changes in habitats, productivity and increased variability of environmental conditions. The way how these will affect fisheries is under debate and, also there is uncertainty on the best course of action to mitigate climate change impacts on fisheries. Harvest control rules are sets of pre-agreed rules that can be used to determine catch limits periodically and describe how harvest is automatically controlled by management in relation to the state of some indicator of stock status. In 2017, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas adopted a harvest control rule for North Atlantic albacore. This harvest control rule was evaluated using Management Strategy Evaluation against the main sources of uncertainty inherent to this fishery. Here, we used the same framework to evaluate the robustness of the adopted rule against two types of potential climate change impacts on North Atlantic albacore dynamics. First, we evaluated how the control rule would perform in the event of overall changes in productivity in the North Atlantic and second, against increases in climate driven recruitment variability. Overall, our results suggest that the adopted harvest control rule is robust to these climate driven impacts and also suggests bounds at which the current management framework would be vulnerable to climate change. Throughout the manuscript we also discuss the potential of harvest control rules and harvest strategies to adapt fisheries management to a changing environment. Our main conclusion is that despite the many uncertainties on climate impacts on fisheries, efficient fisheries management and HCRs will be critical to ensure the sustainability of fisheries in the future.

AB  - Introduction: Mental health in indigenous communities is a relevant issue for the World Health Organization (WHO). These communities are supposed to live in a pure, clean and intact environment. Their real condition is far different from the imaginary; they are vulnerable populations living in difficult areas, exposed to pollution, located far from the health services, exposed to several market operations conducted to extract natural resources, facing criminal groups or illegal exploitation of land resources. These factors may have an impact on mental health of indigenous population.
   Methods: We reviewed all papers available on PubMed, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library until December 2018. We focused on those factors affecting the changes from a traditional to a post-modern society and reviewed data available on stress-related issues, mental distress affecting indigenous/aboriginal communities and the role of Traditional Medicine (TM). We reviewed articles from different countries hosting indigenous communities.
   Results: The incidence of mental distress and related phenomena (e.g. collective suicide, alcoholism and violence) among indigenous populations is affected by political and socio-economic variables. The mental health of these populations is poorly studied and described even if mental illness indicators are somewhat alarming. TM still seems to have a role in supporting affected people and may reduce deficiencies due to poor access to medical insurance/coverage, psychiatry and psychotherapy. It would be helpful to combine TM and modern medicine in a healthcare model to face indigenous populations' health needs.
   Conclusion: This review confirms the impact of societal changes, environmental threats and exploitation of natural resources on the mental health of indigenous populations. Global Mental Health needs to deal with the health needs of indigenous populations as well as psychiatry needs to develop new categories to describe psychopathology related to social variance as recently proposed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5).

AB  - Purpose Summer pasture development and tourism near and around Lake Son-Kul in the western Tian Shan Mountains has resulted in a local source of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) that lack monitoring and evaluation.
   Materials and methods Twenty-eight soil samples were collected from the Lake Son-Kul Basin (SKB) and Naryn River Valley (NRV) to measure OCP concentrations and evaluate their composition, transport processes, and ecological risks.
   Results and discussion Except for the high OCP concentration measured at one location, site 7 (145.32ng/g dw), total OCP concentrations in the SKB ranged from 2.36 to 24.13ng/g dw, slightly higher than concentrations in the NRV (1.69-7.45ng/g dw) and similar to values in polar regions. Among the OCPs, HCHs and methoxychlor were the predominant compounds that accumulated in soils, followed by DDTs and Aldrins, whereas Chlors and Endos displayed lowest concentrations, indicating that animal husbandry is the main agricultural activity in the study area. Most of the less volatile pesticides, including -HCH, p,p-DDT, and Chlors, represent past use from local sources, for instance the pesticides warehouse at site 7. More volatile compounds such as -HCH, -HCH, and p'p-DDE represent exogenous atmospheric transport to the study area, as demonstrated by their isomeric ratios. Ecological risk assessment showed that the surface environment of the study area remains in good condition.
   Conclusions Findings from this study provided a snapshot of the current status of OCP contamination in soils of the Lake Son-Kul region. Although historical OCP contamination has impacted the lake's ecology, catchment soils display low levels of OCP contamination.

AB  - Environmental contextMetabolomics can be used to provide a snapshot of an organism's physiology as the organism is exposed to varying environmental conditions. In this study, laboratory-reared amphibians were exposed to multiple pesticides, analogous to field exposures, resulting in an impact to both pesticide body concentrations and the amphibians' hepatic metabolome. These data can be used in the environmental and ecological risk assessment of multiple pesticides in non-target species. AbstractPesticide mixtures are frequently co-applied throughout an agricultural growing season to maximise crop yield. Therefore, non-target ecological species (e.g. amphibians) may be exposed to several pesticides at any given time on these agricultural landscapes. The objectives of this study were to quantify body burdens in terrestrial phase amphibians and translate perturbed metabolites to their corresponding biochemical pathways affected by exposure to pesticides as both singlets and in combination. Southern leopard frogs (Lithobates sphenocephala) were exposed either at the maximum or 1/10th maximum application rate to single, double or triple pesticide mixtures of bifenthrin (insecticide), metolachlor (herbicide) and triadimefon (fungicide). Tissue concentrations demonstrated both facilitated and competitive uptake of pesticides when in mixtures. Metabolomic profiling of amphibian livers identified metabolites of interest for both application rates; however, the magnitude of changes varied for the two exposure rates. Exposure to lower concentrations demonstrated downregulation in amino acids, potentially owing to their usage for glutathione metabolism and/or increased energy demands. Amphibians exposed to the maximum application rate resulted in upregulation of amino acids and other key metabolites likely owing to depleted energy resources. Coupling endogenous and exogenous biomarkers of pesticide exposure can be used to form vital links in an ecological risk assessment by relating internal dose to pathophysiological outcomes in non-target species.

AB  - Research background: Social and economic development involves a broad spectrum of social, economic and spatial phenomena. The multi-faceted nature of regional development arises directly from the fact that it is shaped by multiple factors. Current discourse emphasises the role of endogenous factors, which indicate the specific nature and the distinctive features of the given territory. Mobilising the endogenous potential ensures stable regional development dynamics. At the moment, one of the fundamental economic problems are the increasing differences in the development of specific regions.
   Purpose of the article: The purpose of this study is to assess the differentiation of the social and economic level development of Polish Voivodeships, applying the selected assessment methods for the years 2010 and 2015, draw up a rank list of regional units according to their development levels, and identify the groups of Voivodeships sharing similar development levels. The indicators used in this study, characterising the level of the social and economic development, have been systematised according to the following areas: demographics and labour market, regional entrepreneurship, local economy structure, innovation and research & development activities, technical infrastructure, social infrastructure, and the condition and protection of the natural environment.
   Methods: The level of the social and economic development of Polish Voivodeships was assessed using Zdzislaw Hellwig's development pattern method, which made it possible to rank them according to the level of development of Polish Voivodeship. The methodology is supplemented by Ward's agglomerative clustering method, which made it possible to distinguish other Voivodeships according to the analysed phenomenon. The Voivodeship clustering method used Jenks' natural breaks classification method.
   Findings & Value added: Pursuing the research aims. the authors focused in particular on clear spatial differences. Through the analysis ere able to identify the changes in the social and economic development processes of the Polish regions. The Voivodeships were divided into groups according to their development level: the highest, high, low and the lowest.

AB  - Assessment of ecological losses caused by surface water contamination forms the basis for establishing the environmental benefit of wastewater treatment. This benefit is defined as the amount of losses avoided in the aquatic environment due to treatment of the discharged wastewater. Estimation of these losses is quite complex and requires prior determination of unit loss indexes. To this end, an analysis of the three methods for estimating the index value of the unit loss caused by surface water pollution was conducted, i.e. the index method, the contingent valuation method and the shadow price method. As a result, the advantages and disadvantages of each method were determined as well as their applicability under local Polish conditions was assessed. Based on literature data, the index method makes it possible to estimate the nationwide index of unit losses caused by surface water pollution. The contingent valuation method, on the other hand, allows estimation of the index value for a single municipality on the basis of interview surveys. Finally, the shadow price method facilitates determination of the unit environmental benefit, the value of which corresponds to the index of the unit loss avoided in the aquatic environment in consequence of wastewater treatment. For the latter, the structure of impact on environmental benefits of particular pollutant groups from the wastewater (nitrogen, phosphorus, suspended solids, organic compounds) was determined. The removal of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds was demonstrated to have the greatest effect. The comparison of methods for estimating the index values of unit losses due to water pollution demonstrated the shadow price method to have the highest potential in terms of its accuracy and capacity to estimate size and structure of the unit loss index for a single wastewater treatment plant.

AB  - There is considerable controversy around the patterns and processes that influence spatial variation in taxonomic composition in mountain environments. We analysed elevational variation in the taxonomic composition of epigaeic spider assemblages across five mountains in north-western Patagonia (Argentina) to examine the relative importance of dispersal (distance) limitation and environmental heterogeneity on a regional scale. The distance limitation hypothesis predicts greater taxonomic similarity between sampling sites separated by short geographical distances than between mountain peaks separated by longer distances, a lack of indicator species of macro-habitats, and weak associations between spider species composition and environmental gradients. Alternatively, the environmental heterogeneity hypothesis predicts that taxonomic differentiation will occur over short distances along elevation gradients in association with the turnover in major habitats and change in environmental conditions, and that indicator species will be present. We collected spiders using 486 pitfall traps arranged in fifty-four 100-m(2) grid plots of nine traps separated by 100 m of elevation, from the base to the summit of each mountain. Multivariate analyses identified spider assemblages that were associated with macro-habitats rather than with mountains. Local environmental variation (mainly in vegetation cover), precipitation and soil characteristics influenced the spatial variation in species composition. Characteristic indicator species showed high specificity and fidelity to macro-habitats, whereas vulnerable species showed high specificity and low fidelity to mountains or macro-habitats. We conclude that, on a regional scale, species adaptation to environmental gradients plays a more important role than dispersal limitation in structuring the taxonomic composition of spider assemblages. Moreover, the presence of indicator species suggests that spiders have a great potential as ecological indicators for evaluating the response of montane biodiversity to future climatic change.

AB  - An environmental risk assessment (ERA) framework was recently developed for consumer product chemicals in China using a tiered approach, applying an existing Chinese regulatory qualitative method in Tier Zero and, then, utilizing deterministic and probabilistic methods for Tiers One and Two. The exposure assessment methodology in the framework applied conditions specific to China including physical setting, infrastructure, and consumers' habits and practices. Furthermore, two scenarios were identified for quantitatively assessing environmental exposure: (1) Urban with wastewater treatment, and; (2) Rural without wastewater treatment (i.e., direct-discharge of wastewater). Upon a brief discussion on the framework methodology, this paper primarily presented a case study conducted using this new approach for assessing two fragrance chemicals, the polycyclic musks HHCB (Galaxolide, 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta-[gamma]-2-benzopyran) and AHTN (Tonalide, 7-acetyl1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene). Both HHCB and AHTN are widely used as fragrances in a variety of consumer products in China, and occurrences of both compounds have been reported in wastewater influents, effluents, and sludge, in addition to surface water and sediments across several major metropolitan regions throughout China. This case study illustrated the very conservative nature of Tier Zero, which indicated a high risk potential of the fragrances to receiving water aquatic communities due to the fragrance's non-ready biodegradability and eco-toxicity profiles. However, the higher-tiered assessments (including deterministic and site-specific probabilistic) demonstrated greater environmental realism with the conclusion of HHCB and AHTN posing minimal risk, consistent with local monitoring data as well as a recent similar study conducted in the United States.

AB  - Transport of fine-grained sediment from unpaved forest roads into streams is a concern due to the potential negative effects of additional suspended sediment on aquatic ecosystems. Here we compared turbidity and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) dynamics in five nonfish bearing coastal Oregon streams above and below road crossings, during three consecutive time periods (before, after road construction/improvement, and after forest harvest and hauling). We hypothesized that the combined effects of road construction/improvement and the hauling following forest harvest would increase turbidity and SSC in these streams. We tested whether the differences between paired samples from above and below road crossing exceeded various biological thresholds, using literature values of biological responses to increases in SSC and turbidity. Overall, we found minimal increases of both turbidity and SSC after road improvement, forest harvest, and hauling. Because flow is often used as a surrogate for turbidity or SSC we examined these relationships using data from locations above road crossings that were unaffected by roads or forest harvest and hauling. In addition, we examined the association between turbidity and SSC for these background locations. We found a positive, but in some cases weak association between flow and turbidity, and between flow and SSC; the relationship between turbidity and SSC was more robust, but also inconsistent among sites over time. In these low order streams, the concentrations and transport of suspended sediment seems to be highly influenced by the variability of local conditions. Our study provides an expanded understanding of current forest road management practice effects on fine-grained sediment in streams and introduces alternative metrics using multiple thresholds to evaluate potential indicators of biological relevance.

AB  - Darwin Harbour in northern Australia is an estuary in the wet-dry tropics subject to increasing urbanization with localized water quality degradation due to increased nutrient loads from urban runoff and treated sewage effluent. Tropical estuaries are poorly studied compared to temperate systems and little is known about the microbial community-level response to nutrients. We aimed to examine the spatial and temporal patterns of the bacterial community and its association with abiotic factors. Since Darwin Harbour is macrotidal with strong seasonal patterns and mixing, we sought to determine if a human impact signal was discernible in the microbiota despite the strong hydrodynamic forces. Adopting a single impact-double reference design, we investigated the bacterial community using next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene from water and sediment from reference creeks and creeks affected by effluent and urban runoff. Samples were collected over two years during neap and spring tides, in the dry and wet seasons. Temporal drivers, namely seasons and tides had the strongest relationship to the water microbiota, reflecting the macrotidal nature of the estuary and its location in the wet-dry tropics. The neap-tide water microbiota provided the clearest spatial resolution while the sediment microbiota reflected current and past water conditions. Differences in patterns of the microbiota between different parts of the harbor reflected the harbor's complex hydrodynamics and bathymetry. Despite these variations, a microbial signature was discernible relating to specific effluent sources and urban runoff, and the composite of nutrient levels accounted for the major part of the explained variation in the microbiota followed by salinity. Our results confirm an overall good water quality but they also reflect the extent of some hypereutrophic areas. Our results show that the microbiota is a sensitive indicator to assess ecosystem health even in this dynamic and complex ecosystem.

AB  - Long- and short-term climate variations in the North Atlantic have been of sufficient magnitude to leave a discernible mark on the history of vegetation and landscape stability in Iceland during the Holocene. A reconstruction of early- and mid-Holocene vegetation around Lake Kagaoarholl, Northwest Iceland, examines how climate fluctuations have affected the terrestrial ecosystem. A thorough reconstruction has been made using pollen and plant macrofossil analyses combined with proxies for organic and inorganic matter. The record shows the development from a period of pioneer vegetation towards a woodland ecosystem. The deposition of the Saksunarvatn tephra at c. 10,300 cal. yr BP caused a 100-year period of instability, followed by a gradual trend of stabilization over several centuries while material left behind by retreating glaciers and tephra was being contained by expanding and developing vegetation. Early-Holocene warmth is indicated by high pollen production of Juniperus communis around the lake by c. 10,100 cal. yr BP and birch woodland being established around the lake by c. 9200 cal. yr BP, much earlier than previously believed for this locale. Cooling climate between c. 8700 and 8200 cal. yr BP halted woodland development, with reduced plant reproduction likely caused by cold spring and summer temperatures. Woodlands became re-established from c. 7900 cal. yr BP before entering a decline from c. 6000 cal. yr BP, with harsher environmental conditions apparent after c. 4200 cal. yr BP. The Kagaoarholl record compares favourably with other palaeoclimatic data from the North Atlantic, demonstrating the potential of pollen and macrofossil data for reconstructions of environmental change in Iceland and as an indicator of climate variability in the North Atlantic during the Holocene.

AB  - 1. Habitat degradation is one of the ` Big Five' drivers of biodiversity loss. However, the mechanisms responsible for this progressive loss of biodiversity are poorly understood. In marine ecosystems, corals play the role of ecosystem engineers, providing essential habitat for hundreds of thousands of species and hence their health is crucial to the stability of the whole ecosystem.
   2. Climate change is causing coral bleaching and degradation, and while this has been known for a while, little do we know about the cascading consequences of these events on the complex interrelationships between predators and their prey. The goal of our study was to investigate, under completely natural conditions, the effect of coral degradation on predator-prey interactions.
   3. Settlement stage ambon damselfish (Pomacentrus amboinensis), a common tropical fish, were released on patches of healthy or dead corals, and their behaviours in situ were measured, along with their response to injured conspecific cues, a common risk indicator. This study also explored the effect of habitat degradation on natural levels of mortality at a critical life-history transition.
   4. We found that juveniles in dead corals displayed risk-prone behaviours, sitting further away and higher up on the reef patch, and failed to respond to predation cues, compared to those on live coral patches. In addition, in situ survival experiments over 48 h indicated that juveniles on dead coral habitats had a 75% increase in predation-related mortality, compared to fish released on live, healthy coral habitats.
   5. Our results provide the first of many potential mechanisms through which habitat degradation can impact the relationship between prey and predators in the coral reef ecosystem. As the proportion of dead coral increases, the recruitment and replenishment of coral reef fishes will be threatened, and so will the level of diversity in these biodiversity hot spots.

AB  - It has been hypothesized that the emerging epidemic of diabetes in economically transitioning or recently transitioned populations is due to mismatch between developmental and mature environments. We took advantage of migration within an ethnically homogenous population to investigate this hypothesis, and the potentially modifying role of postnatal growth conditions, proxied by greater height. We used multivariable logistic regression in a population-based cross-sectional study from 1994 to 1996 of 2,341 long-term Hong Kong residents aged 25-74 years, either born in contemporaneously developed Hong Kong or migrants from economically undeveloped Guangdong. Migrant status was not associated with clinically diagnosed diabetes, odds ratio 1.05 (95% confidence interval 0.69-1.58) in adult migrants compared to Hong Kong-born natives and 1.22 (0.83-1.80) in preadult migrants, adjusted for age, sex, socio-economic position, and lifestyle. However, the association of diabetes with migrant status varied with height, suggesting a potentially complex relationship between indicators of prenatal and postnatal nutritional exposures. Compared to tall Hong Kong-born natives, the odds ratio of diabetes was 2.36 (1.20-4.61) in tall migrants, 1.94 (1.07-3.53) in short Hong Kong-born natives, but 1.04 (0.48-2.23) in short adult migrants. Additionally adjusting for body mass index and waist-hip ratio had little effect, apart from attenuating the association between short height and diabetes prevalence in Hong Kong-born natives. Whether the current epidemic of diabetes is a long-standing effect of such mismatch or a "first-generation through effect" generated by rapid economic development causing disproportionate growth remains to be determined.

AB  - The catabolic diversity of wetland microbial communities may be a sensitive indicator of nutrient loading or changes in environmental conditions. The objectives of this study were to assess the response of periphyton and microbial communities in water conservation area- 2a ( WCA- 2a) of the Everglades to additions of C- substrates and inorganic nutrients. Carbon dioxide and CH4 production rates were measured using 14 days incubation for periphyton, which typiWes oligotrophic areas, and detritus, which is prevalent at P- impacted areas of WCA- 2a. The wetland was characterized by decreasing P levels from peripheral to interior, oligotrophic areas. Microbial biomass and N mineralization rates were higher for oligotrophic periphyton than detritus. Methane production rates were also higher for unamended periphyton ( 80 mg CH4- C kg - 1 d - 1) than detritus ( 22 mg CH4- C kg - 1 d - 1), even though the organic matter content was higher for detritus ( 80%) than periphyton ( 69%). Carbon dioxide production for unamended periphyton ( 222 mg CO2- C kg - 1 d - 1) was signiWcantly greater than unamended detritus ( 84 mg CO2- C kg - 1 d - 1). The response of the heterotrophic microbial community to added C- substrates was related to the nutrient status of the wetland, as substrate- induced respiration ( SIR) was higher for detritus than periphyton. Amides and polysaccharides stimulated SIR more than other C- substrates, and methanogenesis was greater contributor to SIR for periphyton than detritus. Inorganic P addition stimulated CO2 and CH4 production for periphyton but not detritus, indicating a P limitation in the interior areas of WCA- 2a. Continued nutrient loading into oligotrophic areas of WCA- 2a or enhanced internal nutrient cycling may stimulate organic matter decomposition and further contribute to undesirable changes to the Everglades ecosystem caused by nutrient enrichment.

AB  - The composition of the soil atmosphere is an indicator of biological processes, and soil CO2, gradients have been used to estimate CO2 efflux from the surface. Soil atmosphere samplers, constructed with gas-permeable materials, have been used to quantify soil CO2 concentrations. The type of material used can influence the perceived real-time concentrations of CO2 in the soil. Previous works have not directly compared different types of materials under the same conditions. The objective of this study was to determine the diffusion coefficient (D) and time of 95% equilibrium (t(eq)) of CO2 through several materials, and to evaluate the effect of long-term soil burial (183 days) on diffusion characteristics. Materials tested included silicone, expanded Teflon (ePTFE), and ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (PE) tubing. The D of each material was determined using a closed-loop system consisting of a CO2-enriched (7800 ppm) chamber, a CO2 analyzer and an inner tube (experimental tubing) placed inside the chamber. Air was re-circulated through the inner tube, and as CO2 diffused from the chamber into the tubing, the analyzer recorded the increase in concentration. The silicone tubes had values of D ranging from 8.64 to 5.80 x 10(-6) cm(2) s(-1) with corresponding teq between 3.9 and 9.7 h. Diffusion coefficients of the ePTFE (1.25 x 10(-4) cm(2) s(-1)) and PE (7.70 x 10(-4) cm(2) s(-1)) materials were 2 orders of magnitude greater, with t(eq) < 6 min. Exposure to the soil environment for 183 days did not visibly deteriorate the materials or significantly affect the D or t(eq) values. Use of the ePTFE or PE materials, over the silicone materials, may allow for better characterization of dynamic CO2 concentrations in the soil based on the greater D and lesser t(eq) values of these materials.

AB  - This study investigates the relationship between the abundance of wood-rotting fungus suggested as 'continuity indicator species' and environmental variables for the assemblage of saproxylic (wood-living) beetles associated with Fomitopsis pinicola fruiting bodies in a mature spruce forest in southeastern Norway. The presence of species thought to indicate continuity in old growth is one of the criteria used when finding and delineating small protected areas ('woodland key habitats') in Scandinavian forestry. Although it is clear that remnants of old-growth forest are important for many taxa, documentation as to which entities or species the indicator species indeed indicate is scarce. If stands with a continuous and unbroken input of dead wood have a unique assemblage of wood-rotting fungi, it seems relevant to ask if these stands also have a unique assemblage of rare saproxylic beetles. I find that the indicator species exhibit no significant correlations with beetle species richness or with the presence of red-listed saproxylic beetles as a group. The different characteristics of dead wood conditions are the most important environmental variables that explain both the species richness and the presence of red-listed beetles. Single-species analyses reveal contrasting relationships. The red-listed beetle Atomaria alpina shows a significant and positive association to the abundance of indicator species. Contrary, a group of three red-listed species with similar ecology in the family Cisidae exhibits a significant and negative association to indicator species abundance. This indicates that important patterns are concealed when considering general measures such as overall presence of red-listed beetles. Single-species studies are necessary in order to correctly understand how rare beetles respond to forestry activities and to develop a policy that can secure their continuing existence in the boreal forest.

AB  - The O-18 content of CO2 is a powerful tracer of photosynthetic activity at the ecosystem and global scale. Due to oxygen exchange between CO2 and O-18-enriched leaf water and retrodiffusion of most of this CO2 back to the atmosphere, leaves effectively discriminate against O-18 during photosynthesis. Discrimination against O-18 (Delta O-18) is expected to be lower in C-4 plants because of low ci and hence low retrodiffusing CO2 flux. C-4 plants also generally show lower levels of carbonic anhydrase (CA) activities than C-3 plants. Low CA may limit the extent of O-18 exchange and further reduce Delta O-18. We investigated CO2-H2O isotopic equilibrium in plants with naturally low CA activity, including two C-4 (Zea mays, Sorghum bicolor) and one C-3 (Phragmites australis)species. The results confirmed experimentally the occurrence of low Delta O-18 in C-4, as well as in some C-3, plants. Variations in CA activity and in the extent of CO2-H2O isotopic equilibrium (theta (eq)) estimated from on-line measurements of Delta O-18 showed large range of 0-100% isotopic equilibrium (theta (eq) = 0-1). This was consistent with direct estimates based on assays of CA activity and measurements of CO2 concentrations and residence times in the leaves. The results demonstrate the potential usefulness of Delta O-18 as indicator of CA activity in vivo. Sensitivity tests indicated also that the impact of theta (eq) <1 (incomplete isotopic equilibrium),on O-18 of atmospheric CO2 can be similar for C-3 and C-4 plants and in both cases it increases with natural enrichment of <Delta>O-18 in leaf water.

AB  - Background:Though anatoxin-a (antx-a) is a globally important cyanobacterial neurotoxin in inland waters, information on sublethal toxicological responses of aquatic organisms is limited. We examined influences of () antx-a (11-3490 mu g/L) on photolocomotor behavioral responses and gene transcription associated with neurotoxicity, oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity, in two of the most common alternative vertebrate and fish models, Danio rerio (zebrafish) and Pimephales promelas (fathead minnow). We selected environmentally relevant treatment levels from probabilistic exposure distributions, employed standardized experimental designs, and analytically verified treatment levels using isotope-dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Caffeine was examined as a positive control. Results:Caffeine influences on fish behavior responses were similar to previous studies. Following exposure to (+/-) antx-a, no significant photolocomotor effects were observed during light and dark transitions for either species. Though zebrafish behavioral responses profiles were not significantly affected by (+/-) antx-a at the environmentally relevant treatment levels examined, fathead minnow stimulatory behavior was significantly reduced in the 145-1960 mu g/L treatment levels. In addition, no significant changes in transcription of target genes were observed in zebrafish; however, elavl3 and sod1 were upregulated and gst and cyp3a126 were significantly downregulated in fathead minnows. Conclusion: We observed differential influences of (+/-) antx-a on swimming behavior and gene transcription in two of the most common larval fish models employed for prospective and retrospective assessment of environmental contaminants and water quality conditions. Sublethal responses of fathead minnows were consistently more sensitive than zebrafish to this neurotoxin at the environmentally relevant concentrations examined. Future studies are needed to understand such interspecies differences, the enantioselective toxicity of this compound, molecular initiation events within adverse outcome pathways, and subsequent individual and population risks for this emerging water quality threat.

AB  - Few organisms can live in harsh transitional waters due to highly variable and rapid changeable physicochemical conditions. Fortunately, connecting the community structure of such fauna to specific environmental parameters can be used in tracing past and recent environmental changes. Herein, we analyzed the benthic communities in the Manzala lagoon (Nile-Delta), a region very impacted by the construction of the High-Dam at Aswan, along the inshore-offshore gradient. Approx. 3000 specimens belonging to 31 species sampled in 54 sampling sites were identified. The environmental and biological data were subjected to multivariate data analyses. Hierarchical clustering and non-metric multidimensional scaling identified three biotopes along a gradient of water salinity and sediment grain-size. The epifaunal/infaunal ratio was negatively correlated with salinity (R2 = - 0.72, p < 0.01). The low salinity-stations with a high content of silt and clay sediments were dominated by deposit-feeders, opportunistic gastropods. In contrast, the suspension-feeding bivalves dominated the more saline water and sand-sized sediments (R = 0.83, p < 0.001) near the Mediterranean outlets. The general low diversity and high dominance in the lagoon indicate high environmental stress and biodiversity loss as the background freshwater species have declined and only a few opportunistic taxa have flourished. In addition, a specific salinity-range was estimated at both species and community level. The results confirm that salinity and substrate type are major determinants for the structure of the molluscan community (feeding habit and life-mode) in marginal marine environments. Consequently, the feeding habit and life-mode of the mollusks, which have a continuous and very complete fossil record, can be used as a robust indicator for paleosalinity and paleo-hydrodynamics.

AB  - The radiation status of the landscape and climatic zones of Siberia at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries is characterized using bioindicators/biomonitors: lichens, mosses, and needles, according to the results obtained at the sites of their joint growth. The maximal activity of Cs-137 in these components is observed in the forest-tundra landscaped zone, polluted during the period of nuclear tests from the nuclear test site "Novaya Zemlya" and also due to slow migration of these elements to the soil under the arctic conditions. In the southern territories the specific activity of radiocesium in the moss-lichen cover and needles of conifers corresponds to the regional background, in the forest-tundra zone it sometimes exceeds it, but in general does not pose a threat to human health.
   Determined differences in the contents of radioactive elements in lichens and mosses that grow together on sites in different landscape zones of Siberia statistically not significant within one or two standard deviations, and recorded only in the range of 3 sigma at the level of significance 0.05. Specificity of radionuclide distribution in lichens, mosses and needles (differences for epigeals and epiphytic lichens; different species selected at one site, annual and perennial needles, etc.) made it possible to identify the causes of variations in their activities in different zones, along with landscape features of these zones. In the needles of conifers potassium concentration exceeds the content in lichens, at lower levels of thorium and Cs-137.
   The contents of uranium and thorium in the studied components in all landscape-climatic zones correspond to the natural ones, except for the single local territories, because of the possible anthropogenic influence.

AB  - Today, food safety and quality are some of the main concerns of consumer and health agencies around the world. Our current lifestyle and market globalization have led to an increase in the number of people affected by food poisoning. Foodborne illness and food poisoning have different origins (bacteria, virus, parasites, mold, contaminants, etc.), and some cases of food poisoning can be traced back to chemical and natural toxins. One of the toxins targeted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is the biogenic amine histamine. Biogenic amines (BAs) in food constitute a potential public health concern due to their physiological and toxicological effects. The consumption of foods containing high concentrations of biogenic amines has been associated with health hazards. In recent years there has been an increase in the number of food poisoning cases associated with BAs in food, mainly in relation to histamines in fish. We need to gain a better understanding of the origin of foodborne disease and how to control it if we expect to keep people from getting ill. Biogenic amines are found in varying concentrations in a wide range of foods (fish, cheese, meat, wine, beer, vegetables, etc.), and BA formation is influenced by different factors associated with the raw material making up food products, microorganisms, processing, and conservation conditions. Moreover, BAs are thermostable. Biogenic amines also play an important role as indicators of food quality and/or acceptability. Hence, BAs need to be controlled in order to ensure high levels of food quality and safety. All of these aspects will be addressed in this review.

AB  - Length-based methods are the cornerstone of many population studies and stock assessments. This study tested two widely used methods: the Powell-Wetherall (P-W) plot and the L-max approach (i.e., estimating L-infinity directly from L-max). In most simulations, P-W estimates of the ratio total mortality/growth (Z/K ratio) were biased beyond acceptable limits (bias > 30%). Bias in Z/K showed a complex behavior, without possible corrections. Estimates of asymptotic length (L-infinity) were less biased than Z/K, but were very sensitive to intra-cohort variability in growth and to changes in the occurrence of large individuals in the sample. Exclusion of the largest size classes during the regression procedure or weighing by abundance does not solve these issues. Perfect linearization of the data and extremely narrow confidence intervals for Z/K will lead users to erroneous overconfidence in outputs. Clearly, the P-W method is not suitable for the assessment of Z/K ratios of natural populations. Estimation of L-infinity may be tentatively possible under very specific conditions, with necessary external verifications. Also, this study demonstrates that there is no way to estimate L-infinity directly from L-max, since there is no particular relationship to expect a priori between L-infinity and L-max. Errors in estimating L-infinity directly affect the estimate of the growth constant K and all other subsequent calculations in population studies, stock assessments and ecosystem models. New approaches are urgently needed for length-based studies of body growth (e.g., unconstrained curve fit with subsequent bootstrapping), that consider the inherent uncertainty regarding the underlying data and processes.

AB  - Aquatic birds are important biotic components of Lake Ecosystem serving as indicator of pollution, sources of protein, fishing agent, income, recreation, tourism, sport and pest control. The aim of this study was to provide a baseline data and checklist of the bird assemblages in Asa Lake, Ilorin, Nigeria. Bird sampling was conducted weekly for 24 weeks, by walking 10 mS(-1) along a line transect on the bank of the lake. The populations were classified as rare, frequently seen and common based on the number of sightings, and abundance. Diversity indices such as dominance, evenness, Simpson diversity, Shanon-Weiner diversity, Marglef's richness were estimated. 13682 birds consisting of 17 species in 9 families were recorded in the lake. Species were found in highest number during the rains. Water fowl was the most abundant species 42.21%. African jacana was the least abundant constituting 0.67%. Family Ardeidae was the most abundant in terms of species diversity. Three species were commonly seen, four frequently seen, while nine were rare. Diversity indices of the bird species were; (D) 0.045, (1-D) 0.95; (e<^>H/S) 0.96, Margalef richness 3.67 and (H) 2.99. The assemblage of bird species in the lake was high due to the availability of food, submerged aquatic macrophytes seeds and foliage, large volume of water, surface area and depth of the lake and absence of large predators. Morphological characteristics and behavioural tactics of the birds were attributed to the high occurrence of some of the birds. For continued residency of the birds in the lake, lake best management practices (LBMP) should be implemented. Continuous monitoring of the birds (bio monitor) in the lake should also be done to give an insight into the ecological conditions of the lake and at the same time serving as aesthetic organisms in the lake.

AB  - Reuse of domestic wastewater is increasingly practiced as a means to address global demands on fresh water. Greywater is primarily reused via subsurface irrigation of gardens, where the soil environment is seen to be an integral part of the treatment process. The fate of biological contaminants (i.e. pathogens) in the soil is reasonably well understood, but their persistence and survival in soil cover layers is largely unexplored. This study investigated the ability of Escherichia coli to survive in common soil cover layers. Three garden mulches were investigated: pea straw mulch, a bark-based mulch and a coconut husk mulch. Each mulch was treated with an E.coli solution, a synthetic greywater with E.coli, or a freshwater control. Escherichia coli was applied at 1x10(4)most probable number (MPN) per g dry weight mulch. Subsamples were temporally analysed for E.coli. The bark and coconut husk mulches showed a steady decline in E.coli numbers, while E.coli increased in the pea straw mulch for the duration of the 50days experiment, peaking at 18x10(8)MPN per g dry weight mulch. This study highlighted the importance of selection of a suitable material for covering areas that are subsurface irrigated with greywater.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyPotential for microbial contamination is one of the limiting factors for domestic greywater reuse. Although subsurface irrigation is considered to be one of the lowest risk applications, there is still a possibility of microbes reaching the soil surface if the environmental conditions are not favourable or if soil movement inadvertently exposes the irrigation line. In these circumstances, the soil cover layer may be contaminated by greywater microbes. This study assesses the survival rates of the pathogen indicator organism Escherichia coli in three soil cover materials commonly used worldwide and makes clear recommendations to facilitate the safe reuse of domestic greywater.

AB  - Fishing pressure on coral reef ecosystems has been frequently linked to reductions of large fishes and reef fish biomass. Associated impacts on overall community structure are, however, less clear. In size-structured aquatic ecosystems, fishing impacts are commonly quantified using size spectra, which describe the distribution of individual body sizes within a community. We examined the size spectra and biomass of coral reef fish communities at 38 US-affiliated Pacific islands that ranged in human presence from near pristine to human population centers. Size spectra 'steepened' steadily with increasing human population and proximity to market due to a reduction in the relative biomass of large fishes and an increase in the dominance of small fishes. Reef fish biomass was substantially lower on inhabited islands than uninhabited ones, even at inhabited islands with the lowest levels of human presence. We found that on populated islands size spectra exponents decreased (analogous to size spectra steepening) linearly with declining biomass, whereas on uninhabited islands there was no relationship. Size spectra were steeper in regions of low sea surface temperature but were insensitive to variation in other environmental and geomorphic covariates. In contrast, reef fish biomass was highly sensitive to oceanographic conditions, being influenced by both oceanic productivity and sea surface temperature. Our results suggest that community size structure may be a more robust indicator than fish biomass to increasing human presence and that size spectra are reliable indicators of exploitation impacts across regions of different fish community compositions, environmental drivers, and fisheries types. Size-based approaches that link directly to functional properties of fish communities, and are relatively insensitive to abiotic variation across biogeographic regions, offer great potential for developing our understanding of fishing impacts in coral reef ecosystems.

These results were then validated through the bioassays using field water from an urban stream, Chebei Creek in Guangzhou, South China. Seventeen water samples were collected along Chebei Creek for evaluation. In total, 71% of the field waters were acutely toxic to Hyallela azteca and 24% of the waters caused 100% mortality. Toxic unit evaluation suggested that cypermethrin was one of the main contributors to toxicity. The tiered ecological risk assessment approach (deterministic quotient method and probabilistic methods, including joint probability curve and Monte Carlo Simulation) suggested that cypermethrin posed significant threats to aquatic ecology in this stream. The overall probabilistic risk of cypermethrin to aquatic species in Chebei Creek reached 66% when acute-to-chronic ratios were set at 125. An exceedance probability of cypermethrin in Chebei Creek that affected H. azteca as modeled using the joint probability curve method was 88%, suggesting that most sites were at risk due to cypermethrin exposure. This value was similar to the results obtained from acute toxicity tests (71% of field water samples were acutely toxic to H. azteca), indicating the effectiveness of the tiered approach to assess risk of cypermethrin in urban waterways. To the authors' knowledge, the present study is the first to provide a focused probabilistic evaluation of ecological risk for cypermethrin in a complex urban waterway environment. Despite uncertainties existing in the ecological risk assessment procedure, this approach provides a comprehensive assessment of ecological risk of cypermethrin, and subsequently, a foundation for further risk diagnosis and management in urban waterways.

AB  - Recent Studies have confirmed that the aquatic ecosystem is being polluted with an unknown cocktail of pharmaceuticals, their metabolites and/or their transformation products (TPs). Although individual chemicals are typically present at low concentrations, they can interact with each other resulting in additive or potentially even synergistic mixture effects. Therefore it is necessary to assess the environmental risk caused by these chemicals. Data on exposure is required for quantitative risk assessment of TPs and/or metabolites. Such data are mostly missing because of the non-availability of TPs and very often metabolites for experimental testing. This study demonstrates the application of different in silico tools for qualitative risk assessment using the example of photodegradation TPs (photo-TPs) of diatrizoic acid (DIAT), which itself is not readily biodegradable. Its photolytic transformation was studied and the photodegradation pathway was established. The aerobic biodegradability of photo-TPs under the conditions of an aquatic environment was assessed using standardized OECD tests. The qualitative risk assessment of DIAT and selected photo-TPs was performed by the PBT approach (i.e. Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity), using experimental biodegradation test assays, applying different QSAR models with several different toxicological endpoints and in silico read-across approaches. The qualitative risk assessment pointed out that the photo-TPs were less persistent compared to DIAT and none of them possessed any bioaccumulation threat. However, a few photo-TPs were predicted to be active for mutagenicity and genotoxicity, which indicate the need for further testing to confirm these predictions. The present study demonstrates that in silico qualitative risk assessment analysis can increase the knowledge space about the environmental fate of TPs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Paleoproterozoic (similar to 1.73 Ga) basement rocks from Maddhapara, Bangladesh show a large range of chemical variations including diorite, quartz diorite, monzodiorite, quartz monzonite and granite. These are composed of varying proportions of quartz+plagioclase+K-feldspar+biotite+hornblendeepidote+fitanite+magnetite+apatite and zircon. Amphibole and biotite, dominant ferro-magnesian minerals, have been analyzed with an electron microprobe. The biotite, Mg-dominant trioctahedral micas, is classified as phlogopitic nature. Relatively high Mg (1.33-1.53 pfu), Mg-# (0.52-0.59) and low Al-VI (0.13-0.25 pfu) contents in the biotite reflect slightly fractionated magma, which might be a relative indicator for the origin of the parental magma. Biotite is also a very good sensor of oxidation state of the parental magma. Oxygen fugacity of the studied biotites estimate within the QFM and HM buffers and equilibrate at about -12.35 and -12.46, which exhibit the source materials were relatively higher oxidation state during crystallization and related to arc magmatism. Whereas, calcic amphiboles, a parental member of arc-related igneous suite, display consistent oxygen fugacity values (-11.7 to -12.3), low Al-# (0.16-0.21) with H2Omelt (5.6 wt.%-9.5 wt.%) suggest their reliability with the typical values of calc-alkaline magma crystallization. The oxygen fugacity of magma is related to its source material, which in turn depends on tectonic setting. Discrimination diagrams and chemical indices of both biotite and amphibole of dioritic rocks reveal calc-alkaline orogenic complexes; mostly I-type suite formed within subduction-related environments. Moreover, igneous micas are used as metallogenic indicator. The biotites with coexisting amphibole compositions show an apparent calc-alkaline trend of differentiation. The study suggests that the trend of oxidized magmas is commonly associated with compressive tectonic and convergent plate boundaries.

AB  - Disused tin-mining ponds make up a significant amount of water bodies in Malaysia particularly at the Kinta Valley in the state of Perak where tin-mining activities were the most extensive, and these abundantly available water sources are widely used in the field of aquaculture and agriculture. However, the natural ecology and physicochemical conditions of these ponds, many of which have been altered due to secondary post-mining activities, remains to be explored. As ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) are directly related to the nutrient cycles of aquatic environments and are useful bioindicators of environmental variations, the focus of this study was to identify AOBs associated with disused tin-mining ponds that have a history of different secondary activities in comparison to ponds which were left untouched and remained as part of the landscape. The 16S rDNA gene was used to detect AOBs in the sediment and water sampled from the three types of disused mining ponds, namely ponds without secondary activity, ponds that were used for lotus cultivation and post-aquaculture ponds. When the varying pond types were compared with the sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the AOB clone libraries, both Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira-like AOB were detected though Nitrosospira spp. was seen to be the most ubiquitous AOB as it was present in all ponds types. However, AOBs were not detected in the sediments of idle ponds. Based on rarefaction analysis and diversity indices, the disused mining pond with lotus culture indicated the highest richness of AOBs. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that among the physicochemical properties of the pond sites, TAN and nitrite were shown to be the main factors that influenced the community structure of AOBs in these disused tin-mining ponds.

AB  - The basin-scale spatial variability in lipid biomarker proxies in lacustrine sediments, which are established tools for studying continental environmental change, has rarely been examined. It is often implicitly assumed that a lake sediment core provides an average integral of catchment sources. Here we evaluated the distribution of lipid biomarkers in a modern ecosystem and compared it with the sedimentary record. We analyzed lipid biomarkers in terrestrial and aquatic organisms and in lake surface sediments from 17 locations within the saline-alkaline Lonar crater lake in central India. Terrestrial vegetation and lake surface sediments were characterized by relatively high average chain length (ACL) index values (29.6-32.8) of leaf wax n-alkanes, consistent with suggestions that plants in drier and warmer climates produce longer chain alkyl lipids than plants in cooler and humid areas. A heterogeneous spatial distribution of ACL values in lake surface sediments was found: at locations away from the shore, the values were highest (31 or more), possibly indicating different sources and/or transport of terrestrial biomarkers. In floating, benthic microbial mats and surface sediment, n-heptadecane, carotenoids, diploptene, phytol and tetrahymanol occurred in large amounts. Interestingly, these biomarkers of a unique bacterial community were found in substantially higher concentrations in nearshore sediment samples. We suggest that human influence and subsequent nutrient supply resulted in increased primary productivity, leading to an unusually high concentration of tetrahymanol in the nearshore sediments. In summary, the data showed that substantial heterogeneity existed within the lake, but leaf wax n-alkanes in a core from the center of the lake represented an integral of catchment conditions. However, lake level fluctuation may potentially affect aquatic lipid biomarker distributions in lacustrine sediments, in addition to source changes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Andrew Brennan (Ecological Economics, 2013 this issue) has argued that the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) and Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) are theoretically flawed because, as indicators designed to capture the net psychic income generated by economic activity, they fail to incorporate net changes in human-health capital. To a lesser extent, Brennan is also critical of the fact that the ISEW and GPI are unable to reflect both economic welfare and sustainability. Whilst I'm happy to concede that the two indicators fail to fully account for changes in human-health capital, it is my contention that this failure represents, at most, a methodological shortcoming. It does not amount to a theoretical weakness. Despite Brennan's best efforts, the ISEW and GPI remain soundly based on Irving Fisher's distinction between income and capital. Indeed, Brennan's suggested modifications to the ISEW and GPI do nothing but conflate income and capital, which, if taken on board, would lead to misleading indicators of total economic welfare. As for not reflecting both economic welfare and sustainability, I have long argued that the ISEW and GPI merely reflect the former and need to be supplemented by biophysical indicators to determine whether the economic welfare being enjoyed by a nation is sustainable. The fact that the ISEW and GPI only reflect economic welfare is not a weakness, since no indicator can or should attempt to reflect both conditions. The use of strong sustainability approaches to calculate the environment costs incorporated in the ISEW and GPI is not an exercise designed to measure sustainability. It is an exercise in good economic accounting. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Springs are characterized by consistent thermal and hydrologic conditions, which enable use of spring-inhabiting organisms as sensitive indicators of biogeochemical changes in their catchments. We hypothesized that bryophytes would show a stronger response than vascular plants to changes in spring water quality because submerged bryophytes do not take up compounds from the soil. We analyzed species responses to interannual changes in spring water quality (discharge, water temperature, electrical conductivity, and pH) in 57 forest springs over 4 consecutive years. We calculated interannual turnover in species composition for bryophytes and vascular plants with the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index. We applied regression analysis to test interannual changes in species composition of the taxonomic groups over time, and we used 2-sided t-tests to compare year-to-year changes in species composition between bryophytes and vascular plants. We used boosted regression tree (BRT) models to quantify the relative importance of different physicochemical variables and Pearson linear correlation to quantify short-term changes in vegetation relative to changes in spring-water pH. For both groups, interannual changes in species composition were significantly positively related to time scale. Bryophytes did not show a significantly stronger response than vascular plants to interannual changes in the environment. Alterations in pH and conductivity explained most of the observed interannual changes in species composition of both groups, whereas changes in water temperature and discharge were less important. However, responses of single species to environmental change may be delayed, resulting in inertia at the community and ecosystem scales. Hence, longer time periods need to be considered for a better understanding of response times of the vegetation of European forest springs to changes in spring water quality.

AB  - A flow-through system was developed to investigate the effects of time-variable exposure of pesticides on algae. A recently developed algae population model was used for simulations supported and verified by laboratory experiments. Flow-through studies with Desmodesmus subspicatus and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata under time-variable exposure to isoproturon were performed, in which the exposure patterns were based on the results of FOrum for Co-ordination of pesticide fate models and their USe (FOCUS) model calculations for typical exposure situations via runoff or drain flow. Different types of pulsed exposure events were realized, including a whole range of repeated pulsed and steep peaks as well as periods of constant exposure. Both species recovered quickly in terms of growth from short-term exposure and according to substance dissipation from the system. Even at a peak 10 times the maximum predicted environmental concentration of isoproturon, only transient effects occurred on algae populations. No modified sensitivity or reduced growth was observed after repeated exposure. Model predictions of algal growth in the flow-through tests agreed well with the experimental data. The experimental boundary conditions and the physiological properties of the algae were used as the only model input. No calibration or parameter fitting was necessary. The combination of the flow-through experiments with the algae population model was revealed to be a powerful tool for the assessment of pulsed exposure on algae. It allowed investigating the growth reduction and recovery potential of algae after complex exposure, which is not possible with standard laboratory experiments alone. The results of the combined approach confirm the beneficial use of population models as supporting tools in higher-tier risk assessments of pesticides. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2012;31:899908.

At desolated landfills of coal combustion waste (CCW) that were un-covered and covered with shallow soil material layers, soil microbial indicators were estimated for both the ecological and eco-toxicological evaluation. The young CCW sites with pH values of 9.5 and substantial coal-derived organic carbon showed significant microbial biomass content and nitrogen mineralization rates. At the 0 to 15 year old landfills, the microbial biomass content and activities increased significantly with age. However, large spatial variations occurred due to the variation of the cover material thickness, the degree of ash-aging and the tillage practices. Carbon dioxide was even sequestered at young CCW sites as indicated during laboratory incubation with an open apparatus purging continuously ambient air. In accordance, the respiratory quotient went down to 0.03 mol CO(2) evolution rate per mol O(2) uptake rate, indicating that the CO(2) evolution rate is limited as an overall quality indicator. Within 15 years, these 'Technosols' showed pH values of 7.7 and decalcified while changes in microbial biomass content and activity rates were mainly related to N availability. We concluded that the available As, B, Cr and Ni pollution at CCW sites seemed largely immobilised by organic matter and alkalinity and therefore did not to inhibit the microbial colonisation and development of high microbial activity within 15 years. However, the ash disposals pose a contamination risk by wind erosion and a future risk to human or environmental health when toxic metals will be released in soil at low pH values, low organic matter and low antagonistic ion contents.

AB  - The aim of this work is to prepare wound dressing hydrogels permitting (i) to cure chronicle pathologies; (ii) to remove unsuitable odors coming from healing. Thus, chitosan, a natural polymer with biological properties, and activated carbon (AC), a well-known adsorbent, are mixed within a composite hydrogel. To get a suitable porous structure for healing, the vapor induced phase separation process (VIPS) is used. It permits to slow down mass transfers kinetics compared to other elaboration processes such as the wet process. Hence, a better control of the final porous matrix is reached throughout the elaboration process.
   In this work, the mass transfers occurring through the elaboration of the composites were studied thanks to gravimetric measurements carried out during the VIPS process. Results showed there were two main steps in the gelation process. A weight intake, due to an ammonia flux allowing the gelation to happen, was followed by a weight loss, mainly controlled by a water outtake. This second part could be compared to a slow drying in smooth conditions. Gelation with a color indicator was also performed, which provided complementary experimental information on mass transfers barrier.
   A modeling of mass transfers mechanisms occurring during the gel elaboration is presented to get an overview of limiting phenomena leading to the final composite structures. It involves a coupling between chemical reactions, external mass transfers and internal diffusion within the polymeric matrix. Results show that internal diffusion is the main barrier to gelation.
   To qualify the gel structure, drying kinetics were compared on the elaborated gels. Whatever the gel, the drying kinetics were globally the same and could be divided into three steps. Considering the process used and this result, it was believed that the matrixes prepared were homogeneous and rather symmetric. They could constitute the first layer of wound dressings.

AB  - In order to improve the reliability of using bryozoans as an indicator of the palaeoenvironment, a detailed study of the ancient environmental parameters of the Middle Miocene bryozoan event was carried out using foraminifera, calcareous nannoplankton and oxygen and carbon stable isotope data. Abundant occurrence of Bryozoa in the Middle Miocene of the Central Paratethys was an isochronous event which can be correlated with M6 Zone between FO of Orbulina suturalis and LO of Praeorbulina circularis (14.8-14.58 Ma). The ecosystems of the Central Paratethys marine basins during this time were generally influenced by the Middle Miocene climatic optimum and the large transgression which covered the Central Paratethys basins with tropical-subtropical waters. These events triggered the expansion of Bryozoa which settled in the narrow shallow-water zone of the basin and were accompanied by epiphytic foraminifera such as Asterigerinata, Lobatula and Elphidium and large foraminifera such as Amphistegina, rarely cibicidoids. Although foraminiferal assemblages show only small palaeoenvironmental variations, bryozoan species compositions remarkably vary according to palaeoenvironments. In this study, four clusters with differing bryozoan assemblages can be distinguished in shallow-water environment as follows:
   1) Reteporella-Hornera verrucosa assemblage, indicative of a high-energy environment,
   2) Buffonellodes-Rhynchozoon assemblage, occurred on carbonate substratum with seagrass meadows influenced by the Middle Miocene warm-water incursion.
   3) Smittina-Metrarabdotos assemblage, indicative of toleration of suboxic zone in sediment.
   4) Schizomavella tenelia-Schizoporella tetragona assemblage, recorded almost in all shallow-water environments. This cluster probably represents species with high adaptation potential.
   Exceptionally deeper-water conditions were inferred at one section, and represented by a Tervia irregularis dominated assemblage. This assemblage was only present for a short period of time. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - During the past 130 years, western juniper Juniperus occidentalis Hook.) has rapidly expanded into sagebrush communities impacting plant structure and function. Predictions of intercanopy shrub density and cover with woodland development can provide insight into site condition and ecological resiliency in western juniper encroached areas. The purpose of this study is to model shrub density and cover in relation to juniper competition across a heterogeneous landscape in a southeast Oregon watershed. Independent variables included in model development were derived from high-resolution color imagery, a 10 m digital elevation model, and field-based vegetation and soil moisture measurements. juniper cover and three intercanopy classes, representing different levels of juniper competition, were delineated from 1:5000 scale color (RGB) imagery. A competition index was produced from the classified image representing a gradient of potential competition with juniper. An integrated moisture index was generated representing variability in soil moisture due to hillslope solar radiation, curvature of the landscape and flow path direction and flow accumulation (flow path density). Plant density, plant cover, and percent soil moisture (gravimetric) were measured from 10 m x 10 m plots located throughout the watershed study area. Multiple stepwise regression produced the best-fit model for predicting plant density or cover for mountain big sagebrush (Artemesia tridentata ssp. vaseyana Beetle), bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata (Pursh)), and all shrub species combined. The prediction of total shrub density was significantly greater than expected by chance (p < 0.001), with a 0.865 coefficient of determination. Total shrub cover also had a high correlation between observed values and environmental gradients (R-2 = 0.773). These data can be used by land managers to assess the change in plant structure with increasing juniper canopy cover, a measure important for monitoring impacts from juniper woodland establishment.

AB  - 1. House mouse Mus domesticus outbreaks in the grain-growing areas of south-eastern Australia occur irregularly and may be local or widespread, covering thousands of square kilometres. All natural and agricultural habitats are occupied when house mouse numbers are high, and the question we addressed was whether we can distinguish source and sink habitats within these agricultural landscapes so that management practices can be better targeted.
   2. Live-trapping on replicated grids in 15 habitats, including eucalypt woodland, cypress pine woodland, areas of permanent water and crop habitats, was carried out from 1983 to 1988 at 9-week intervals.
   3. Agricultural cropland (including crops, fallow and pastures), farm buildings, seepage areas and natural woodland could be source habitats. Farm buildings, seepage areas and saltbush areas all had high mouse densities entering the 1983-84 outbreak and were refuge habitats for mice.
   4. Cropland habitats quickly became the source area in spring 1983, and woodlands were initially sinks that lagged 2-4 months behind the population growth shown in crops.
   5. Adult female mice in cropland habitats were more often in breeding condition compared with mice in natural woodland. Mice also had higher indices of residency in cropland than in natural woodland.
   6. Synthesis and applications. In non-irrigated cereal production areas of south-eastern Australia, house mice move from refuge habitats in seepage areas and farm buildings into crops, build up in numbers in cropland habitats, and then invade woodland habitats, which by themselves cannot generate outbreaks of this pest species. Monitoring for incipient outbreaks should concentrate on refuges in seepage areas and crops and their associated fence lines as source habitat indicators. Population control in these habitats in spring would reduce the likelihood of population outbreaks in autumn, leading to reduced rodenticide use and a concomitant reduction in environmental hazards.

AB  - Bottom-up control, or physical forcing of upper trophic populations, is often cited as a major factor regulating marine species. In particular, seabirds are often cited as indicators of relative productivity and health of the marine environment. The degree to which physical forcing plays a dominant role and the mechanisms of effect remain unclear. We test the relationship between measures of oceanographic and atmospheric forcing, proxied by commonly available monthly to daily indices, and the response of populations of a ubiquitous seabird of the Pacific Northwest coastal environment, the common murre, Uria aalge. We constructed two models: an annualized bottom-up model that examines the degree to which population response variables, including population size, breeding success, and foraging parameters, are correlated with oceanographic forcing at space and time scales relevant to murre biology; and a daily direct forcing model that examines the degree to which diet choices reflect specific, local oceanographic signals. Our bottom-up model suggests that murres are regulated by bottom-up forcing, and that the strength of the association between physical change and population response may be mediated by density dependence. Our direct forcing model indicated that chick diet is affected by both local and remote parameters, including upwelling, tide, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. We conclude that murres, and seabirds in general, can be used as indicators of local to basinwide physical change, but only under certain conditions: the life history of the species, and the specific local population, must be well known; a conceptual model that links life history traits to measures of physical change at biologically relevant space and time scales must be developed; and larger populations that are more apt to show density-dependent effects should be selected.

AB  - Topsoil (0-15 cm) hulk density, aggregate stability soil dispersibility, water retention and infiltration were measured between 1989 and 1996 on an Alfisol under rehabilitation in southwestern Nigeria. The planted leguminous species were Pueraria phaseoloides, Senna siilnrrir, Leucaena leucocephala,, Acacia leptocarpa and A. auriculiformis. plots with natural fallow and maize/cassava intercropping were included. Level (minimum) and mound tillage with hoes was adopted for the cultivated areas under study after 4 and 6 year fallow periods. Under fallow, the soil bulk density decreased from 1.56 to 1.11 t m(-3). The continuously cropped treatment (level tillage) had significantly higher bulk density than the fallowed subplots after 6 years. Mean soil penetrometer resistance ranged from 75 to 157 kPa for fallowed plots and from 192 to 295 kPa for the continuously cropped (level tillage) subplot. Surface soil water contents were similar for all the treatments during the soil strength measurements. Although soil aggregates were generally of low stability and not well formed, they were improved by fallowing.
   Soil structural improvement by planted fallows was similar to that by natural fallow, but the trees were more promising for long-term fallow (>6 years) than the herbaceous P. phaseoloides. However, the improvement in soil structure after 4 or 6 rear falloff could not be maintained in subsequent cropping. Furthermore, the significant improvement in soil bulk density caused by A. auriculiformis and natural fallow was more rapidly lost on the cultivated subplots compared with other fallow treatments. Thus, soil structure recovery under a fallow does not imply a sustained improvement when stress is applied to this soil. Post-fallow soil management options such as residue incorporation and tillage to ameliorate compaction or soil strength mill be necessary to enhance the improvements by fallow species.

AB  - The toxicity of various organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs) is of increasing concern. However, there is still a lack of research on the toxicity of OPFRs to terrestrial invertebrates and its metabolism in vivo. Herein, earthworms (Eisenia fetida) were exposed to soil spiked with 0, 0.05, 0.5, and 5 mg/kg tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP, a typical alkyl OPFRs) for 28 d to study the biological responses to the exposure and metabolism of TBOEP. TBOEP exposure inhibited the activity of acetyl-cholinesterase (64.4-68.6% of that in the control group), increased the energy consumption level, and affected calcium-dependent pathways of E. fetida, which caused a 3.6-12.4% reduction in the weight gain rate (developmental toxicity), a 10.6-69.4% reduction in the number of juveniles (reproduction toxicity), and neurotoxicity to E. fetida. The 5 mg/kg TBOEP exposure caused a significant accumulation of malondialdehyde (1.68 times higher than that in the control group) in E. fetida, which indicated that the balance of oxidation and anti-oxidation of E. fetida was broken. Meanwhile, E. fetida maintained the absorption and metabolic abilities to TBOEP under the environmental condition. The removal rate of soil TBOEP was increased by 25.1-35.5% by the presence of E. fetida. Importantly, TBOEP could accumulate in E. fetida (0.09-76.0 mu g/kg) and the activation of cytochrome P450 and glutathione detoxification pathway promoted the metabolism of TBOEP in E. fetida. These findings link the biological responses and metabolic behavior of earthworms under pollution stress and provide fundamental data for the environmental risk assessment and pollution removal of OPFRs in soil.

AB  - Purpose: To compare listening ability (speech reception thresholds) and real-life listening experience in users with a percutaneous bone conduction device (BCD) with two listening programs differing only in high-frequency gain. In situ real-life experiences were recorded with ecological momentary assessment (EMA) techniques combined with real-time acoustical data logging and standard retrospective questionnaires. Methods: Nineteen experienced BCD users participated in this study. They all used a Ponto 4 BCD from Oticon Medical during a 4-week trial period. Environmental data and device parameters (i.e., device usage and volume control) were logged in real-time on an iPhone via a custom iOS research app. At the end of the trial period, subjects filled in APHAB, SSQ, and preference questionnaires. Listening abilities with the two programs were evaluated with speech reception threshold tests. Results: The APHAB and SSQ questionnaires did not reveal any differences between the two listening programs. The EMAs revealed group-level effects, indicating that in speech and noisy listening environments, subjects preferred the default listening program, and found the program with additional high-frequency gain too loud. This finding was corroborated by the volume log-subjects avoided the higher volume control setting and reacted more to changes in environmental sound pressure levels when using the high-frequency gain program. Finally, day-to-day changes in EMAs revealed acclimatization effects in the listening experience for ratings of "sound quality" and "program suitability" of the BCD, but not for ratings of "loudness perception" and "speech understanding". The acclimatization effect did not differ among the listening programs. Conclusion: Adding custom high-frequency amplification to the BCD target-gain prescription improves speech reception in laboratory tests under quiet conditions, but results in poorer real-life listening experiences due to loudness.

AB  - Monitoring the condition of building structures based on composite materials in aggressive environments shows that the deterioration of basic properties occurs under the influence of various factors such as temperature and humidity changes, in addition to changes in the chemical composition of air environment. In addition, the composite materials during the operation must retain not only the mechanical properties laid down at the design stage, but also the electro-physical characteristics, regardless of the type of destructive effects. In the current study, the quantitative assessment of the result of the interaction of an aggressive sulphate-containing medium with composites modified with conductive and dielectric additives was carried out. The effect of sulphate attack on the specific electrical conductivity of cement composites was studied. The nature of the interaction was evaluated by changing the properties of the samples of the developed compositions under the influence of a single-normal solution of sodium sulphate. The analysis was carried out by means of potentiometric titration using the exchange interaction method by fixing the degree of absorption of sulphate ions and determining the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. The measurement of the solution potential allowed determination of the quantitative indicators of the rate of calcium hydroxide leaching from the sample structure, which is necessary to assess the intensity of the destruction process and determine the nature of the change in strength properties. Measurements of the electrical resistivity of samples under the constant influence of sulphate aggression were taken during 28 days of observation. A method for quantifying the effect of a sulphate medium on a cement matrix was proposed that enables the material durability to be predicted. The features of changes in the morphology of structural components after exposure to aggressive solution were determined by physical and chemical methods.

AB  - Woody plant expansion into shrub and grasslands is a global and vexing ecological problem. In the Great Basin of North America, the expansion of pinyon-juniper (Pinus spp.-Juniperus spp.) woodlands is threatening the sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) biome. The Greater Sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse), a sagebrush obligate species, is widespread in the Great Basin and considered an indicator for the condition of sagebrush ecosystems. To assess the population response of sage-grouse to landscape-scale juniper removal, we analyzed a long-term telemetry data set and lek counts with a Bayesian integrated population model in a before-after-control-impact design. Population growth rates (lambda) in a treatment area (Treatment) with juniper removal and a control area (Control) without juniper removal indicated the two areas generally experienced population increase, decrease, and stability in the same years. However, the difference in lambda between study areas indicated a steady increase in the Treatment relative to the Control starting in 2013 (removals initiated in 2012), with differences of 0.13 and 0.11 in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Retrospective sensitivity analysis suggested the dynamics in lambda were driven by increases in juvenile, adult, first nest, and yearling survival in the Treatment relative to the Control. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of targeted conifer removal as a management strategy for conserving sage-grouse populations in sagebrush steppe affected by conifer expansion. Examples of positive, population-level responses to habitat management are exceptionally rare for terrestrial vertebrates, and this study provides promising evidence of active management that can be implemented to aid recovery of an imperiled species and biome.

AB  - This paper presents a thermo-economic analysis of a simple organic Rankine cycle (SORC) as a waste heat recovery (WHR) systems of a 2 MW stationary gas engine evaluating different working fluids. Initially, a systematic methodology was implemented to select three organic fluids according to environmental and safety criteria, as well as critical system operational conditions. Then, thermodynamic, exergy, and exergo-economic models of the system were developed under certain defined considerations, and a set of parametric studies are presented considering key variables of the system such as pump efficiency, turbine efficiency, pinch point condenser, and evaporator. The results show the influence of these variables on the combined power of the system (gas engine plus ORC), ORC exergetic efficiency, specific fuel consumption (Delta BSFC), and exergo indicators such as the payback period (PBP), levelized cost of energy (LCOE), and the specific investment cost (SIC). The results revealed that heat transfer equipment had the highest exergy destruction cost rates representing 81.25% of the total system cost. On the other hand, sensitivity analyses showed that acetone presented better energetic and exergetic performance when the efficiency of the turbine, evaporator, and condenser pinch point was increased. However, toluene was the fluid with the best results when pump efficiency was increased. In terms of the cost of exergy destroyed by equipment, the results revealed that acetone was the working fluid that positively impacted cost reduction when pump efficiency was improved; and toluene, when turbine efficiency was increased. Finally, the evaporator and condenser pinch point increased all the economic indicators of the system. In this sense, the working fluid with the best performance in economic terms was acetone, when the efficiency of the turbine, pinch condenser, and pinch evaporator was enhanced.

AB  - The South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO) Convention includes specific provisions to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs). The SPRFMO Commission has determined that the interim measures put in place to protect VMEs should be replaced by an improved system of fishable and closed areas. We used the conservation planning tool Zonation to examine the utility of a decision-support tool to develop spatial management options that balance the protection of VMEs with utilisation of high value areas for fishing. Input data included: habitat suitability maps for VME indicator taxa, and uncertainties associated with these model predictions, for an area of the high seas around New Zealand; naturalness condition, represented by two proxy variables using New Zealand trawl effort data; and value to the New Zealand fishery using trawl catch data for two gear types and three time-periods. Running scenario analyses with these data allowed for an understanding of the effect of varying the input data on the spatial prioritisation of areas for VME conservation. The analyses also allowed for the cost to fishing to be determined, in terms of the amount of the trawl catch footprint (normalised to the catch) lost if high priority areas for VME indicator taxa are protected. In most scenarios, the cost to fishing was low given the relatively high proportion of suitable habitat for VME indicator taxa that could be protected. The main outcome of the present study is a demonstration of the practical utility of using available data, including modelled data, and the Zonation decision-support tool to develop future options for the spatial management of the SPRFMO area. Suggestions are also made for improvements in input data for future analyses.

AB  - Studying Arctic biogeochemical ecosystem with various methods and approaches is of vital importance to further predict future global climate changes. Organic matter of modern bottom sediments, which accumulates heterogeneous signals of various processes of carbon transport and transformation, acts as the unique indicator of initial depositional environment of sediment and its diagenetic history. Using high-precision geochemical instruments allows us to obtain important information on potential input of both allochthonous and autochthonous components to organic matter, and thus to further promote understanding of the modern Arctic carbon cycle.
   The aim of the research is to study the lithological and organo-geochemical features of the sediments accumulated in the specific lagoon conditions of the coastal part of the Laptev Sea (lvashkina Lagoon, Bykovsky Peninsula).
   Materials and methods. Precipitation in the area of the Lena river delta was selected as an object of the study. To assess the variability of molecular composition of organic matter in accumulation of sediments, the 18-meter interval of the VD-13 well, drilled in the central part of the lvashkina lagoon during the 2073 spring Arctic expedition, was investigated. For the samples, their granulometric charaderistics were determined, and pyrolytic and chromatography-mass spectrometric studies were conducted as well. It is shown that the increased content of organic carbon in the section is confined to the pelitic fraction of sediments. The distribution of n-alkanes is characterized by the dominance of high molecular weight odd homologues, which indicates the ubiquitous contribution of higher terrestrial vegetation to formation of organic matter accumulated in sediments. However, the contribution of the potentially migratory organic component is not excluded, since the presence of a low molecular weight fraction of n-alkanes is noted for a number of samples. The results of the pyrolytic analysis of the samples indicate a sharp variability in the content of C-org and volatile organic compounds with depth.

AB  - As the frequency and intensity of climate extremes are likely to be substantially modified in upcoming decades due to climate warming, an evaluation of the response of interannual vegetation variabilities to climate extremes is imperative. This study comprehensively analyzed the spatio-temporal variabilities of 21 temperature and precipitation indices across Hubei Province in Central China based on daily meteorological records for the period 1961-2015. To quantify the sensitivity of the vegetation to climate indices in the study area, we correlated climate indices with three vegetation indicators: leaf area index, normalized difference vegetation index, and gross primary productivity. The results indicated that warm-related indices exerted considerable increasing trends, especially for summer days at a rate of 0.35 days year(-1) (p < 0.01). In addition, the trends of 18 indices during 1982-2015 were larger than those during 1961-2015, indicating accelerated climate changes in Hubei Province. Spatially, extreme precipitation showed increases in the eastern regions of the study area and decreases in the western regions. Correlation analyses revealed that warm anomalies of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation resulted in extreme warm conditions and extreme precipitation in the study area. Stepwise linear regression analyses identified three temperature indices and three precipitation indices, which were mostly correlated with the three ecosystem variables at the site scale. Further multiple regressions demonstrated the main negative impacts caused by frost days, warm spell duration, extremely heavy precipitation, and consecutive dry days on the terrestrial ecosystem in Hubei Province. Our study provides an improved understanding of the effects of climate extremes on terrestrial ecosystems and can also offer a basis for the management of mitigating damage from climate extremes.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are present in all soils and comprise an important component of soil biota with respect to plant nutrition and growth as well as soil quality. Previous research in a number of agroecosystems had documented large impacts from various management practices (e.g., tillage, fertilization, crop rotation) on the levels of host root colonization and/or composition of the AM fungal communities in the roots and soil. Here, we tested whether a standardized mycorrhizal bioassay could contribute to deciphering soil-use legacy through detection of consistent changes in the colonization pattern of a mycorrhizal bait plant (leek). To this end, we grew the leek in a large number (154) of soils under uniform environmental conditions. Most of the variation in the mycorrhizal colonization of bait plants grown in the different soils, could be attributed to soil properties and sampling site altitude, whereas the occurrence of specific structures (vesicles) was particularly correlated with abundance of certain AM fungal taxa such as Rhizophagus sp. Contributions of the root colonization of bait plants to explaining agricultural management practices and soil heavy metal concentrations (frequently used as indicators of soil quality) were comparatively small and partly counterintuitive. For example, higher incidence of arbuscules was detected in soils to which mineral fertilizers were applied as compared to organically farmed soils. Moreover, the explanatory power of the bioassay was much less than was that for soil respiration, a well established bioindicator of soil quality. Therefore, the mycorrhizal bioassay tested here appears not to be suitable as an interpreter of soil-use legacy, even though it does uncover very clear trends in colonization patterns of the bait plants by indigenous AM communities across large environmental gradients.

AB  - The estuaries of Texas are lagoons that lie in a climatic gradient in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Estuaries located in the northeastern part of the Texas coast receive more rainfall than estuaries in the southwestern part, and consequently greater runoff and concomitant freshwater inflow. Extreme inter-annual variability of precipitation caused by El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events is another characteristic of the Texas coast. During El Nino periods, salinities in Texas estuaries decrease because of increased precipitation and increased freshwater inflow to the coast. During La Nina periods, salinities increase due to drier climatic conditions and reduced freshwater inflow. The combination of the climatic gradient and temporal variability of freshwater inflow drive changes in the frequency, timing, duration, and magnitude of river flows to coastal waters, which in turn control the salinity, nutrients, organic matter, and sediments in Texas estuaries. Chlorophyll biomass, as an indicator of primary production, was estimated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from July 2002 to December 2011 for all Texas estuaries. The climate patterns in the Pacific Ocean delivers a cascading signal via freshwater inflow changes to estuaries that effects primary production subsequently. The maximum correlation was found at the 5th lag (month) with correlation coefficient (rho) being 0.45 (NINO3.4 is fixed as a reference). The combination of the local climatic gradient and quasi-periodic natural variability in ENSO has been influencing estuarine ecosystem dynamics over decadal scales in this region. The present study demonstrates that freshwater inflow is an important driver in maintaining primary productivity of Texas estuaries, which is required to maintain estuarine health and sustainability.

AB  - For centuries, Fennoscandian wooded meadows and woodland pastures (Habitats Directive habitat types *6530 and 9070 respectively) covered large areas of Northern Europe. In the Twentieth Century, abandonment-driven encroachment has led to the wooded grasslands changing into what may be considered as old-growth deciduous forests. The present paper examined whether the present stand structure and the composition of three contrasting functional groups (herbaceous layer vascular plants, epiphytic bryophytes, and earthworms) could serve as indicators of the historic origin of the forest patches, i.e. to what extent changes in ecological conditions in overgrown woodlands have shifted towards broad-leaved forests with ancient trees. Indicators were tested for the objective of restoration planning of habitat quality, i.e. whether semi-open woodlands could be restored or if it would be more appropriate to preserve them as broad-leaved forests. The study was carried out by comparing the composition of ancient forest cores, forest edges and overgrown wooded grasslands. The land use history of sample sites was examined from historical topographical maps and aerial photos.
   The results showed that as long as 60 years after abandonment, parts of the studied forests still retained some light-demanding plant species characteristic of historical wooded grasslands. The composition of earthworm communities was similar in all of the studied historical forest groups. Only some of the stand structure characteristics and epiphytic mosses indicated that there were differences between ancient forest cores and overgrown wooded grasslands. We conclude that the combination of various functional indicators should be used in the evaluation of successional woodlands for habitat restoration. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climatic niche models based on native-range climatic data accurately predict invasive-range distributions in the majority of species. However, these models often do not account for ecological and evolutionary processes, which limit the ability to predict future range expansion. This might be particularly problematic in the case of invaders that occupy environments that would be considered marginal relative to the climatic niche in the native range of the species. Here, we assess the potential for future range expansion in the shrub Chromolaena odorata that is currently invading mesic savannas (>650 mm MAP) in South Africa that are colder and drier than most habitats in its native range. In a greenhouse experiment we tested whether its current distribution in South Africa can be explained by increased competitive ability and/or differentiation in drought tolerance relative to the native population. We compared aboveground biomass, biomass allocation, water use efficiency and relative yields of native and invasive C. odorata and the resident grass Panicum maximum in wet and dry conditions. Surprisingly, we found little differentiation between ranges. Invasive C. odorata showed no increased competitive ability or superior drought tolerance compared to native C. odorata. Moreover we found that P. maximum was a better competitor than either native or invasive C. odorata. These results imply that C. odorata is unlikely to expand its future range towards more extreme, drier, habitats beyond the limits of its current climatic niche and that the species' invasiveness most likely depends on superior light interception when temporarily released from competition by disturbance. Our study highlights the fact that species can successfully invade habitats that are at the extreme end of their ranges and thereby contributes towards a better understanding of range expansion during species invasions.

AB  - To compare the performance of two common methods for surveying boreal lake aquatic macrophyte communities (the transect survey and the phytolittoral inventory) in lake bioassessment, we studied five small humic lakes with both methods. In addition to this pairwise comparison, we contrasted available independent sets of reference lake data of either methodological origin. Specifically, we compared the observed species richness and a number of ecological quality (community) metrics and their variability both between the methods and within them in relation to sampling effort and operator. With the phytolittoral inventory, more taxa (mean 38.8 +/- s.d. 12.1) were observed than with transect survey (29.8 +/- 6.5) in a shorter time. Ecological quality metrics relying on taxonomic composition were sensitive to variation both between (reference lake data: t-test, p < 0.001) and within methods (metric values varied with sample size), whereas a trophy-specific metric based on indicator species was more robust in this respect (ref. lakes: t-test, p = 0.788; minor variation with sample size). The two methods did not differ in among-observer variation (CV of community metrics 5.0-8.7), which was, as indicated by an NMDS ordination, relatively low compared to among-lake variation. Overall, the results highlight the importance of establishing reference conditions using unified methods, which are also consistent with those used in the macrophyte-based ecological assessments. Even though the more cost efficient phytolittoral inventory method is more suitable for biodiversity surveys focusing on the overall species richness and rare species, we suggest that the transect survey better meets the requirements of ecological status assessment, as it produces information also on the zonation of the littoral vegetation.

AB  - The stable hydrogen isotopic compositions (delta D) of selected aliphatic hydrocarbons (n-alkanes and isoprenoids) in eight crude oils of similar source and thermal maturity from the Upper Indus Basin (Pakistan) were measured. The oils are derived from a source rock deposited in a shallow marine environment. The low level of biodegradation under natural reservoir conditions was established on the basis of biomarker and aromatic hydrocarbon distributions. A plot of pristane/n-C-17 alkane (Pr/n-C-17) and/or phytane/n-C-18 alkane (Ph/n-C-18) ratios against American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity shows an inverse correlation. High Pr/n-C-17 and Ph/n-C-18 values and low API gravity values in some of the oils are consistent with relatively low levels of biodegradation. For the same oils, delta D values for the n-alkanes relative to the isoprenoids are enriched in deuterium (D). The data are consistent with the removal of D-depleted low molecular weight (LMW) n-alkanes (C-14-C-22) from the oils. The delta D values of isoprenoids do not change with progressive biodegradation and are similar for all the samples. The average D enrichment for n-alkanes with respect to the isoprenoids is found to be as much as 35 parts per thousand for the most biodegraded sample. For example, the moderately biodegraded oils show an unresolved complex Mixture (UCM), loss of LMW n-alkanes (<C-15) and moderate changes in the alkyl naphthalene distributions. The relative susceptibility of alkyl naphthalenes at low levels of biodegradation is discussed. The alkyl naphthalene biodegradation ratios were determined to assess the effect of biodegradation. The dimethyl, trimethyl and tetramethyl naphthalene biodegradation ratios show significant differences with increasing extent of biodegradation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - New chemicals are being added each year to the existing burden of toxic substances in the environment. This has led to increased pollution of ecosystems as well as deterioration of the air, water, and soil quality. Excessive agricultural and industrial activities adversely affect biodiversity, threatening the survival of species in a particular habitat as well as posing disease risks to humans. Some of the chemicals, e.g., pesticides and heavy metals, may be genotoxic to the sentinel species and/or to non-target species, causing deleterious effects in somatic or germ cells. Test systems which help in hazard prediction and risk assessment are important to assess the genotoxic potential of chemicals before their release into the environment or commercial use as well as DNA damage in flora and fauna affected by contaminated/polluted habitats. The Comet assay has been widely accepted as a simple, sensitive, and rapid tool for assessing DNA damage and repair in individual eukaryotic as well as some prokaryotic cells, and has increasingly found application in diverse fields ranging from genetic toxicology to human epidemiology. This review is an attempt to comprehensively encase the use of Comet assay in different models from bacteria to man, employing diverse cell types to assess the DNA-damaging potential of chemicals and/or environmental conditions. Sentinel species are the first to be affected by adverse changes in their environment. Determination of DNA damage using the Comet assay in these indicator organisms would thus provide information about the genotoxic potential of their habitat at an early stage. This would allow for intervention strategies to be implemented for prevention or reduction of deleterious health effects in the sentinel species as well as in humans.

AB  - Animal population dynamics in open systems are affected not only by agents of mortality and the influence of species interactions on behavior and life histories, but also by dispersal and recruitment. We used an extensive data set to compare natural loss rates of two mayfly species that co-occur in high-elevation streams varying in predation risk, and experience different abiotic conditions during larval development. Our goals were to generate hypotheses relating predation to variation in prey population dynamics and to evaluate alternative mechanisms to explain such variation. While neither loss rates nor abundance of the species that develops during snowmelt (Baetis bicaudatus) varied systematically with fish, loss rates of the species that develops during baseflow (Baetis B) were higher in streams containing brook trout than streams without fish; and surprisingly, larvae of this species were most abundant in trout streams. This counter-intuitive pattern could not be explained by a trophic cascade, because densities of intermediate predators (stoneflies) did not differ between fish and fishless streams and predation by trout on stoneflies was negligible. A statistical model estimated that higher recruitment and accelerated development enables Baetis B to maintain larger populations in trout streams despite higher mortality from predation. Experimental estimates suggested that predation by trout potentially accounts for natural losses of Baetis B, but not Baetis bicaudatus. Predation by stoneflies on Baetis is negligible in fish streams, but could make an important contribution to observed losses of both species in fishless streams. Non-predatory sources of loss were higher for B. bicaudatus in trout streams, and for Baetis B in fishless streams. We conclude that predation alone cannot explain variation in population dynamics of either species; and the relative importance of predation is species-and environment-specific compared to non-predatory losses, such as other agents of mortality and non-consumptive effects of predators.

AB  - The macroinvertebrate fauna of the river Nent, a heavy metal polluted Upland stream in northern England, first surveyed in 1976, was re-examined in 2004 to assess long-term changes in relation to activities in the catchment which have included, a river restoration project, works associated with the development of a mine heritage site and the removal of a chicken farm and more effective organic pollution control measures. The degree of change between years in total abundance, numbers of taxa and community composition varied considerably between sites. Two tributary sites showed marked changes between years due to a reduction in acidity in one and changed substratum in the other but in the main river no significant difference in total taxa and total abundance was observed between years, although seasonal differences were significant. Multivariate community analyses grouped 1976 samples with those taken in 2004 but revealed a clear separation between upper and lower Nent sites. This observed difference may be related to increased algal cover in the lower sites in conjunction with geomorphological features of the lower Nent. Environmental assessment methodology River Invertebrate Prediction and Classification System (RIVPACS) identified 'sensitive' faunal groups and indicated that the extensive impact of zinc pollution in the main river has remained practically the same between 1976 and 2004. This persistence of community structure despite the heavily disturbed nature of the river is attributed to relative constancy in instream habitat conditions. The recent activities in the catchment have had little effect on the overall controllers of faunal communities in this system, zinc concentrations and geomorphological characteristics of the stream. However, further disturbances involving movement of spoil heaps and channel alterations in the upper catchment may increase both sediment and heavy metal loadings to the river.

AB  - Under the EU Directive 2004/28/EC, an environmental risk assessment of new veterinary medicinal products is required. Given the nature of risk assessment for new applications, there is a need to model exposure concentrations. Critical evaluations are essential to ensure that the use of models by regulators does not result in the propagation of misleading information. The empirical validations of soil exposure models, previously discussed in this journal, indicate that it is impossible to analyse the contribution of every model parameter to the variability in the predictions. In particular, the prediction of the slurry concentration is challenged by uncertainties concerning dilution, mixing and dissipation of residues. Surface water and groundwater models generated highly deviating results compared to the field results, questioning the usefulness of the available screening models. Animal husbandry, slurry handling and environmental conditions throughout Europe are considered in order to define realistic worst case scenarios, to be used in conjunction with distribution models for the environmental risk assessment of veterinary medicinal products at registration. Given the variability in manure management practice throughout Europe, a deterministic approach for the manure-to-soil model was selected. Both worst case and best case scenario were developed. Several modelling assumptions applied in the surface water exposure model for fish nursery effluent were validated against newly available data. Since the available data give no proof that a settling tank contributes to the removal of pesticides from waste water, it is recommended for risk assessment purposes to consider the contribution of the settling tank to removal of pesticides and medicines to be negligible. Surface water dilution factors may be considered to be rather small, a factor of 2, for low flow situations. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A region of distinct oceanographic features that result from the meeting of several water masses is marked by Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, between the Middle Atlantic Eight (MAB) and South Atlantic Eight (SAB). The features are dynamic, corresponding, in part, to the degree of water exchange between the MAB and SAB. The extent of larval fish transport via these features could have implications to fish population genetics, year-class structure, zoogeography, and access to nursery habitat. As a step in the examination of larval exchange between the MAB and SAB, we studied the association of spring larval fish assemblages with environmental variables descriptive of the water mass origins. The region was clearly an oceanographic and ichthyoplankton faunal transition zone. Larval distribution corresponded to patterns of adult distributions along the entire eastern seaboard. High taxa-environment correlations described a boundary assemblage strongly influenced by oceanographic conditions. Net assemblages from mixed waters were dominated by taxa with widespread adult distributions (e. g. Peprilus triacanthus, synodontidae, triglidae, clupiedae, others) rather than a mix of taxa from other groups. MAB water contained Limanda ferruginea and Benthosema glaciale in deep, cold water and Glyptocephalus cynoglossus, Hippoglossina oblonga, Scomber scombrus, Lophius americanus, and others in shallow, warmer, less saline water. High densities of numerous sub-tropical species, (e.g. Xyrichtys novacula, Bothus spp.) and low densities of many others were found in SAB waters but varied greatly in distribution with depth. Taxa varied in their fidelity to environmental indicators, thereby allowing for insight into the nature of the apparent differential permeability of this boundary zone to various species and into the precision of future predictions regarding transport related recruitment success.

AB  - The mink (Mustela vison) is a top trophic level species that readily bioaccumulates environmental pollutants and is considered to be a sensitive indicator of ecosystem health. Spatial trends in levels of organochlorine and heavy metal contaminant burdens were determined from 1991 to 1995 for wild mink from western Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada. Tissue samples from 207 mink from seven communities were analyzed for residues of 63 organochlorines and 10 heavy metals. All groups of organochlorines were detected in mink livers at relatively low levels; maximum community means were 9.52 ng/g Sigma DDT and 73.07 ng/g Sigma PCB (sum of 43 congeners). There was a general trend of decreasing organochlorine burdens along a northerly or westerly gradient for some groups of compounds, primarily Sigma DDT, Sigma PCB, Sigma chlordane and dieldrin. Toxic equivalents (TEQs) of mink liver tissue were low, with the maximum community mean of 0.28 pg/g wet weight (5.5 pg/g lipid weight). Levels of heavy metal burdens in liver and kidney tissues were found to be relatively low, with the exception of Hg, which was found at moderate levels. There was no obvious geographic trend to the pattern of heavy metal burdens. The available evidence suggests that long-range atmospheric transport is the main source of the organochlorine contaminants observed. Local conditions (geology, water and soil chemistry, diet, etc.) may determine heavy metal burdens. Levels of contaminants in NWT mink appear to be one to two orders of magnitude lower than levels observed to cause reproductive impairment, reduced survival of kits, or lethality in adult mink. In the western NWT mink may be the best indicator to assess trends in environmental contaminants and ecosystem health; periodic monitoring is recommended.

AB  - Factorial enrichment experiments with nitrate-N, phosphate-P and selenite-Se, were conducted in situ, with natural phytoplankton assemblages, during two consecutive spring-bloom periods (1983 and 1984) in Lake Erken, Sweden. Nutrient conditions, biomass indicators and algal physiological status, in experiments and in lake water, were compared. Characteristic peaks of phytoplankton, dominated by diatoms, developed in the lake in both years. In 1984, chlorophyll alpha biomass (30 mug l-1) reached almost twice that of 1983 (17 mug l-1). Inorganic P resources were depleted in both years, but inorganic N was exhausted only in 1984. In 1983, Stephanodiscus hantzschii GRUN v. pusillus GRUN. KRIEGER completely dominated the biomass peak. In 1984, Melosira islandica v. helvetica O. MULL occurred in great numbers along with S. hantzschii v. pusillus. The growth rate of S. hantzschii v. pusillus, surplus phosphorus dynamics and potential alkaline phosphatase activity were different during the two spring periods. In the experiments, eight alternative nutrient situations were tested during four phases of the natural phytoplankton development. The algae responded to enrichments during the entire phytoplankton bloom in 1983 and 1984. Nutrient interactions were important, especially in 1983, and occurred most frequently during the late exponential phase, biomass maximum and declining phase in both years. Interactions between N and P were most common in 1983, occurring during the late exponential phase and biomass maximum. N and Se interaction occurred occasionally. Interactions between P and Se were more frequent in 1983 than in 1984. When nutrients interacted, the combined effect was generally smaller than the sum of their individual effects. P deficiency indicators and the experiments showed clearly that the bloom of 1983 was P limited. In 1984 no such clear pattern was found.

AB  - Aim Geo-referenced species occurrence records are a prime example of biodiversity data and a cornerstone of biodiversity research. Yet, their availability depends on non-biological factors, including the political framework in the region of collection. Here we present Bio-Dem (), an open-source software to explore the relationship between the availability of species occurrence records and the political framework in countries worldwide and through time. Location Global. Taxon Any. Methods Bio-Dem accesses the number of occurrence records available from countries worldwide from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility () and socio-political information from these countries from the Varieties of Democracy database () as well as information on colonial history from the Issue Correlates of War Project. Results Bio-Dem is available as a free graphical user interface web application at . Through three interactive graphs, Bio-Dem enables users to explore the relationship between species occurrence records and countries' regime type, freedom of movement, freedom of association, gross domestic product, education length, political corruption, armed conflict and colonial history. We describe possible links of these specific political indicators with the collection and mobilization of biodiversity data. Illustrative examples and video tutorials explaining the use of Bio-Dem are available at . Main conclusions Bio-Dem provides a user-friendly way to explore the link between socio-political variables and the availability of species occurrence records in user-selected taxa and geographic regions, and to generate hypotheses on their connection. We envision Bio-Dem as a useful tool for teachers communicating the caveats of available biodiversity data, for biodiversity scientists exploring potential spatial and temporal bias in their data, and for social scientists exploring the impact of political systems on scientific data collection and biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Mountainous sites can only grow a limited variety of vegetation types due to their fragile soil conditions. In the north of Iran, mountainous sites are commonly occupied by Crataegus and Berberis shrubs, which are natively distributed in Asia, Europe, North America and Africa. Despite the widespread distribution of these two species, the effect of pure and mixed canopy composition of these species on soil fertility and microbial activities (as soil function indicators) has not been considered. In this paper, five types of canopy composition have been studied for their effect on soil function; including pure Crataegus (PC), and pure Berberis (PB), as well as mixed Crataegus and Berberis with almost equal canopy cover (50C:50B), Crataegus-dominated stand (70C:30B), and Berberis-dominated stand (30C:70B). A total of 225 soil samples (5 plant types x 15 samples x 3 soil depths including 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm belowground) were taken from the field, transferred to the laboratory and analyzed. PCA results showed a difference in the soil characteristics between the canopy composition types, with the first and second axes justifying 46.67% and 14.12% of the total variance, respectively. The 50C:50B mixed canopy composition resulted in soils with higher values of soil organic matter fractions (i.e. particulate and dissolved C and N), C and nutrient (N, P, K, Ca and Mg) pools, and soil microbial (i.e. respiration and biomass) and enzyme (urease, acid phosphatase, arylsulfatase and invertase) activities, especially in the topsoil (0-10 cm). Soil function indicators decreased in ranked order of 70C:30B > 30C:70B > PC > PB plant types. As a conclusion, it can be stated that the equal ratio of Crataegus and Berberis can enhance soil function and create fertile islands in the high altitudes of natural ecosystems.

AB  - The problem of life strategies in relation to the alteration of habitat quality remains one of the fundamental questions in ecology and evolution. Spatial analysis of community assemblage for organisms could be a useful insight to resolve this issue. An important tropical riverine ecosystem, the Ganges, has been considered for this study. The River Ganges supports a diverse fish fauna, with about 300 fish species reported for Indian waters. The emergence and maintenance of life strategy of fish are naturally regulated in response to the variation of abiotic factors in different ways. Here, we formulate a spatial model using Self Organizing map (SOM), with monthly surveys of local fisheries from nine principal landing sites along the lower stretch of the Ganges. We explored the conditions for selecting life history strategies based on prevailing abiotic factors of habitat. Parameters of water quality incur heterogeneity within a continuous habitat. It is already reported that the fishery in this area is at a stake due to over exploitation and the catch per unit effort (CPUE) is declining as an invariable outcome. Thus, an assessment of community assemblage of this area is of principal importance for managing aquatic resources in the lower Ganges. The primary goal is to test the hypothesis that fish faunal community structure and assemblage along with their life strategy can change along the gradient of water quality parameters down the stretch of lower Ganges. Data on average annual yield (total mean monthly catch) was considered for analysis. Statistical ordination revealed associations between assemblage composition and abiotic factors. Patterns of fish community composition are associated with species life-history strategies which, in turn, are influenced by their quality of habitat. Therefore, the anthology of abiotic factors, controlling the immediate habitat of organisms, has paramount role to serve as the indicators of habitat quality and life history strategies following eco-evolutionatry aspects.

AB  - The assessment of the impacts of land-use and management on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics is a major environmental concern, as the soil carbon cycle underpins key ecosystem services. However, assessments based on short-term SOC dynamics face methodological and experimental difficulties. Hurisso et al. (2016) proposed a method to assess SOC dynamics by coupling two methods: Permanganate Oxidizable Carbon (POXC) and Basal Soil Respiration (BSR). This method has been used in laboratory on dried and re-wetted soil samples from temperate regions mainly. In our study, we adapted this method to the field and proposed a cost-effective in-field indicator combining the POXC and in situ Basal Soil Respiration (SituResp (R) method).
   We tested the indicator at four study sites (n = 169 points) within various tropical land-use and management contexts based on rubber, soybean and oil palm cropping systems respectively in Thailand, Cambodia and Indonesia. The results demonstrated the relevance, sensitivity and robustness of the POXC-SituResp (R) indicator to characterize the impact of a gradient of disturbance on SOC dynamics. The results also highlighted the potential of conservation agriculture (no-tillage and crops residues) and compost amendments to accumulate SOC. Rock-Eval (R) analysis showed that POXC-SituResp (R) indicator is negatively linked to excess of potentially mineralizable labile carbon. Carbon pools targeted by the POXC were specified by Rock-Eval (R) pyrolysis measurements to be a rather thermal resistant pool of SOC.
   Our study confirms that the integrated indicator based on POXC and BSR assess a relative carbon stabilization of SOC pools. This indicator can be measured in the field by a rapid and cost-effective method.

AB  - Feeding behavior of large herbivores determines the composition of their dung and together with environmental factors the intensity of decomposition processes leading to the recycling of nutrients in tropical forests. Large herbivore dung and its decomposition has so far been characterized by stoichiometric analyses of elements such as C and N. The objective of our study was to examine the suitability of biomarker analyses and analytical pyrolysis to infer large herbivore feeding behavior and the decomposition of their dung in different environments. Our conceptual approach included exposure of fresh dung of a grazing ruminant (gaur, Bos gaurus) and a non-ruminant mixed-feeder (the Asian elephant, Elephas maximus) in two tropical forest types (dry and moist) and analysis of dung biochemical composition in two seasons (dry and wet). To this end we characterized the dungs' lignin and carbohydrate (sugar) signatures and pyrolysis products before and after 28 days of exposure.
   Our results showed that stoichiometric as well as biomarker analyses were able to differentiate gaur and elephant dung independent of season and forest type, while analytical pyrolysis products did not differ between dung types. The lignin signature of fresh dung additionally indicated the forage preference of animals in different forest types and seasons. During decomposition, C and N contents decreased and the chemical composition of both dung types converged. The lignin signature of dung at the end of the experiment showed higher lignin decomposition in moist forest and wet season than dry forest and dry season. We conclude that detailed biochemical analyses can provide deeper insights into the main controls of large herbivore dung and its decomposition in tropical forests than stoichiometric analysis. In particular lignin may be a suitable indicator to investigate large herbivore feeding behavior and the environmental conditions of their habitat.

AB  - Diapause is an adaptation that insects have evolved to synchronize their life cycle with that of seasonal climatic changes and resources availability. However, cues for its induction are not always clear and, in some cases, a maternal effect may be involved. At the population level, just a part of the individuals may exhibit diapause with important consequences in terms of winter survival. Moreover, clear indicators of diapause state are difficult to identify. Diapause induction was thus investigated in the aphid parasitoid speciesAphidius erviHaliday (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) developing in the aphidSitobion avenae(Hemiptera: Aphididae) at four crossed photothermal regimes (16 degrees C and 8 degrees C, 16:8 h L:D and 8:16 h L:D), and during 2 successive generations. We analyzed the reliability of changes in mummy color to assess for the diapausing state compared to dissections, and we measured parasitoid morphological and physiological traits. We observed that the proportion of dark brown mummies increased after one generation under low photothermal regime compared to other regimes. No diapause was recorded at 16 degrees C, 16:8 h L:D, while we observed 16.2% and 67.5% diapause incidence at 8 degrees C, 8:16 h L:D, at 1st and 2nd generation, respectively. Diapause induction is thus increased by short day-length conditions and low temperatures as well as by maternal effects. All parasitoid life-history traits (weight, size, fat content, water content, egg-load, and longevity) were affected by the photothermal regime and/or the generation. These results raise new questions on the environmental thresholds needed to induce diapause and on survival and adaptation potential of commercially available parasitoid strains in different environments.

AB  - We recorded diatom species succession over one full year (May 2017-May 2018) using automated sediment traps installed in two contrasting Greenlandic fjords: the seasonally ice-covered Young Sound in high-arctic Northeast Greenland and the nearly sea-ice free Godthabsfjord in subarctic Southwest Greenland. The traps were positioned at differing water depths (37m in Young Sound vs. 300m in Godthabsfjord). Distinct differences between the study sites were observed in both sediment and diatom fluxes. In Young Sound, total diatom flux was extremely seasonal and as high as 880 x 10(6) valves m(-2) d(-1) in the spring. In Godthabsfjord, total diatom flux was more stable throughout the year, with a maximum of 320 x 10(6) valves m(-2) d(-1) in the summer. The diatom assemblage in Young Sound was dominated by the sea-ice species Fragilariopsis oceanica, Fragilariopsis reginae-jahniae and Fossula arctica, which exhibited pulse-like deposition in the trap during and after the ice melt. In Godthabsfjord, the fluxes were dominated by Chaetoceros (resting spores), while the remaining assemblage was characterised by the cold-water indicator species Detonula confervacea (resting spores) and Thalassiosira antarctica var. borealis (resting spores) together with Fragilariopsis cylindrus. Our data show that, F. oceanica, F. reginae-jahniae and F. arctica exhibit similar seasonal behaviour and a clear link to sea ice. Fragilariopsis cylindrus seems to have a more flexible niche, and based on our study, cannot be considered an unequivocal ice indicator. Taking into account these ecological and seasonal preferences of individual diatom species is crucial when reconstructing past sea-ice conditions both qualitatively and quantitatively.

AB  - To ensure the food security of rising human population, proportionate increase in yields of staple crops like wheat takes central place. To promote sustainable wheat cropping systems having the minimum environmental hazards and the maximum economic turn outs, source and dose optimization of organic wastes for specific cultivars occupies pivotal position. This field study investigated the response of rainfed wheat cultivars (NARC-2009 and Pakistan-2013) to different fertilization regimes involving two organic materials (poultry litter and farm yard manure) applied solely (12.5 and 20 tons ha(-1) respectively) and in conjunction with reduced doses of organic manures (50% of solo application on weight basis) and chemical fertilizers (50%% of solo application on weight basis). The grain yield (Gy), biological yield (By), harvest index (Hi) and economic indicators were recorded as response variables. NARC-2009 under sole application of Cf remained unmatched in term of Gy (4.32 t ha(-1)), By (9.85 t ha(-1)) and Hi (44%). The same cultivar under binary application of poultry litter+50% fertilizers followed it with Gy of 4.08 t ha(-1), which in turn was followed by combined application of farm yard manure+50% fertilizers. The solo application of chemical fertilizers incurred the highest cost (US$ 519) and also generated the highest net earnings (US$ 560) along with the value-cost and benefit-cost ratios, while it was followed by co-application of poultry litter and reduced doses of chemical fertilizers. To conclude with, the grain yield potential of wheat cultivars differed significantly, while binary application of poultry litter and reduced doses of chemical fertilizers have the potential to yield comparatively better wheat grain yield and economic turn outs under rainfed conditions, although those were not comparable to solo application of inorganic fertilizers.

AB  - Habitat degradation is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity worldwide and the main contributor to the decline of many carnivorous plant species. For carnivorous plants in the southeastern United States, including many Pinguicula species (butterwort, Lentibulariaceae), degradation via altered fire regime has been implicated in their decline. Despite this decline, limited empirical research has been conducted examining the influence of habitat structural changes (through natural succession or human management) on reproduction and prey capture by carnivorous plants. The objectives of our study were to compare reproduction and prey capture for Pinguicula lutea (yellow butterwort) in habitats with different vegetation structures in the Florida Panhandle, where differences were largely due to management history. Pinguicula lutea is a self-compatible carnivorous plant that inhabits fire-dependent longleaf pine savannas of the southeastern United States and is threatened in the state of Florida. In 2014 and 2015, 13 sites were identified occupying three different habitat structures: maintained (intermittently mowed), grassy (dominated by Aristida stricta var. beyrichiana), and woody (encroachment by Hypericum and Ilex). Reproductive output was determined by assessing fruit set and ovule fertilization rate at each site. Additionally, prey availability and prey capture were assessed at each habitat site. In general, there were no differences in either measure of reproduction across habitat structure types. There were differences in prey abundance of Collembola, Diptera, and total arthropods both in terms of availability and capture. Total arthropod availability and prey capture were lowest in grassy sites compared to maintained habitat sites and woody habitat sites. Microclimatic conditions associated with each habitat structure and leaf morphology or physiology could explain the observed arthropod abundance and prey capture patterns. This study is the first ecological assessment of plant-insect interactions for Pinguicula species of the southeastern US and highlights the importance of habitat quality and management for this understudied group of carnivorous plants.

AB  - The present study was aimed at determining cell and tissue-level biomarkers and histopathological alterations in the green garden snail, Cantareus apertus (Born, 1778), exposed to different nominal dietary concentrations of Pb (25, 100 and 2500 mg Pb/kg), Cd (5, 10 and 100 mg Cd/Kg) and their combination (25 mg Pb + 5 mg Cd/Kg, 100 mg Pb + 10 mg Cd/Kg and 2500 mg Pb + 100 mg Cd/kg) for 1 and 8 weeks. Lead and Cd exerted histopathological effects on the digestive gland in a dose-dependent manner and related to lysosomal and tissue-level biomarkers. The biological responses observed included digestive cell vacuolisation and numerical atrophy, calcium cell hydropic degeneration, excretory cell hypertrophy, inflammatory responses, blood vessel congestion, and disruption of the blood vessel wall and the interstitial connective tissue. Lysosomal enlargement and transient intracellular accumulation of neutral lipids and lipofuscins were also observed, together with alterations in the cell type composition and thinning of the digestive gland epithelium and with diverticular distortion. This response profile fits well with the biological effects reported after metal exposure in gastropods from other regions, as well as with data obtained in parallel studies dealing with metal bioaccumulation and intralysosomal accumulation, mortality, feeding, growth, oxidative stress and neurotoxicity exerted elicited by Pb, Cd and their mixture in green garden snails under the present experimental conditions. Consequently, C. apertus seems to be a suitable model species for the biomarker-based assessment of the biological effects of Pb and Cd, alone or in combinations, thus providing a challenging opportunity to advance in identifying suitable sentinel species for metal pollution biomonitoring and ecosystem health assessment in soil ecosystems in Northern Africa.

AB  - Pigs reared in barren conditions are exposed to many different stressors, compromising their welfare and producing physiological and behavioural changes. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of environmental enrichment (EE) consisting of natural hemp ropes, sawdust, rubber balls, and a herbal compound (HC) of Valerian officinalis and Passiflora incarnata on the behaviour and performance of growing pigs. Fifty-six pigs were used to assess four different treatments divided in two pens of seven animals per treatment (14 pigs/treatment). The treatments tested were: (a) pigs reared with EE, (b) pigs supplemented with HC, (c) pigs provided with both EE and HC, and (d) control group (CG, neither EE nor HC). Body weight and lesions were measured before starting the experiments (week 15) and at 18, 20, 22 and 24 weeks of age. Weekly instantaneous scan and continuous focal sampling were used to record behavioural patterns of activity, social interactions and abnormal behaviours. Three novel tests were carried out at 16, 19 and 23 weeks of age. Body weight at the end of the experiment was found to be significantly lower for the pigs reared in the control group compared to the other treatments (p = 0.0009). Furthermore, pigs reared with EE presented less stereotypies (p = 0.016) and redirected behaviour (0.0188), but more exploratory behaviour (p = 0.008). However, pigs supplemented with HC presented less social interactions (p = 0.048), a trend to present less negative social behaviour (p = 0.09) and less skin lesions (P = 0.0433) than pigs not supplemented. Finally, no remarkable differences were reported in any of the three novel tests. Thus, both EE and HC positively influenced some animal welfare indicators and performance of growing pigs in the present experiment.

AB  - Mediterranean rivers are subjected to strong seasonality with drought during the hot season and extreme flows in autumn-winter. In particular, drought episodes and water scarcity alter the river morphology, with repercussions on primary production and the trophic chain. In this paper, we aimed at analysing the different responses in terms of chlorophyll a content of the three main photosynthetic groups composing stream periphyton, namely diatoms, cyanobacteria and green algae. This work was conducted in the Ligurian Alps (NW-Italy) on five oligotrophic streams (Argentina, Impero, Merula, Quiliano, and Vallecrosia), similar in terms of physico-chemical parameters. We measured chlorophyll a content of diatoms, cyanobacteria and green algae by means of an in situ fluorimetric probe (BenthoTorch (R)). Data were collected from April to October 2014 in: i) impacted sites, where the water scarcity was exacerbated by human pressure; ii) control sites. We applied Generalized Linear Mixed Models to investigate the response of total chlorophyll a and its relative proportions among the three algal groups in relation to the following environmental predictors: water depth, flow velocity, canopy shading, microhabitat isolation, sampling season, dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, nutrients, and macrophyte coverage. Results showed an opposite response of diatoms and green algae. Diatoms were favoured in the control sites and under moderate flow conditions, while the probability of green algae presence was higher in the impacted sites and during the drought season. Cyanobacteria showed a response similar to green algae, preferring warm, isolated pools typical of the drought period. Diatoms proved to be the most sensitive to drought. More specifically, we found out that percentages of diatoms below 51% with respect to total benthic chlorophyll a indicate high hydrological disturbance. This study provides the first evidence that the proportion of chlorophyll a produced by diatoms can be a suitable indicator for monitoring programs aiming at determining the effects of water scarcity on river ecosystems.

AB  - The interplay between a receiver's sensory system and a sender's courtship signals is fundamental to the operation of sexual selection. Male courtship signals that match a female receiver's preexisting perceptual biases can be favored yet the message they communicate is not always clear. Do they simply beacon the male's location or also indicate his quality? We explored this question in a species of fiddler crab Uca terpsichores that courts under elevated predation risk and that mates and breeds underground in the safety of males' burrows. Sexually receptive females leave their own burrows and are thereby exposed to avian predators as they sequentially approach several courting males before they choose one. Males court by waving their single greatly enlarge claw and sometimes by building a sand hood next to their burrow entrance. Hoods are attractive because they elicit a risk-reducing orientation behavior in females, and it has been suggested that claw waving may also serve primarily to orient the female to the male. If the wave communicates male quality, then females should discriminate mates on the basis of variation in elements of the wave, as has been shown for other fiddler crabs. Alternatively, variation in elements of the claw waving display may have little effect on the display's utility as a beacon of the location of the male and his burrow. We filmed courting males and females under natural conditions as females responded to claw waving and chose mates. Analysis of the fine-scale courtship elements between the males that females rejected and those they chose revealed no differences. When predation risk during courtship is high, males' courtship displays may serve primarily to guide females to safe mating and breeding sites and not as indicators of male quality apart from their roles as beacons.

AB  - Mass and body composition are indices of overall animal health and energetic balance and are often used as indicators of resource availability in the environment. This study used morphometric models and isotopic dilution techniques, two commonly used methods in the marine mammal field, to assess body composition of Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii, N = 111). Findings indicated that traditional morphometric models that use a series of circular, truncated cones to calculate marine mammal blubber volume and mass overestimated the animal's measured body mass by 26.9+/-1.5% SE. However, we developed a new morphometric model that uses elliptical truncated cones, and estimates mass with only 22.8+/-1.7% error (N = 10). Because this elliptical truncated cone model can estimate body mass without the need for additional correction factors, it has the potential to be a broadly applicable method in marine mammal species. While using elliptical truncated cones yielded significantly smaller blubber mass estimates than circular cones (10.2+/-0.8% difference; or 3.5+/-0.3% total body mass), both truncated cone models significantly underestimated total body lipid content as compared to isotopic dilution results, suggesting that animals have substantial internal lipid stores (N = 76). Multiple linear regressions were used to determine the minimum number of morphometric measurements needed to reliably estimate animal mass and body composition so that future animal handling times could be reduced. Reduced models estimated body mass and lipid mass with reasonable accuracy using fewer than five morphometric measurements (root-mean-square-error: 4.91% for body mass, 10.90% for lipid mass, and 10.43% for % lipid). This indicates that when test datasets are available to create calibration coefficients, regression models also offer a way to improve body mass and condition estimates in situations where animal handling times must be short and efficient.

AB  - We investigated the influence on bacterial community and biochemical variables through mechanical disturbance of sediment-akin to small-scale mining in Kalbadevi beach, Ratnagiri, a placer-rich beach ecosystem which is a potential mining site. Changes were investigated by comparing three periods, namely phase I before disturbance, phase II just after disturbance, and phase III 24 h after disturbance as the bacterial generation time is a parts per thousand currency sign7 h. Cores from dune, berm, high-, mid-, and low-tide were examined for changes in distribution of total bacterial abundance, total direct viability (counts under aerobic and anaerobic conditions), culturability and biochemical parameters up to 40 cm depth. Results showed that bacterial abundance decreased by an order from 10(6) cells g (-aEuro parts per thousand 1) sediment, while, viability reduced marginally. Culturability on different-strength nutrient broth increased by 155% during phase II. Changes in sedimentary proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids were marked at berm and dune and masked at other levels by tidal influence. Sedimentary ATP reduced drastically. During phase III, Pearson's correlation between these variables evolved from non-significant to significant level. Thus, simulated disturbance had a mixed effect on bacterial and biochemical variables of the sediments. It had a negative impact on bacterial abundance, viability and ATP but positive impact on culturability. Viability, culturability, and ATP could act as important indicators reflecting the disturbance in the system at short time intervals. Culturability, which improved by an order, could perhaps be a fraction that contributes to restoration of the system at bacterial level. This baseline information about the potential mining site could help in developing rational approach towards sustainable harnessing of resources with minimum damage to the ecosystem.

AB  - Integrated ecosystem assessment initiatives are important steps towards a global biodiversity observing system. Reliable earth observation data are key information for tracking biodiversity change on various scales. Regarding the establishment of standardized environmental observation systems, a key question is: What can be observed on each scale and how can land cover information be transferred? In this study, a land cover map from a dry semi-arid savanna ecosystem in Namibia was obtained based on the UN LCCS, in-situ data, and MODIS and Landsat satellite imagery. In situ botanical relev, samples were used as baseline data for the definition of a standardized LCCS legend. A standard LCCS code for savanna vegetation types is introduced. An object-oriented segmentation of Landsat imagery was used as intermediate stage for downscaling in-situ training data on a coarse MODIS resolution. MODIS time series metrics of the growing season 2004/2005 were used to classify Kalahari vegetation types using a tree-based ensemble classifier (Random Forest). The prevailing Kalahari vegetation types based on LCCS was open broadleaved deciduous shrubland with an herbaceous layer which differs from the class assignments of the global and regional land-cover maps. The separability analysis based on Bhattacharya distance measurements applied on two LCCS levels indicated a relationship of spectral mapping dependencies of annual MODIS time series features due to the thematic detail of the classification scheme. The analysis of LCCS classifiers showed an increased significance of life-form composition and soil conditions to the mapping accuracy. An overall accuracy of 92.48% was achieved. Woody plant associations proved to be most stable due to small omission and commission errors. The case study comprised a first suitability assessment of the LCCS classifier approach for a southern African savanna ecosystem.

AB  - Coral polyps host intracellular symbiotic dinoflagellates (SD). The loss of SD (referred as bleaching) under stressful environmental conditions is the main reason of coral reef destruction, and therefore, intensively studied over the world. Lipids are the structural base of biomembranes and energy reserve of corals and are directly involved in the coral bleaching. In order to establish a relationship between coral tissue morphology, physiological processes and lipidome dynamics during bleaching, the soft coral Sinularia heterospiculata was exposed to experimental heat stress (33 degrees C) for 72 h. A chlorophyll content, structure of cells, the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and molecular species of storage and structural lipids were analyzed. After 24 h of heat exposure, the level of ROS-positive SD cells did not increase, but the host tissues lost a significant part of SD. The removal of SD cells by exocytosis were suggested. Exocytosis was presumed to prevail at earlier stages of the soft coral bleaching. Symbiophagosomes with degenerative SD were observed in the stressed coral host cells. After 24 h, the content of phosphatidylinositols, which involved in apoptosis and autophagy, was significantly decreased. The innate immune response was triggered, and SD were digested by the coral host. After 48 h, a degradation of SD chloroplasts and a decrease in the specific monogalactosyldiacylglyceml molecular species were detected that confirmed a disruption of lipid biosynthesis in chloroplasts. At the end of coral bleaching, the appearance of oxidized phosphatidylethanolamines, indicating damage to the host membranes, and the degradation of the coral tissues were simultaneously observed. Thus, a switch between dominant mechanisms of the SD loss during bleaching of S. heterospiculata was found and proved by certain variations of the lipidomic profile. Lipidomic parameters may become indicators of physiological processes occurring in the symbiotic coral organism and may be used for assessing anthropogenic or natural destructive effects on coral reefs.

AB  - Anthropogenic pollution has become a major issue governing ecosystem and human health risks. The Hangzhou Bay and Qiantang Estuary region are facing unusual perturbation due to rapid development along the embayment in recent decades. This study evaluated the organic and inorganic pollutants in water, sediment, and from the muscles of higher trophic organisms (fish, crustacean, shellfish) during four different seasons (in 2018-2019) along the Qiantang Estuary and Hangzhou Bay region to assess the ecosystem health and potential hazard status. Dissolved inorganic phosphate and nitrogen were the major pollutants in this area, which led to severe eutrophication throughout the study period. Eutrophication signals coincided well with the phytoplankton abundance, which revels the control of nutrient enrichment on the spatio-temporal distribution of phytoplankton. Food availability, along with salinity and temperature, drives the zooplankton population distribution. Heavy metals were not the issue of water quality as their concentrations meet the national and international baseline standards. However, in the sediments, Copper (Cu) and Arsenic (As) concentrations were higher than the baseline value. Towards the northwestern part of the Qiantang Estuary, the overall potential risk index of sediment with higher Cadmium (Cd) and Mercury (Hg) depicted delicate condition with moderate risk for the sediment contamination. The As concentration in fishes was close to the baseline standards limit irrespective of low As values within water and sediments. The higher concentrations of Zinc (Zn) and As in shellfish muscles, whereas other metals were within the limit of baseline standard in all the organisms. However, the hazard analysis (Targeted hazard quotient, THQ) values for the seafood consumption to human health indicates the potentially threatening consequences of shellfish and crustacean consumption on human health.

AB  - The spatial heterogeneity of soil limiting resources is one of the most important factors maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem functions. There is a general concern that herbivore grazing plays a central role in modifying soil resources heterogeneity. However, most studies have examined how large herbivores as a group affect soil heterogeneity. There is limited knowledge about how assemblages of different herbivore species may influence soil heterogeneity, and whether the herbivore assemblage effects might vary with grassland types.
   Here we conducted a 4-year grazing experiment to examine the effects of different herbivore assemblages (no grazing; cattle grazing; sheep grazing; and mixed grazing of cattle and sheep) on the spatial heterogeneity of soil N availability across three types of grasslands (meadow steppe, typical steppe and desert steppe) in eastern Eurasian steppe.
   The results showed that all the herbivore grazing increased the heterogeneity of soil N availability in the three grasslands with different precipitation (only cattle grazing and mixed grazing of cattle and sheep in meadow steppe did not reach a statistically significant level). The consistently increased heterogeneity of soil N availability was primarily due to the effect of animal excreta addition, which weakened in drier grasslands, likely because of the slower excreta decomposition. Moreover, sheep excreta contributed more to soil N heterogeneity than that of other herbivore assemblages, and the effect was statistically significant in meadow steppe and typical steppe with relative high precipitation.
   Synthesis and applications. Our study indicates that sheep could have larger potential to maintain and enhance grassland heterogeneity than cattle especially in grassland ecosystems with high precipitation. We therefore suggest that managing above-ground herbivore species is important for conserving and promoting grassland soil heterogeneity, and that the management should also take into account local environmental conditions such as precipitation.

AB  - This study proposes a simple and effective method for determination of Al, Cd, Cu, Ni, and Zn in soil samples, associating ultrasound-assisted extraction and flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). Ultrasound-assisted extraction conditions were optimized using a central composite design. This method required small volumes of HCl, HNO3, and HF as an extraction solvent blend to ensure effective analyte extraction. Limits of detection and quantification were determined to assess the minimum accurate concentration of the studied elements that can be detected and quantified in a soil sample. Therefore, the ultrasound-assisted extraction was concluded as a simple and straightforward pretreatment technique to determine Al, Cd, Cu, Ni, and Zn concentrations in soil samples. Eight sites of agricultural and native forest areas of the city of Ponta Grossa and Guarapuava, State of Parana, Brazil, were evaluated for metals, and compared with the reference values for trace elements provided by the Brazilian National Environment Council. Environmental assessment of soils from those eight sites was accomplished through I-geo, EF, CF, and PLI parameters, which aimed at the evaluation of agricultural sites in comparison with adjacent natural forest sites with no history of anthropogenic mobilization to determine the degree of the contribution of anthropogenic sources to metal concentrations. According to the I-geo, EF, and CF parameters, all sites were classified as unpolluted to moderately polluted and none or minor enrichment due to anthropogenic activities were noticed. PLI parameter evaluated the concentration of all studied metals in soils to stipulate an order of contamination, which was concluded as site 8 <site 4 <site 3 <site 7 <site 2 <site 6 <site 1 <site 5 for the sites under study.

AB  - Poor storage of cereals, such as maize can lead to both nutritional losses and mycotoxin contamination. The aim of this study was to examine the respiration of maize either naturally contaminated or inoculated with Aspergillus flavus to examine whether this might be an early and sensitive indicator of aflatoxin (AF) contamination and relative storability risk. We thus examined the relationship between different interacting storage environmental conditions (0.80-0.99 water activity (a(w)) and 15-35 degrees C) in naturally contaminated and irradiated maize grain + A. flavus on relative respiration rates (R), dry matter losses (DMLs) and aflatoxin B1 and B2 (AFB1-B2) contamination. Temporal respiration and total CO2 production were analysed by GC-TCD, and results used to calculate the DMLs due to colonisation. AFs contamination was quantified at the end of the storage period by HPLC MS/MS. The highest respiration rates occurred at 0.95 a(w) and 30-35 degrees C representing between 0.5% and 18% DMLs. Optimum AFs contamination was at the same a(w) at 30 degrees C. Highest AFs contamination occurred in maize colonised only by A. flavus. A significant positive correlation between % DMLs and AFB1 contamination was obtained (r=0.866, p<0.001) in the irradiated maize treatments inoculated with A. flavus. In naturally contaminated maize + A. flavus inoculum loss of only 0.56% DML resulted in AFB1 contamination levels exceeding the EU legislative limits for food. This suggests that there is a very low threshold tolerance during storage of maize to minimise AFB1 contamination. This data can be used to develop models that can be effectively used in enhancing management for storage of maize to minimise risks of mycotoxin contamination.

AB  - Improvements in the management of Natura 2000 sites are essential to achieve the targets set out by the Habitats and Birds Directives of the European Union. A current focus is on the development of management plans, which are fundamental instruments in the implementation of conservation measures. This study explores the viability of using existing forest plans to assist in this purpose. As case study, we consider the regulatory framework of the Veneto Region, northern Italy. We collected quantitative and qualitative data on forest plans at the regional and at three sub-regional spatial scales: local, district, and biogeographical. Forest plans cover about 54% of the terrestrial area of Natura 2000 sites in Veneto, and 75% of Sites of Community Importance in the Alpine biogeographical region. At the local scale of analysis, metrics from forest plans represent a valuable historical record which can be used to interpret the current state and future trends, especially for forests with long management records. These data can be used to assess biodiversity indicators for the monitoring of Natura 2000 forest and non-forest habitat types, in compliance with Article 17 of the Habitats Directive. Moreover, the heterogeneous stand conditions which are promoted by some forest management approaches can improve the conservation efforts for some habitat types and species. The scale of local forest plans are typically the most appropriate for implementing habitat management strategies. From this study, we conclude that management authorities should take advantage of the wide spatial coverage and distribution of existing forest plans, especially in mountain areas inside and outside the Natura 2000 network, for the successful conservation of European Union habitat types and species.

AB  - Waste management is a serious challenge across many resource constrained countries of the world leading to environmental issues such as pollution and high rates of soil occupation, health issues induced by poor hygienic conditions, and financial problems linked to the high costs associated to waste management, which have high impacts on municipal budget. In this study we determined the environmental impact of different waste disposal scenarios in a major city of Pakistan. Existing studies on the subject of waste management in Pakistan fail to account for the environmental burden of waste processing technologies. To counter this, in this paper we used Emergy based accounting procedures to obtain a donor or nature based perspective for environmental foot printing. Three scenarios were considered for the analysis consisting of the current practice of open dumping as Scenario A; sanitary landfilling with composting and material recycling as Scenario B and incineration with composting and recycling as Scenario C. Results were presented in the form of Emergy based input-output tables as well as greenhouse gas emissions as measured in kg CO2 equivalent (kCO(2eq)/t) per tonne of waste. Scenario A was the worst option due to its high emissions and lack of any useful output. Scenario B was identified as the best alternative as it resulted in similar amount of net emissions as Scenario C but with relatively lower stress on the environment as indicated by the Emergy indicators. In view of the subject city's resource constraints we recommend inducing waste reduction and minimization practices through public awareness campaigns. Resource contributions from the civic society are also suggested for erecting the necessary waste disposal infrastructure. The results and suggestions presented herein need to be highlighted in a timely manner in order to resolve environmental and public health risks posed by the current practices.

AB  - The pharmaceutical products are emerging pollutants continuously released into the environment, because they cannot be effectively removed by the wastewater treatment plants. In recent years, questions have been raised concerning the environmental risks related to these pollutants. The goal of this research was to evaluate the responses in Lemna minor after 7 days and in Corbicula fluminea after differing durations (1, 3, 7, and 19 days) of exposure to the psychoactive drug mixture (valproic acid, citalopram, carbamazepine, cyamemazine, hydroxyzine, oxazepam, norfluoxetine, lorazepam, fluoxetine, and sertraline) in different concentrations (0, 0 + ethanol, drug concentration (DC) 1 = river water concentration, DC2 = effluent concentration, and DC3 = 10x effluent concentration). In this aim, growth parameters of L. minor, gluthathione S-transferase (GSTs), catalase (CAT), ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and/or gene expressions (pi-gst, cat, cytochrome P450 4 (cyp4), multidrug resistant 1 (mdr1), and superoxide dismutase (sod)) were measured. GST activities increased significantly in L. minor exposed to DC3, but no changes were found in CAT activity. In C. fluminea, EROD activity was induced significantly in both gill and digestive gland tissues after 3 days' exposure to DC3, while a GST increase was observed only in digestive gland tissues, suggesting that these pharmaceuticals induced an oxidative effect. Gene expression analysis revealed transient transcriptomic responses of cyp4, sod, and mdr1 under drug concentrations 2 or 3 and no change of expression for the other genes (cat and pi-gst) or condition (environmental drug concentration) tested. Finally, the data reported in this study represent important ecotoxicological information, confirming that this enzyme family (cyp4, sod, and mdr1) may be considered as a sensible and early indicator of exposure to drugs and emphasizing the involvement of selected genes in detoxification pathways.

AB  - The objective of the investigation was to determine the response of different taxa of mites across the land use types and demonstrate that soil mites could be used as an indicator of environmental change after the conversion of secondary forests into rubber plantations. The sampling was performed during the dry season on 12 sampling areas, consisting of four land use types: secondary forests, 7-year-old rubber plantations, 12-year-old rubber plantations, and 25-year-old rubber plantations, with three replications of each treatment. Soil cores were sampled along a 40 m transect with a steel corer. The soil mites were extracted using modified Berlese-Tullgren funnels during a 10 day period. Soil physico-chemical parameters were measured on each sampling area. The conversion of secondary forests into rubber plantations was characterized by a modification of the mean values of mite density (+103 and +262%), species richness (-11 and +32%), water content (-41 and -5%), bulk density (+6 and -3%) and soil organic carbon (-73 and -59%) respectively, after 7 and 25 years of conversion. The density of mites, species richness and soil water content increased with the aging of the rubber plantations, demonstrating an improvement in soil ecological quality and environmental conditions. These results are confirmed by the values of the Maturity Index of Gamasid mites. which increased with the increasing age of rubber plantations. In other words, the severity of environmental impact decreased with the aging of the rubber plantations and was ranked as follows: 25-year-old rubber plantations < secondary forest < 12-year-old rubber plantations < 7-year-old rubber plantations. The Maturity Indexes estimated that 25-year-old rubber plantations (0.84) and in secondary forests (0.74) are relatively similar and characterize stable habitats, which are potentially dominated by Gamasid species with K selection.

AB  - Among soil processes governing the clay size fraction distribution with depth, illuviation is not only widespread but also particularly poorly understood. Using a micromorphological approach, this study aims at i) quantifying the intensity of illuviation independently of all other competing soil processes, ii) testing the sensitivity of illuviation to different land uses, and iii) assessing the relative contribution of illuviation to the genesis of textural differentiation. Two Luvisols developed from loess in Northern France were selected: the first under a deciduous forest and the second under conventional agricultural management, both with no change in land use for at least 100 years. In addition to classical mass balance calculations, clay illuviation features such as limpid and dusty clay coatings were used as diagnostic features of the illuviation process and were quantified by a point-counting approach in large thin sections. In the two Luvisols under study illuviation was found to be responsible for 75% and 86% of the textural contrast, respectively in the cultivated soil and the forested one. Illuviation was thus by far the dominant factor causing textural differentiation, even if accessory processes involving the clay size fraction were also at play such as lithological discontinuity, clay neoformation or biological and physical reworking. The recognition of dusty clay coatings considered as an indicator of cultivation in the soil under forest underlines the sensitivity of illuviation to past periods of cultivation and the legacy of anthropedogenesis on the present soil properties. A qualitative change in the nature of the translocated particles without significant changes in the intensity of illuviation was identified in the soil under cultivation in comparison with the soil under forest. These results support the conclusion that illuviation is an active process in soils under present climatic conditions and must no more be considered as a fossil soil process. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction: Longitudinal studies on the evolution of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms are limited and have primarily used repeated measurements performed several months apart. However, measurements of changes in everyday life should more closely reflect the 'real life' of the patient and his or her family. We propose to study the child's ASD symptoms and their effect on the quality of life, psychological status and anxiety of the child's parents over a 6-month period using SMARTAUTISM, a smartphone application.
   Method and analysis: This is a prospective, longitudinal, exploratory, open study with a 6-month follow-up period. Data will be recorded longitudinally over multiple weeks under natural conditions. The factors affecting the quality of life and anxiety of parents of children with ASD and the children's functional symptoms will be examined, and the feasibility of using a smartphone application designed for parents of ASD patients will be assessed. Primary objective: Explore the evolution of a child's behaviour over 6 months and the (psychological and social) effects of these changes on the family. Secondary objective: Assess the feasibility of our application by examining the filling rate and application usage by parents for 6 months. 100 families containing 1 child diagnosed with ASD will be included. At baseline, sociodemographic, psychiatric and medical data will be recorded. The correlations of the general epidemiological variables (primary outcome measure) will be evaluated via multivariate analysis. The application filling rate (relative to the ideal filling rate) will be used to assess the feasibility of the application (secondary outcome measure).
   Ethics and dissemination: The SMARTAUTISM study has the approval of the local ethics committee, and data security will be ensured via the use of encryption and a secure medical server. The use of this application will be proposed at autism resource centres across France.

AB  - Music listening is associated with both pain- and stress-reducing effects. However, the effects of music listening in daily life remain understudied, and the psycho-biological mechanisms underlying the health-beneficial effect of music listening remain unknown. We examined the effects of music listening on pain and stress in daily life in a sample of women with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS; i.e., a condition characterized by chronic pain) and investigated whether a potentially pain-reducing effect of music listening was mediated by biological stress-responsive systems. Thirty women (mean age: 50.7 9.9 years) with FMS were examined using an ecological momentary assessment design. Participants rated their current pain intensity, perceived control over pain, perceived stress level, and music listening behavior five times per day for 14 consecutive days. At each assessment, participants provided a saliva sample for the later analysis of cortisol and alpha-amylase as biomarkers of stress-responsive systems. Hierarchical linear modeling revealed that music listening increased perceived control over pain, especially when the music was positive in valence and when it was listened to for the reason of 'activation' or 'relaxation'. In contrast, no effects on perceived pain intensity were observed. The effects of music listening on perceived control over pain were not mediated by biomarkers of stress-responsive systems. Music listening in daily life improved perceived control over pain in female FMS patients. Clinicians using music therapy should become aware of the potential adjuvant role of music listening in daily life, which has the potential to improve symptom control in chronic pain patients. In order to study the role of underlying biological mechanisms, it might be necessary to use more intensive engagement with music (i.e., collective singing or music-making) rather than mere music listening.

AB  - Permanent pastures, which include sown, native and naturalised pastures, account for 4.3Mha (56%) of the national land use in Australia. Given their extent, pastures are of great interest with respect to their potential to influence national carbon (C) budgets and CO2 mitigation. Increasing soil organic C (SOC) mitigates greenhouse gases while providing other benefits such as pasture productivity, soil health and ecosystem services. Several management approaches have been recommended to increase C sequestration in pasture-based systems; however, results have proved variable and often contradictory between sites and years. Here, we present an overview of the processes and mechanisms responsible for C sequestration in permanent pastures. In addition, we discuss the merits of traditional and emerging pasture-management practices for increasing SOC in pastures, with a focus on dryland pasture systems of south-eastern Australia. We conclude by summarising the knowledge gaps and research priorities for soil C-sequestration research in dryland pastures. Our review confirms that soils under a range of pasture types have considerable potential for sequestration of atmospheric CO2 in Australia, and that the magnitude of this potential can be greatly modified by pasture-management practices. Although the shortage of long-term studies under Australian conditions limits our ability to predict the potential of various management approaches to sequester soil C, our review indicates that prevention of erosion through maintenance of groundcover and adoption of options that promote deep C sequestration are likely to confer broad-scale maintenance or increases in SOC in pasture soils over a decade or longer. We acknowledge that the evidence is limited; therefore, confidence in the recommended practices in different locations and climates is largely unknown.

AB  - Time sequence of the JZ-2010 profile derived from AMS(14)C dating and the content of the sediment elements Ti, Rb and Sr, the Rb/Sr values as well as the granularity and the magnetic susceptibility are utilized to reconstruct the environmental humidity changes in the Jianghan Plain since 12,700 cal. BP. The comprehensive analyses of multiple alternative indicators indicate that the regional moisture turned from relatively dry to wet after the Late-Glacial period and reached its optimum until the mid-Holocene. However, the trend was punctuated by several decreased humidity phases. Beginning with the severe dry event approximately 4400-4100 cal. BP, the environment was dry as a whole, with modest humidity from approximately 3900 cal. BP. Humidity changes in the study area are dominated by the East Asian monsoon system, which is under the influence of the gradual southward migration of the ITCZ, driven by the summer solar insolation changes in the Northern Hemisphere due to orbital forcing. As the first attempt to apply Rb/Sr value and Ti concentration in tracing moisture evolution in a region with typical subtropical humid climate, this study highlights the different effects and consequences of the proxies throughout the palaeoenvironmental change process, and the impacts of regional topography that sustained tectonic subsidence since the Cretaceous as well as the southeast tilt that opened the plain to the summer monsoon. Moreover, the fluctuation of magnetic susceptibility is associated with the granularity feature, the reduction-oxidation conditions, and the impact of human factors on the natural sedimentary environments during the historic period in the Jianghan Plain.

AB  - This paper synthesizes available information on five Category A pathogens (Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, Variola major and Lassa) to develop quantitative guidelines for how environmental pathogen concentrations may be related to human health risk in an indoor environment. An integrated model of environmental transport and human health exposure to biological pathogens is constructed which 1) includes the effects of environmental attenuation, 2) considers fomite contact exposure as well as inhalational exposure, and 3) includes an uncertainty analysis to identify key input uncertainties, which may inform future research directions. The findings provide a framework for developing the many different environmental standards that are needed for making risk-informed response decisions, such as when prophylactic antibiotics should be distributed, and whether or not a contaminated area should be cleaned up. The approach is based on the assumption of uniform mixing in environmental compartments and is thus applicable to areas sufficiently removed in time and space from the initial release that mixing has produced relatively uniform concentrations. Results indicate that when pathogens are released into the air, risk from inhalation is the main component of the overall risk, while risk from ingestion (dermal contact for B. anthracis) is the main component of the overall risk when pathogens are present on surfaces. Concentrations sampled from untracked floor, walls and the filter of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system are proposed as indicators of previous exposure risk, while samples taken from touched surfaces are proposed as indicators of future risk if the building is reoccupied. A Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis is conducted and input-output correlations used to identify important parameter uncertainties. An approach is proposed for integrating these quantitative assessments of parameter uncertainty with broader, qualitative considerations to identify future research priorities.

AB  - As the global demand for food continues to increase, the displacement of food production by using agricultural land for carbon mitigation, via either carbon sequestration, bioenergy or biofuel is a concern. An alternative approach is to target abandoned salinized farmland for mitigation purposes. Australia, for example, has 17 million ha of farmland that is already or could become saline. At a representative, salinized, low rainfall (350mmyr-1) site at Wickepin, Western Australia, we demonstrate that afforestation can mitigate carbon emissions through either providing a feedstock for bioenergy or second generation biofuel production and produce salt-tolerant fodder for livestock. A range of factors markedly affect this mitigation. These include hydrological conditions such as salinity, site factors such as slope position and soil properties and a range of silvicultural factors such as species, planting density and age of the planting. High density (2000stemsha-1) plantings of Eucalyptus occidentalis Endl. produced a mean total biomass of 4.6tha-1yr-1 (8.5t CO2-e ha-1yr-1) averaged over 8years. Atriplex nummularia Lindl. produced a mean total biomass of 3.8tha-1yr-1 (6.9t CO2-e ha-1yr-1) averaged over 4years and approximately 1.9tha-1yr-1 of edible dry matter annually to 8years of age. With differences in salt tolerance between E. occidentalis and A. nummularia, we propose an integrated approach to treating salinized sites that takes salinity gradients into account, replicates natural wetland ecosystems and produces both fodder and biomass. Continued mitigation is expected as the stands mature, assuming that growth is not affected by the accumulation of salt in the soil profile. Such carbon mitigation could potentially be applied to salinized farmland globally, and this could thus represent a major contribution to global carbon mitigation without competing with food production.

AB  - The impacts of watershed urbanization on streams have been studied worldwide, but are rare in China. We examined relationships among watershed land uses and stream physicochemical and biological attributes, impacts of urbanization on overall stream conditions, and the response pattern of macroinvertebrate assemblage metrics to the percent of impervious area (PIA) of watersheds in the middle section of the Qiantang River, Zhejiang Province, China. Environmental variables and benthic macroinvertebrates of 60 stream sites with varied levels of watershed urban land use were sampled in April, 2010. Spearman correlation analysis showed watershed urbanization levels significantly correlated with increased stream depth, width, and values of conductivity, total nitrogen, ammonia, phosphate, calcium, magnesium, and chemical oxygen demand for the study streams. There was significant difference in total taxa richness, Empheroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) taxa richness, and Diptera taxa richness, percentages of individual abundances of EPT, Chironomidae, shredders, filterers, and scrapers, and Shannon-Wiener diversity index between reference streams and urban impacted streams. In contrast, percentages of individual abundances for collectors, oligochaeta, and tolerant taxa, and biotic index were significantly higher in urban impacted than reference streams. All the above metrics were significantly correlated with PIA. The response patterns of total taxa richness, EPT taxa richness, and Shannon-Wiener diversity index followed a drastic decrease at thresholds of 3.6, 3.7, and 5.5% of PIA, respectively. Our findings indicate that stream benthic macroinvertebrate metrics are effective indicators of impacts of watershed urban development, and the PIA-imperviousness thresholds we identified could potentially be used for setting benchmarks for watershed development planning and for prioritizing high valued stream systems for protection and rehabilitation.

AB  - Background and Aims Green roofs are constructed ecosystems where plants perform valuable services, ameliorating the urban environment through roof temperature reductions and stormwater interception. Plant species differ in functional characteristics that alter ecosystem properties. Plant performance research on extensive green roofs has so far indicated that species adapted to dry conditions perform optimally. However, in moist, humid climates, species typical of wetter soils might have advantages over dryland species. In this study, survival, growth and the performance of thermal and stormwater capture functions of three pairs of dryland and wetland plant species were quantified using an extensive modular green roof system.
   Methods Seedlings of all six species were germinated in a greenhouse and planted into green roof modules with 6 cm of growing medium. There were 34 treatments consisting of each species in monoculture and all combinations of wet-and dryland species in a randomized block design. Performance measures were survival, vegetation cover and roof surface temperature recorded for each module over two growing seasons, water loss (an estimate of evapotranspiration) in 2007, and albedo and water capture in 2008.
   Key Results Over two seasons, dryland plants performed better than wetland plants, and increasing the number of dryland species in mixtures tended to improve functioning, although there was no clear effect of species or habitat group diversity. All species had survival rates > 75% after the first winter; however, dryland species had much greater cover, an important indicator of green roof performance. Sibbaldiopsis tridentata was the top performing species in monoculture, and was included in the best treatments.
   Conclusions Although dryland species outperformed wetland species, planting extensive green roofs with both groups decreased performance only slightly, while increasing diversity and possibly habitat value. This study provides further evidence that plant composition and diversity can influence green roof functions.

AB  - An increased trend towards the construction of biogas plants can be observed in Germany since the entry into force of the Renewable Energies Act (EEG) in 2000 and, in particular, since its amendment in 2004. Consequently, the acreage of maize for co-digestion with slurry or mono-digestion has been expanded which is mainly due to its high methane yields per hectare and the easy mechanisability and storability of maize silage. The objective of this contribution was to review and critically assess the state-of-the-art in agronomic research on maize grown for use in biogas plants and to indicate the potential need for research. Many problems that are still unresolved are pointed out in the fields of harvest time optimization, methods for estimating the methane yield, breeding, assessment of energy maize production with respect to C and N flows at system level and ecological assessment. To date, for instance, no systematic, multi-annual experiments are available which allow a substantiated derivation of the optimal development stage for maximizing methane yield or a quantification of the impact of biogas slurry application on N loss potential. The authors identify potential conflicts between energy maize production and cross-compliance standards, in particular, with regard to the Fertilizer Ordinance and the obligation to maintain all agricultural land in good agricultural and ecological condition. Furthermore, the contribution addresses reservations about an increase of energy maize production from the perspective of nature conservation. The study draws the conclusion that an application of suitable models might facilitate the assessment of energy maize production at field, farm, and regional levels.

AB  - In many successional series, grass species play an important role in mid-successional stages. Using calcareous sand ecosystems in the northern upper Rhine valley (Germany) as a model, we analyzed successional trajectories and the factors that determine their direction. A 5- to 7-year study of 23 permanent plots is presented. Polar ordination revealed that succession starts with pioneer communities (dominated by Corynephorus canescens and cryptogams) and can eventually lead to relatively stable Calamagrostis epigejos or Stipa capillata tall grass stands. At some sites, Cynodon dactylon can play a major role, but we focused on the two previously mentioned species. Gradient analyses of their ecological amplitudes by means of principal components and regression analysis were carried out in order to elucidate the factors determining the successional trajectories. Soil analyses of 71 plots established significantly positive linear relations for C epigejos with respect to total nitrogen, extractable phosphate and potassium, as well as soil moisture indicator values. C epigejos is not able to spread if the stress factors nutrient deficiency and dryness are combined. Lower tolerance limits are presented. In contrast, S. capillata shows negative relations to phosphate, declining strongly at P contents > 20 mg kg(-1). At a moisture indicator value of around 3.2 (indicating dry sites), S. capillata reaches its optimum. S. capillata is a model for a tall grass species which, even with low nutrient levels and dry soil conditions, can be successful in mid-successional phases; but it is displaced by C epigejos if soil moisture increases or phosphate/potassium supply is higher. Regarding a general framework, the successional phases are characterized by processes such as replacement of species, facilitation, and inhibition.

AB  - 1. We quantified the relationships between diatom relative abundance and water conductivity and ionic composition, using a dataset of 3239 benthic diatom samples collected from 1109 river sites throughout the U.S.A. [U.S. Geological Survey National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program dataset]. This dataset provided a unique opportunity to explore the autecology of freshwater diatoms over a broad range of environmental conditions.
   2. Conductivity ranged from 10 to 14 500 muS cm(-1), but most of the rivers had moderate conductivity (interquartile range 180-618 muS cm(-1)). Calcium and bicarbonate were the dominant ions. Ionic composition, however, varied greatly because of the influence of natural and anthropogenic factors.
   3. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and Monte Carlo permutation tests showed that conductivity and abundances of major ions (HCO + CO, Cl-, SO, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+) all explained a statistically significant amount of the variation in assemblage composition of benthic diatoms. Concentrations of HCO + CO and Ca2+ were the most significant sources of environmental variance.
   4. The CCA showed that the gradient of ionic composition explaining most variation in diatom assemblage structure ranged from waters dominated by Ca2+ and HCO + CO to waters with higher proportions of Na+, K+, and Cl-. The CCA also revealed that the distributions of some diatoms correlated strongly with proportions of individual cations and anions, and with the ratio of monovalent to divalent cations.
   5. We present species indicator values (optima) for conductivity, major ions and proportions of those ions. We also identify diatom taxa characteristic of specific major-ion chemistries. These species optima may be useful in future interpretations of diatom ecology and as indicator values in water-quality assessment.

AB  - Climatic warming during the last glacial-interglacial transition (LGIT) was punctuated by reversals to glacial-like conditions. Palaeorecords of ecosystem change can help document the geographical extent of these events and improve our understanding of biotic sensitivity to climatic forcing. To reconstruct ecosystem and climatic variations during the LGIT, we analyzed lake sediments from southwestern Alaska for fossil pollen assemblages, biogenic-silica content (BSiO2 %), and organic-carbon content (OC%). Betula shrub tundra replaced herb tundra as the dominant vegetation of the region around 13 600 cal BP (cal BP: (14) C calibrated calendar years before present), as inferred from an increase of Betula pollen percentages from < 5% to > 20% with associated decreases in Cyperaceae, Poaceae, and Artemisia . At c . 13 000 cal BP, a decrease of Betula pollen from 28 to < 5% suggests that shrub tundra reverted to herb tundra. Shrub tundra replaced herb tundra to resume as the dominant vegetation at 11 600 cal BP. Higher OC% and BSiO2 % values suggest more stable soils and higher aquatic productivity during shrub-tundra periods than during herb-tundra periods, although pollen changes lagged behind changes in the biogeochemical indicators before c . 13 000 cal BP. Comparison of our palaeoecological data with the ice-core ddelta(18) O record from Greenland reveals strikingly similar patterns from the onset through the termination of the Younger Dryas (YD). This similarity supports the hypothesis that, as in the North Atlantic region, pronounced YD climatic oscillations occurred in the North Pacific region. The rapidity and magnitude of ecological changes at the termination of the YD are consistent with greenhouse experiments and historic photographs demonstrating tundra sensitivity to climatic forcing.

AB  - Many Indigenous and post-development commentators view the hegemony of western conceptions of 'development' as profoundly implicated in the Anthropocene's global ecological crises and underpinned by modernity's extractivist and anthropocentric worldview and sensibilities. Meanwhile, as Kothari et al. note, secular modernity's defenders persist in the presumption that modern science affords the definitive account of nature and reality, while the worldviews of Indigenous peoples are frequently delegitimised as unsophisticated or mere superstition. Accordingly, many Indigenous critics call for today's Indigenous movements globally to challenge the dominance of western 'heteropatriarchal' styles of thinking. They suggest modernity needs to learn from Indigenous movements and traditions, not least for insights into ethical relationality with the animate Earth. Likewise, Arturo Escobar insists that contemporary academic 'theory' needs re-enlivening: bringing it closer to life and the Earth and to the work of those who struggle to defend them. This paper asks how Indigenous decolonization agendas, which struggle in defense of life and the Earth, might inform historiography in the Anthropocene. For example, Beverley Southgate has suggested that history has a utopian and therapeutic purpose - helping us escape the thrall of the past and orientate ourselves towards emancipatory futures. This paper suggests - in an era of ecological emergency - that history's utopian imaginaries will need to be commensurate with that vivid experience of sensed ethical reciprocity with nature, to which indigenous traditional ecological knowledges (ITEK) bear witness. Some western historians question whether a coherent story for humanity is possible, given how systems thinking suggests global feedback and radical uncertainty condition our future. However, systems thinking also highlights the hierarchical nature of human-ecological systems and suggests that the deepest level for intervening in any human-ecological system is at the level of a society's 'mental models' and 'worldview'. This is the level at which interventions have the greatest leverage for radical system transformation and is the level that this essay focuses upon.

AB  - Ending hunger and ensuring food security are among targets of 2030's SDGs. While food trade and the embedded (virtual) water (VW) may improve food availability and accessibility for more people all year round, the sustainability and efficiency of food and VW trade needs to be revisited. In this research, we assess the sustainability and efficiency of food and VW trades under two food security scenarios for Iran, a country suffering from an escalating water crisis. These scenarios are (1) Individual Crop Food Security (ICFS), which restricts calorie fulfillment from individual crops and (2) Crop Category Food Security (CCFS), which promotes "eating local" by suggesting food substitution within the crop category. To this end, we simulate the water footprint and VW trades of 27 major crops, within 8 crop categories, in 30 provinces of Iran (2005-2015). We investigate the impacts of these two scenarios on (a) provincial food security (FSp) and exports; (b) sustainable and efficient blue water consumption, and (c) blue VW export. We then test the correlation between agro-economic and socio-environmental indicators and provincial food security. Our results show that most provinces were threatened by unsustainable and inefficient blue water consumption for crop production, particularly in the summertime. This water mismanagement results in 14.41 and 8.45 billion m(3) y(-1) unsustainable and inefficient blue VW exports under ICFS. "Eating local" improves the FSp value by up to 210% which lessens the unsustainable and inefficient blue VW export from hotspots. As illustrated in the graphical abstract, the FSp value strongly correlates with different agro-economic and socio-environmental indicators, but in different ways. Our findings promote "eating local" besides improving agro-economic and socio-environmental conditions to take transformative steps toward eradicating food insecurity not only in Iran but also in other countries facing water limitations.

AB  - Many freshwater ecosystems are in decline because of anthropogenic disturbance including climate change, yet our understanding of ecological vulnerability to future conditions including climatic variation is limited. Understanding climate risks to freshwater ecosystems requires combining hydrological and ecological knowledge. While there have been significant advances in ecohydrological approaches when applied within the large array of methods available for undertaking impact assessments, the ecological and hydrological elements are often not well-integrated. This results in a mismatch in their ability to accommodate the inherent uncertainty in both impacts and responses. We examine published literature that assesses climate change impacts on freshwater ecosystems using both hydrological and ecological models to better understand method choices. We identify four fundamentally distinct modeling approaches used to assess climate change risk. We discuss which approaches are less useful for predicting ecological impacts under climate change, and highlight approaches of comparable complexity that can maximize the utility of dynamic, process-based modeling while capturing the effects of climate uncertainty and variability. Using an illustrative case study of riparian vegetation health under climate change, we show how the four alternate modeling approaches feature different degrees of information in their outcomes and inferences about future risk. Most current studies that examine climate change risks to freshwater ecosystems use simplified methods or inadequately combine key elements. However, unless the interactions between changing hydrologic variability and ecological responses are explicitly captured in scale-sensitive modeling methods, the risks of climate change to freshwater ecosystems will likely be substantially misrepresented, with negative consequences for effective management responses. Capturing these interactions requires combining ecological and hydrological methods of comparable complexity.

AB  - A deep understanding of the relationship between watershed non-point source (NPS) pollution and lake total phosphorus (TP) accumulation is the basis of watershed-lake environmental management and ecological reconstruction, in which the acquisition of long-term NPS P and lake TP data over corresponding temporal and spatial scales seems to be the key issue. In this study, three typical sub-basins within Hongze Lake were selected as study sites. The sediment TP concentrations were designated as the lake indicator to relate with the NPS P loads, and the role of sediment in representing watershed NPS pollution was quantitatively analyzed. The results showed that, first, a notable fluctuation tendency in NPS P loads, which was largely influenced by policy, was found for all three sub-basins. Second, the deposition rate for three sediment cores was approximately 0.40 cm per year, with 13 cm cores reflecting the period since 1990. Third, the sediment is a faithful recorder of watershed NPS P pollution and lake nutrient enrichment. The correlation coefficient (r) between watershed NPS P loads and lake sediment TP concentrations showed notable differences when each watershed was considered separately. In particular, an ideal relationship was found in Basins 1 and 2, especially in the bottom 7 and 8 cm of the sediment cores, in whichrexceeded 0.8. This showed that sediment can be an effective indicator of NPS P pollution during certain periods, such as 1990 - 2002, and diverse roles can be attributed to land-use/cover change and lake resuspension conditions. In addition, the weakest relationship existed in the No. 3 watershed, largely due to higher rainfall amounts compared with other two watersheds. For all the watersheds, lake sediment is a suitable indicator of watershed NPS P pollution over certain temporal and spatial scales.

AB  - Interest in atmosphere-surface flux modeling over the mountainous regions of the globe has increased recently, with a major focus on the prediction of water, carbon and other functional indicators in natural and disturbed conditions. However, less research has been centered on exploring energy fluxes (net radiation; sensible, latent and soil heat) and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) over the Neotropical Andean biome of the paramo. The present study assesses the implementation and parameterization of a state-of-art Land-Surface Model (LSM) for simulation of these fluxes over two representative paramo catchments of southern Ecuador. We evaluated the outputs of the LSM Community Land Model (CLM ver. 4.0) with (i) ground-level flux observations from the first (and highest) Eddy Covariance (EC) tower of the Northern Andean paramos; (ii) spatial ETa estimates from the energy balance-based model METRIC (based on Landsat imagery); and (iii) derived ETa from the closure of the water balance (WB). CLM's energy predictions revealed a significant underestimation on net radiation, which impacts the sensible and soil heat fluxes (underestimation), and delivers a slight overestimation on latent heat flux. Modeled CLM ETa showed acceptable goodness-of-fit (Pearson R = 0.82) comparable to ETa from METRIC (R = 0.83). Contrarily, a poor performance of ETa WB was observed (R = 0.46). These findings provide solid evidence on the CLM's accuracy for the ETa modeling, and give insights in the selection of other ETa methods. The study contributes to a better understanding of ecosystem functioning in terms of water loss through evaporative processes, and might help in the development of future LSMs' implementations focused on climate / land use change scenarios for the paramo.

AB  - Over the past century, atmospheric nitrogen deposition (N-dep) has increased across the western United States due to agricultural and urban development, resulting in degraded ecosystem quality. Regional patterns of N-dep are often estimated by coupling direct measurements from large-scale monitoring networks and atmospheric chemistry models, but such efforts can be problematic in the western US because of complex terrain and sparse sampling. This study aimed not only to understand N-dep patterns in mountainous ecosystems but also to investigate whether isotope values of lichens and throughfall deposition can be used to determine N-dep sources, and serve as an additional tool in ecosystem health assessments. We measured N-dep amounts and delta N-15 in montane conifer forests of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem using canopy throughfall and bulk monitors and lichens. In addition, we examined patterns of C:N ratios in lichens as a possible indicator of lichen physiological condition. The isotopic signature of delta N-15 of N-dep helps to discern emission sources, because delta N-15 of NOx from combustion tends to be high (-5 to + 25 parts per thousand) while NHx from agricultural sources tends to be comparatively low (-40 to -10 parts per thousand). Summertime N-dep increased with elevation and ranged from 0.26 to 1.66 kg ha(-1). N-dep was higher than expected in remote areas. The delta N-15 values of lichens were typically -15.3 to -10% suggesting agriculture as a primary emission source of deposition. Lichen % N, delta N-15 and C:N ratios can provide important information about N-dep sources and patterns over small spatial scales in complex terrain. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aims to establish the relationship between the composition, structure of sediment dissolved organic matter (DOM) and water quality based on changes of environmental conditions in Dongting Lake. Hence, UV-vis absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy were combined to characterize the components and structure of DOM in surface sediments of Dongting Lake. The relationship of the structural characteristics of DOM with N, P contents and water quality was also explored. The results showed that the DOC contents of Dongting Lake sediments were between 60.004 and 368.286 mg kg(-1), with the general trend of Eastern > Southern >Western for the Dongting Lake regions. The DOM in the sediments mainly comprised humic-like substances, which were greater in the Eastern than in the Southern and Western Dongting Lake regions by 4.1% and 6.43%, respectively. The humification degree of DOM in the sediments was high, and the substitution groups in the aromatic rings mainly contained carbonyl, carboxyl, hydroxyl, and esters. The source of DOM in the Dongting Lake sediments was significantly influenced by terrestrial input and biological metabolism. Furthermore, the composition and structural characteristics of DOM in the Dongting Lake sediments were found to be closely related to the contents of N and P in the sediments, as well as the water quality. Especially, the ratio of humic-like substances to protein-like substances (P ((III+V,n))/P-(I+II,P-n)) can be indirectly taken as an indicator of water quality. Thus, the changes of composition and structure of sediment DOM can establish a relationship with the water quality, and will have an indicative effect on lake trophic status. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Predicting the vulnerability of species to environmental change requires integrating observations of individual ecophysiological and behavioral responses with community level constraints. To assess the response of stream-breeding frogs (Rana boylii) to thermal stressors, such as cold water released from the depths of upstream reservoirs or warm water that results from climate change, we combined field manipulations with population censuses and environmental correlations. These frogs migrate between shaded tributaries and open canopy mainstem channels to oviposit where algal food is abundant for tadpoles. Within this context of spatial variation in aquatic primary productivity, we evaluated whether tadpole thermoregulatory behavior is a useful indicator of survival to metamorphosis and adult distribution. In a thermal gradient, tadpoles selected temperatures between 16.5-22.2 degrees C (mean, 19.60 +/- 0.6 degrees C). We reared tadpoles in streams colder, warmer, or close to thermal preference. Temperature effects were mediated through algal quantity and quality. Mortality increased with increasing deviation from preferred temperatures, but the effects were ameliorated when tadpole diet was supplemented with algae (Cladophora glomerata with epiphytic nitrogen-rich diatoms, Epithemia spp.) harvested from sun-lit channels. Distribution of frogs in free-flowing and dammed reaches within a northern California watershed was in equilibrium with tadpole thermal preference. Populations were dense (>= 125 breeding females/km) where July water temperatures averaged 17.5-19 degrees C in 2010, a relatively cool summer. Below 16 degrees C, frogs were sparse with open canopy and absent under closed canopy. Integration of thermoregulatory behavior with ecological context can thus be useful to forecast recruitment when the thermal regimes of rivers are altered by anthropogenic factors.

AB  - The deep-sea represents a substantial portion of the biosphere and has a major influence on carbon cycling and global biogeochemistry. Benthic deep-sea prokaryotes have crucial roles in this ecosystem, with their recycling of organic matter from the photic zone. Despite this, little is known about the large-scale distribution of prokaryotes in the surface deep-sea sediments. To assess the influence of environmental and trophic variables on the large-scale distribution of prokaryotes, we investigated the prokaryotic assemblage composition (Bacteria to Archaea and Euryarchaeota to Crenarchaeota ratio) and activity in the surface deep-sea sediments of the Mediterranean Sea and the adjacent North Atlantic Ocean. Prokaryotic abundance and biomass did not vary significantly across the Mediterranean Sea; however, there were depth-related trends in all areas. The abundance of prokaryotes was positively correlated with the sedimentary concentration of protein, an indicator of the quality and bioavailability of organic matter. Moving eastwards, the Bacteria contribution to the total prokaryotes decreased, which appears to be linked to the more oligotrophic conditions of the Eastern Mediterranean basins. Despite the increased importance of Archaea, the contributions of Crenarchaeota Marine Group I to the total pool was relatively constant across the investigated stations, with the exception of Matapan-Vavilov Deep, in which Euryarchaeota Marine Group II dominated. Overall, our data suggest that deeper areas of the Mediterranean Sea share more similar communities with each other than with shallower sites. Freshness and quality of sedimentary organic matter were identified through Generalized Additive Model analysis as the major factors for describing the variation in the prokaryotic community structure and activity in the surface deep-sea sediments. Longitude was also important in explaining the observed variability, which suggests that the overlying water masses might have a critical role in shaping the benthic communities.

AB  - Questions What are the species and functional trait composition of riparian forests in near-natural Southwest European rivers? Are functional trait and species assemblages constrained by environment? Location Near-natural riparian habitats throughout mainland Portugal, Southwest Europe. Methods We collected data on riparian woody abundances and environmental variables from 175 river locations. Twenty-eight key functional traits were assigned to the surveyed species. Hierarchical clustering and indicator species analysis were used to derive compositional and functional groups of sites. We used Mantel tests to relate species and trait abundances and environmental gradients, and identified sets of relevant variables at diverse spatial scales. Then, four Dispersion indicators were developed to assess the extent to which the groups are constrained by the environment. These measures were tested for significance using iteration procedures. Results Clustering revealed four compositional groups of sites: Alder woods, Ash woods, Tree-heath shrublands and Semi-arid shrublands; and three functional groups: Mixed riparian forests, Shrublands with fleshy fruits and Stress-tolerant shrublands. These groups were primarily defined by broad-scale gradients of climate, elevation and river hierarchy. The most dispersed groups had broad trait composition (e.g. Mixed riparian forests) and were floristically diverse (Alder woods). In general, the compositional groups were more closely related to environmental gradients than the functional groups. Conclusions Assemblages with very specific functional traits or with homogeneous species composition were largely constrained to the most extreme environmental conditions in the study area. Future research to assist environmental management should be directed to the role of fine-scale environmental determinants of riparian assemblages, especially those related to flow variability and water stress.

AB  - Soil contamination with metals is a serious problem requiring urgent measures to counteract their impacts. The conventional soil remediation techniques are often inefficient and expensive. In this work, we studied the potential of the species Fraxinus angustifolia for the phytoremediation of metal contaminated soils from the Cunha Baixa uranium mine (Mangualde, Portugal). The plants were exposed to a contaminated, a reference and a control soil, for a period of about 3 months, during which metal accumulation and a set of physiologic parameters (shoot height, potential maximum efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) and quantum yield of PSII (Phi(PSII)), leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf relative water content, leaf chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoid content, leaf malondialdehyde (MDA) content and leaf proline content) were measured. The genetic profiles of the endophytic communities from the roots of the plants were also analyzed, via PCR-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) targeted for a conserved region of 16S rDNA, pre- and post-exposure. Only the shoot height was a suitable indicator of the negative effects of the contamination with metals on the plants. The remaining parameters indicated good physiologic fitness and recovery. The trees did not hyperaccumulate metals but extracted Sr at a higher rate. The bacterial profiles from the control and reference soils showed more similarity with each other and with the pre-exposure profiles than with those from the contaminated soil. We showed that F. angusnfolia has the ability to resist and adapt to the adverse conditions of contamination, revealing a potential which can be exploited for phytoremediation, specifically phytostabilization. It also revealed that changes exerted on the bacterial root communities exposed to contamination, resulted in profiles considerably different from those of the remaining communities.

AB  - Aim Vegetation optical depth (VOD) is an indicator of the water content of both woody and leaf components in terrestrial aboveground vegetation biomass that can be derived from passive microwave remote sensing. VOD is distinct from optical vegetation remote sensing data such as the normalized difference vegetation index in that it is: (a) less prone to saturation in dense canopies; (b) sensitive to both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic biomass; and (c) less affected by atmospheric conditions. Our primary objective was to analyse a recently developed long-term VOD record and investigate how the vegetation water content of various land-cover types responded to environmental changes and human influences from 1988 to 2008. Location Global. Methods We first conducted MannKendall trend tests on annual average VOD to identify regions with significant changes over the period 19882008. To diagnose the underlying cause of the observed changes, patterns for these identified regions were further compared with independent datasets of precipitation, crop production, deforestation and fire occurrence. Results (1) Over grassland and shrubland, VOD patterns corresponded strongly to temporal precipitation patterns. (2) Over croplands, annual average VOD showed a general increase that corresponded to reported crop production patterns and was attributed to a combination of precipitation patterns and agricultural improvements. (3) Over humid tropical forest, the spatial pattern of VOD decline agrees well with deforestation patterns; the 2005 Amazon drought corresponded with a temporary VOD decrease. (4) Over boreal forests, regional VOD declines are attributed to a combination of fires and clear cutting. Main conclusions Passive microwave remote sensing of VOD can be used to monitor global changes in total aboveground vegetation water content and biomass over various land-cover types. This new observational record can help in hydrological, agricultural, ecological and climate change studies, and provides new insights into large-scale vegetation change and its drivers.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine and explore the structure of the reed rush phytocoenosis, to assess spatial differences in the concentration of certain trace elements in stems and leaves of the common reed (Phragmites australis) and to make an attempt at determining the bioindicative characteristics of this species with respect to the environmental features of anthropogenic water bodies, several thousand of which are present in the central part of southern Poland. Using the INAA technique, concentrations of the following elements have been determined in common reed tissues: As (0.01-0.69 mg.kg(-1)), Ba (6.0-62.0 mg.kg(-1)), Br (2.5-71.5 mg.kg(-1)), Ca (0.2-1.2%), Co (0.1-1.7 mg.kg(-1)), Cr (0.2-1.7 mg.kg(-1)), Fe (0.01-0.02%), K (0.7-2.9%), Na (235.0-2910.0 mg.kg(-1)), Sb (0.05-1.16 mg.kg(-1)), Zn (20.0-250.0 mg.kg(-1)). Using the INAA and ICP XRF techniques, the overall chemical composition of the substratum sediments on which P. austral grows and the elements they contain, has been determined. Results of common reed tissue analyses are highly varied and only reflect the fertility of the water environment and of the accumulated sediments on which P. austral is developed to a small extent. In many cases the samples also fail to reflect the pollution found in the water or substratum sediments. It was determined that within the water bodies examined, Phragmites austral is mainly forms single-species stands of the Phragmitetum austral is association. Its strong dynamics and high bioproductivity as well as the varied numbers of specimens present in different environments make the common reed to some degree a quantitative bioindicator and a mixed type bioindicator.

AB  - Invertebrates have long been used as resident sentinels for assessing ecosystem health and productivity. The shore crabs, Hemigrapsus oregonensis and Pachygrapsus crassipes, are abundant in estuaries and beaches throughout northern California, USA and have been used as indicators of habitat conditions in several salt marshes The overall objectives of the present study were to conduct a lab-based study to test the accumulation of current-use pesticides, validate the analytical method and to analyze field-collected crabs for a suite of 74 current-use and legacy pesticides. A-simple laboratory uptake study was designed to determine if embryos could bioconcentrate the herbicide molinate over a 7-d period. At the end of the experiment, embryos were removed nom the crabs and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Although relatively hydrophilic (log K-OW of 2.9). molinate did accumulate with an estimated bioconcentration factor (log BCF) of approximately 2 5 Following method validation, embryos were collected from two different Northern California salt marshes and analyzed. In field-collected embryos 18 current-use and eight organochlorine pesticides were detected including synthetic pyrethroids and organophosphate insecticides, as well as DDT and its degradates. Lipid-normalized concentrations of the pesticides detected in the field-collected crab embryos ranged from 0 1 to 4 ppm. Pesticide concentrations and profiles in crab embryos were site specific and could be correlated to differences in land-use practices. These preliminary results indicate that embryos are an effective sink for or game contaminants in the environment and have the potential to be good indicators of ecosystem health, especially when contaminant body burden analyses are paired with reproductive impairment assays Environ Toxicol Chem 2010;29.2593-2599 (C) 2010 SETAC

AB  - Previous studies support the hypothesis that large numbers of infaunal burrow-irrigating organisms in the western basin of Lake Erie may increase significantly the sediment oxygen demand, thus enhancing the rate of hypolimnetic oxygen depletion. We conducted laboratory experiments to quantify burrow oxygen dynamics and increased oxygen demand resulting from burrow irrigation using two different year classes of Hexagenia spp. nymphs from western Lake Erie during summer, 2006. Using oxygen microelectrodes and hot film anemometry, we simultaneously determined oxygen concentrations and burrow water flow velocities. Burrow oxygen depletion rates ranged from 21.7 mg/nymph/mo for 15 mm nymphs at 23 degrees C to 240.7 mg/nymph/mo for 23 mm nymphs at 13 degrees C. Sealed microcosm experiments demonstrated that mayflies increase the rate of oxygen depletion by 2-5 times that of controls, depending on size of nymph and water temperature, with colder waters having greater impact. At natural population densities, nymph pumping activity increased total sediment oxygen demand 0.3-2.5 times compared to sediments with no mayflies and accounted for 22-71% of the total sediment oxygen demand. Extrapolating laboratory results to the natural system suggest that Hexagenia spp. populations may exert a significant control on oxygen depletion during intermittent stratification. This finding may help explain some of the fluctuations in Hexagenia spp. population densities in western Lake Erie and suggests that mayflies, by causing their own population collapse irrespective of other environmental conditions, may need longer term averages when used as a bio-indicator of the success of pollution-abatement programs in western Lake Erie and possibly throughout the Great Lakes.

AB  - Paleolimnological approaches using sedimentary diatom assemblages were used to assess water quality changes over the last approximately 200 years in three lakes from King's County, Nova Scotia. In particular, the role of recent shoreline development in accelerating eutrophication in these systems was assessed. Sediment cores collected from each lake were analyzed for their diatom assemblages at approximately 5-year intervals, as determined by Pb-210 dating. Analyses showed that each system has changed, but tracked different ecosystem changes. Tupper and George lakes recorded shifts, which are likely primarily related to climatic warming, with diatom assemblages changing from a preindustrial dominance by Aulacoseira spp. to present-day dominance by Cyclotella stelligera. In addition to the recent climatic-related changes, further diatom changes in the Tupper Lake core between approximately 1820 and 1970 were coincident with watershed disturbances (farming, forestry, and construction of hydroelectric power infrastructure). Black River Lake has recorded an increase in diatom-inferred total phosphorus since about 1950, likely due to impoundment of the Black River system for hydroelectric generation and subsequent changes in land runoff. Before-and-after (i.e., top-bottom) sediment analyses of six other lakes from King's County provided further evidence that the region is being influenced by climatic change (decreases in Aulacoseira spp., increases in planktonic diatom taxa), as well as showing other environmental stressors (e. g., acidification). However, we recorded no marked increase in diatom-inferred nutrient levels coincident with shoreline cottage development in any of the nine study lakes. Paleolimnological studies such as these allow lake managers to place the current limnological conditions into a long-term context, and thereby provide important background data for effective lake management.

AB  - Current research indicates that plant populations should increase above the current Wisconsin recommendation of 74100 plants ha(-1) for higher corn (Zea mays L.) grain yields. However, stalk lodging is a major constraint to increasing plant populations. One option growers have is using Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) hybrids, which are known to lodge less. A new method for assessing stalk lodging risk is needed. The objectives of this study were to (i) assess rind strength of corn hybrids with or without the Bt trait to increasing plant populations at natural levels of European Corn Borer [ECB, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner)], and (ii) determine the potential of rind strength measurements for predicting stalk lodging. In 2003 and 2004, rind penetrometer resistance (RPR) was used to measure rind strength for four Bt and five non-Bt hybrids with plant populations ranging from 64220 to 123500 plants ha(-1) at 10 locations in Wisconsin. Stalk lodging increased from 6 to 18% as plant population increased, and only at one location, Arlington, did Bt hybrids lodge significantly less (20 vs. 42%) than non-Bt hybrids. The RPR of both Bt and non-Bt hybrids decreased from 3.9 to 3.7 load-kg plant(-1) with increasing plant population. Plants with rind strength measurements < 3.9 load-kg plant(-1) taken at physiological maturity showed more lodging. Thus, such measurements appear to be a good indicator of stalk lodging potential in a high plant population situation. This new method has potential to help growers prepare for grain harvest by identifying fields with plants having average RPR below a 3.9 load-kg plant(-1) threshold, and adjusting harvest schedules of suspect fields earlier to avoid yield losses caused by stalk lodging. Further research using more hybrids across a range of environmental conditions and plant populations will be necessary to fully understand the importance of this tool and its potential importance in understanding and identifying high lodging potential environments.

AB  - The toxicity of cadmium, lead, chromium, and arsenite on Caenorhabditis elegans was investigated to identify sensitive biomarkers for environmental monitoring and risk assessment. Effects of these metals on stress-related gene expression, growth, reproduction, and mortality of C. elegans were investigated under laboratory conditions. The possibility of using C. elegans as a biosensor for environmental toxicity monitoring was also tested using a green fluorescent protein transgenic nematode. The 24-h median lethal concentrations of cadmium, lead, chromium, and arsenite in C. elegans were 846, 34, 115, and 92 mg/L, respectively. Cadmium exposure led to an increase in the expression of most of the genes tested. The degree of increase was more than threefold compared to control in heat shock protein 16.2, heat shock protein 70, metallothionein 2, cytochrome P450 family protein 35A2, glutathione-S-transferase 4, superoxide dismutase 1, catalase 2, C. elegans p53-like protein 1, and apoptosis enhancer 1 genes. The lead-, chromium-, and arsenite-exposed nematode, on the other hand, showed little change in gene expression. Alterations in growth and reproduction were observed in cadmium- and chromium-exposed worms. To consider a transgenic nematode as a biosensor for toxicity monitoring, the responses of stress-related gene promoters need to be tested with a variety of metals. The overall results suggest that cadmium exhibits a high level of tolerance compared to the other metals tested. Use of the responses of stress-related gene expression therefore has considerable potential as a sensitive biomarker for the diagnosis of cadmium contamination, and C elegans seems to be a good biological model for this approach.

AB  - Current intensive pig production is often associated with environmental burdens. However, very few studies deal with the environmental performance of both current and alternative systems of pig production. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the environmental impacts of three contrasting pig production systems using the life cycle assessment method and to identify hot spots for each system. The scenarios compared were conventional good agricultural practice (GAP) according to French production rules, a French quality label scenario called red label (RL) and a French organic scenario called organic agriculture (OA). For each of the three scenarios a "favourable" and an "unfavourable" variant was defined; these variants were used as indicators of uncertainty with respect to key parameters for technical performance and emissions of pollutants. The environmental categories assessed were: eutrophication, climate change, acidification, terrestrial toxicity, energy use, land use and pesticide use. Two functional units (FU) were used to express impacts: 1 kg of pig produced and 1 ha of land surface used. The scenarios were examined with particular emphasis on their contribution to eutrophication and acidification. Given this perspective, the RL scenario can be an interesting alternative to GAP on the condition that its emission of greenhouse gases can be reduced. The results for OA were very dependent on the choice of the FU. Per kg of pig, eutrophication and acidification were similar for OA and GAP, while OA had less eutrophication and acidification than GAP when expressed per ha. For the three scenarios, environmental hot spots and important margins of improvement were identified. Finally, the uncertainty analysis indicated that efforts should be made to produce more reliable estimations of emission factors for NO3, NH3 and N2O in the field. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To evaluate the impact of elevated nutrients on reef organisms symbiotic with zooxanthellae, giant clams Tridacna maxims were exposed daily to increased ammonia and phosphate (N, P, N+P) in their natural reef environment for 3 to 6 mo. The results strongly corroborate the major responses of the symbiotic association to nutrient enrichment previously observed (with T, gigas) under controlled outdoor conditions. Exposure of the clams to elevated N (10 mu M) increased zooxanthellae density, reduced zooxanthellae size, down-regulated N uptake by zooxanthellae freshly isolated from their hosts, and reduced glutamate in the clam haemolymph, with increased pools of some free amino acids (methionine, tyrosine) in the zooxanthellae. These results confirm that the zooxanthellae in giant clams are N Limited in situ and have free access to inorganic N from the sea water. There is also corroborating evidence that the zooxanthellae are P limited in situ as well, possibly due to host interference. While the N:P ratios of the animal host reflected ambient Nand P concentrations in the sea water, those of the zooxanthellae did pot. Regardless of P exposure (2 mu M P) of the clams, zooxanthellae N:P ratios were consistently high (>30:1) and phosphate concentrations in the clam haemolymph bathing the zooxanthellae tube system consistently low (<0.1 mu M) These field findings, consistent with previous laboratory observations, confirm the limiting roles of both N and P in the giant clam- zooxanthellae symbiosis. That significant changes occurred earlier and at lower nutrient loading compared to some reef organisms investigated within the same experimental framework further demonstrates organism-level responses of a potential bio-indicator of the early onset of eutrophication in reef waters.

AB  - Biomonitoring was proposed to assess the condition of living organisms or entire ecosystems with the use of bioindicators-species sensitive to specific pollutants. It is important that the bioindicator species remains alive for as long as possible while retaining the ability to react to the negative effects of pollution (elimination/neutralization of hazardous contaminants). The purpose of the study was to assess the survival of Pleurozium schreberi moss during exposure (moss-bag technique) based on the measurement of the concentration of elements (Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb), chlorophyll content, and its fluorescence. The study was carried out using a CCM-300 portable chlorophyll content meter, portable fluorometer, UV-Vis spectrophotometer, and a flame atomic absorption spectrometer. As a result of the laboratory tests, no significant differences were found in the chlorophyll content in the gametophytes of mosses tested immediately after collection from the forest, compared to those drying at room temperature in the laboratory (p = 0.175 for Student's t-test results). Mosses exposed using the moss-bag technique of active biomonitoring were characterized by a drop in the chlorophyll content over 12 weeks (more than 50% and 60% for chlorophyll-a and chlorophyll-b, respectively). Chlorophyll content in mosses during exposure was correlated with actual photochemical efficiency (yield) of photosystem II (calculated value of Pearson's linear correlation coefficient was 0.94-there was a significant correlation between chlorophyll a and yield p = 0.02). The highest metal increases in mosses (RAF values) were observed for zinc, lead, and copper after the second and third month of exposure. The article demonstrates that the moss exposed in an urbanized area for a period of three months maintains the properties of good bioindicator of environmental quality.

AB  - Species distributions are influenced by processes occurring at multiple spatial scales. It is therefore insufficient to model species distribution at a single geographic scale, as this does not provide the necessary understanding of determining factors. Instead, multiple approaches are needed, each differing in spatial extent, grain, and research objective. Here, we present the first attempt to model continent-wide great ape density distribution. We used site-level estimates of African great ape abundance to (1) identify socioeconomic and environmental factors that drive densities at the continental scale, and (2) predict range-wide great ape density. We collated great ape abundance estimates from 156 sites and defined 134 pseudo-absence sites to represent additional absence locations. The latter were based on locations of unsuitable environmental conditions for great apes, and on existing literature. We compiled seven socioeconomic and environmental covariate layers and fitted a generalized linear model to investigate their influence on great ape abundance. We used an Akaike-weighted average of full and subset models to predict the range-wide density distribution of African great apes for the year 2015. Great ape densities were lowest where there were high Human Footprint and Gross Domestic Product values; the highest predicted densities were in Central Africa, and the lowest in West Africa. Only 10.7% of the total predicted population was found in the International Union for Conservation of Nature Category I and II protected areas. For 16 out of 20 countries, our estimated abundances were largely in line with those from previous studies. For four countries, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia, and South Sudan, the estimated populations were excessively high. We propose further improvements to the model to overcome survey and predictor data limitations, which would enable a temporally dynamic approach for monitoring great apes across their range based on key indicators.

AB  - The impact of a strongly anthropogenic urban-industrial catchment on the pollution status of bottom sediments of a potamic ecosystem is presented, including the spatial and temporal distribution of selected persistent organic pollutants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)). The study compares the pollution of bottom sediments of the Bytomka River at low and high water levels. The Bytomka River is characterized by a high proportion of industrial and municipal wastewater in the total water balance (80%-90%). At low water levels, the concentration ranged from 2.88 to 74.67 mg/kg d.w. (the sum of PAHs) and from below the method quantitation limit (MQL) to 26.13 mu g/kg d.w. (the sum of PCBs), at high water levels from 3.90 to 116.53 mg/kg d.w. (the sum of PAHs) and from below MQL to 15.95 mu g/kg d.w. (the sum of PCBs). It was found that the pollution of sediments with PAHs and PCBs is seasonally variable and depends on the water flow rate. High water levels are related to rainwater runoff from tarmacked surfaces and these periods are used to discharge increasing amounts of wastewater, which are sources of PAHs and PCBs. The analysis of characteristic ratios shows that air deposition associated with low emissions may also be one of the likely sources of PAHs in the river studied. According to the ecotoxicological indicators threshold effect concentration and probable effect concentration, concentrations of PAHs in the bottom sediments of the Bytomka River may have an adverse effect on plant and animal organisms living in these habitats. No impact of PCBs was found.

AB  - Stressors are omnipresent in the environment and trigger specific physiological and/or behavioural responses that remain relatively less known in invertebrates. Among the parameters used to quantify the impact of stress on physiology, the circulating level of glucose is commonly used in aquatic crustacean species. Terrestrial isopods are small crustaceans commonly used as bioindicators of soil quality; however, their response to environmental stressors remains poorly documented. In laboratory conditions, we investigated how different stressors influence the physiological response of two terrestrial isopod species. Thus, we exposed Armadillidium vulgare and Porcellio dilatatus to a series of both acute (physical) and chronic (temperature, social isolation, and exposure to herbicide) stressors that mimic potentially stressful situations encountered in their environment. Our results revealed that, for both species, glycaemia is not impacted by thermic shock (1 h at 4 degrees C), mechanical disturbances (1 min of shaking or upside-down motion) or social isolation (4 weeks) at the population level. Nevertheless, we observed a significantly higher sensitivity in male P. dilatatus exposed to upside-down movements and in males of both species exposed to social isolation. Acute (96 h) and chronic (21 days) exposure to glyphosate (1.8-2.5 kg.ha(-1)) did not impact glycaemia levels in A. vulgare. However, at both tested doses, individuals exposed to glyphosate for 25 days and subjected to an additional stressor (haemolymph sampling at 96 h) had significantly higher glycaemia in comparison to their control. Survival was also impacted by the joint application of chronic glyphosate exposure and intermediate haemolymph sampling. We conclude that glucose is a potentially good indicator to study the stress response of terrestrial isopods. Additional studies for this parameter, combined with other physiological indicators, are needed to better characterize this response.

AB  - Chemical warfare agents (CWA) dumped worldwide in all types of aquatic reservoirs pose a potential environmental hazard. Leakage of CWAs from eroding containers at dumping sites had been observed, and their presence in the tissues of aquatic animals was confirmed. However, the ecological effects of CWA have not yet been studied. In standardized laboratory bioassays, we tested if sublethal concentration of Clark I, an arsenic based CWA, can affect life histories (somatic growth rate, fecundity, size at maturity), population growth rate and stable isotope signatures of a keystone crustacean grazer Daphnia magna. We found that the life histories and fitness of daphnids reared in the presence of Clark I differed from those reared in Clark-free conditions. The effects were observed when Clark I concentrations were no less than 5 mu gxL(-1). With increasing concentrations of the tested CWA, all of the tested parameters decreased linearly. The finding indicates that even sublethal concentrations of Clark I can affect crustacean populations, which should be taken into account when assessing the environmental risks of this particular CWA. We found intraspecific diversity in susceptibility to Clark I, with some clones being significantly less vulnerable than others. We also found that in the presence of Clark I, the ratio of heavy and light isotopes of nitrogen in the bodies of daphnids was affected - daphnids exhibited delta N-15 enrichment with increasing concentrations of this CWA. The isotopic composition of carbon was not affected by the presence of Clark I. The nitrogen isotopic signature may be used as an indicator of stress in zooplankton exposed to the presence of toxic xenobiotics. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The chlorophyll-breakdown to pheophorbide is determined by biotic factors such as grazing (via chlorophyllide) or senescence (via pheophytin). So far, much of the information on chlorophyll-breakdown is available from sediments, but information from the water column is limited. This study addressed chlorophyll-breakdown-pathways (Chl-BP) on a seasonal basis from eight major ports (18-30 stations/port) representing freshwater, estuarine, and marine ecosystems. The distribution of chlorophyll and its breakdown fractions (pheophytin, pheophorbide) exhibited distinct spatial and seasonal variations. Fresh-water (except Haldia-port) and estuarine ports are characterized by high-biomass, high-pheophytin, and low-pheophorbide, whereas marine-ports by low-biomass (except Mangalore-port), low-pheophytin, and high-pheophorbide. Pheophytin and pheophorbide distribution were biomass independent and dependent, respectively. The pheophorbide: pheophytin ratio indicated a potential proxy for determining the dominant breakdown pathway, i.e., herbivory dominant (>1) or not dominant (<1). However, CHl-BP is taxa-specific and grazer's feeding habits. The ratios exhibited apparent differences between different ecosystems, i.e., the higher ratios in marine (up to 11.2) followed by estuarine (up to 0.9) and freshwater (up to 0.4; except Haldia) systems. The diatoms (preferred grazer diet) contribution to total phytoplankton was more in marine followed by estuarine and freshwater systems. The low and high ratios suggested the prevalence of chlorophyll-breakdown via senescence and grazing mode, respectively. We proposed that such scaling will have implications in the ballast water management - BWM (ballast tank conditions (eg. dark) during voyages, post-voyage discharge - including treated water using approved BWM systems, and the nature of ports, potential discharge point) and algal bloom research (e.g. understanding fate and in control measures).

AB  - Neutralizing land degradation due to overexploitation of natural resources is an acceptable strategy under developing conditions. However, this important approach has not been adequately introduced and adopted in the world. The present study therefore aimed to calculate Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) for the Shazand Watershed with an area about 1740 km(2) located in central arid and semi-arid region of Iran. The LDN status was basically assessed using three indicators, viz. land use and land cover, soil organic carbon and land productivity using Land Cover/Use Changes (LUC), Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) and Net Primary Productivity (NPP) metrics for two sub-periods during 2000 to 2016. Towards this, 140 soil samples were then taken from the top 30-cm of the soil from homogeneous units representing an area >= 1-km(2) for four different main land uses including irrigated farms, rain fed farms, range lands, and orchards. Consequently, SOC and various soil properties such as sand, silt, clay, gravel, bulk density (BD), pH, electrical connectivity (EC), calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and nitrogen (N) were analyzed. NPP metric was also obtained using MODIS satellite images for three periods of 2000-2008, 2008-2016, and 2000-2016. The results of combination of study metrics indicated that net loss occurred in irrigated lands, rain fed lands, and range lands in the first eight-year period (2000-2008) and in contrary a balanced and stable situation in the second eight-year period (2008-2016). Overall, the LDN status in the Shazand Watershed was in a net loss situation during the period from 2000 to 2016 in irrigated lands, rain fed lands, and range lands covered areas of 12,290, 44,170 and 66,630 ha, respectively.

AB  - As the main part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Tibet has a large range of elevations. Its complex topography and diverse vegetation types constitute various micro-habitat conditions, which may exert great influence on ecosystems. The bryophytes are higher plant with simple structure, and widely distributed, and extremely sensitive to environmental variation as well. As one of the important indicator plants, its response to environmental variation is important to explore. In this study, to better understand the response of bryophytes to environmental variation, we explored the relationship between the morphological traits of Bryum argenteum and its surrounding climate, topography, soil, and other environmental factors in the arid and semi-arid regions of Tibet. The Bryum argenteum specimens collected in the arid and semi-arid regions of Tibet from 2007 to 2015 were taken for 8 samples each specimen, and slides of plants and leaves were made. The slides were photo graphed and we measured the plant height, leaf length, leaf width, costa length, costa width and hair-point length, and measured the correlations between them and the environmental factors. Our results showed that the morphological characteristics of bryophytes are closely related to environmental variation, among which the hair-point length and plant height showed high coefficient of variation and phenotypic plasticity. The effects of environmental variation on bryophytes are largely different in different substrates. The morphological traits of terricolous Bryum argenteum are largely influenced by growing season precipitation, soil pH, and soil texture, while the morphological traits of saxicolous Bryum argenteum are largely influenced by elevation, growing season temperature, annual precipitation, and total nitrogen, available phosphorus and organic matter in soil. Our study showed the various functional traits of bryophytes are closely related and the combination of these traits collaboratively responds to environmental variation.

AB  - The introduction of nitrogen-fixing trees in a mixed system with Eucalyptus can improve soil chemical and microbiological properties, especially C-N contents and microbial diversity. However, the effects of this forest management on soil mesofauna remain poorly understood. Thus, we hypothesized that higher mesofauna abundance and diversity, microbial activity and soil quality are greater in the mixed plantation of Eucalyptus grandis and Acacia mangium than in pure Eucalyptus plantations. We aimed at evaluating the density and diversity of soil mesofauna, and its interaction with microbiological and chemical soil attributes in pure Acacia mangiwn (AC), Eucalyptus grandis (EU) and mixed E. grandis and A. mangium plantations (M). We also intended to adapt a general indicator of soil quality for such forest plantations. It is common for soil macrofauna studies to employ the general indicator of soil quality (GISQ). Since our study did not comprise soil macrofauna, but included only soil mesofauna, we adapted the GISQ to contemplate mesofaunal attributes, introducing the great interaction between them and microorganisms. Soil samples (0-5 cm) were collected at 2015, when trees were six years old. The only faunal order to show a higher density is Diplura. Our results show that the metabolic quotient (qCO(2) ) is lower in AC, while the cation exchange capacity (CEC), H + Al and soil moisture are higher in AC than in EU and M. We verified that intercropping of A. mangium in E. grandis improves soil quality and our indicator showed that soil mesofauna correlates with soil microbial attributes density. Thus, our results provide a novel evidence of ecological interactions between soil mesofauna and microorganisms under field conditions for pure and mixed plantations of Eucalyptus grandis and Acacia mangium.

AB  - Tribal farmers are most vulnerable to climate variability and change (CVC) due to their climate sensitive livelihoods and lack of resources to afford the adaptation measures. In order to formulate appropriate programs and policies addressing climate change, it is essential to understand their adaptive capacity (AC). This study analyzed the level of adaptive capacity (AC) of tribal dairy farmers' households of Himachal Pradesh, part of western Himalayan region (one of the fifteen agro-climatic zones in India), and confronting the factors that cause the differences in adaptive capacity (AC). Based on the previous studies, adaptive capacity of each household was determined by developing a composite adaptive capacity index by using method of principal component analysis (PCA) with the help of statistical software SPSSv21. Adaptive capacity index (ACI) was developed underlying the definition of adaptive capacity (AC) as put forward by IPCC (2007), consisting of five index components namely human capital, physical capital, financial capital, social capital and natural capital. Results showed that variations in adaptive capacity index were caused by differences in human capital, physical and financial capital. Tribal households that scored low in these three indicators had lower adaptive capacity (AC). Adaptive capacity index (ACI) indicated that 31.88 percent of sampled household have low level of adaptive capacity with wide variation in index score of components of adaptive capacity across the villages and households, which were highly vulnerable to climate variability and change (CVC). Naurangabad village of Sirmaur district have lowest score (0.70 +/- 0.03) of Adaptive capacity index (ACI) among the entire selected villages. To cope up the adverse climatic conditions and for the sustenance of dairy farming in the study area, the appropriate climate resilient policies will be required for incentivizing the livelihoods infrastructure, promotion of grass root level innovations and to increase adaptive capacity of tribal dairy farmers by using locally available resources.

AB  - Cross congruence, where diversity or composition of multiple species follow similar patterns, underlies the use of indicator species in conservation practice. However, there are circumstances in which cross congruence has been shown to break down, for example after disturbance events. If cross congruence does not occur in habitats which experience natural disturbance, then conservation measures based on indicator species may yield misleading results. We assessed the degree of cross congruence among three biological taxa in dune slacks, which are temporary ponds found in coastal sand dunes. We also investigated the efficacy of a national monitoring assessment based on a single taxonomic group, plants, to predict the diversity and composition of two other taxonomic groups: snails and water beetles. We found no evidence of cross congruence among these three groups and the plant-based monitoring system did not predict the composition or diversity of snails or water beetles. The potential for dune slacks to support species of conservation interest was demonstrated here as eight snail species and two water beetle species listed as Near threatened or Vulnerable on the Irish Red Lists were found within the 24 sites surveyed, and the Irish populations of two of these are of international significance (Vertigo angustior, Leiostyla anglica). Some of these species of conservation interest were found in dune slacks which were of poor conservation status according to the monitoring methodology applied. Our results show that indicator species drawn from a single taxonomic group are not adequate to monitor the general habitat condition of dune slacks. Dune slacks are among many habitats of conservation interest which experience natural disturbance, and this research has implications for conservation practice in other habitats such as seasonal wetlands and fire-dependent habitats.

AB  - A better understanding of the linkages between aboveground and belowground biotic communities is needed for "more accurate predictions about how ecosystems may be altered by climate change, land management, or biodiversity loss. Soil microbes are strongly affected by multiple factors including local abiotic environmental conditions and plant characteristics. To find out how soil microbial communities respond to multiple facets of the local soil and plant environment, we analysed soil lipid profiles associated with three-year-old monocultures of 29 tree species. These species are native of the diverse subtropical forests of southeast China and greatly vary in functional traits, growth or biomass characteristics, and phylogenetic relatedness. Along with the traits of each tree species, we also determined the soil and plot characteristics in each monoculture plot and tested for phylogenetic signals in tree species specific microbial indicators. Microbial community structure and biomass were influenced by both soil properties and plant functional traits, but were not related to the phylogenetic distances of tree species. Specifically, total microbial biomass, indicators for fungi, bacteria, and actinomycetes were positively correlated with soil pH, soil organic nitrogen, and soil moisture. Our results also indicate that leaf dry matter content and the leaf carbon to nitrogen ratio influence multivariate soil microbial community structure, and that these factors and tree growth traits (height, crown or basal diameter) positively promote the abundances of specific microbial functional groups. At the same time, a negative correlation between leaf nitrogen content and Gram positive bacterial abundance was detected, indicating plant microbial competition for nitrogen in our system. In conclusion, even at early stages of tree growth, soil microbial community abundance and structure can be significantly influenced by plant traits, in combination with local soil characteristics.

AB  - The recent continental-scale outbreak of native bark beetles in western North America is unprecedented at least since Euro-American settlement. Observational and modeling evidence suggest that warm temperatures observed during the late 20th century altered beetle population dynamics by accelerating beetle reproductive cycles leading to exponential population growth. The linkage between beetle outbreaks and climate warming has motivated efforts to reconstruct these disturbances using long-term environmental records using lake sediments. Here, we present data from across western North America in an effort to understand how beetle remains retrieved from lake sediments may be used as a proxy for reconstructing severe outbreaks and ecosystem response over centennial to millennial timescales. We (1) review existing literature related to beetle taphonomy; (2) present previously unpublished data of beetle remains in lake sediments; (3) comment on the development of a methodology to retrieve terrestrial beetle remains from lake sediments; (4) discuss potential controls on beetle carcass taphonomy into the sediment matrix; and lastly (5) speculate on the use of primary and secondary attack beetle remains as indicators of past outbreak episodes. Our synthesis suggests that the remains of primary attack beetles are rarely preserved in lake sediments, at least using small-diameter piston devices common in multi-proxy studies. Alternatively, remains of secondary attach beetles may be common but further work is required to understand how these insects can be used to aid in interpreting past forest disturbances, including bark beetle outbreaks and wildfire. A number of factors may influence whether or not bark beetle remains become entrained in the area of sediment focusing including lake water chemistry, fish predation and scavenging, and weather conditions during peak beetle emergence.

AB  - In vitro production (IVP) systems have been used to bypass problems of fertilization and early embryonic development. However, embryos produced by IVP are commonly selected for implantation based on morphological assessment, which is not a strong indicator of establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. Thus, there is a need to identify additional indicators of embryonic developmental potential. Previous studies have identified microRNA expression in in vitro culture media to be indicative of embryo quality in both bovine and human embryos. Like microRNAs, mRNAs have been shown to be secreted from cells into the extracellular environment, but it is unknown whether or not these RNAs are secreted by embryos. Thus, the objective of the present study was to determine whether mRNAs are secreted into in vitro culture media and if their expression in the media is indicative of embryo quality. In vitro culture medium was generated and collected from both blastocyst and degenerate (those which fail to develop from the morula to blastocyst stage) embryos. Small-RNA sequencing revealed that many mRNA fragments were present in the culture media. A total of 17 mRNA fragments were differentially expressed between blastocyst and degenerate conditioned media. Differential expression was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR for fragments of mRNA POSTN and VSNL-1, in four additional biological replicates of media. To better understand the mechanisms of mRNA secretion into the media, the expression of a predicted RNA binding protein of POSTN, PUM2, was knocked down using an antisense oligonucleotide gapmer. Supplementation of a PUM2 gapmer significantly reduced blastocyst development and decreased secretion of POSTN mRNA into the media. Overall, differential mRNA expression in the media was repeatable and sets the framework for future study of mRNA biomarkers in in vitro culture media to improve predictability of reproductive performance.

AB  - Hutchinson defined species' realized niche as the set of environmental conditions in which populations can persist in the presence of competitors. In terms of demography, the realized niche corresponds to the environments where the intrinsic growth rate (r) of populations is positive. Observed species occurrences should reflect the realized niche when additional processes like dispersal and local extinction lags do not have overwhelming effects. Despite the foundational nature of these ideas, quantitative assessments of the relationship between range-wide demographic performance and occurrence probability have not been made. This assessment is needed both to improve our conceptual understanding of species' niches and ranges and to develop reliable mechanistic models of species geographic distributions that incorporate demography and species interactions.
   The objective of this study is to analyse how demographic parameters (intrinsic growth rate r and carrying capacity K) and population density (N) relate to occurrence probability (P-occ). We hypothesized that these relationships vary with species' competitive ability. Demographic parameters, density, and occurrence probability were estimated for 108 tree species from four temperate forest inventory surveys (Quebec, western USA, France and Switzerland). We used published information of shade tolerance as indicators of light competition strategy, assuming that high tolerance denotes high competitive capacity in stable forest environments.
   Interestingly, relationships between demographic parameters and occurrence probability did not vary substantially across degrees of shade tolerance and regions. Although they were influenced by the uncertainty in the estimation of the demographic parameters, we found that r was generally negatively correlated with P-occ, while N, and for most regions K, was generally positively correlated with P-occ. Thus, in temperate forest trees the regions of highest occurrence probability are those with high densities but slow intrinsic population growth rates. The uncertain relationships between demography and occurrence probability suggests caution when linking species distribution and demographic models.

AB  - Knowledge of groundwater residence time is important in understanding key issues in the evolution of water quality, whether this occurs due to water-rock interaction or simply by mixing or contamination. The build-up in the atmosphere of the trace gases chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) from the middle of the last century offers a convenient way of dating waters up to similar to 60 a old. The gases are well-mixed in the atmosphere so their input functions are not area-specific as is the case with H-3. While any one of these trace gases can in principle provide a groundwater age, when two or more are measured on water samples the potential exists to distinguish between different modes of flow including piston flow, exponential flow and simple end-member mixing. As with all groundwater dating methods, caveats apply. Factors such as recharge temperature and elevation must be reasonably well-constrained. Primarily for SF6, the phenomenon of 'excess air' also requires consideration. Primarily for the CFCs, local sources of contamination need to be considered, as do redox conditions. For both SF6 and the CFCs, the nature and thickness of the unsaturated zone need to be factored into residence time calculations. However, as an inexpensive dating method, the trace gases can be applied to a wide range of groundwater problems where traditional age indicators might once have been used more sparingly. Examples include tracing flowlines, detecting small modern inputs in 'old' waters, and pollution risk assessment. In the future, with the main CFCs already declining in the atmosphere, new anthropogenic trace gases are likely to take their place. (C) 2012 Natural Environment Research Council.

AB  - Increasing demands for firewood owing to rising energy costs have accelerated discussions about the amount of dead wood needed for conservation. A sharp increase in dead wood caused by bark beetles in a German national park provides lessons for management of commercial and protected forests. We investigated the effects of dead wood due to bark beetle infestation as well as tree senility on abundance and richness of saproxylic species of beetles. Increasing amounts of spruce dead wood and opening of the canopy by bark beetles had positive effects on the abundance of host-generalist, conifer-specialist, and red-listed saproxylic beetles. Broadleaf specialists were positively associated with the amount of broadleaf dead wood and negatively associated with canopy openness. Gradient analysis of beetle assemblages revealed two major environmental axes: canopy openness and amount of dead wood. We found a threshold for community divergence at a canopy openness of 23% (confidence interval CI: 11-49) and at an amount of dead wood of 64 m(3) ha(-1) (CI: 35-160). Critically endangered species served as indicators of dense and open forests, but only when the amount of dead wood was high. Our results suggest that, to maintain saproxylic beetle assemblages, the amount of dead wood in commercial montane forests (at present approximate to 15 m(3) ha(-1)) needs to be tripled, with a focus on broadleaf wood in dense stands and spruce wood in open stands. For large protected areas in Europe, our data suggest that bark beetle infestation and senescence without active forest management improves habitat conditions for saproxylic beetles.

AB  - The identification of disturbance thresholds is important for many aspects of aquatic resource management, including the establishment of regulatory criteria and the identification of stream reference conditions. A number of quantitative or model-based approaches can be used to identify disturbance thresholds, including nonparametric deviance reduction (NDR), piecewise regression (PR), Bayesian changepoint (BCP), quantile piecewise constant (QPC), and quantile piecewise linear (QPL) approaches. These methods differ in their assumptions regarding the nature of the disturbance-response variable relationship, which can make selecting among the approaches difficult for those unfamiliar with the methods. We first provide an overview of each of the aforementioned approaches for identifying disturbance thresholds, including the types of data for which the approaches are intended. We then compare threshold estimates from each of these approaches to evaluate their robustness using both simulated and empirical datasets. We found that most of the approaches were accurate in estimating thresholds for datasets with drastic changes in responses variable at the disturbance threshold. Conversely, only the PR and QPL approaches performed well for datasets with conditional mean or upper boundary changes in response variables at the disturbance threshold. The most robust threshold identification approach appeared to be the QPL approach; this method provided relatively accurate threshold estimates for most of the evaluated datasets. Because accuracy of disturbance threshold estimates can be affected by a number of factors, we recommend that several steps be followed when attempting to identify disturbance thresholds. These steps include plotting and visually inspecting the disturbance-response data, hypothesizing what mechanisms likely generate the observed pattern in the disturbance-response data, and plotting the estimated threshold in relation to the disturbance-response data to ensure the appropriateness of the threshold estimate.

AB  - The humic acids (HAS) isolated from the sediments of the various rivers, lakes, and reservoirs in China were studied using elemental analyzer, fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and CP/MAS C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The results showed that the HAS were characterized by some common chemical and phygicochemical properties, but they also pose some differences in the C-containing functional groups. The C/N, C/H, O/C, and O/H ratios differ widely for the various HAS, showing that the elemental composition of the HAS from the various sediments was different due to the different environmental conditions. All HAS show similar spectra with different intense absorbance in the region of 4000-2000 cm(-1), suggesting that they have very similar structures and functional groups. The absorbance region between 1900 and 400 cm(-1) also showed similar spectra with different intense absorbance, different relative intensities, and some relevant differences for the various HAS. The total aromaticities for the six HAS varied from 23.1% to 41.8%. The differences in the elemental composition and functional groups for the various HAS were attributed to their different biogeochemical origins. The HAS in the sediments from Taihu Lake (one freshwater shallow lake with heavy eutrophication), the Pearl River (the tropical river), and the Liao River (located at the joint of the temperate zone and cold-temperate zone) showed different structural proper-ties due to their different geographical and climate zones. These different properties for the six HAS were expected to affect the sorption, distributions, and fates of heavy metals and organic chemicals.

AB  - The distribution and abundance of peracaridean fauna associated with the bryozoan Bugula neritina have been analysed according to their possible relationships with environmental stress on the coastline of Algeciras Bay. The spatial environmental variability along this bay has been established based on the analysis of five abiotic variables (hydrodynamism, siltation, suspended solids, and organic matter content) at six stations over a 12-month period. The temporal variability of these abiotic variables was not taken into account due to the method used in collecting the samples. The abundance and beta diversity of the peracarid fauna were also calculated monthly. Hydrodynamism was the only abiotic variable significantly correlated with beta diversity, with a linear regression model between the two variables (r = 0.81). The distributional pattern of the peracarids (based on the abundance matrix) was correlated with the environmental variables by matching samples' similarities using the Spearman rank correlation. This analysis showed that the combination of variables that best explains the patterns of distribution is hydrodynamism and siltation (p(s) = 0.665). Of the species considered the amphipods Ischyrocerus inexpectatus, Jassa marmorata and Podocerus variegatus were negatively correlated with hydrodynamisin and positively with temperature. The caprellidea Phtisica marina was also negatively correlated with hydrodynamism. On,the other hand, the amphipods Cressa mediterranea and Stenothoe dollfusi preferred environments with high hydrological forces and low sedimentation rate. Due to the particular environmental conditions where they live and their requirements, Gammaropsis maculata, Corophium acutum, J. marmorata, 1, inexpectatus, and P. variegatus were categorised as good indicator species in port environments. Others such as Aora spinicornis, Microjassa cumbrensis, and C. mediterranea were categorised as species well adapted to high hydrological forces.

AB  - Sediment toxicity test and bioassay protocols are currently being standardised in order to meet European legislative requirements for product assessments and environmental monitoring. Most existing test methods require that sediment-dwelling organisms are exposed to test substances bound to sediment in test systems with uncontaminated overlying water. These test systems have not been widely compared with responses of field populations under realistic exposure conditions. In this study, sediment toxicity data generated in the laboratory were compared with the response of a field population of the midge Chironomus riparius exposed to the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin. In the field this insecticide was applied to the overlying water column of artificial pond systems to give nominal concentrations of 1, 10, 50 and 100 mu g/L. The field response, as measured by larval density and adult emergence, was not predicted by bulk sediment chemical concentration, sediment toxicity test or laboratory bioassay results. All three measurements underestimated acute toxic effect. Rather, toxicity to C. riparius in the field was predicted more accurately using a short-term water-only toxicity test. No chronic or sublethal effects due-to sediment-bound permethrin were observed. This indicates that the primary route of exposure in the field was probably via the water column. Primary routes of exposure are difficult to predict a priori for different chemical types until the factors affecting bioavailability have been fully elucidated. Until this time, there isa need for the validation of predictive sediment toxicity tests and for the measurement of in situ biological response in conjunction with sediment chemistry and toxicity for environmental monitoring purposes, particularly when ongoing exposure via the water column is likely.

AB  - Detecting land cover change through very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images is helpful in supporting urban sustainable development, natural disaster evaluation, and environmental assessment. However, the intraclass spectral variance in VHR remote sensing images is usually larger than that of median-low remote sensing images. Furthermore, the bitemporal images are usually acquired under different atmospheric conditions, sun height, soil moisture, and other factors. Consequently, in practical applications, many pseudo changes are presented in the detected map. In this paper, an adaptive histogram trend (AHT) similarity approach is promoted to quantitatively measure the magnitude between the corresponding pixels in bitemporal images in terms of change semantic. In the proposed approach, to reduce the phenological effect on the bitemporal images of land cover change detection (LCCD), we first define the quantitative description of AHT. Second, the change magnitudes between pairwise pixels are quantitatively measured by an improved bin-to-bin (B2B) distance between the corresponding AHTs. Then, the change magnitudes between two entire bitemporal images are measured AHT-by-AHT. Finally, binary threshold methods, such as the Otsu method or the double-window flexible pace search (DFPS) method, are used to divide the change magnitude image into binary change detection maps and obtain the final change detection map. The performance of the AHT-based LCCD approach is verified by four pairs of VHR remote-sensing images that correspond to two types of real land cover change cases. The detected results based on the four pairs of bitemporal VHR images outperformed the compared state-of-the-art LCCD methods.

AB  - Peatlands in the Western Balkans are becoming rapidly reduced due to vegetation succession, further enhanced by climate change and abandonment of traditional land management practices. Currently, the peatlands of this region act as habitat islands embedded mainly in a forest landscape matrix. This allows them to host more forest and generalist species of animals and plants than would be expected from such ecosystem. We were interested in testing if a taxon, unspecialized for such extreme habitats, can maintain stable populations in a peatland, and how environmental fluctuations affect its spatio-temporal distributions along a successional gradient Terrestrial isopods were sampled in four habitat types: a fen, two successional habitats and a beech forest, with pitfall traps during two consecutive years. In total, 1069 individuals belonging to five species were recorded. Activity density increased more than four-fold along the successional gradient, from the fen to an older and more complex successional habitat. This pattern was governed by an increase in the structural complexity of the habitat, where succession habitats supported more favourable shelter sites for terrestrial isopods. Soil moisture decreased over 30% along the successional gradient Additionally, the older successional habitat was more nutrient rich than the fen, providing higher substrate quality for decomposers and enabling the survival of forest species. The fen was inhabited by a single species, Ligidium germanicum, while other species were extremely rare. Its seasonal activity started in the spring, reaching the maximum in June and decreasing at the end of summer. Spatial changes in isopod assemblages along the successional gradient imply that the groundwater level in the fen was sufficiently high to supress the invasion of forest species into the fen. Colonisation of the fen by terrestrial isopods will likely progress as environmental conditions become more suitable by progressive vegetation succession and climate change.

AB  - Standard ecotoxicity tests are conducted under constant and favorable experimental conditions. In natural communities, however, the toxicity of chemicals may be influenced by abiotic and biotic environmental factors. Firstly, the authors examined the influence of temperature and total food concentration on the nature of the combined effects of copper (Cu) and the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa to Daphnia magna (i.e., whether the combined effects deviated from noninteraction). Secondly, the authors investigated the relative influence of the percentage of M. aeruginosa in the diet, temperature, and total food concentration on chronic Cu toxicity to D. magna. The nature of the combined effects between Cu and M. aeruginosa (i.e., synergism according to the independent action reference model and noninteraction according to concentration addition reference model) was not affected by temperature and total food concentration. In line with other studies, the concentration addition reference model gave rise to more protective predictions of mixture toxicity than the independent action reference model, thus confirming the former model's suitability as a conservative scenario for evaluating mixture toxicity of Cu and M. aeruginosa under the temperature and food concentrations tested. Further, the 21-d median effective concentration for Cu based on reproduction varied between 20g/L and 100g/L, and the results indicate that the percentage of M. aeruginosa explained 76% of the variance in the Cu median effective concentration for reproduction, whereas the effects of temperature and total food were limited (together explaining 11% of the variance). The present study suggests that environmental risk assessment of Cu should consider specific situations where harmful M. aeruginosa blooms can co-occur with elevated Cu exposure.

AB  - The ecosystem-based management of nearshore waters requires synthesis of spatial data on the distribution of ecological conditions and intensity of anthropogenic perturbations, and the overlay of their effects on the ecosystem health. An assessment framework for ecosystem health incorporating 4 components namely vigor, organization, resilience and maintenance was proposed in this paper, based on which an analytical approach was developed to quantify the integrated effects of island mass and anthropogenic pressures on the waters of nearshore archipelago. The southern waters of Miaodao Archipelago, which are located in the intersection of the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea, China, were taken as a typical example to acquire the spatial heterogeneity of the ecosystem health and its sensitivity to multiple anthropogenic pressures. Results indicated that there was a relatively significant performance of the spatial heterogeneity for the ecosystem health. It presented that the interisland waters were poorer health than the external waters, and the waters adjacent to the continent functioned less well than those in a relatively open area. This phenomenon was primarily determined by the performance of vigor as well as resilience of ecosystem. For the 4 components of ecosystem health, there were an obvious spatial heterogeneity of vigor as well as the resilience, a seasonal succession of organization, and a spatiotemporal uniformity of maintenance. Moreover, the ecosystem health was more sensitive to the stressors of inland activities and coastline exploitation especially in the waters of Miaodao Bay and Changdao Port. The analytical process and resulting maps provide flexible tools for regional efforts to implement ecosystem-based management in the waters of archipelago and further nearshore waters so as to promote their sustainable development.

AB  - Understanding the nature of interactions between nanomaterials, such as commercially ubiquitous hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) nanorhombohedra (N-Rhomb) and biological systems is of critical importance for gaining insight into the practical applicability of nanomaterials. Microglia represent the first line of defense in the central nervous system (CNS) during severe injury or disease such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease as illustrative examples. Hence, to analyze the potential cytotoxic effect of N-Rhomb exposure in the presence of microglia, we have synthesized Rhodamine B (RhB)-labeled alpha-Fe2O3 N-Rhomb, with lengths of 47 +/- 10 nm and widths of 35 +/- 8 nm. Internalization of RhB-labeled alpha-Fe2O3 N-Rhomb by microglia in the mouse brain was observed, and a dose-dependent increase in the cellular iron content as probed by cellular fluorescence was detected in cultured microglia after nanoparticle exposure. The cells maintained clear functional viability, exhibiting little to no cytotoxic effects after 24 and 48 hours at acceptable, physiological concentrations. Importantly, the nanoparticle exposure did not induce microglial cells to produce either tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) or interleukin 1-beta (IL1 beta), two pro-inflammatory cytokines, nor did exposure stimulate the production of nitrites and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are common indicators for the onset of inflammation. Finally, we propose that under the conditions of our experiments, i. e. in the presence of RhB labeled-alpha-Fe2O3 N-Rhomb maintaining concentrations of up to 100 mu g mL(-1) after 48 hours of incubation, the in vitro and in vivo internalization of RhB-labeled alpha-Fe2O3 N-Rhomb are likely to be clathrin-dependent, which represents a conventional mechanistic uptake route for most cells. Given the crucial role that microglia play in many neurological disorders, understanding the potential cytotoxic effects of these nanostructures is of fundamental importance if they are to be used in a therapeutic setting.

AB  - In this experiment, we studied the transcriptional and functional (enzymatic) responses of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) to metal stress, with a focus on oxidative stress and vitamin A metabolism. juvenile yellow perch were exposed to two environmentally relevant concentrations of waterborne cadmium (Cd) and nickel (Ni) for a period of 6 weeks. Kidney Cd and Ni bioaccumulation significantly increased with increasing metal exposure. The major retinoid metabolites analyzed in liver and muscle decreased with metal exposure except at high Cd exposure where no variation was reported in liver. A decrease in free plasma dehydroretinol was also observed with metal exposure. In the liver of Cd-exposed fish, both epidermal retinol dehydrogenase 2 transcription level and corresponding enzyme activities retinyl ester hydrolase and lecithin dehydroretinyl acyl transferase increased. In contrast, muscle epidermal retinal dehydrogenase 2 transcription level decreased with Cd exposure. Among antioxidant defences, liver transcription levels of catalase, microsomal glutathione-S-transferase-3 and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were generally enhanced in Cd-exposed fish and this up-regulation was accompanied by an increase in-the activities of corresponding enzymes, except for microsomal glutathione-S-transferase. No consistent pattern in antioxidant defence responses was observed between molecular and biochemical response when fish were exposed to Ni, suggesting a non-synchronous response of antioxidant defence in fish exposed to waterborne Ni. There was a general lack of consistency between muscle transcription level and enzyme activities analyzed. The overall findings from this investigation highlight the usefulness of transcriptional and biochemical endpoints in the identification of oxidative stress and vitamin A metabolism impairment biomarkers and the potential use of multi-level biological approaches when assessing environmental risk in fish.

AB  - The interactions between invertebrates and micro-organisms living in streambed sediments often play key roles in the regulation of nutrient and organic matter fluxes in aquatic ecosystems. However, benthic sediments also constitute a privileged compartment for the accumulation of persistent organic pollutants such as PAHs or PCBs that may affect the diversity, abundance and activity of benthic organisms. The objective of this study was to quantify the impact of sediment contamination with the PAH benzo(a)pyrene on the interaction between micro-organisms and the tubificid worm, Tubifex tubifex, which has been recognized as a major bioturbator in freshwater sediments. Sedimentary microcosms (slow filtration columns) contaminated or not with benzo(a)pyrene (3 tested concentrations: 0, 1 and 5 mg kg(-1)) at the sediment surface were incubated under laboratory conditions in the presence (100 individuals) or absence of T. tubifex. Although the surface sediment contaminations with 1 mg kg(-1) and 5 mg kg(-1) of benzo(a)pyrene did not affect tubificid worm survival, these contaminations significantly influenced the role played by T. tubifex in biogeochemical processes. Indeed, tubificid worms stimulated aerobic respiration, denitrification, dehydrogenase and hydrolytic activities of micro-organisms in uncontaminated sediments whereas such effects were inhibited in sediments polluted with benzo(a)pyrene. This inhibition was due to contaminant-induced changes in bioturbation (and especially bio-irrigation) activities of worms and their resulting effects on microbial processes. This study reveals the importance of sublethal concentrations of a contaminant on ecological processes in river sediments through affecting bioturbator-microbe interactions. Since they affect microbial processes involved in water purification processes, such impacts of sublethal concentrations of pollutants should be more often considered in ecosystem health assessment.

AB  - Leaves of Mediterranean evergreens experience large variations in gas exchange rates over their life span due to aging and seasonally changing environmental conditions. Accounting for the changing respiratory physiology of leaves over time will help improve estimations of leaf and whole-plant carbon balances. Here we examined seasonal variations in light-saturated net CO2 assimilation (A(max)), dark respiration (R-d) and the proportional change in R-d per 10 degrees C change in temperature (Q(10) of R-d) in previous-year (PY) and current-year (CY) leaves of the broadleaved evergreen tree Quercus ilex L. A(max) and R-d were lower in PY than in CY leaves. Differences in nitrogen between cohorts only partly explained such differences, and rates of A(max) and R-d expressed per unit of leaf nitrogen were still significantly different between cohorts. The decline in A(max) in PY leaves did not result in the depletion of total non-structural carbohydrates, whose concentration was in fact higher in PY than CY leaves. Leaf-level carbon balance modeled from gas exchange data was positive at all ages. Q(10) of R-d did not differ significantly between leaf cohorts; however, failure to account for distinct R-d between cohorts misestimated canopy leaf respiration by 13% across dates when scaling up leaf measurements to the canopy. In conclusion, the decline in A(max) in old leaves that are close to or exceed their mean life span does not limit the availability of carbohydrates, which are probably needed to sustain new growth, as well as R-d and nutrient resorption during senescence. Accounting for leaf age as a source of variation of R-d improves the estimation of foliar respiratory carbon release at the stand scale.

AB  - We studied the bioavailability and toxicity of copper, zinc, arsenic, cadmium, and lead in sediments from Lake Roosevelt (LR), a reservoir on the Columbia River in Washington, USA that receives inputs of metals from an upstream smelter facility. We characterized chronic sediment toxicity, metal bioaccumulation, and metal concentrations in sediment and pore water from eight study sites: one site upstream in the Columbia River, six sites in the reservoir, and a reference site in an uncontaminated tributary. Total recoverable metal concentrations in LR sediments generally decreased from upstream to downstream in the study area, but sediments from two sites in the reservoir had metal concentrations much lower than adjacent reservoir sites and similar to the reference site, apparently due to erosion of uncontaminated bank soils. Concentrations of acid-volatile sulfide in LR sediments were too low to provide strong controls on metal bioavailability, and selective sediment extractions indicated that metals in most LR sediments were primarily associated with iron and manganese oxides. Oligochaetes (Lumbriculus variegatus) accumulated greatest concentrations of copper from the river sediment, and greatest concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, and lead from reservoir sediments. Chronic toxic effects on amphipods (Hyalella azteca; reduced survival) and midge larvae (Chironomus dilutus; reduced growth) in whole-sediment exposures were generally consistent with predictions of metal toxicity based on empirical and equilibrium partitioning-based sediment quality guidelines. Elevated metal concentrations in pore waters of some LR sediments suggested that metals released from iron and manganese oxides under anoxic conditions contributed to metal bioaccumulation and toxicity. Results of both chemical and biological assays indicate that metals in sediments from both riverine and reservoir habitats of Lake Roosevelt are available to benthic invertebrates. These findings will be used as part of an ongoing ecological risk assessment to determine remedial actions for contaminated sediments in Lake Roosevelt.

AB  - Combined lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) and greater scaup (A. marila) populations decreased from the 1980s to the 1990s and have not recovered. Factors limiting reproduction, including effects of contaminants and trace elements, have been highlighted as a concern in female scaup, but no studies have examined possible effects on male scaup. We examined the effects of cadmium, mercury, selenium, and corticosterone on pair status and on male reproductive indices, including testosterone, testes mass, and seminiferous tubule diameter, in male lesser scaup collected in the western boreal forest near Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, May and June, during 2004 and 2005. Male scaup that were larger in size (p = 0.048) and with better body condition (p = 0.038) were more likely to be paired. No relations were observed between independent variables and testosterone and testes mass. However, results suggested that seminiferous tubule diameter is influenced by a complex array of biologic and toxicologic parameters, which differ depending on pair status. Tubule diameters of paired male scaup were negatively influenced by hormones, whereas contaminants influenced diameter in unpaired male scaup. The effects of selenium were attenuated when bound with cadmium but not mercury. When selenium concentrations were high (greater than median value), there was a positive effect of cadmium on tubule diameter (R-2 = 0.30, n = 10, p = 0.007) but a negative relation with mercury (R-2 = 0.15, n = 10, p = 0.09). Seminiferous tubule diameter may be a sensitive indicator of sublethal effects of contaminants. This study showed contaminant and trace element effects at concentrations lower than threshold levels associated with major toxic effects. This study also demonstrated the complex nature of biologic systems and the importance of considering interactions to accurately characterize effects of metals.

AB  - Global warming has had numerous effects on populations of animals and plants, with many species in temperate regions experiencing environmental change at unprecedented rates. Populations with low potential for adaptive evolutionary change and plasticity will have little chance of persistence in the face of environmental change. Assessment of the potential for adaptive evolution requires the estimation of quantitative genetic parameters, but it is as yet unclear what impact, if any, global warming will have on the expression of genetic variances and covariances. Here we assess the impact of a changing climate on the genetic architecture underlying three reproductive traits in a wild bird population. We use a large, long-term, data set collected on great tits (Parus major) in Wytham Woods, Oxford, and an 'animal model' approach to quantify the heritability of, and genetic correlations among, laying date, clutch size and egg mass during two periods with contrasting temperature conditions over a 40-year period (1965-1988 [cooler] vs. 1989-2004 [warmer]). We found significant additive genetic variance and heritability for all traits under both temperature regimes. We also found significant negative genetic covariances and correlations between clutch size and egg weight during both periods, and among laying date and clutch size in the colder years only. The overall G matrix comparison among periods, however, showed only a minor difference among periods, thus suggesting that genotype by environment interactions are negligible in this context. Our results therefore suggest that despite substantial changes in temperature and in mean laying date phenotype over the last decades, and despite the large sample sizes available, we are unable to detect any significant change in the genetic architecture of the reproductive traits studied.

AB  - Most physical habitat models such as PHABSIM (Physical HABitat SIMulation) calculate the Usable Area (UA) of the river surface or the riverbed as an indicator for the available habitat for a species of interest. Although these models have been widely applied, the three dimensionality of habitat hydraulics is increasingly being recognized as an essential issue for understanding the ecological needs of aquatic organisms. This paper describes the modular toolbox HaMoSOFT (Habitat Modelling SOFTware) which quantifies the available habitat as the Usable Volume (UV) for each class of depth, flow velocity, substrate and cover and for all possible class combinations. The toolbox was calibrated in an artificial river under laboratory conditions. Optimal grids for field sampling were defined by comparing model results based on reduced sampling densities. The UV of a natural river stretch, the Schwechat River in Austria, was analysed at different discharges to assess the impact of flow changes on model outputs. UA and UV percentages were modelled for five cross-sectional datasets, one collected in the artificial river, one in the Zwalm River (Belgium) and three in the Schwechat River at different discharges. UA percentages appeared to be higher than those of UV for lower flow velocity classes in all natural rivers and for lower depth classes in all rivers. Analysis of the Usable Volumes for the three Schwechat River scenarios revealed the observed trends were independent of flow changes. The results indicate HaMoSOFT is an interesting tool to overcome some shortcomings of Weighted Usable Area (WUA) modelling. Since the UV method is a trade-off between the practical needs for model application in river management and the complexity of the three-dimensional hydraulic models, it may be a practical approach for realistic physical habitat quantification.

AB  - Here we report the effects of a natural altitudinal gradient of UV-B radiation, from 1140 to 1816 m altitude, on the physiology of the aquatic liverwort Jungermannia exsertifolia Steph. subsp. cordifolia (Dumort.) Va (n) over tildea collected in mountain streams. Photosynthetic pigments, net photosynthesis and dark respiration rates, chlorophyll fluorescence, protein concentration, sclerophylly, and UV-absorbing compounds [both global UV absorbance of methanol-extractable UV-absorbing compounds (MEUVAC) and concentrations of five individual compounds] were measured. Two new caffeic acid derivatives were discovered: 5''-(7'',8''-dihydroxycoumaroyl)-2-caffeoylmalic acid and 5''-(7'',8''-dihydroxy-7-O-beta-glucosyl-coumaroyl)-2-caffeoylmalic acid, whereas three additional compounds were already known in other species: p-coumaroylmalic acid, phaselic acid ( both compounds in their cis- and trans- forms) and feruloylmalic acid. Most physiological variables changed considerably along the altitudinal gradient, but only six showed significant linear relationships with altitude: MEUVAC levels, the concentrations of the two new secondary compounds, the maximal apparent electron transport rate through PSII (ETRmax) and the maximal non- photochemical quenching (NPQ(max)) increased with altitude, whereas photoinhibition percentage decreased. A principal components analysis (PCA) was conducted to rank the values of the physiological and ecological variables obtained along the altitudinal transect, showing that those variables correlated with altitude were responsible for the ordination of the sampling points. The liverwort was not adversely affected by the changing conditions along the altitudinal gradient and, in particular, by the increasing UV-B irradiance, probably because the characteristics shown by high-altitude populations may confer tolerance to high UV-B levels. The response to UV-B of the two new compounds suggests that they could be used as indicators of the spatial changes in UV-B radiation.

AB  - Solid friable residues (i.e. Ash) from combusted oil shale are a major environmental issue because they are highly enriched with toxic elements following combustion. The synchrotron based techniques X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) were used for determining the changes in speciation of Chromium (Cr) and Vanadium (V) in the ash and its mixtures with Red soil and Phosphogypsum as additives, through one-year period of hydration process. The X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) qualitative results indicate that all mixtures exhibits similar patterns showing that Vanadium has remain as pentavalent state, on the contrary Chromium has dramatic decreased from hexavalent to trivalent. This change in Cr speciation became clearer with increasing hydration period. Therefore, the results confirmed the advantage of the hydration process in the Cr(VI) reduction which might be due the domination of carbonate phase within all mixtures, thus hydration caused carbonate dissolution that increase the pH toward more alkaline which caused the Cr(IV) reduction into less-harmful and less mobile Cr(III). This increase in pH was not in favor of changing the V(V) into V(IV) due to its large stability field V(V). The Extend X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) analysis showed that Cr exhibiting a coordination shell of C-atoms as first nearest neighbors backscattering atoms around Cr, and at C-atoms backscattering at medium range order. This confirmed the domination of carbonate media through the best fitting of Cr-C. Which might be attributed to the more alkaline conditions developed during saturation of water (hydration), that accelerates of the reduction of Cr(VI) into Cr(III). This means simply that hydration of the ash can reduce the presence of harmful Cr(VI) in these ash tailings.

AB  - Freshwater organisms are threatened by changes in stream flow and water temperature regimes due to global climate change and anthropogenic activities. Threats include the disappearance of narrow-tolerance species and loss of favorable thermal conditions for cold-adapted organisms. Mayflies are an abundant and diverse indicator of river health that performs important functional roles. The relative importance of key hydro-environmental factors such as water temperature and flow volumes in structuring these communities has rarely been explored in the tropical regions of Africa. Here, we investigate the response of mayfly species diversity to these factors in the Luvuvhu catchment, a strategic water source area in the arid northeastern region of South Africa. Mayfly larvae were sampled monthly in stones-in-current biotopes across 23 sites over a one-year period. The relationship between these environmental drivers and mayfly diversity was modeled using linear mixed effects models (LMMs) and a model-based multivariate approach. Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN) was used to model the response of mayfly species to important gradients and identify thresholds of change. Site-specific characteristic were the most important predictor of mayfly diversity, and there was considerable variation over time, with mayfly diversity peaking during winter. Along this, gradient temperature was the best predictor of assemblage structure, with five out of six reliable indicator species being cold-adapted, and a community threshold response at 19 degrees C. Results support laboratory-based thresholds of temperature for mayfly species survival and development, extending empirical evidence to include field-based observations. Increased global (climate change) and local (riparian vegetation removal, impoundments) changes are predicted to have negative impacts on mayfly diversity and ultimately on ecosystem function.

AB  - Background: Snakes feed on germ-infested rodents, while water monitor lizards thrive on rotten matter in unhygienic conditions. We hypothesize that such creatures survive the assault of superbugs and are able to fend off disease by producing antimicrobial substances. In this study, we investigated the potential antibacterial activity of sera/lysates of animals living in polluted environments.
   Methods: Snake (Reticulatus malayanus), rats (Rattus rattus), water monitor lizard (Varanus salvator), frog (Lithobates catesbeianus), fish (Oreochromis mossambicus), chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), and pigeon (Columba livia) were dissected and their organ lysates/sera were collected. Crude extracts were tested for bactericidal effects against neuropathogenic E. coli K1, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. To determine whether lysates/sera protect human cells against bacterialmediated damage, cytotoxicity assays were performed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release as an indicator of cell death. Lysates/sera were partially characterized using heat-treatment and pronasetreatment and peptide sequences were determined using the Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS).
   Results: Snake and water monitor lizard sera exhibited potent broad-spectrum bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested. Heat inactivation and pronase-treatment inhibited bactericidal effects indicating that activity is heat-labile and pronase-sensitive suggesting that active molecules are proteinaceous in nature. LCMS analyses revealed the molecular identities of peptides.
   Conclusion: The results revealed that python that feeds on germ-infested rodents and water monitor lizards that feed on rotten organic waste possess antibacterial activity in a heat-sensitive manner and several peptides were identified. We hope that the discovery of antibacterial activity in the sera of animals living in polluted environments will stimulate research in finding antibacterial agents from unusual sources as this has the potential for the development of novel strategies in the control of infectious diseases.

AB  - Temperate grasslands, including those of northern Eurasia, are among the most imperiled ecosystems on Earth. Eighty percent ofMongolia's land area is rangeland, where interacting climate, land-use and changes in governance threaten the sustainability of Mongolia's rangelands and pastoral culture. Particularly concerning are the potential ecological impacts of changing pastoral grazing practices-namely declining use of grazing reserves and pastoral mobility. However, like other grazing practices globally, there have been no empirical studies to evaluate the effects of specific Mongolian grazing practices on ecological function at a management scale. We collected data on the grazing practices of 130 pastoral households across four ecological zones and sampled ecological conditions in their winter pastures. We used a novel social-ecological analysis process to (1) develop integrated, holistic indicators of ecological function using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, and (2) assess the effects of individual grazing practices on these indicators using statistical matching to control for confounding management and contextual factors. We identified two latent factors related to ecological and pastoral resilience: Factor 1 represents resource retention and soil stability and Factor 2 represents species richness and functional diversity. Using these two factors as response variables, we found that the values of both resilience factors were higher in pastures where households made fall or winter otor migrations or set aside grazing reserves. This study provides the first management-scale empirical test of the ecological response to specific grazing practices in Mongolia, using an approach that can be applied in other rangeland systems. Our findings highlight the importance to ecological and pastoral resilience of supporting traditional pastoral practices of mobility and grazing reserves, while also controlling stocking densities, increasing rangeland monitoring, and ensuring equitable access to state-designated emergency grazing reserves at local, regional, and national levels.

AB  - This study develops and applies an interdisciplinary and mixed method approach to operationalize the social-ecological systems (SES) framework in the context of aquaculture, the fastest growing food production sector worldwide. We apply this methodology to conduct a case study of community-based pond aquaculture on the island of Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. This diagnostic approach demonstrates how sustainability challenges are interrelated at multiple levels through an analysis applying common-pool resource (CPR) and collective action theories. At the community level, qualitative data show how pond aquaculture systems can have CPR dilemmas, requiring communities to work together to solve them. We show how a provision dilemma manifests from the need to maintain common canal infrastructure to distribute water to private ponds. Asymmetric incentives to contribute exist because there are up and downstream users in the pond network, similar to some irrigation systems. Second, at the level of individual ponds, we developed indicators for the Resource System, Resource Unit, Governance and Actor tiers of the SES framework. Indicator data for each pond was measured and transformed into normalized quantitative scores to examine the relationships between social and ecological outcomes within and between ponds. We combine the results of our multi-level analysis to discuss the broader social-ecological relationships which link collective action challenges in managing common canal infrastructure with pond level outcomes and current government policies for advancing community development. We emphasize the need for increased knowledge and training on effective aquaculture practice as an underlying driver of current system conditions. This study raises many methodological challenges associated with designing empirically based SES research and building SES theory. We discuss challenges with integrating diverse data types, indicator selection and making normative assumptions about sustainability.

AB  - Background: Benthic macroinvertebrates are commonly used as indicators of the biological condition of waterbodies. Both the benthic macroinvertebrates and the physicochemical properties of the water provide important information about the pollution of a water environment. Goals: To investigate the relationships between assemblage composition of Oligochaeta (Annelida), Chironomidae (Diptera), and other macroinvertebrates with physical and chemical water variables in the Meric River, Turkey. Methods: This study was carried out by taking water and benthic samples at 8 stations at monthly intervals in order to determine what macrobenthic fauna exist in the Meric River and what environmental properties affect their distribution. Results: A total of 39 taxa were found and we determined that there is an average of 851 individuals per m(2). Also, this study established the first records for Brachium sowerbyii (Oligochaeta) and Pottashia alternis (Chironomidae) in the Turkish Thrace region. According to Shannon-Wiener index, while it was determined that Meric River has the highest diversity values with H' = 0.845 at the station 4, the river has the poorest diversity with H'= 0.477 at the station 2. Also, we examined similarities of distribution of Oligochaeta taxa by station and month using the Bray-Curtis index. Accordingly, while stations 6 and 8 were determined to be the most similar to each other, stations 2 and 5 were the least similar. The relationships between Oligochaeta taxa and physical and chemical parameters of water were evaluated using the Spearman Correlation index. As a result, we found that water temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, hydrogen sulfide, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, chlorine, salinity, dissolved oxygen and biological oxygen have positive correlations with some species of Oligochaeta, while nitrate and nitrite have negative correlations with some species of Oligochaeta. Conclusions: We made a number of suggestions for sustainable usage of this river.

AB  - Changes in clutch and egg size in many avian species have been linked to seasonal variation, female physiological state, and laying date during breeding season. These reproductive variables have also been linked to population status and habitat variables. Recent declines in Herring Gull (Larus argentatus) populations in the Atlantic region may be associated with environmental changes, fishery activities, or natural species interactions and fluctuations. We studied variability and trends in Herring Gull egg, clutch, and population size at a cluster of three islands of the Grand Manan Archipelago in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. A generalized linear model investigating variability in Herring Gull egg volume over a 28-year period (1988 to 2015) showed increasing egg volume since a low in 2000, significant positive correlations with regional fisheries landings, and weak interactions with sea surface temperature and the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. Herring Gull egg size decreased by 11.6% from 1988 to 2000, but both egg size and clutch size have increased significantly since 2001. A 2015/2016 population estimate of the three islands showed a 36% decline in Herring Gull numbers since 2001. Changes in annual and seasonal availability of various fishery related food sources, specifically decreasing Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) and groundfish landings and increasing American lobster (Homarus americanus) landings, may be linked to these increases in reproductive variables. However, it appears that other factors may be influencing the declining gull population because despite increased availability of alternative food sources and increased clutch size and egg volume, there has been no documented increase in abundance. Interspecific interactions, anthropogenic activities, and climatic variability may also have a role in these population dynamics.

AB  - This study shares the experience of the Integrated Conservation Program for the black-faced lion tamarin, Leontopithecus caissara, on measuring its conservation success. We present the program history and evaluate its impact from 2005 until 2014 in the Ariri region, at Cananeia, Sao Paulo, Brazil. To assess impact we combined an evaluation of the Econegotiation, a strategy that looks for involve various social segments into conservation through participative forums, with the Threat Reduction Assessment. Econegotiations analysis made possible to estimate the reduction of direct threats, which is considered the most difficult step in the application of Threat Reduction Assessment. We identified a 20-30% reduction in threats, expressed by better political coherence and use of natural resources within the region. Our study revealed two factors that influence the success of integrated conservation and development projects: (i) the ability to integrate in the local context and influence it to make biodiversity conservation an interest shared by diverse actors and leaders, and (ii) the weight of our biocentric vision in defining the target condition constrains the calculation of Threat Reduction Assessment. As lessons learned, we highlight vital aspects to consider in conservation and sustainability: (i) initial effort to know the territory's social, cultural, and economic profile; (ii) clarity of direction and focus on the program's mission; (iii) consolidation of partnerships at all levels; and (iv) strategy to discuss, understand, and overcome conflicts, such as Econegotiations in the black-faced lion tamarin program, can act on critical threats and identify approaches and partnerships to reduce them.

AB  - The risks posed by nutrient deposition due to air pollution on ecosystems and their respective services to human beings can be appropriately estimated by bioindicator plants when they are well acclimated to the study region environmental conditions. This assumption encouraged us to comparatively evaluate the accumulation potential of ryegrass cv. Lema and guava cv. Paluma macro and micronutrients. We also indicated the most appropriate species for biomonitoring nutrient contamination risks in tropical areas of Southeastern Brazil, which are characterized by marked dry and wet seasons and complex mixtures of air pollutants from different sources (industries, vehicle traffic and agriculture). The study was conducted in 14 sites with different neighboring land uses, within the Metropolitan Region of Campinas, central-eastern region of Sao Paulo State. The exposure experiments with ryegrass and guava were consecutively repeated 40 (28 days each) and 12 (84 days each) times, respectively, from Oct/2010 to Sept/2013. Macro and micronutrients were analyzed and background concentrations and enrichment ratios (ER) were estimated to classify the contamination risk within the study region. Significantly higher ER suggested that ryegrass were the most appropriate accumulator species for N, S, Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn deposition and guava for K, Ca, P and B deposition. Based on these biomonitoring adjustments, we concluded that the nutrient deposition was spatially homogeneous in the study area, but clear seasonality in the contamination risk by nutritional inputs was evidenced. Significantly higher contamination risk by S, Fe, K and B occurred during the dry season and enhanced contamination risk by Mn, Cu and Zn were highlighted during the wet season. Distinctly high contamination risk was estimated for S, Fe and Mn in several exposure experiments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Alternative cropping systems have been proposed to enhance sustainability of agriculture, but their mid and long-term effects on soil biodiversity should be studied more carefully. Earthworms, having important agro-ecological functions, are regarded as indicators of soil biological health. Species composition, abundance, and biomasses of earthworms were measured in autumn 2005-2007 (period 1) and 2011-2013 (period 2) in a trial initiated in 1997 near Paris, France. A conventional, an organic and a direct seeded living mulch-based cropping systems were compared. Earthworms were sampled in a wheat crop by combining the application of a chemical expellant and hand-sorting.
   In period 1, earthworm abundance did not usually differ in the three cropping systems, but sometimes it was higher in the conventional system. Mean total abundance was 122, 121 and 149 individuals m (2) in period 1 and 408, 386 and 216 in period 2 in the organic, living mulch and conventional systems respectively. While earthworm abundance and biomass increased slightly in the conventional system between the two periods, they at least tripled in the other two systems. This was mainly due to the species Aporrectodea caliginosa and Aporrectodea longa in the living mulch cropping system, and to A. caliginosa, Lumbricus castaneus, Lumbricus terrestris and A. longa in the organic system.
   After at least 14 years, organic and living mulch cropping systems contained between 1.5 and 2.3 times more earthworms than the conventional system. Considering the inter-annual variations in earthworm communities due to climatic conditions and cultural practices, earthworm communities should be assessed over several years before conclusions can be drawn. Moreover, since changes in cultural practices may take a long time to affect earthworm communities, mid and long-term trials are needed to assess the effects of cropping systems on soil biodiversity.

AB  - The epiphytic macro in vertebrate communities associated with the Common Reed, Phragmites australis (Cav) Trin. ex Steudel, were examined seasonally from summer 2004 to spring 2005 in eleven coastal lagoons of the Llobregat Delta (NE Spain) following the method proposed by Kornijow & Kairesalo (1994). The aims of the study were to: 1) characterise and quantify changes in epiphytic macroinvertebrate communities along environmental gradients: 2) assess the contribution of elements of the epiphytic compartment to structuring the community: 3) define the optima and tolerances of selected epiphytic macroinvertebrate taxa for the most relevant ecological factors responsible for assemblage composition; and 4) identify possible epiphytic species assemblages that would allow a logoon's typology to be established, as well as their representative indicator species, Communities showed statistically significant seasonal variation, with two faunal peaks: one in summer, with high chironomid densities, and the other in winter, with high naidid densities. These peaks showed a clear response to the influence of environment factors. Salinity explained the highest percentage of total variance (36%), while trophic variables (nutrients, phytoplanktonic chlorophyll-a, and total organic carbon) and epiphyton biomass (19.2 and 4% of total variance explained, respectively were secondary. Three different epiphytic mocroinvertebrate species assemblages could be defined. These assemblages were directly linked to conductivity conditions, which determined the rate of survival of certain taxa, and to the existence of a direct connection with the sea, which permitted the establishment of "brackish-water", species. In spite of the existence of these species assemblages, the species composition and biomass of epiphytic macroinvertebrates and epiphyton differed substantially between lagoons: both elements were subject to changes in the environment, which finally determined the site-to-site variation in the density and composition of the macroinvertebrate population.

AB  - In the tropics, most of the extreme weather events are convective in nature. Many parts over the Indian region experience thunderstorms at higher frequency during the pre-monsoon months (March-May), when the atmosphere is highly. unstable because of high temperatures prevailing at lower levels. During April and May, the eastern and northeastern parts of the country, i.e. Gangetic West Bengal, Jharkhand, Orissa, Bihar, Assam and parts of other northeastern states are affected by higher frequency of severe thunderstorms, locally named as 'Kal-baishakhi' or 'Nor' westers'. Realizing the importance of better understanding and prediction of these severe local storms over east and northeast India and their socio-economic impact, the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India organized a national coordinated programme on 'Severe Thunderstorm Observation and Regional Modelling (STORM)' to be carried out in the pre-monsoon season of 2006-10. Mesoscale models are essential for the accurate prediction of such high-impact weather events. In the present study, an attempt has been made to simulate one thunderstorm event that occurred on 20 May 2006 at Kolkata (22.52 degrees N, 88.37 degrees E) during the field experiment of STORM 2006, using Non-hydrostatic Mesoscale Model (NMM) core of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) system with different initial conditions. This model has been developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/National Centers for Environment Prediction. The model results are validated with STORM field experiment data. The model performed well in capturing stability indices, which act as indicators of severe convective activity along with the thunderstorm-affected parameters as in the observations. The results of these analyses show that the 3 km WRF-NMM has better capability when it comes to thunderstorm simulation. This suggests that high-resolution models have the potential to provide unique and valuable information for severe thunderstorm forecasters.

AB  - The implementation schedule for the EU water framework directive requires the creation of monitoring programmes for water bodies according to the intensity of the pollution risk by the end of 2006. Until 2009 river basin district management programmes have to be established followed by the implementation of measures from the management plans (until 2012). The WAgriCo-project (Water Resources Management in Cooperation with Agriculture), is a collaborative project funded by the European Commission Life Fund within the period October 2005 to September 2008, involving six British and four German institutions. The WAgriCo-project is based around the catchment management process, of identifying diffuse pollution issues and potential management solutions, involving land managers/advisors to implement methods and to assess their effectiveness in terms of pollution reduction and costs. For a basic understanding of the interactions between these issues an integrated hydrological/hydrogeological conceptual model has been set up. The model consists of three main features: natural characteristic assessment, anthropogenic impact assessment using monitoring data and model tools providing a linkage between the first two parts.
   In this paper the application of the integrated hydrological/hydrogeological conceptual model for geographical prioritization and determination of environmental target areas in the case study area Grosse Aue in the Federal State of Lower Saxony, Germany is described and discussed. It is demonstrated how area differentiated parameters like the denitrification condition in soils, the runoff ratio, nitrate concentrations in the leachate and groundwater monitoring data are determined and combined in order to determine target areas. With the given example of the case study area Grosse Aue, the importance of defining the receptor of nitrate outputs (groundwater or surface water) and the environmental target prior to the delineation of environmental target areas could be shown.

AB  - Stable light isotopes in ratite eggshells have been shown to be reliable indicators of shifts in climate and environmental conditions in the past. Here, we show that delta(18)O and delta(13)C values in fossil and modern ratite eggshells collected in the aeolianite deposits of the southern and central Namib Desert track regional distinctions and global climate shifts throughout the Neogene. 6180 values, although variable, are consistently higher in the central compared to the southern Namib throughout the record. delta(18)O trends during the Miocene differ for the two regions, but track each other post-Miocene. Throughout the Miocene, delta(13)C values for ratite eggshells from both the central and Southern Namib regions are indistinguishable showing that the flora remained C-3 throughout. The overall negative (-3 parts per thousand) shift in mean values for Miocene biostratigraphic zones is consistent with the response of C-3 photosynthesis to pCO(2) shifts from 180 to 320ppmv as estimated from marine alkenone studies and/or evolution of the delta(13)C of the atmospheric CO2. Evidence for C-4 plants occurs post-Miocene, with the development of the southern, winter rainfall and central/northern, summer rainfall zonation apparent today. These data provide independent corroboration that the expansion Of C-4-dominated ecosystems after similar to 7 Ma cannot be attributed to a reduction Of pCO(2) below a 500 ppmv threshold, as earlier proposed. Proliferation of C-4 plants in the Namib after similar to 5 Ma and, elsewhere, may be related rather to energy budgets and rainfall seasonality shifts resulting from large-scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation reorganisation.

AB  - Our purpose was to define a quantitative and expeditious method to analyze the effects of processes that influence species distribution and abundance at different organizational scales. We considered habitat loss, the breaking apart of habitat patches, and habitat structural alteration critical processes that affect species distribution and abundance. We evaluated the effects of these processes by considering the response of selected indicator species to isolation (landscape scale), patch size and edge effect (patch scale), and habitat structure (plot scale). We used broadleaf forests as our case-study ecosystem and birds as indicator species. Faunal data came from a georeferenced, long-term, breeding-bird database, and environmental data were obtained from field surveys and land-use digital cartography. Birds, grouped according to their sensitivity to patch isolation, patch size, edge effect, and habitat structure, indicated how environmental conditions affected species abundance. The most sensitive group to the above-mentioned processes included the Marsh Tit (Parus palustris), Nuthatch (Sitta europaea), and Short-toed Treecreeper (Certhia brachydactyla). We evaluated the umbrella effect of these species for the conservation of the other co-occurring birds and found that their effectiveness varied according to the criterion used to select sites for protection. Site selection based on indicator species identified forest patches with greater species abundance than an alternative criterion that chose sites based on patch isolation and size, edge effect, and forest structure. The alternative criterion, although not as efficient as indicator species, may nevertheless be useful and effective for conservation when faunal data are lacking and guidelines for habitat management or restoration are needed. Our method is applicable to other ecosystems and taxa because the processes we considered occur in many ecosystems and may have significant effects on species from all taxonomic groups.

AB  - Lesions in estuarine finfish are associated with a variety of organisms including parasites and bacterial, viral, and fungal infectious agents. In addition, trauma, suboptimal water quality, and other abiotic stress factors may result in the loss of homeostasis. We have observed solitary ulcerative lesions on menhaden sampled from the Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, the Pamlico River, North Carolina, and the St. Johns River, Florida. Histologically, the lesions demonstrated a marked chronic inflammatory infiltrate and granulomas in response to fungal hyphae throughout large areas of exposed necrotic muscle. Gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria were also observed in the lesions, a common finding in ulcers of aquatic organisms. Similar observations in menhaden and other species have been described previously in the literature as ulcerative mycosis, mycotic granulomatosis, red spot disease, and epizootic ulcerative syndrome. Despite the many different known causes of fish lesions, the popular press and the scientific literature have recently emphasized Pfiesteria in piscicida and other Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellates (and their bioactive compounds) as the primary causative agent for finfish lesions, particularly mycotic granulomatous ulcers in Atlantic menhaden. While some laboratory data suggest that Pfiesteria may play a role in field-observed lesions, much more cause-and-effect evidence is needed to determine the importance of other risk factors, both alone or and in combination with Pfiesteria. In order to better understand the etiology of lesion initiation and progression in estuarine finfish, accurate assessments of environmental conditions collected on appropriate temporal and spatial scales, and fish morphological indicators consistent with gross and histological pathologic terminology, should be used for reporting fish lesion observations and kills. Further, this outlook will help to avoid bias and may foster a broader perspective for examining the health of estuarine systems in general. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the present study, heat-shock protein of M-r 70 kDa (HSP70), a marker of cellular stress response, was validated as a potential biomarker under field conditions. The dab, Limanda limanda (female, size greater than or equal to 25 cm, spawning maturity stage 2) was used as the indicator organism. The data on HSP level were correlated with the occurrence of DNA damage, measured in the same specimens of L. limanda, to prove the usefulness of the method. The area under investigation was the North Sea. Four locations were selected: station N01, close to Heligoland, in the North Sea; station N04 at the Dogger Bank; station N06 at the Firth of Forth; and station G08 in the English Channel. Ten animals from each location were selected and their livers used for the experiments. The results show that the highest levels of HSP70 (consisting of two forms of M-r 75 and 73 kDa) were in fish from station N04, while low values were measured in livers from L. limanda collected at station N01. Intermediate levels were seen in the animals the two other locations. By application of a novel technique, it was found that the extent of DNA damage (single-strand breaks and alkaline labile sites) in fish liver parallels the levels of both HSP70 forms. Our results suggest that L. limanda may be a useful bioindicator and heat-shock proteins, a useful biomarker for monitoring of environmental pollution. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - An experiment was conducted on an Experimental Farm of Fur-bearing Animals affiliated to the Research Institute of Animal Production in Nitra in August to September 1995. The animals were housed in special cages for metabolic trials. The experiments were conducted on five nonsib mink males at the age of four months. The animals were clinically healthy and examined for plasmocytosis. The experiment consisted of three stages to determine the digestibility of nitrogen from feed ration with various proportions of cod fillet administered to minks and nitrogen digestibility in the rest feed (cod fillet). The animals received basal feed ration in the first stage while in the second stage the content of test feed in the feed ration was 41.7% and in the third stage 62.5% out of the original amount. Each experimental stage had two periods a preparatory period and an appropriate experimental period. The preparatory period lasted three days, when the animals adapted themselves to a new feed ration, and the appropriate experiment lasted five days. Feed was administered twice a day (at 9 h a.m. and at 3 h p.m.). The nutritive value of feed rations was in agreement with the standard for the age category and physiologic stage concerned. Climatic conditions were observed throughout the experiments. Average air temperature was 14.2 +/- 0.6 degrees C in the first stage of experiments, 28.0 +/- 0.4 degrees C in the second stage and 18.1 +/- 0.4 degrees C in the third stage. Indicators necessary to calculate digestibility coefficients for feed rations and test feed were determined during the appropriate experiment: feed intake, remaining uneaten feed and amount of excrements. The indicators were recorded and samples were taken twice a day, always an hour before feeding at 7 to 8 o'clock. A direct method was used to calculate nitrogen digestibility in the feed rations with various proportions of cod fillet, and an indirect (differential) method was used to calculate digestibility in the test feed. The results of calculations were processed by a mathematico-statistical method of one-factor analysis of variance with multivariate comparisons of differences in arithmetical means. No statistically significant intra-group differences were determined for the animals, it means that the set of minks was homogeneous. Tests of the effects of replications in the particular groups revealed statistically significant differences at a significance level P less than or equal to 0.5 for the second stage of experiments at administration of feed ration with 41.7% portion of cod fillet. As the biological material is homogeneous, we believe that this fact was influenced by the environment factor (climatic conditions during the experiments). Coefficient of nitrogen digestibility in the basal feed ration was 67.661 +/- 1.180%, in the feed ration with 41.7% of cod fillet 72.327 +/- 0.613% and in the feed ration with 62.5% proportion of test feed 81.563 +/- 1.095%. The obtained results of nitrogen digestibility in the test feed rations are statistically significant (P less than or equal to 0.05). Coefficient of nitrogen digestibility in cod fillet used in feed ration with 41.7% proportion of test feed (2nd stage) was 81.240 +/- 0.864% and in the feed ration with 62.5% of test feed it amounted to 93.020 +/- 1.033% (P < 0.05).
   It can be concluded from the results obtained that the coefficient of nitrogen digestibility in feed rations administered to minks is increasing in relation to the per cent proportion of test feed. Nitrogen digestibility in test feed was also related to the feed proportion in feed rations (41.7% : 81.240 +/- 0.86% and 62.5% : 93.020 +/- 1.033%).
   It is recommended to use cod fillet in feed rations for minks throughout the year as it is a dietetic feed with high crude protein content (16.62%) and with low fat content (0.60%).

AB  - The use of "belly scoring" can offer a novel, non-invasive objective management tool to gauge food intake between individuals, groups, and populations, and thus, population fitness. As food availability is increasingly affected by predation, ecological competition, climate change, habitat modification, and other human activities, an accurate belly scoring tool can facilitate comparisons among wildlife populations, serving as an early warning indicator of threats to wildlife population health and potential population collapse. In social species, belly scores can also be a tool to understand social behavior and ranking. We developed and applied the first rigorous quantitative photogrammetric methodology to measure belly scores of wild painted dogs (Lycaon pictus). Our methodology involves: (1) Rigorous selection of photographs of the dorso/lateral profile of individuals at a right angle to the camera, (2) photogrammetrically measuring belly chord length and "belly drop" in pixels, (3) adjusting belly chord length as a departure from a standardized leg angle, and (4) converting pixel measurements to ratios to eliminate the need to introduce distance from the camera. To highlight a practical application, this belly score method was applied to 631 suitable photographs of 15 painted dog packs that included 186 individuals, all collected between 2004-2015 from allopatric painted dog populations in and around Hwange (n = 462) and Mana Pools National Parks (n = 169) in Zimbabwe. Variation in mean belly scores exhibited a cyclical pattern throughout the year, corresponding to biologically significant patterns to include denning demand and prey availability. Our results show significant differences between belly scores of the two different populations we assessed, thus highlighting food stress in the Hwange population. In the face of growing direct and indirect anthropogenic disturbances, this standardised methodology can provide a rapid, species-specific non-invasive management tool that can be applied across studies to rapidly detect emergent threats.

AB  - The potential health risks associated with the pharmaceuticals released into the environment through effluents from sewage treatment plants have become a major cause for concern. Owing to the lack of effective indicators, monitoring the concentration of these pollutants in the aquatic environment is challenging. The aim of this study was to assess the toxicity of a mixture of five pharmaceutical drugs (paracetamol, carbamazepine, diclofenac, irbesartan, and naproxen) using the aquatic moss Fontinalis antipyretica as a bioindicator and bioaccumulator. We examined the effects of the drug mixture on the cellular antioxidant system, chlorophyll content, and morphological traits of F. antipyretica. The plant was exposed for 5 months to three concentrations of the mixture, including the environmental concentration (MX1), and 10- (MX10) and 100-times (MX100) the environmental concentration. The results showed that only carbamazepine and irbesartan were accumulated by the species. The bioconcentration level increased with exposure time, with the maximum uptake at the 4th month of exposure. The increase in bioaccumulation with exposure time was more evident in plants exposed to MX100. Analysis of the activity of antioxidant enzymes showed that superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1.) and catalase (EC 1.11.1.6.) were highly sensitive to the drug mixture. The activity of the enzymes was significantly higher in plants exposed to MX100; however, the activity of guaiacol peroxidase (GPX, EC 1.11.1.7.) was not significantly affected. Plants exposed to MX10 and MX100 had significantly lower total chlorophyll content and chlorophyll a/b ratio compared with those of plants in the control group; however, photosynthetic activity was restored after 5 months of exposure. The morphological characteristics of F. antipyretica were less sensitive to the treatment conditions.

AB  - In common discourse, economic activities run by profit-oriented managers and entrepreneurs are considered to be at the root of social and ecological crisis and hence, hamper sustainable development. With this perspective, government, policymaking institutions, and civil societies take the center stage in shaping a sustainability-oriented industry by using the tools of command and control to curb the negative environmental and social impacts of business. However, this view not only overestimates the role of legal regulations and policies but also underestimates and, in a sense, distorts the relationship between innovative entrepreneurial activities and sustainable development. With growing impetus in the domain of sustainable entrepreneurship since the early 1990s, researchers have increasingly advocated sustainability-driven entrepreneurs and managers as the core movers of sustainable production and consumption. Presently, sustainable entrepreneurship remains an extremely relevant yet under researched area of investigation. Debates regarding semantic and practical approaches to sustainability-oriented entrepreneurs impede empirical and theoretical developments in this area. Hence, in the context of the existent gap in literature, this study adopts a qualitative approach to conceptualize sustainable entrepreneurship, by building upon a typology of this phenomenon. In doing so, the overlapping yet conceptually distinct terms, "green" entrepreneurship, "social" entrepreneurship, and "institutional" entrepreneurship are incorporated to understand how entrepreneurs induce sustainable innovations to meet the objectives of social benefits and profit maximization in the context of changing market indicators. The relevance of the study lies in its theoretical as well as practical implications as it attempts to develop a framework to identify, under which specific conditions a particular firm is most likely to adopt sustainable innovations, hence, indicating the need to refine and extend the existing models of sustainable entrepreneurship with respect to motivations for sustainability innovations.

AB  - Benthic foraminifera are valuable environmental indicators of heavy metal contaminants in marine environments. To broaden their effectiveness as bioindicators, this study compares individually the effects of selected heavy metal contaminants, including both metabolically essential and non-essential elements, on temperate rotalids and subtropical miliolids, as well as associated monothalamid foraminifera. To accomplish these aims, assemblages of foraminifera were grown experimentally from propagules (small juveniles) collected from two coastal sites: Sapelo Island, Georgia, and Little Duck Key, Florida, that provide an effective comparison between environments and types of foraminifera. Surface sediment was collected from both locations and sieved immediately after collection. Using the propagule method, assemblages of foraminifera were grown in the laboratory from propagules in the sediment samples. Two metabolically essential trace elements, nickel, and zinc, and two non-essential elements, arsenic and cadmium were used to represent both types of heavy metal. Experimental conditions were held constant while varying only the metal concentrations.
   In treatments from both origins, increasing concentrations of cadmium, nickel, and zinc led to decreases in abundance and diversity for the foraminifera. In addition, zinc, and to a lesser extent cadmium and nickel above certain concentrations, resulted in an increase of deformed tests among the foraminifera. Deformities occurred amongst the most common calcareous species from Sapelo island: Ammonia tepida and Haynesina germanica. Fewer deformities were observed in common calcareous species from Little Duck Key, the miliolids Quinqueloculina sabulosa and Quinqueloculina bosciana featured few deformities. Notably, monothalamid species such as Psammophaga sapela remained present at high metal concentrations. These results support previous research and reinforce the usefulness of rotalids such as A. tepida and H. germanica as bioindicators of heavy metal contamination as well as suggesting a possible use of monothalamids such as P. sapela in this manner.

AB  - Bycatch remains one of the most significant fisheries issues in the world and its monitoring and reporting is now expected in many regions. This paper provides a global synthesis of the data that are available on one of the most controversial components of bycatch, that associated with the capture and discarding of endangered, threatened and protected (ETP) species in marine commercial and artisanal fisheries. We examine the available literature regarding estimates for the key taxa in this category of bycatch (seabirds, turtles, sea snakes, marine mammals, sharks, rays and teleosts) and use the data to try to provide a total global estimate. We estimate (albeit quite imprecisely) that at least 20 million individuals of such species are discarded annually throughout the world. However, there remain far too many gaps and uncertainties across fisheries and regions in the information to provide any robustness (or variance) around such an estimate, nor to determine the actual fates of these animals (many may survive). This is exacerbated because: (1) the occurrences of such species are often rare and controversial and so go either unnoticed and/or unrecorded; (2) different levels of protection are afforded to different ETP species in different countries and fisheries and; (3) discarding practices vary greatly across a hierarchy of spatio-temporal scales and according to individual fishing conditions and procedures-the latter affecting actual mortalities. Nevertheless, there have been major initiatives established in recent years to provide better data on such interactions in addition to novel fishing methods and practices that reduce them and also improve the survival of discarded individuals. This paper discusses the data currently available and the quite significant gaps that remain.

AB  - India being a developing economy dependent on climate-sensitive sector like agriculture is highly vulnerable to impacts of global climate change. Vulnerability to climate change, however, differs spatially within the country owing to regional differences in exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. The study uses the Hadley Centre Global Environment Model version 2-Earth System (HadGEM-ES) climate projections to assess the dynamics in vulnerability across four climate change exposure scenarios developed using Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The analysis was carried out at subnational (district) level; the results were interpreted and reported for their corresponding agro-ecological zones. Vulnerability of each district was quantified using indicators capturing climatic variability, ecological and demographic sensitivity, and socio-economic capacity. Our analysis further assigns probabilities to vulnerability classes of all the 579 districts falling under different agro-ecological zones. The results of the vulnerability profile show that Western plains, Northern plains, and central highlands of the arid and semi-arid agro-ecological zones are the most vulnerable regions in the current scenario (1950-2000). In the future scenario (2050), it extends along districts falling within Deccan plateau and Central (Malwa) highlands, lying in the arid and semi-arid zones, along with regions vulnerable in the current scenario, recording the highest vulnerability score across all exposure scenarios. These regions exhibit highest degree of variation in climatic parameters, ecological fragility, socio-economic marginality, and limited accessibility to resources, generating conditions of high vulnerability. The study emphasizes on the priority to take up adaptive management actions in the identified vulnerable districts to not only reduce risks of climate change, but also enhance their inherent capacity to withstand any future changes in climate. It provides a systematic approach to explicitly identify vulnerable regions, where regional planners and policy makers can build on existing adaptation decision-making by utilizing an interdisciplinary approach in the context of global change scenario.

AB  - Soil microbial communities are important indicators for evaluating the effectiveness of vegetational restoration. The ability of soil microbial communities to recover under six types of restoration was examined using Biolog, phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA), and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Soil samples were collected from eroded loessial soils that had been restored for 30 years on the Loess Plateau with natural grass, black locust, korshinsk peashrub, Chinese pine, and mixed forest of Chinese pine-indigo and black locust-indigo. Part of sloped farmland that had not been restored represented pre-restoration conditions. An 80-year-old forest of Chinese arborvitae represented the end point of restoration. Soils that were originally farmed but have been under restoration treatments for the past 30 years had significantly higher average well-color development, total PLFAs, bacterial PLFAs, fungal PLFAs, and Shannon indices of catabolic diversity, structural diversity, and bacterial phylogenetic diversity. These indicators, though, were lower than those for the native forest. Principal component analysis significantly separated the sloped farmland, Chinese arborvitae, and the six types of restoration. Redundancy analysis indicated that pH, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, available nitrogen, and available phosphorus were the most important environment factors in affecting soil functional diversity, and C/N ratio and available nutrients were the main properties in determining microbial community structure. Vegetational restoration substantially increased microbial biomass and microbial physiological activity, and shifted microbial community structure, but the community structures and compositions did not recover to the status of the natural forest during the early stage (<30 years) of vegetational restoration.

AB  - Positive interactions between plants play a fundamental role in environments with extreme conditions, such as coastal sand dunes, where the establishment of many species is limited by high temperature, and low availability of water and nutrients in the soil. The ability to store water and enrich the soil with nutrients characterizes bromeliads as potential nurse plants for other species. This study aimed to analyze the potential of the bromeliad Vriesea friburgensis to act as a nurse plant, and to compare this interaction in coastal dunes in herbaceous versus scrub vegetation. The study was performed on Santa Catarina Island in Brazil. Juveniles of other species associated with V.friburgensis were collected within and under bromeliad tanks and on adjacent plots beside each bromeliad. The abundance, species richness and height of juveniles were recorded. We found that abundance and richness of Vf-associated juveniles were lower than those Vf-not associated, in herbaceous vegetation (negative interaction). However, the height of some shrubs species, like Eupatorium casarettoi and Tibouchina urvilleana, was greater when Vf-associated (positive interaction). In scrub vegetation, the abundance and richness of juveniles were not significantly affected by V.friburgensis presence (neutral interaction). However, the height of some shrubs and trees species, like Clusia criuva, Eugenia catharinae, Myrsine parvifolia and Ocotea pulchella, was greater when Vf-associated. Species composition associated with V.friburgensis differed from the assemblage in adjacent plots, indicating that some species interact more with nurse plants, whereas others fail to develop when associated with this bromeliad; the difference between groups in species composition was less evident in scrub vegetation areas. Clusia criuva was considered an indicator species for Vf-associated juveniles in both vegetation types. Despite the fact that these tank bromeliads do not function as nurse plants for some species, there are others that seem to be favoured by this interaction.

AB  - The estimation of natural background levels (NBLs) of dissolved concentrations of target chemical species in subsurface reservoirs relies on a proper assessment of the effects of forcing terms driving flow and transport processes taking place within the system and whose dynamics drive background concentration values. We propose coupling methodologies based on (a) global statistical analyses and (b) numerical modeling of system dynamics to distinguish between the impacts of different types of external forcing components influencing background concentration values. We focus on the joint application of a statistical methodology based on Component Separation and experimental/numerical modeling studies of groundwater flow and transport for the NBL estimation of selected chemical species in potentially contaminated coastal aquifers. We consider a site which is located in Calabria, Italy, and constitutes a typical example of a Mediterranean coastal aquifer which has been subject to intense industrial development. Our study is keyed to the characterization of NBLs of manganese and sulfate and is geared to the proper identification of the importance of a natural external forcing (i.e., seawater intrusion) on NBL assessment. Results from the Component Separation statistical approach are complemented by numerical simulations of the advective-dispersive processes that could influence the distribution of chemical species (i.e., sulfate) within the system. Estimated NELs for manganese are consistent with the geochemical composition of soil samples. While Component Separation ascribes the largest detected sulfate concentrations to anthropogenic sources, our numerical modeling analysis suggests that they are mainly related to the natural process of seawater intrusion. Our results indicate that the use of statistical methodologies in complex groundwater systems should be assisted by a detailed characterization of the dynamics of natural (and/or induced) processes to distinguish effective anthropogenic contamination from natural conditions and to define realistic environmental clean-up goals.

AB  - Lichen epiphytes are applied as excellent environmental indicators worldwide. However, very little is known about epiphytic lichen communities and their response to forest dynamics in subtropical China. This paper proposes the applications of the cover, diversity, and functional traits of epiphytic lichens to assess environmental changes associated with succession in subtropical forests of southwest China. Bole lichens were sampled from 120 plots of eight representative forest types in the Ailao Mountains. Total cover, species richness, diversity and community structure of bole lichens differed significantly among forest types, and the highest cover and diversity occurred in the Populus bonatii secondary forest (PBSF). Sixty-one indicator species were associated with particular forest types and more than 50% occurred in the PBSF. Both cover and diversity of most lichen functional groups varied regularly during forest succession. Lichen pioneer species were not displaced by competitively superior species as succession proceeds and cyanolichens were more prevalent in secondary forests. The results also highlight the importance of habitat variables such as canopy openness, host diversity, forest age, tree size, the size of the largest tree, tree density, and basal area on the lichen community. Consequently, our findings support the notion that epiphytic lichens, in terms of cover, diversity, species composition and functional traits can be used as effective indicators for large-scale and long-term forest monitoring. More importantly, the narrowly lobed foliose group was the best candidate indicator of environmental conditions in this region. The combined application of lichen indicator species and functional groups seemed to be a more reliable and more powerful method for monitoring forest dynamics in subtropical montane ecosystems.

AB  - A high-resolution paleolimnological study from Lake Brazi, a small mountain lake in the Southern Carpathian Mountains, Romania, shows distinct diatom responses to late glacial and early Holocene climate change between ca. 15,750 and 10,000 cal year BP. Loss-on-ignition, titanium, sulphur, phosphorus, biogenic silica content, and diatom assemblage composition were used as proxies for past environmental changes. Total epilimnetic phosphorus (TP) concentrations and lakewater pH were reconstructed quantitatively using diatom-TP and pH transfer functions. The most remarkable changes in the aquatic ecosystem were found at ca. 12,870 and 10,400 cal year BP. Whereas the onset of the Younger Dryas (YD) climatic reversal was conspicuous in our record, the beginning of the Holocene was not well marked. Two diatom assemblage zones characterize the YD in Lake Brazi, suggesting a bipartite division of this climatic oscillation. The diatom responses to the YD cooling were (1) a shift from Staurosira venter to Stauroforma exiguiformis dominance; (2) a decrease in overall diatom diversity; (3) a decrease in lake productivity, inferred from DI-TP, organic matter, and biogenic silica content; and (4) a lowering of the DI-pH. Compositional change of the diatom assemblages suggested a sudden shift towards more acidic lake conditions at 12,870 cal year BP, which is interpreted as a response to prolonged ice cover and thus shorter growing seasons and/or enhanced outwash of humic acids from the catchment. Taking into account the chironomid-based inference of only moderate July mean temperature decrease (< 1 A degrees C), together with the pollen-inferred regional opening of the forest cover and expansion of steppe-tundra, our data suggest that ecosystem changes in the Southern Carpathians during the YD were likely determined by strong seasonal changes.

AB  - Background, aim, and scope The aim of the present study was to evaluate the distribution of petroleum hydrocarbons in ten commercial fish species and water samples in three estuaries along Tamilnadu coast, Bay of Bengal, India.
   Materials and methods Fish and water samples collected from Tamilnadu coast, India, were extracted and analyzed for petroleum hydrocarbons by ultraviolet fluorescence (UVF) spectroscopy.
   Results The petroleum hydrocarbon concentration (PHC) in coastal waters and fish species varied between 2.28 and 14.02 mu g/l and 0.52 and 2.05 mu g/g, respectively. The highest PHC concentration was obtained in Uppanar estuarine waters (14.02 +/- 0.83) and the lowest was observed in Vellar estuarine waters (2.28 +/- 0.25).
   Discussion Among the ten fish species, Sardinella longiceps have high PHC concentration from all the locations. This study suggests that S. longiceps can be used as a good biological indicator for petroleum hydrocarbon pollution in water.
   Conclusions The concentration of petroleum hydrocarbons in coastal waters along Tamilnadu coast is markedly higher than that in the background, but there is no evidence for its increase in fish of this region. From a public health point, petroleum hydrocarbon residue levels in all fish samples analyzed in this study are considerably lower than the hazardous levels.
   Recommendations and perspectives At present, as Tamilnadu coastal area is in a rapid development stage of new harbour, chemical industries, power plants, oil exploration and other large-scale industries, further assessment of petroleum hydrocarbons and the various hydrodynamic conditions acting in the region are to be studied in detail and continuous pollution monitoring studies should be conducted for improving the aquatic environment. The results will also be useful for pollution monitoring program along the coastal region and also to check the levels of petroleum hydrocarbons.

AB  - In the Humboldt Current System, the region off central-southern Chile has relatively high eddy kinetic energy. generating an extensive coastal transition zone (similar to 600 km offshore) in which coastally derived eddies are recurrent features. This energy might promote strong exchanges of water, biogeochemical properties, and plankton between the coastal upwelling band and the adjacent oceanic zone In this study, the mesoscale structure of epipelagic copepod assemblages and its relationship to environmental variability and the eddy field in the coastal transition zone and oceanic areas off Concepcion (34-39 degrees S, 73-84 degrees W) were investigated. Zooplankton samples were collected during cruises of opportunity carried out during the 2006 coastal upwelling season and the oceanographic conditions were derived from satellite data on sea surface height, temperature, and chlorophyll a The use of cluster analyses and indicator species revealed two main copepod assemblages (i) species with a mainly coastal distribution, the maximum in total abundance being found nearshore and (ii) species with a mainly oceanic distribution (beyond 500 km from the coast), where a secondary maximum was observed Both types of assemblages, however, included species widely distributed in the coastal transition zone An ordination analysis identified sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a as the main factors affecting the distribution of most species and the clustering of stations resembled the distribution of these variables Some of the large calanoid species that are common in shelf waters were more abundant within nearshore eddies rich in chlorophyll a and other cyclonic eddies far offshore, however, the eddy field alone did not explain the copepod mesoscale distribution Altogether, the wide distribution of shelf/slope copepod species in this region suggests that physical and biological mechanisms might be acting to extend the productive area of the coastal upwelling zone (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB  - In coastal southern California, natural riparian corridors occur in a landscape mosaic comprised of human land uses (mainly urban and suburban development) interspersed among undeveloped areas, primarily native shrublands. We asked, does the composition of the landscape surrounding a riparian survey point influence plant species distribution, community composition, or habitat structure? We expected, for example, that invasive non-native species might be more abundant as the amount of surrounding urbanization increased. We surveyed 137 points in riparian vegetation in Orange County, California, along an urbanization gradient. Using logistic regression we analyzed 79 individual plant species' distributions, finding 20 negatively associated and 12 positively associated with the amount of development within a 1-km radius around the survey points, even after accounting for the effects of elevation. However, after summarizing plant community composition with Detrended Correspondence Analysis we observed that, overall, community composition was not statistically correlated with the amount of development surrounding a survey point once the association between development and elevation was taken into account. Non-native species were not particularly associated with increasing development, but instead were distributed throughout vegetation and urbanization gradients. However, the extent of the tree and herb layers (structural attributes) was associated with development, with the tree layer increasing and the herb layer decreasing as urbanization increased. Thus, although the degree of surrounding urbanization appears to influence the distribution of a number of individual plant species, overall composition of the community in our study system seemed relatively unaffected. Instead, we suggest that community composition reflected larger-scale environmental conditions, such as stream order and other variables associated with elevation, and/or regional-scale disturbances, such as historic grazing or enhanced atmospheric deposition of nitrogen.

AB  - Reproductive effects have been recorded in wild fish in waters receiving pulp mill effluent (PME) since the mid to late 1980s. Laboratory assays with fathead minnow (FHM; Pimephales promelas) have been developed to better understand fish responses to PME. However, observations from laboratory studies have been variable, making it difficult to establish cause/effect relationships. A lack of environmental relevance in these laboratory studies may have contributed to the variability observed. The objectives of the present study were, first, to determine the effects of bleached kraft PME (BKME) on FHM under environmentally realistic conditions (i.e., ambient water and effluent quality) and, second, to determine the suitability of pair-breeding FHM to better link BKME-induced changes in indicators at the biochemical, individual, and population levels. A mobile bioassay trailer was situated on-site at a bleached kraft mill for 60 d, allowing supply of both ambient water (Lake Superior, Canada) and final BKME. The reproductive output of FHM was initially assessed for 21 d to obtain baseline data pre-exposure. At the end of the pre-exposure period, selected breeding pairs were exposed to final BKME (100% v/v and 1% v/v) for 21 d. Results demonstrated a stimulatory response pattern at 1% BKME (e.g., increased egg production) compared to control. In the 100% treatment, spawning events were reduced and fewer eggs were produced during the first two weeks of exposure. Exposure to 100% (v/v) BKME also resulted in ovipositor development in males and development of male secondary sex characteristics in females. Obtaining pre-exposure data and use of pair-breeding FHM in this assay gave a sensitive indication of effluent effects and allowed accurate comparisons of endpoints to be made.

AB  - It is expected that international biomass trade will significantly increase in the coming years because of the possibly lower costs of imported biomass, the better supply security through diversification and the support by energy and climate policies of various countries. Concerns about potential negative effects of large-scale biomass production and export, like deforestation or the competition between food and biomass production, have led to the demand for sustainability criteria and certification systems that can control biomass trade. Because neither such criteria and indicator sets nor certification systems for sustainable biomass trade are yet available, the objective of this study is to generate information that can help to develop them. For these purposes, existing certification systems, sets of sustainability criteria or guidelines on environmental or social sound management of resources are analyzed with the purpose to learn about the requirements, contents and organizational set ups of a certification system for sustainable biomass trade. First, an inventory of existing systems was made; second, their structures were analyzed. Key finding from the analysis of internationally applied certification systems was that they are generally led by an international panel that represents all countries and stakeholders involved in the biomass production and trade activities. In third and fourth steps different approaches to formulate standards were described and a list of more than 100 social, economic, ecological and general criteria for sustainable biomass trade was extracted from the reviewed systems. Fifth, methods to formulate indicators, that make sustainability criteria measurable, and verifiers that are used to control the performance of indicators are described. It is recommended to further develop the criteria and indicator (C&I) sets for sustainable biomass trade by involvement of the relevant stakeholders (e.g. biomass producer and consumer) and the analysis of local conditions (e.g. local production potentials and limits, and preferences of local people).

AB  - Developmental stability reflects the ability of a genotype to develop in the same way under varying environmental conditions. Deviations from developmental stability, arising from disruptive effects of environmental and genetic stresses, can be measured in terms of fluctuating asymmetry, a particularly sensitive indicator of the ability to cope with these stresses during ontogeny. In an inbred Adriatic island population, we expected dental arch fluctuating asymmetry 1) to be higher than in an outbred sample from the same island, and 2) within this population, to increase with the level of inbreeding. Due to environmental stress, we also expected to find higher fluctuating asymmetry in the outbred island population than in an urban reference group from the same country. The material consisted of 506 dental casts of 253 children from 1) the island of Hvar, and 2) Zagreb, Croatia. Three-dimensional coordinates of 26 landmarks spanning the arches were digitized. The analysis partitioned the asymmetry of arch forms into components for directional and fluctuating bilateral asymmetry, using the appropriate Procrustes method (geometric morphometrics). The results corroborated the hypotheses. Fluctuating asymmetry was found to be higher on the island than in Zagreb in all groups and in both jaws, and increased significantly with endogamy level in the lower jaw. There was no significant directional asymmetry in the Zagreb sample and likewise none in the upper jaws of the outbred island group, but significant directional asymmetry in both jaws of the inbred population and also in the lower jaws of the outbred island group. These results suggest an environmental as well as a genetic influence on dental arch asymmetry. Although the lower jaws expressed these two stresses almost additively, the upper jaws appeared to be better buffered. The role of directional asymmetry as a potential indicator of craniofacial developmental instability clearly merits further attention.

AB  - The decline of eastern Bering Sea snow (Chionoecetes opilio) and Tanner (Chionoecetes bairdi) crab has coincided with loss of spring sea ice extent and northward contraction of the 'cold pool,' a layer of cold (< 2 degrees C) summer bottom water. We measured temperature-associated growth and lipid storage of lab-reared Tanner crab, as well as the fatty acid content of field-collected juvenile Chionoecetes spp. Field collections occurred during a cold, high sea ice year (2012) and a warm, low ice year (2014), representative of cold and warm climate stanzas in the southeastern Bering Sea. Lab-reared Tanner crab maintained the lowest growth rates but highest lipids under cold conditions (2 degrees C). In the field, crabs contained higher fatty acids per wet weight (mg g(-1)) during 2012 than during 2014. Water column-integrated chlorophyll a (chla, an indicator of phytoplankton biomass) from large particles (> 10 mu m) such as diatoms was elevated in the colder year particularly over the central middle shelf. During the cold year, crab storage of diatom-sourced fatty acids (16:1n-7 to 16:0, r(2) = 0.72) as well as a station-specific relationship between large size-fraction integrated chla and crab total fatty acids (r(2) = 0.5) points to the potential importance of diatoms to juvenile crab nutrition. Our results suggest that continued warming and loss of sea ice across the Bering Sea may reduce juvenile crab lipid storage through both direct thermal effects as well as through the reduction of large-size phytoplankton delivered to the benthos.

AB  - Deforestation without their subsequent restoration leads to the disruption of natural ecosystems. This led to the need to create fast-growing artificial plantations. From this point of view, heightened interest is shown in the plant of the bluegrass family - the giant miscanthus. As a renewable source of raw materials, it can become an alternative to forest crops. Differing in slow growth in the initial period, miscanthus weakly competes with weeds. Therefore, the purpose of the research was to determine the optimal way to combat weeds, ensuring the creation of a highly productive agrocenosis of Miscanthus giant in the forest-steppe of the Middle Volga region. In this regard, in 2015-2017. on the light gray soil of the experimental plot of the Penza State Agrarian University, a field experiment was laid on agrotechnical and chemical measures to control weeds in the culture of miscanthus. On average, over three years, the use of herbicides Magnum and Ballerina against the background of Tornado improved the conditions for the formation of leaves and before leaving for winter their area was the largest 18.36 and 19.09 thousand m(2)/ha, respectively, FP 496.1 ... 508.7 thousand .m(2) . day/ha, NPF decreased to 0.01 ... 0.08 g/m(2) . day. due to shading and death of the lower leaves. The maximum yield of dry matter of 2.96 t/ha was obtained with a double herbicide treatment. The main component that forms the frame of a plant is cellulose, the content of which in the aboveground mass was 56.96 ... 60.57%. The mass fraction of crude ash did not exceed 4.59%, potassium and calcium in it was 0.54% and 0.2%, respectively, the amount of nitrogen was 0.87%.

AB  - Recurrent dinoflagellate blooms of Alexandrium catenella expose the economically and ecologically important Southern Rock Lobster in Tasmania to paralytic shellfish toxins (PST), and it is unknown if PST accumulation adversely affects lobster performance, health and catchability. In a controlled aquaculture setting, lobsters were fed highly contaminated mussels to accumulate toxin levels in the hepatopancreas (mean of 6.65 mg STX center dot 2HCl equiv. kg(-1)), comparable to those observed in nature. Physiological impact of PST accumulation was comprehensively assessed by a range of behavioural (vitality score, righting ability and reflex impairment score), health (haemocyte count, bacteriology, gill necrosis and parasite load), nutritional (hepatopancreas index and haemolymph refractive index) and haemolymph biochemical (21 parameters including electrolytes, metabolites, and enzymes) parameters during a 63 day period of uptake and depuration of toxins. Exposure to PST did not result in mortality nor significant changes in the behavioural, health, or nutritional measures suggesting limited gross impact on lobster performance. Furthermore, most haemolymph biochemical parameters measured exhibited no significant difference between control and exposed animals. However, the concentration of potassium in the haemolymph increased with PST, whilst the concentration of lactate and the sodium:potassium ratio decreased with PST. In addition, exposed lobsters showed a hyperglycaemic response to PST exposure, indicative of stress. These findings suggest that PST accumulation results in some measurable indicators of stress for lobsters. However, these changes are likely within the adaptive range for Jasus edwardsii and do not result in a significant impairment of gross performance. Our findings support previous conclusions that crustaceans are relatively tolerant to PST and the implications for the lobster fishery are discussed.

AB  - Few fossil-based environmental and climate records in northern Europe are dated to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5a around 80 ka BP. We here present multiple environmental and climate proxies obtained from a lake sequence of MIS 5a age in the Sokli basin (northern Finland). Pollen/spores, plant macrofossils, NPPs (e.g. green algae), bryozoa, diatoms and chironomids allowed an exceptionally detailed reconstruction of aquatic and telmatic ecosystem successions related to the development of the Sokli Ice Lake and subsequent infilling of a relatively small and shallow lake confined to the Sokli basin. A regional vegetation development typical for the early half of an interglacial is recorded by the pollen, stomata and plant macrofossil data. Reconstructions of July temperatures based on pollen assemblages suffer from a large contribution of local pollen from the lake's littoral zone. Summer temperatures reaching present-day values, inferred for the upper part of the lake sequence, however, agree with the establishment of pine-dominated boreal forest indicated by the plant fossil data. Habitat preferences also influence the climate record based on chironomids. Nevertheless, the climate optima of the predominant intermediate- to warm-water chironomid taxa suggest July temperatures exceeding present-day values by up to several degrees, in line with climate inferences from a variety of aquatic and wetland plant indicator species. The disequilibrium between regional vegetation development and warm, insolation-forced summers is also reported for Early Holocene records from northern Fennoscandia. The MIS 5a sequence is the last remaining fossil-bearing deposit in the late Quaternary basin infill at Sokli to be studied using multi-proxy evidence. A unique detailed climate record for MIS 5 is now available for formerly glaciated northern Europe. Our studies indicate that interglacial conditions persisted into MIS 5a, in agreement with data for large parts of the European mainland, shortening the Last Glacial by some 50 ka to MIS 4-2.

AB  - The steppe marmot inhabits a wide range of open dry grasslands in Eurasia. Throughout this vast area, marmot habitats have undergone major changes due to human activities. Long-term ecological monitoring was conducted in the European steppe marmot settlements (Marmota bobak bobak) in Northeastern Ukraine in 2001-2019. The data obtained were compared with the observations made inM. b. schaganensissettlements in Kazakhstan during the expedition in 2017. The goals of our investigation were (1) to estimateM. bobakecological plasticity based on general vegetation parameters of its habitats and settlement structure, (2) to relate the population density of the European subspecies to the food base of its habitats, (3) to evaluate the population response ofM. b. bobakto the abandonment of cattle grazing, (4) to ascertain new ecological adaptations (if any) to the habitat changes, and (5) to reveal the steppe marmot's status in the plant-herbivore interaction system in the grasslands of Northeastern Ukraine and Northern Kazakhstan. We have found differences in ecological features ofM. b. bobakandM. b. schaganensis. The European subspecies was and continues to be a secondary pasture user. The Kazakhstan subspecies can be both secondary and primary users of the Asian dry steppes. Our studies have shown that the habitats of the European steppe marmot worsened dramatically (due to increased herbage height and cover of uneaten plant species together with litter) in comparison with those of the Kazakhstan subspecies. Presence in diverse habitats with a range of vegetation parameters as well as the differences between the settlement structures ofM. b. bobakandM. b. schaganensisdemonstrate the high ecological plasticity of the steppe marmot at the species level. At the same time, we have not found any new ecological adaptations that would ensure the survival ofM. b. bobaksettlements in modern conditions of the total cessation of cattle grazing.

AB  - Swimming ponds are artificial ecosystems for bathing in which people imitate the conditions of natural waters. Swimming in natural water may pose health risks if the water quality is microbiologically poor. Swimming ponds are small water bodies that may be used by relatively large groups of people, moreover, the water is not disinfected, e.g. by using chlorine. The draft new swimming pool legislation in the Netherlands includes water quality requirements for swimming ponds. This study focused on the examination and evaluation of the new microbiological water quality requirements, including Escherichia coli, intestinal enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, in thirteen public swimming pools. In eight of thirteen swimming ponds the water quality met the requirements for fecal indicators; 93-95% of the samples met the requirement for E. coli (<= 100/100 ml) and intestinal enterococci (<= 50/100 ml). The requirement for P. aeruginosa (<= 10/100 ml) was met in eleven of thirteen swimming ponds (99% of the samples). In 68% of the samples the requirement for S. aureus (< 1/100 ml) was met. A linear mixed effect analysis showed that E. coli and intestinal enterococci concentrations were significantly dependent on the log10 of turbidity. P. aeruginosa concentrations were significantly dependent on water temperature. 31-45% of the variation between swimming ponds was explained by considering `pond' as a random effect in the analysis. The monitoring of microbiological parameters in swimming pond water needs selective analytical methods, such as those used in this study, due to large numbers of background bacteria. The draft new Dutch swimming pool legislation provides proper guidance to ensure the microbiological safety of swimming pond water; it would benefit from inclusion of turbidity as an extra parameter. S. aureus is a relevant parameter for non-fecal shedding, although scientific literature does not provide evidence for a norm value based on a dose-response relation for exposure to S. aureus in water.

AB  - The state of Amapa is a federative unit of Brazil, it has a large part of its territory governed by rules for the protection of natural resources, in such a way that it directly interferes in public policies in the cross-border region with French Guiana, French Department in South America. In this way, the study addresses the issue of land situation and the condition on the border between Amapa and French Guiana. The objective of the study was to analyze the characteristics of territorial management at the border, the environmental protection rules, the dynamics and confrontations of strategic actions. The methodological actions were based on data collection, biographical and documentary research techniques with a qualitative research approach. The results obtained identified the complex diversity of interests that affect the territory with the administrative overlap of the territorial management of the federal entity that holds the largest area in hectares of Amapa land, configured as protected areas. Territorial management is conflicting, caused by the inconsistency between the purposes of creating protected areas and the potential inherent in the cross-border corridor, and the third aspect, are the challenges of confrontation in the territorial organization of Amapa that are directly related to the process os strengthening governance, as competent institutions such as communities living in the vicinity of protected areas, do not participate much in improving the indicators of sustainability and social inclusion, and can provide the development inducing the conservation of natural and cultural resources of conservation units for full use in the state of Amapa. The conclusion of the article is that the territorial area where the biodiversity corridor is inserted is the same area where the Amapa cities that integrate the cross-border corridor are inserted, but the plans are not integrated, thus generating fragmented institutional actions.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) are routinely applied to assess current as well as future species distributions, for example to assess impacts of future environmental change on biodiversity or to underpin conservation planning. It has been repeatedly emphasized that SDMs should be evaluated based not only on their goodness of fit to the data, but also on the realism of the modeled ecological responses. However, possibilities for the latter are hampered by limited knowledge on the true responses as well as a lack of quantitative evaluation methods. Here we compared modeled niche optima obtained from European-scale SDMs of 1476 terrestrial vascular plant species with empirical ecological indicator values indicating the preferences of plant species for key environmental conditions. For each plant species we first fitted an ensemble SDM including three modeling techniques (GLM, GAM and BRT) and extracted niche optima for climate, soil, land use and nitrogen deposition variables with a large explanatory power for the occurrence of that species. We then compared these SDM-derived niche optima with the ecological indicator values by means of bivariate correlation analysis. We found weak to moderate correlations in the expected direction between the SDM-derived niche optima and ecological indicator values. The strongest correlation occurred between the modeled optima for growing degree days and the ecological indicator values for temperature. Correlations were weaker for SDM-derived niche optima with a more distal relationship to ecological indicator values (notably precipitation and soil moisture). Further, correlations were consistently highest for BRT, followed by GLM and GAM. Our method gives insight into the ecological realism of modeled niche optima and projected core habitats and can be used to improve SDMs by making a more informed selection of environmental variables and modeling techniques.

AB  - This study applied a 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding approach to characterize bacterial community compositional and functional attributes for surface water samples collected within, primarily, agriculturally dominated watersheds in Ontario and Quebec, Canada. Compositional heterogeneity was best explained by stream order, season, and watercourse discharge. Generally, community diversity was higher at agriculturally dominated lower order streams, compared to larger stream order systems such as small to large rivers. However, during times of lower relative water flow and cumulative 2-day rainfall, modestly higher relative diversity was found in the larger watercourses. Bacterial community assemblages were more sensitive to environmental/land use changes in the smaller watercourses, relative to small-to-large river systems, where the proximity of the sampled water column to bacteria reservoirs in the sediments and adjacent terrestrial environment was greater. Stream discharge was the environmental variable most significantly correlated (all positive) with bacterial functional groups, such as C/N cycling and plant pathogens. Comparison of the community structural similarity via network analyses helped to discriminate sources of bacteria in freshwater derived from, for example, wastewater treatment plant effluent and intensity and type of agricultural land uses (e.g., intensive swine production vs. dairy dominated cash/livestock cropping systems). When using metabarcoding approaches, bacterial community composition and coexisting pattern rather than individual taxonomic lineages, were better indicators of environmental/land use conditions (e.g., upstream land use) and bacterial sources in watershed settings. Overall, monitoring changes and differences in aquatic microbial communities at regional and local watershed scales has promise for enhancing environmental footprinting and for better understanding nutrient cycling and ecological function of aquatic systems impacted by a multitude of stressors and land uses.

AB  - Increases in temperature have been predicted and reported for the Mediterranean mountain ranges due to global warming and this phenomenon is expected to have profound consequences on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We hereby present the case of Gentiana lutea L. subsp. lutea, a rhizomatous long-lived plant living in Central-Southern Europe, which is at the edge of its ecological and distributional range in Sardinia. Concretely, we analysed the reproductive success experienced during three phenological cycles (2013/2014, 2014/2015 and 2015/2016) in four representative populations, with particular attention to the phenological cycle of 2014/2015, which has been recorded as one of the warmest periods of the last decades. The Smirnov-Grubbs test was used to evaluate differences in temperature and precipitation regimes among historical data and the analysed years, while the Kruskal-Wallis followed by the Wilcoxon test was used to measure differences between anthesis and reproductive performances among cycles and populations. In addition, generalised linear models were carried out to check relationships between climate variables and reproductive performance. Significant differences among climate variables and analysed cycles were highlighted, especially for maximum and mean temperatures. Such variations determined a non-flowering stage in two of the four analysed populations in 2014/2015 and significant differences of further five reproductive traits among cycles. These results confirmed that in current unstable climatic conditions, which are particularly evident in seasonal climates, reproductive success can be a sensitive and easily observable indicator of climatic anomalies. Considering the importance of this issue and the ease and cost-effectiveness of reproductive success monitoring, we argue that research in this sense can be a supporting tool for the enhancement of future crucial targets such as biodiversity conservation and the mitigation of global warming effects.

AB  - Sewage effluents are the most important source of emergent pollutants in the aquatic environment. In the present study the toxicological impact of an untreated sewage effluent on the Prochilodus lineatus fish was assessed under field conditions using a caging experiment. The biomarkers which were measured here involved oxidative stress markers, hepatic function parameters, neurotoxicity indicators, energy reserves, histological alterations and brain cell proliferation. In addition, water quality parameters including the occurrence of some human pharmaceuticals were measured. Juveniles of P. lineatus were caged for 15 days at three sites: the effluent site, and 2 km upstream and downstream from the effluent discharge. Caffeine, atenolol, carbamazepine, en-alapril and sildenafil were detected in water river samples. The increased activation of caspase-3 and the decreased cell proliferation in the diencephalon showed that the brain of fish caged at the effluent was affected. These fish also displayed a rise in hepatic transaminase activity, and oxidative stress in liver and gills which was evidenced by an increased lipid peroxidation and activation of antioxidant enzymes. At tissue level, increased glycogen and decreased lipid contents in liver as well as the highest indexes of hepatic lesions were also observed in the fish caged at the effluent. Both biochemical and histopathological findings demonstrated that effects were more severe on the liver of such fish than on their gills. The in situ exposure method carried out in our study makes it possible to observe the real effects of the sewage effluent on fish. Furthermore, our results also provide a better understanding of the harmful effects of wastewater effluents on the aquatic wildlife.

AB  - Accurate quantification of ecosystem services (ES) at regional scales is increasingly important for making informed decisions in the face of environmental change. We linked terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem process models to simulate the spatial and temporal distribution of hydrological and water quality characteristics related to ecosystem services. The linked model integrates two existing models (a forest ecosystem model and a river network model) to establish consistent responses to changing drivers across climate, terrestrial, and aquatic domains. The linked model is spatially distributed, accounts for terrestrial-aquatic and upstreamdownstream linkages, and operates on a daily time-step, all characteristics needed to understand regional responses. The model was applied to the diverse landscapes of the Upper Merrimack River watershed, New Hampshire, USA. Potential changes in future environmental functions were evaluated using statistically downscaled global climate model simulations (both a high and low emission scenario) coupled with scenarios of changing land cover (centralized vs. dispersed land development) for the time period of 1980-2099. Projections of climate, land cover, and water quality were translated into a suite of environmental indicators that represent conditions relevant to important ecosystem services and were designed to be readily understood by the public. Model projections show that climate will have a greater influence on future aquatic ecosystem services (flooding, drinking water, fish habitat, and nitrogen export) than plausible changes in land cover. Minimal changes in aquatic environmental indicators are predicted through 2050, after which the high emissions scenarios show intensifying impacts. The spatially distributed modeling approach indicates that heavily populated portions of the watershed will show the strongest responses. Management of land cover could attenuate some of the changes associated with climate change and should be considered in future planning for the region.

AB  - There are numerous regulatory-approved Escherichiacoli enumeration methods, but it is not known whether differences in media composition and incubation conditions impact the diversity of E.coli populations detected by these methods. A study was conducted to determine if three standard water quality assessments, Colilert((R)), USEPA Method 1603, (modified mTEC) and USEPA Method 1604 (MI), detect different populations of E.coli. Samples were collected from six watersheds and analysed using the three enumeration approaches followed by E.coli isolation and genotyping. Results indicated that the three methods generally produced similar enumeration data across the sites, although there were some differences on a site-by-site basis. The Colilert((R)) method consistently generated the least diverse collection of E.coli genotypes as compared to modified mTEC and MI, with those two methods being roughly equal to each other. Although the three media assessed in this study were designed to enumerate E.coli, the differences in the media composition, incubation temperature, and growth platform appear to have a strong selective influence on the populations of E.coli isolated. This study suggests that standardized methods of enumeration and isolation may be warranted if researchers intend to obtain individual E.coli isolates for further characterization.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyThis study characterized the impact of three USEPA-approved Escherichiacoli enumeration methods on observed E.coli population diversity in surface water samples. Results indicated that these methods produced similar E.coli enumeration data but were more variable in the diversity of E.coli genotypes observed. Although the three methods enumerate the same species, differences in media composition, growth platform, and incubation temperature likely contribute to the selection of different cultivable populations of E.coli, and thus caution should be used when implementing these methods interchangeably for downstream applications which require cultivated isolates.

AB  - The Zechstein Main Dolomite (Ca2) in the area between Grotow Platform and western part of the Gorzow Platform, in western Poland, represents the 3rd order sequence of the Polish Zechstein. The deposits are mainly the HST carbonate facies. Totally, fifteen HST microfacies associations were identified and they represent the carbonate platform (shallow subtidal-supratidal deposits), the platform slope (upper -lower slope deposits) and the basin environments. The deposition of the Ca2 was controlled by the pre-Zechstein paleomorphology and the systems of tectonic dislocations. On this background the geochemical results are presented and their source nature characterized in the context of the facial model of the Ca2. The results of geochemical analyses indicate that most of samples collected in the study area contain the epigenetic hydrocarbons. In the Ca2 carbonates the TOC values range from near zero to 5.2 wt.%, and these of hydrocarbons contents reach up to 9.6 mg/g rock. Despite such significant variability, the average values are low and do not exceed 0.5% TOC and 2.5 mg HC/g rock. All geochemical parameters indicate that the Ca2 carbonates from the study area represent poor to fair oil-prone source rocks with local good and/or excellent hydrocarbon potential. The macerals composition reveals predominance of the oil-prone Type II kerogen in all studied microfacies. In the kerogen composition organic mineral associations and solid bitumens prevail. The organic matter from the Ca2 was deposited under anoxic conditions in the hypersaline depositional environment. The maturity indicators: vitrinite reflectance R., temperature T-max and biomarker parameters indicate that the maturity of organic matter corresponds to the final phase of the "oil window" and to the early phase of the "gas window".

AB  - Percent tree cover is the percentage of the ground surface area covered by a vertical projection of the outermost perimeter of the plants. It is an important indicator to reveal the condition of forest systems and has a significant importance for ecosystem models as a main input. The aim of this study is to estimate the percent tree cover of various forest stands in a Mediterranean environment based on an empirical relationship between tree coverage and remotely sensed data in Goksu Watershed located at the Eastern Mediterranean coast of Turkey. A regression tree algorithm was used to simulate spatial fractions of Pinus nigra, Cedrus libani, Pinus brutia, Juniperus excelsa and Quercus cerris using multi-temporal LANDSAT TM/ETM data as predictor variables and land cover information. Two scenes of high resolution GeoEye-1 images were employed for training and testing the model. The predictor variables were incorporated in addition to biophysical variables estimated from the LANDSAT TM/ETMdata. Additionally, normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) was incorporated to LANDSAT TM/ETM band settings as a biophysical variable. Stepwise linear regression (SLR) was applied for selecting the relevant bands to employ in regression tree process. SLR-selected variables produced accurate results in the model with a high correlation coefficient of 0.80. The output values ranged from 0 to 100 %. The different tree species were mapped in 30 m resolution in respect to elevation. Percent tree cover map as a final output was derived using LANDSAT TM/ETM image over Goksu Watershed and the biophysical variables. The results were tested using high spatial resolution GeoEye-1 images. Thus, the combination of the RT algorithm and higher resolution data for percent tree cover mapping were tested and examined in a complex Mediterranean environment.

AB  - In protected areas maintaining existing phytodiversity is an important conservation target. In this study we analysed the effects of abandonment on plant species composition and species richness over a period of nine years in a montane grassland in the Long-term Ecosystem Research (LTER) region Eisenwurzen (Styria, Austria). Additional investigations concerned the number of Red Data List species, plant strategy types, Ellenberg indicator values, indicator values for mowing, grazing and trampling tolerance, temporal sequence of phenological phases and seven plant traits. We differentiated two topography-related habitat types: an initially species-rich sheep pasture on a steep, south-facing slope and a less species-rich meadow on a flat site immediately below, with a comparatively higher nutrient and water supply in the topsoil. Testing a possible management alternative, the effects of continued low-intensity sheep grazing on the slope were also analysed. In spring 2001, one permanent plot of 50 m(2) was established in the centre of each habitat type and treatment. Our results show that the long-term effects of abandonment on grassland vegetation depend largely on local site conditions. Nutrient availability in the soil seems to be an especially important factor. On the abandoned flat site, floristic composition and physiognomy changed dramatically within four years; a high species turnover and a decline in phytodiversity could be observed. In contrast, we found only minor effects on the abandoned slope site even nine years after abandonment. If the maintenance of existing phytodiversity is a conservation target, suitable management operations have to be carried out at shorter intervals (at least every 3 years) in habitats with nutrient-rich soils than in nutrient-poor habitats (approx. 5 to 10 years). From a nature conservation point of view, low-intensity sheep grazing may be a suitable management alternative to mowing.

AB  - Batos B., Z. Miletic, S. Orlovic, and D. Miljkovic (2010): Variability of nutritive macroelements in peduncalate oak (Quercus robur L.) leaves in Serbia.- Genetika, Vol 42, No. 3, 435-453. Nowadays, the territory of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) in Serbia is less widespread than in the past, primarily as the consequence of excessive exploitation and aggravated regeneration caused by the changed groundwater regime. The researches in this paper were aimed at the analysis of the variability of the content of macroelements in leaves, as well as of the soil characteristics in the pedunculate oak populations on the different sites, according to which the sites with the best conditions for the nutrition of pedunculate oak would be singled out. The analysed populations are of natural or artificial origin, and they occurred during the process of restitution. They are situated in the zone ranging from continental to moderate continental climate, at five different localities and five different types of soil. Foliar analyses of 150 individual - trees of pedunculate oak at five sites in Serbia and the respective soil analysis show that individual variability in macroelements among trees was not statistically significant, while the site effect was highly significant. Concentrations of elements, at all sites, in the decrease sequence were: N>Ca>K>Mg>P>Na. The highest individual variability was exhibited by Na, followed by Mg, Ca and K, and P as well as N had the lowest variability. The obtained results point to the conclusion that the variability of the content of macroelements in leaves is mainly the result of the environmental influence. Statistically significant intra-individual variability, as an indicator of the existence of genetic differences between trees within populations, was detected only for Ca concentration in leaves.

AB  - Molybdenum (Mo) isotopes have great potential as a paleoredox indicator, but this potential is currently restricted by an incomplete understanding of isotope fractionations occurring during key (bio) geochemical processes. To address one such uncertainty we have investigated the isotopic fractionation of Mo during adsorption to a range of Fe (oxyhydr)oxides, under variable Mo/Fe-mineral ratios and pH. Our data confirm that Fe (oxyhydr)oxides can readily adsorb Mo, highlighting the potential importance of this removal pathway for the global Mo cycle. Furthermore, adsorption of Mo to Fe (oxyhydr)oxides is associated with preferential uptake of the lighter Mo isotopes. Fractionations between the solid and dissolved phase(Delta Mo-98) increase at higher pH, and also vary with mineralogy, increasing in the order magnetite (Delta Mo-98 = 0.83 +/- 0.60 parts per thousand) < ferrihydrite (Delta Mo-98 = 1.11 +/- 0.15 parts per thousand) < goethite (Delta Mo-98 = 1.40 +/- 0.48 parts per thousand) < hematite (Delta Mo-98 = 2.19 +/- 0.54 parts per thousand). Small differences in isotopic fractionation are also seen at varying Mo/Fe-mineral ratios for individual minerals. The observed isotopic behaviour is consistent with both fractionation during adsorption to the mineral surface (a function of vibrational energy) and adsorption of different Mo species/structures from solution. The different fractionation factors determined for different Fe (oxyhydr)oxides suggests that these minerals likely exert a major control on observed natural Mo isotope compositions during sediment deposition beneath suboxic through to anoxic (but non-sulfidic)bottom waters. Our results confirm that Mo isotopes can provide important information on the spatial extent of different paleoredox conditions, providing they are used in combination with other techniques for evaluating the local redox environment and the mineralogy of the depositing sediments.

AB  - There is a growing interest in quantifying regional scale actual evapotranspiration (ET) for water accounting and for water productivity assessments at river basin scale. Methods that provide point values fail to describe the situations at larger scales. Remote sensing measurements can be used at different spatial scales. This paper applies the theory of the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL). SEBAL was originally derived for Egypt, Spain and Niger [Bastiaanssen, W.G.M., 1995. Regionalization of surface flux densities and moisture indicators in composite terrain: a remote sensing approach under clear skies in Mediterranean climates. Ph.D. dissertation, CIP Data Koninklijke Bibliotheek, Den Haag, The Netherlands. 273 pp.] and was calibrated and validated using ground measurements from four flux sites and from seven agro-meteorological stations in the semi-arid region of the Low-Middle Sao Francisco River basin, Brazil. Measured parameters included surface albedo, surface temperature, atmospheric and surface emissivity, soil heat flux, surface roughness, net radiation, air temperature gradients, sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, evaporative fraction, and photosynthetically active radiation. The daily ET was estimated (RMSE of 0.38 mm d(-1)) for mixed agricultural and natural ecosystems. The improved coefficients for the local conditions can now be used to study the impact of expanding irrigated agriculture on the regional water balance and to quantify the water productivity of irrigated horticulture that is the largest water consumer in the Brazilian semi-arid region. Both applications are described in an accompanying paper (Part B). (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Borrmann effect(1,2) - a dramatic increase in transparency to X- ray beams - is observed when X- rays satisfying Bragg's law diffract through a perfect crystal. The minimization of absorption seen in the Borrmann effect has been explained by noting that the electric field of the X- ray beam approaches zero amplitude at the crystal planes, thus avoiding the atoms. Here we show experimentally that under conditions of absorption suppression, the weaker electric quadrupole absorption transitions are effectively enhanced to such a degree that they can dominate the absorption spectrum. This effect can be exploited as an atomic spectroscopy technique; we show that quadrupole transitions give rise to additional structure at the L(1), L(2) and L(3) absorption edges of gadolinium in gadolinium gallium garnet, which mark the onset of excitations from 2s, 2p(1/2) and 2p(3/2) atomic core levels, respectively. Although the Borrmann effect served to underpin the development of the theory of X- ray diffraction(3-6), this is potentially the most important experimental application of the phenomenon since its first observation seven decades ago. Identifying quadrupole features in X- ray absorption spectroscopy is central to the interpretation of 'pre- edge' spectra, which are often taken to be indicators of local symmetry, valence and atomic environment(7). Quadrupolar absorption isolates states of different symmetries to that of the dominant dipole spectrum, and typically reveals orbitals that dominate the electronic ground- state properties of lanthanides and 3d transition metals, including magnetism. Results from our Borrmann spectroscopy technique feed into contemporary discussions regarding resonant X- ray diffraction(8) and the nature of pre-edge lines identified by inelastic X- ray scattering(7). Furthermore, because the Borrmann effect has been observed in photonic materials, it seems likely that the quadrupole enhancement reported here will play an important role in modern optics.

AB  - In 1995, the Geological Surveys of Finland (GTK) and Norway (NGU) and the Central Kola Expedition (CKE) carried out an ecogeochemical mapping programme across one of most heavily damaged areas in Europe, i.e., the western half of the Kola Peninsula, and contiguous areas in northern Finland and Norway. The study included not only media such as moss and podzol profiles but also samples of the humus layer for more than 650 sampling sites. The nature of organic material, i.e., humus layer, depends on the vegetation, climatic conditions and the overburden. The element concentrations found in humus are dual in origin, reflecting anthropogenic input as well as local geology. The anthropogenic input is clearly seen on the map of Factor 1 (Ni, Co, Cu, As, Ni, Cd and Pi). The influence of geology can be seen clearly on the factor loading maps for Factor 2 (Fe, Cr, V, Sb) and, to a lesser extent, those for Factors 4 (Sr, Ca, P) and 5 (Y, Th, Ag, Al). Factor 3 (Rb, Tl, S) combines all those elements whose concentrations increase towards the south, and can be attributed to the zonation of vegetation. Factor 6 (B, K, Mg) can mainly be interpreted as a marine factor. The areas of high loadings of heavy metals have not expanded; the areas of maximum loadings have remained roughly the same for several years as compared to results obtained previously in the same area. The heaviest loadings occur in the area within a radius of 50 to 100 km of the emission source. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Changes in aquatic ecosystem due to anthropogenic or natural process are growing concern which requires regular monitoring for water quality to formulate guidelines for their proper management. The present study aimed to understand the limno-biotic status of nine different small (Kanva, Votehole, Anjanapura, and Gayathri) and medium (Jambadahalla, Tunga, Varahi, Shanthisagar, and Boranakanive) reservoirs of Karnataka state of India using physicochemical and the plankton diversity during the three different seasons (pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon). The water quality parameters like transparency in terms of secchi disc depth (m), water temperature (degrees C), pH, EC (mu S/cm), dissolved oxygen (mg/l), TDS (mg/l), total alkalinity (mg/l), NO3--N (mg/l), PO43--P (mg/l), and SiO2 (mg/l) besides planktonic diversity were measured using standard procedure. The variables were subjected to Pearson's correlation analysis to determine the relationship among them during three seasons. Further principal component analysis (PCA) was done to explain the variance. The results revealed that all the reservoir water was alkaline in nature with marked seasonal differences and was fairly rich in dissolved oxygen except Gayathri. Electrical conductivity values of all the reservoirs were below the permissible limit (2000 mu S/cm) with a noticeable concentration of PO43--P in all the reservoirs. High silicate content coupled with dominance of Mycocystis sp. in most of the reservoirs is an indication of eutrophic condition. Principal component analysis revealed the evidence of anthropogenic factors leading to deterioration of the water quality index of all the reservoirs from "poor" to "unsuitable category" except Tunga reservoir (Good quality). Since all these reservoirs support fisheries and are amenable to enhanced fisheries through fish seed stocking, there is an urgent need to monitor the water quality of these multipurpose reservoirs for conservation of aquatic biodiversity and maintain ecosystem health.

AB  - In recent decades, the biodiversity of freshwater environments has decreased sharply due to anthropogenic disturbances that damaged ecosystem structures and functions. Habitat restoration has emerged as an important method to mitigate the degradation of river ecosystems. Although in many cases a post-project monitoring has been promoted to access the restoration progress, it is still unclear how aquatic community changes following river habitat restoration in China. Macroinvertebrate communities intermediately positioned within ecosystem food webs play a key role in ecosystem processes within river ecosystem, driving energy flow and nutrient cycling. Here, benthic macroinvertebrates are used as bio-indicators to assess the ecosystem health of degraded urban rivers, restored urban rivers, and undisturbed rivers. This study aims to determine (i) how habitat restoration influences macroinvertebrates diversity and how this compared to degraded and reference conditions; (ii) how did macroinvertebrate community compositions differ in restored, degraded, and reference sites; and (iii) the environmental factors shaping macroinvertebrate communities. Habitat restoration significantly increased the diversity and richness of macroinvertebrate community and intolerant species and shifted the community composition towards reference status. Habitat characteristics and water chemistry, including substrate diversity, water velocity, and both nutrients (TN) and organic pollutants (TOC), appeared to shape the turnover of these communities. Habitat characteristics contributed to most of the variation of the entire macroinvertebrate community. Our research indicates that habitat restoration is an efficient approach to restore the aquatic community and hence improve river ecosystem health for freshwater conservation and sustainable management in Zhejiang province. This study strengthens our understanding of the changes of macroinvertebrate community after habitat restoration and important controlling variables that attribute to these changes, which provides an important guidance for future freshwater management.

AB  - Transitional coastal zones are subject to high degrees of temporal fluctuation in environmental conditions, with these patterns varying in space. Gaining an in depth understanding of how sessile organisms cope with and respond to such environmental changes at multiple scales is needed to i) advance fundamental knowledge, predict how organisms may react to stressors and iii) support the management of halieutic resources in transitional coastal areas. We addressed this question using mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) as model system. Valve-gaping sensor were deployed at multiple sites within the southern Venice Lagoon over a period of 6 months, to investigate the existence of periodicity in valve-gaping and its relationship with environmental variables, such as temperature and chlorophyll-a.
   Gaping behaviour was found to have periodic rhythms, of similar to 12 h and similar to 24 h, which were most pronounced in the inner part of lagoon part and were strongest during summer months. In autumn, the dual periodicity became weaker and mostly the 12 h remained. Gaping was closely linked with tide, but the relationship in terms of phasing varied upon location. Surprisingly, no clear direct relationships were found with chlorophyll-a, but food delivery may be mediated by tide itself. The results highlight the heterogeneity of behaviour and the endogenic nature of circadian rhythms in space and time. These findings have important implications for management of transitional areas where tidal alteration may have impacts on key behaviours, and emphasize the importance of characterizing their rhythms before using these as stress indicator. Moreover, the described tidal relationships should be included in growth models of bivalves in these systems. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) interactions is vital for water management in karstic catchments due to its impact on water quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the applicability of seven environmental tracers to quantify and localize groundwater exfiltration into a small, human-impacted karstic river system. Tracers were selected based on their emission source to the surface water either as (a) dissolved, predominantly geogenic compounds (radon-222, sulphate and electrical conductivity) or (b) anthropogenic compounds (predominantly) originating from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents (carbamazepine, tramadol, sodium, chloride). Two contrasting sampling approaches were compared (a) assuming steady-state flow conditions and (b) considering the travel time of the water parcels (Lagrangian sampling) through the catchment to account for diurnal changes in inflow from the WWTP. Spatial variability of the concentrations of all tracers indicated sections of preferential groundwater inflow. Lagrangian sampling techniques seem highly relevant for capturing dynamic concentration patterns of WWTP-derived compounds. Quantification of GW inflow with the finite element model FINIFLUX, based on observed in-stream Rn activities led to plausible fluxes along the investigated river reaches (0.265 m(3)s(-1)), while observations of other natural or anthropogenic environmental tracers produced less plausible water fluxes. Important point sources of groundwater exfiltration can be ascribed to locations where the river crosses geological fault lines. This indicates that commonly applied concepts describing groundwater-surface water interactions assuming diffuse flow in porous media are difficult to transfer to karstic river systems whereas concepts from fractured aquifers may be more applicable. In general, this study helps selecting the best suited hydrological tracer for GW exfiltration and leads to a better understanding of processes controlling groundwater inflow into karstic river systems.

AB  - Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes have profound impacts on the functioning of (agro)ecosystems and have potential to mitigate global climate change. However, we still lack interdisciplinary methods to project future LULC scenarios at spatial scales that are relevant for local decision making and future environmental assessments. Here we apply an interdisciplinary approach to develop spatially explicit projections of LULC at a resolution of 30 x 30 m informed by historic relationships between LULC and their key drivers, within the context of the four qualitative scenarios of global shared socioeconomic pathways. We apply this methodology to a case study in the Zona da Mata, Brazil, which has a history of major LULC changes. The analysis of LULC changes from 1986 to 2015 indicates that pasture area decreased from 76 to 58 % of total area, while forest areas increased from 18 to 24 %, and coffee from 3 to 11 %. Environmental protection legislation, rural credit for smallholder farmers, and demand for agricultural and raw products were identified as main drivers of LULC changes. Projected LULC for 2045 strongly depends on the global socioeconomic pathway scenarios, and forest and coffee areas may increase substantially under strong government measures in the environmentally conscious Green Road scenario or decrease in the high consumption Rocky Road scenario. Our study shows that under the set of drivers during the past three decades reforestation can go hand in hand with increase of agricultural production, but that major and contrasting changes in LULC can be expected depending on the socioeconomic pathway that will be followed in the future. To guide this process, LULC scenarios at the local scale can inform the planning of local and regional development and forest conservation.

AB  - Thermal indices as environmental risk indicators have been used to assess heat stress of dairy cows. The present study aimed to evaluate the predictive performance of the typical cattle-related thermal indices by comparing their prediction to heat stress levels and associations with some physiological responses. The study was conducted from August to September 2019 in a naturally ventilated barn in Jiangsu, China. Nine typical cattle-related thermal indices, i.e., temperature-humidity index (THI), black globe temperature index (BGHI), equivalent temperature index, effective temperature (ET) for dairy cows, respiratory rate predictor (RRP), adjusted temperature-humidity index (THIadj), heat load index (HLI), comprehensive climate index (CCI), and equivalent temperature index for cattle (ETIC), were evaluated. Respiration rate (RR) and body surface temperature (BST) were collected twice per day from a total of 287 lactating cows, 18 of which were continuously measured vaginal temperature (VT). Over the experimental period, the average daily RR, VT, and BST were 55.8 breaths/min, 38.7 degrees C, and 32.3 to 36.4 degrees C that depend on body positions, respectively. The study found that the prediction of THI, BGHI, THIadj, and CCI was closer to the actual heat stress conditions which were mild to moderate heat stress. Correlation analyses showed that RR, VT, and BST correlated most closely with effective temperature (r = 0.580;P < 0.05), BGHI (r = 0.642; P < 0.05), and CCI (r = 0.849; P < 0.05). In this evaluation, based on the comprehensive performance of CCI in the relatively accurate prediction to heat stress level and duration, detection on environmental differences between standing and lying zone, and correlations with some physiological responses, CCI is seemingly the promising thermal index to assess heat stress of housed dairy cows.

AB  - The occurrence of the {2 1 0} shape of pyrite crystals has been used as an empirical indicator for gold enrichment in ore deposits. Such indicating, also called 'typomorphism' in ore mineralogy, was conventionally attributed to environmental factors such as sulfur fugacity and temperature and pressure conditions in the ore-forming hydrothermal fluid. Here we show that the crystal-face specific redox reactivity of pyrite is also an important governing potency that drives gold enrichment in the pyrite crystals with particular shapes. This conclusion was drawn from data compiled from chemical analysis of field samples, laboratory testing of gold deposition on natural pyrite crystals, as well as theoretical calculations. Kinetic measurements of gold reductive deposition first revealed the highest precipitation rate on the {2 1 0} faces, particularly when pyrite crystals are enclosed by complex forms containing {2 1 0}. Corroborating with the experimental observations, density functional theory (DFT) calculations further indicated that the {2 1 0} possesses a high adsorption energy for gold, a high energy state of the highest occupied molecular orbital and consequently a low Eh. These results afford evidence supporting the view that the face specific reactivity, an intrinsic property of crystal, plays an important role in the gold concentration in pyrite and the occurrence of specific pyrite shapes. Our findings not only provide a surface chemical view for understanding the empirical prospecting method but also exemplified the significance of crystal face specific-reactivity in understanding crystallographic orientation related geochemical processes. The crystal face specific reactivity may be a critical factor controlling geochemical reactions at mineral-water interface, such as prebiotic synthesis on pyrite surfaces and mineral-water interface controlled kinetic isotope fractionation.

AB  - The Yellow River Delta has abundant land resources, but the land exhibits heavy degeneration because of long-term exposure to harsh natural conditions and improper human activities, and the soil quality is poor in some areas. All these factors have adversely affected agricultural development and ecological protection in the Yellow River Delta. This study selected multiple physical and chemical indicators and used principal component analysis (PCA) to construct a minimum data set (MDS) to determine a comprehensive set of indicators for assessing soil quality in the Yellow River Delta. Moreover, a fuzzy logic model was used to assess soil quality and analyze the spatial distribution of the primary land use types in different soil quality grades. The results indicate that the MDS includes six soil indicators: total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (AK), soil organic matter (SOM), soil salinity (SS) and pH. According to the spatial distribution maps of the indicators, SS gradually declined from the coast to the inland areas, while TN and AP had opposite characteristics. AK and pH were evenly distributed around the study area, and SOM was highest in the center and gradually declined toward the edge of the study area. The soil quality was higher in inland areas than in coastal areas, and most of the study area was classified as grade III. Most of the farmland, forest, and garden plots were distributed in high-grade soil levels, but some of these plots were distributed in areas classified as grades V or VI. Many areas with high soil quality were unused, which indicated that the land resources of the study area should be planned reasonably.

AB  - Gulf Menhaden, Brevoortia patronus, in the northern Gulf of Mexico support a large commercial fishery and are thought to play an important trophic role in the coastal ecosystem. The temporal dynamics of both fatty acid and oil content have a direct impact on the value of Gulf Menhaden to predators and to the fishery. In this work, we describe how oil content of Gulf Menhaden varies with season, sex, age, condition, and tissue and investigate how fatty acid composition of mature (>= 137.5 mm FL) female tissues varies with season, month, and tissue type. We found pronounced temporal (January to October) variation in mean oil content ranging from 0.062 to 0.579 mg g(-1) that exhibited a significant (p < 0.001) seasonal pattern. We observed significant differences in oil content between tissue (muscle vs. ovary) of mature females and these exhibited a significant seasonal contrast, indicating that females were provisioning eggs in the fall. PERMANOVA analysis indicated the existence of significant differences (p < 0.001) in the composition of fatty acids of muscle tissue collected in different months. Mean eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) levels exhibited significant seasonal differences (p < 0.05), and in the case of DHA and LC-PUFA, both exhibited mean tissue-specific differences (p < 0.05). This work indicates that the value of Gulf Menhaden as prey and a fishery resource in the region varies during the year and we propose that trophic models of the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem should account for this variation.

AB  - The creation of general-purpose combustion chambers and drafting of regulations (unified technologies) which would secure efficient combustion of complex fuel compositions necessitates reliable experimental data concerning the main ignition and combustion characteristics of high-potential oil-water emulsions, coal-water slurries and coal-water slurries containing petrochemicals. In the conducted experiments, we varied the main factors of heating, ignition and combustion processes: properties and concentrations of solid and liquid fuels, the temperature in the model combustion chamber, and initial sizes of fuel droplets. It was established that ignition delay times of oil-water emulsions and coal-water slurries containing petrochemicals based on typical industrial waste can differ 3-4 times. The combustion heat of typical waste industrial oil (collected from power plants after use) makes up 50-90% of the total combustion heat of oil-water emulsions and coal-water slurries containing petrochemicals. The main anthropogenic emission concentrations (sulfur and nitrogen oxides) are 5-6 times higher from burning oil-water emulsions than from burning coal-water slurries containing petrochemicals. We have defined thermal conditions providing close values of the main combustion parameters for oil-water emulsions and fuel slurries. Using two approaches, we have calculated relative efficiency indicators (criteria) of burning high-potential oil-water emulsions, coal-water slurries, and coal-water slurries containing petrochemicals versus coal. These criteria take into account environmental, economic and energy performance. Environmental and energy performance indicators of coal-water slurries containing petrochemicals are 35-90 times higher than those of oil-water emulsions, and 6-16 times higher than those of coal dust fuel.

AB  - Microbial respiration (R-m) and ecoenzyme activities (EEA) related to microbial carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus acquisition were measured in 792 freshwater and estuarine wetlands (representing a cumulative area of 217,480 km(2)) across the continental United States as part of the US EPA's 2011 National Wetland Condition Assessment. EEA stoichiometry was used to construct models for and assess nutrient limitation, carbon use efficiency (CUE), and organic matter decomposition (- k). The wetlands were classified into ten groups based on aggregated ecoregion and wetland type. The wetlands were also assigned to least, intermediate, and most disturbed classes, based on the extent of human influences. Ecoenzyme activity related to C, N and P acquisition, R-m, CUE, and - k differed among ecoregion-wetland types and, with the exception of C acquisition and - k, among disturbance classes. R-m and EEA were positively correlated with soil C, N and P content (r = 0.15-0.64) and stoichiometry (r = 0.15-0.48), and negatively correlated with an index of carbon quality (r = - 0.22 to - 0.39). EEA stoichiometry revealed that wetlands were more often P- than N-limited, and that P-limitation increases with increasing disturbance. Our enzyme-based approach for modeling C, N, and P acquisition, and organic matter decomposition, all rooted in stoichiometric theory, provides a mechanism for modeling resource limitations of microbial metabolism and biogeochemical cycling in wetlands. Given the ease of collecting and analyzing soil EEA and their response to wetland disturbance gradients, enzyme stoichiometry models are a cost-effective tool for monitoring ecosystem responses to resource availability and the environmental drivers of microbial metabolism, including those related to global climate changes.

AB  - The minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) is the most common baleen whale among several marine mammal species observed in Korea. Since a high concentrated condition of prey to whales can be obtained by physical structures, the foraging whale distribution can be an indicator of biological hotspot. Our main objective is verifying the coastal upwelling-southwestern East Sea as a productive biological hotspot based on the geographical distribution of minke whales. Among the cetacean research surveys of the National Institute of Fisheries Science since 1999, 9 years data for the minke whales available in the East Sea were used for this study. The regional primary productivity derived from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was used for a proxy of biological productivity. Minke whales observed during the sighting surveys were mostly concentrated in May and found mostly (approximately 70%) in the southwestern coastal areas (< 300 m) where high chlorophyll concentrations and primary productivity were generally detected. Based on MODIS-derived primary productivity algorithm, the annual primary production (320 g C m(-2) y(-1)) estimated in the southwestern coastal region of the East Sea belongs to the highly productive coastal upwelling regions in the world. A change in the main spatial distribution of minke whales was found in recent years, which indicate that the major habitats of mink whales have been shifted into the north of the common coastal upwelling regions. This is consistent with the recently reported unprecedented coastal upwelling in the mid-eastern coast of Korea. Based on high phytoplankton productivity and high distribution of minke whales, the southwestern coastal regions can be considered as one of biological hotspots in the East Sea. These regions are important for ecosystem dynamics and the population biology of top marine predators, especially migratory whales and needed to be carefully managed from a resource management perspective.

AB  - Behavioral ecotoxicology has become very important in the short time since a change in behavior is very often the first response to environmental altered conditions. We investigated the influence of trace metal intake on the spatial orientation performances of the carabid beetle Parallelomorphus laevigatus, fundamental ability for its survival. The aim of this study was to consider the solar orientation as behavioral biomarker for exposure to trace metal contamination. Therefore, we tested the ability of solar orientation of specimens of this species, fed with shrimps contaminated with three different concentrations of Cu, Zn, or Hg. We carried out the orientation tests after 1, 3, 7, and 10 days of contaminated feeding. Subsequently, we fed these beetles with not contaminated shrimps and again tested them after 1, 3, 7, and 10 days. For all three metals considered and, regardless of the degree of contamination of the food, we have found a progressive and significant counterclockwise displacement of the angle of orientation and a corresponding progressive reduction in the precision in the directional choices by the animals. We also noticed a clear growing recovery in the normal orientation by these insects after returning to their feeding with uncontaminated food. In conclusion, we can consider the orientation in space of P. laevigatus as a behavioral biomarker for exposure to trace metal contamination. We believe that the intake of trace metals may induce the insects to make mistakes in their spatial orientation, due to an acceleration of their biological clock. Such a clock malfunction is not definitive, since the return to a normal diet restores P. laevigatus the ability to re-make the correct directional choices. Ultimately, our results confirm the usefulness of behavioral ecotoxicology investigations; moreover, they stimulate the opportunity to deepen the understanding of functioning of the biological clock in the animals.

AB  - Developing water quality guidelines for Antarctic marine environments requires understanding the sensitivity of local biota to contaminant exposure. Antarctic invertebrates have shown slower contaminant responses in previous experiments compared to temperate and tropical species in standard toxicity tests. Consequently, test methods which take into account environmental conditions and biological characteristics of cold climate species need to be developed. This study investigated the effects of five metals on the survival of a common Antarctic amphipod, Orchomenella pinguides. Multiple observations assessing mortality to metal exposure were made over the 30 days exposure period. Traditional toxicity tests with quantal data sets are analysed using methods such as maximum likelihood regression (probit analysis) and Spearman-Karber which treat individual time period endpoints independently. A new statistical model was developed to integrate the time-series concentration-response data obtained in this study. Grouped survival data were modelled using a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) which incorporates all the data obtained from multiple observation times to derive time integrated point estimates. The sensitivity of the amphipod, O. pinguides, to metals increased with increasing exposure time. Response times varied for different metals with amphipods responding faster to copper than to cadmium, lead or zinc. As indicated by 30 days lethal concentration (LC50) estimates, copper was the most toxic metal (31 mu g/L), followed by cadmium(168 mu g/L), lead (256 mu g/L) and zinc (822 mu g/L). Nickel exposure (up to 1.12 mg/L) did not affect amphipod survival. Using longer exposure durations and utilising the GAMM model provides an improved methodology for assessing sensitivities of slow responding Antarctic marine invertebrates to contaminants.

AB  - Metal rich sites are populated by only a few specialized vascular plant species allowing less competitive bryophytes to inhabit these ecological niches. On such sites, many different stress factors may interact with the plants and foreclose statements on the individual effects of a single factor, therefore the means for this tolerance are difficult to investigate. This study uses the cultivation of the moss Physcomitrella patens on solid media under controlled environmental conditions in order to study the growth inhibiting effects of copper, zinc and cadmium and the contribution of corresponding anions as chlorides, sulfates and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, respectively. Availability of the metals to plants was estimated both by water extraction with subsequent measurement by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy and by modeling metal speciation using Visual MINTEQ a free chemical equilibrium model software.
   A decreased ratio of gametophyte to protonema growth (G:P) was observed as a first reaction to even very low metal levels; G:P measurements can therefore be used as sensitive stress indicators in P. patens. Though all metals caused inhibiting effects with all anions, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid chelates showed up to three orders of magnitude less toxic. Using Visual MINTEQ, we modeled the water solubility of zinc almost perfectly but achieved less accurate results for copper. For both metals, water solubility was rather under- than overestimated, indicating that adsorption to the agar played only a minor role in controlling metal solubility. Free metal cations were useful to explain growth inhibition which could not be fully explained by total metal concentration, calculated or experimentally determined water solubility. Especially the low toxicity of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid chelates could be explained satisfactory by shielding of the metal ions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Earthworms are important soil macrofauna inhabiting almost all ecosystems. Their biomass is large and their burrowing and ingestion of soils alters soil physicochemical properties. Because of their large biomass, earthworms are regarded as an indicator of "soil heath''. However, primarily because the difficulties in quantifying their behavior, the extent of their impact on soil material flow dynamics and soil health is poorly understood. Image data, with the aid of image processing tools, are a powerful tool in quantifying the movements of objects. Image data sets are often very large and time-consuming to analyze, especially when continuously recorded and manually processed. We aimed to develop a system to quantify earthworm movement from video recordings. Our newly developed program successfully tracked the two-dimensional positions of three separate parts of the earthworm and simultaneously output the change in its body length. From the output data, we calculated the velocity of the earthworm's movement. Our program processed the image data three times faster than the manual tracking system. To date, there are no existing systems to quantify earthworm activity from continuously recorded image data. The system developed in this study will reduce input time by a factor of three compared with manual data entry and will reduce errors involved in quantifying large data sets. Furthermore, it will provide more reliable measured values, although the program is still a prototype that needs further testing and improvement. Combined with other techniques, such as measuring metabolic gas emissions from earthworm bodies, this program could provide continuous observations of earthworm behavior in response to environmental variables under laboratory conditions. In the future, this standardized method will be applied to other animals, and the quantified earthworm movement will be incorporated into models of soil material flow dynamics or behavior in response to chemical substances present in the soil.

AB  - The development of stress-tolerant crops is an increasingly important goal of current crop breeding. A higher abiotic stress tolerance could increase the probability of introgression of genes from crops to wild relatives. This is particularly relevant to the discussion on the risks of new GM crops that may be engineered to increase abiotic stress resistance. We investigated abiotic stress QTL in greenhouse and field experiments in which we subjected recombinant inbred lines from a cross between cultivated Lactuca sativa cv. Salinas and its wild relative L. serriola to drought, low nutrients, salt stress, and aboveground competition. Aboveground biomass at the end of the rosette stage was used as a proxy for the performance of plants under a particular stress. We detected a mosaic of abiotic stress QTL over the entire genome with little overlap between QTL from different stresses. The two QTL clusters that were identified reflected general growth rather than specific stress responses and colocated with clusters found in earlier studies for leaf shape and flowering time. Genetic correlations across treatments were often higher among different stress treatments within the same experiment (greenhouse or field), than among the same type of stress applied in different experiments. Moreover, the effects of the field stress treatments were more correlated with those of the greenhouse competition treatments than to those of the other greenhouse stress experiments, suggesting that competition rather than abiotic stress is a major factor in the field. In conclusion, the introgression risk of stress tolerance (trans-) genes under field conditions cannot easily be predicted based on genomic background selection patterns from controlled QTL experiments in greenhouses, especially field data will be needed to assess potential (negative) ecological effects of introgression of these transgenes into wild relatives.

AB  - Because of inadequate knowledge and funding, the use of biodiversity indicators is often suggested as a way to support management decisions. Consequently, many studies have analyzed the performance of certain groups as indicator taxa. However, in addition to knowing whether certain groups can adequately represent the biodiversity as a whole, we must also know whether they show similar responses to the main structuring processes affecting biodiversity. Here we present an application of the metacommunity framework for evaluating the effectiveness of biodiversity indicators. Although the metacommunity framework has contributed to a better understanding of biodiversity patterns, there is still limited discussion about its implications for conservation and biomonitoring. We evaluated the effectiveness of indicator taxa in representing spatial variation in macroinvertebrate community composition in Atlantic Forest streams, and the processes that drive this variation. We focused on analyzing whether some groups conform to environmental processes and other groups are more influenced by spatial processes, and on how this can help in deciding which indicator group or groups should be used. We showed that a relatively small subset of taxa from the metacommunity would represent 80% of the variation in community composition shown by the entire metacommunity. Moreover, this subset does not have to be composed of predetermined taxonomic groups, but rather can be defined based on random subsets. We also found that some random subsets composed of a small number of genera performed better in responding to major environmental gradients. There were also random subsets that seemed to be affected by spatial processes, which could indicate important historical processes. We were able to integrate in the same theoretical and practical framework, the selection of biodiversity surrogates, indicators of environmental conditions, and more importantly, an explicit integration of environmental and spatial processes into the selection approach.

AB  - Life cycle assessment and marginal prevention costs (eco-costs method) for an acrylonitrile plant were carried out estimating the environmental impact and the eco-costs, due to the increment in the production capacity. This study compares the old plant's operative performance (old design) at 50,000 ton/year where the by-products were incinerated, with the current operation at 60,000 ton/year where those by-products in the waste stream will be treated to take advantage of its substance content, to generate profitable products. In addition, the effect of a wastewater flow rate with cyanide was evaluated on the biological wastewater treatment process.
   The redesign showed a high reduction percentage in eleven of eighteen midpoint impact categories. The reduction of 36% in the global impacts in the redesign was obtained when these ones were calculated based on the impacts of the year of 2005. The CO2 emissions equivalents (CO(2)eq) had a reduction of 46% (from 6.55 to 3.50 kg CO(2)eq/kg of acrylonitrile). The total of marginal prevention costs (eco-costs) are 1.28 USD/kg for acrylonitrile old design and the 0.735 USD/kg for acrylonitrile redesign, i.e. 42.5% lower than the old design. This means that 94.5% are costs for pollution and the use of energy and 5.4% by depletions of material resources.
   This study proved that the redesign is environmentally most favorable and economically affordable method. Eco-costs method should be incorporated as part of the financial indicators of a project, but with the respective adaptation to the environmental and economic conditions of a region.

AB  - Glucocorticoids are important stress hormones in birds that affect many aspects of physiology and behavior. Although these hormones have been well studied in temperate and Arctic-dwelling birds, much less is known about them in tropical species. Corticosterone, the primary avian glucocorticoid, is best-known for its involvement in energy balance. In ecological contexts, its main function is to re-direct an organism towards immediate survival of a biotic or abiotic stressor. As tropical environments are quite different from temperate and Arctic ones, corticosterone may have unique influences on avian physiology and behavior near the equator. For example, seasonality in the tropics is not characterized by the dramatic changes in ambient temperature as it is in the Arctic and temperate zones. In the tropics, other conditions, such as rainfall, may more strongly influence corticosterone and thus fitness. Likewise, threat of infection may be greater, or at least more persistent, in the tropics compared to other parts of the globe. As corticosterone can be immunosuppressive, tropical birds may avoid maintaining high levels of this hormone or be insensitive to it. In this paper, we review basic aspects of glucocorticoid physiology then briefly summarize the literature on corticosterone in non-tropical birds. We then summarize data from the few studies of corticosterone in tropical species and suggest some potentially useful directions for future studies, including how differences in habitat and social/mating systems, in particular, might influence patterns of corticosterone in tropical species. As corticosterone can be an indicator of the stress an organism has experienced, study of this hormone in tropical birds may not only teach us about its function in novel situations, it may also augment efforts to conserve avian populations.

AB  - This research examined landscape indicators that signal ecological change in both intensely used and lightly used lands at Fort Benning, Georgia. Changes in patterns of land cover through time affect the ecological system by altering the proportion and distribution of habitats for species that these cover types support. Landscape patterns, therefore, are important indicators of land-use impacts, past and present, upon the landscape. This analysis of landscape pattern began with a landscape characterization based on witness tree data from 1827 and the 1830s and remotely sensed data from 1974, 1983 199 1, and 1999. The data from the early 1800s, although coarse, were useful in characterizing the historical range of variability in ecological conditions for the area. The steps for the analysis involved the creation of a land-cover database and a time series of land-cover maps, computation of landscape metrics, and evaluation of changes in those metrics over time as evidenced in the land-cover maps. We focused on five cover types (bare/developed land, deciduous forest, mixed forest, pine forest, and non-forest vegetated land), for they reveal information important to resources management at Fort Benning. An examination of land-cover class and landscape metrics, computed from the maps, indicated that a suite of metrics adequately describes the charging landscape at Fort Benning, Georgia. The most appropriate metrics were percent cover, total edge (km), number of patches, descriptors of patch area, nearest neighbor distance, the mean perimeter-to-area ratio, shape range, and clumpiness. Identification of such ecological indicators is an important component Of building an effective environmental monitoring system. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A local source of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Saglek Bay, Labrador, has contaminated marine sediments and the coastal food web. As part of a larger assessment of ecological risks in the Bay, we evaluated biological responses to PCB concentrations in a northern fish species, the shorthorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius). Biological endpoints, including ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in liver tissue, fish body condition, lipid content, and relative liver mass were examined in 35 sculpin collected during August-September 1999. Across a wide range of PCB concentrations (5.1-6920 ng/g wet weight (ww) in whole fish excluding liver), sculpin showed significant EROD induction (as much as 25-fold in the most exposed group). Responses varied directly with PCB concentrations but there was also an apparent threshold for induction at about 50 ng/g ww (whole fish excluding liver). A strong relationship between sculpin PCB concentrations and the concentrations of PCBs in the marine sediments of Saglek Bay suggests that concentrations above this threshold can arise from very low concentrations in sediments (2.3 ng/g dry weight). Other biological endpoints did not show significant responses to PCB concentrations, nor were they related to the observed EROD activity. Although PCDF compounds were present in trace amounts (primarily 2,3,4,7,8-PnCDF), mono-ortho and non-ortho substituted (coplanar) PCBs appeared to contribute the majority of the total dioxin toxic equivalent (TEQ) concentrations. Overall, the results indicate that biological responses occur in shorthorn sculpin with relatively low PCB concentrations (similar to 50 ng/g), which are not unrealistic for even mildly contaminated areas in northern Canada.

AB  - The amphipod Diporeia spp. is the dominant component of the Great Lakes benthic macroinvertebrate fauna, and plays an important role in the ecosystem. The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 1978 (GLWQA) calls for the use of Diporeia as an indicator of ecological condition, with a goal of 220 to 320/m(2) at depths less than 100 m, and 30-160/m(2) at greater depths. To ascertain the status of Diporeia in Lake Superior, a probability-based survey of 27 sites representing the U.S. nearshore (10 to 110 m) waters of Lake Superior was conducted in 1994, and again in 2000. During 1995 to 1998, ten nearshore non-depositional sites and five sites in major depositional basins in the western half of the lake were revisited yearly to examine variability of Diporeia abundance. In 1994, nearshore Diporeia abundance ranged from 550 to 5500/m(2), and the entire nearshore area met or exceeded the GLWQA ecosystem objective. In 2000, abundance ranged from less than 10 to 2,800/m(2), and 11% of the nearshore area did not meet the GLWQA objective. The area that did not meet the GLWQA objective was located in the eastern half of the lake. Examination of yearly abundance data in the western half of Lake Superior did not reveal a significant trend at nearshore or offshore sites. Although Diporeia abundance in the eastern half of the lake was lower in 2000 than 1994, the severe declines in Diporeia populations that have been observed in the lower Great Lakes are not evident in Lake Superior. Abundances of Diporeia observed in the present study are higher than those reported in the 1970s by a factor of seven.

AB  - At eight different dates during the 2000 growing season, delta(13)C and delta(18)O were determined in the phloem of adult beech trees growing in natural beech stands in south-west Germany differing in stand density and local climate. In addition, stand transpiration, precipitation, photosynthetic active radiation, relative air humidity, water pressure deficit of the air, air and soil temperature, soil water potential, and sugar concentration of the phloem sap were determined directly and evaporation and canopy stomatal conductance were modelled. All parameters were related to delta(13)C. The study aimed to identify the time integral within which the delta(13)C of organic compounds transported in the phloem is an indicative measure of these environmental influences. delta(13)C of soluble carbon transported in the phloem was well correlated with mean stomatal conductance in a two-day integral prior to phloem sampling but did not depend on either light intensity or soil water availability. A strong positive relationship between delta(13)C and delta(18)O pointed to observed variation in delta(13)C of phloem sap being a result of variation in stomatal conductance. Bulk leaf delta(13)C was a poor indicator of changes in environmental conditions during the growing season. From these results we conclude that the analysis of delta(13)C in soluble carbon transported in the phloem is a reliable indicator of short-term changes in C-i/C-a. In contrast, the delta(13)C of structural carbon in beech foliage represents an integration of a range of factors that mask short-term influences responsible for C-i/C-a.

AB  - Pesticide use options available to farmers differ strongly with respect to the risks they pose to the environment. This paper proposes a fuzzy expert system to calculate an indicator "Ipest" which reflects an expert perception of the potential environmental impact of the application of a pesticide in a field crop. We defined four modules, one reflecting the presence (rate of application) of the pesticide, the other three reflecting the risk for three major environmental compartments (groundwater, surface water, air). The input variables for these modules are pesticide properties, site-specific conditions and characteristics of the pesticide application. For each input variable two functions describing membership to the fuzzy subsets Favourable (F) and Unfavourable (U) have been defined. These functions are based on criteria drawn from the literature or on the authors' expert judgement. The expert system calculates the value of modules according to the degree of membership of the input variables to the fuzzy subsets F and U and according to sets of decision rules. The four modules can be considered individually or can be aggregated (again according to membership to fuzzy subsets F and U and a set of decision rules) into the indicator Ipest. The system is flexible and can be tuned to expert perception, it can be used as a decision aid tool to rank or choose between alternative pesticide application options with respect to their potential environmental impact. Results of a sensitivity analysis and module and Ipest scores for some pesticide application cases are presented.

AB  - The specific nature of forestry as an economic activity generates problems in realizing the set business plans and executing commercial operations. Business analysis deals with concepts and methods of perceiving the degree of development, as well as with unrealized possibilities of a business entity. The particular character of analyzing business operations of entities dealing with forest management arises, among other things, from the need to assure forest sustainability. In managing forests and forestland, it is not always possible to obey the principle of operational profitability, as the lack of any silvicultural treatments jeopardizes future increment of wood biomass and leads to the decline in the general forest value. Furthermore, the specificity of forest management is particularly evident in a long term cycle of biomass production, and extensive period of time between initial activities and the achieved economic effects, and in investments into forests which frequently exceed the financial possibilities of forest owners. The achieved degree and the unrealized possibilities of developing the forest potential are conditioned by biological factors and by economic and technical treatments. To measure and evaluate the effects of these factors on forest sustainability, specific knowledge is required combined with specific criteria for analytical assessment of the success of business entities dealing with forest management.
   This paper discusses economic and business analysis in forestry. It presents the results of the research project conducted by the state forest company "Hrvatske sume" d.o.o. and Faculty of Forestry University of Zagreb over a 5 year period. The data regarding the economic value of the forest, annual cut value, biological regeneration costs for all forest management units in
   Pozega Forest Administration, including incomes and costs of forest harvesting have been analyzed together with the data regarding profitability and economic indicators. The actual cutting value method has been used for the analyses of the stand value. The Activity Based Cost Method has been used for the cost analysis. The cost-effectiveness and profitability in forestry have also been calculated. Pozega Forest Administration manages the area of 52,025 ha, mainly productive forests in the Municipality of Slavonia and Pozega.
   The total annual cut is 140,991 m(3) on the area of 3,615 ha. The total growing stock of the state forests is 9,744,426 m(3), which includes 9,200,025 m(3) of even-aged forests and 544,401 m(3) of uneven aged forests. The annual wood volume increment is 253,947 m(3). The average forest stand value is 46,871 HRK/ha, or 54,723 HRK/ha without first age class (see Fig. 1 Forest value per management unit). The total costs of biological regeneration are 1,529 HRK/ha, and without forest management, silviculture, forest protection and wood construction it is 7,029 HRK/ha. The costs of the biological regeneration are shown in Fig. 2. The value of the annual cut for Pozega Forest Administration is 10,214 HRK/ha (see Table 1).
   The costs of forest harvesting in 2007 are 8,460 HRK/ha on average, and 8,659 HRK/ha in 2008. Expenditures and revenues of forest harvesting in Pozega Forest Administration 2007/2008 are shown in Fig. 4. If the costs of biological regeneration are included, the cost-effectiveness ratio is less than one (e<1), meaning that the management of the selected forest administration is not cost-effective. However, according to the presented negative economic indicators, profitability in forestry has shown positive forest management results. The possible measures that could lead to the increase in profitability are those affecting the company income. To achieve this goal it is necessary to lower the forest biological regeneration costs, to lower the market sale price, to increase the engaged resources, and to improve the capacity utilization.
   This research has shown that specific understanding and measuring of forest potentials are conditioned by biological factors and by economic and technical treatments. To measure and evaluate the effects of these factors on forest sustainability, specific knowledge is required combined with specific criteria for analytical assessment of the success of business entities dealing with forest management.

TI  - Global consequences of the European Union enlargement and convergence position of the Slovak economy
T2  - EKONOMICKY CASOPIS
LA  - Slovak
AB  - The objective of the presented article is to contribute to a more real approach to understanding the impact of the eternal environment's development on the conditions and consequences of Slovakia's accession into the EU. In thus context, the article concentrates an analytical attention to the following areas of problems:
   a cardinal impact of globalisation processes and qualitative mega-competition on the EU and consequent high requirements on its global adaptation;
   present and prepared reforms of the mechanisms of the EU functioning;
   a convergence position of Slovakia among the candidate countries.
   It has been characteristic for whole pre-globalisation development of internationalisation of the economic life that external - or international economic relations - as well as the system of the world economy, have kept the character of derivation, derived from the determining characteristics of national economies.
   Globalisation represents a radical turnover in which the process of internationalisation is terminated, as its volume exceeds the critical threshold, in which the cumulating quantity of internationalisation of the state economic structures passes into a new quality - into the forming of a world-wide structure. Its formation means that the primary and determining character and the importance of econonuc relations and processes is moving from the inside of state entities to the global economic relations and processes, in which the key role is played by the ,,transnational players" - TNCs (transnational corporations). Globalisation is thus dictating the logic of the evolution not only to the state economies, but also major regional integration aligcunents, like the EU, have to adapt themselves to a strong pressure of the globalisation trends.
   While entering the EU, it has to be taken into consideration, that the EU is also a part of the globalising world economy, where it is confronted with an extremely challenging mega-competition, most of all with the USA and Japan. The position of the EU in the competition of three centres of the world economy has and will have radical impact on the future development of the integration process, its priorities and conditions. Because of thus reason, it is relevant also in the context of the interests of the candidate countries. Data about the development in the economies of the USA, the EU and Japan documents a long-teen downward trend in the annual averages of real GDP growth in the decades from 1950 - 2000. Concurrently, it reveals remarkable differences in a decreasing rate of the performance of mentioned economies.
   From the view of the EU, the ,,scissors effect" between performance of its economy and the performance of the USA economy becomes very significant. According to the projections of prestigious foreign institutions, it is expected that after the year 2000 except for 2001 - economic growth rate in the USA will be still - until 2004 - advancing the EU of more than 1 percentage point.
   Besides the remarkable and still rising technologic advance, the most important advantage of the USA in relation to the EU is represented also by political and economic compactness and unique systematic economic policy that is far in advance from thus one trying to be achieved during 40 years of integration in Europe. The competition with the USA will be very challenging strategic priority for the EU. The objectives and means of its fulfilment will influence European development essentially and they will also considerably influence the character of the conditions of the new member states, Slovakia included.
   Global mega-competition raises the categorical request for the advancement in the competitiveness of the European Union as a whole, of all its member states and of its companies, on the basis of the formation of the Union as a compact economic complex with an internally harmonized business environment. For its formation, the EU plans to realize variety of key reforms in taxes, banking, financial and capital market, pension systems, labor market, agricultural policy, governance and its financing, Pact of Stability's criteria adherence and creation of the new principles and mechanisms of decision-making processes and the EU institutional structures functioning within the horizon of 2003-2006.
   The difficulties and complications of the economic development in the EU, the problems in a realization of its reforms and in a functioning of the EMU are reflected into a modification of the conditions of the candidate countries' entry, which could bring several risks for them. It is obvious that the conditions of the entry of present candidate countries into the EU will be considerably more serious and more complicated then during the past enlargements. The candidate countries represent - before as well as after their entry into the EU - potential and real partners as well as competitors in various directions. In this context, it is important to identify our relative position among diem. In the article, the position is analyzed by 11 indicators in relation to the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia. The most complex analysis of Slovakia's relative position among the other candidate countries is provided by the Transformation Effect Indicator and by the European Convergence Indicator. In the both cases, Slovakia has relatively the weakest convergence position.

AB  - Marine predators are thought to utilise oceanic features adjusting their foraging strategy in a scale-dependent manner. Thus, they are thought to dynamically alter their foraging behaviour in response to environmental conditions encountered. In this study, we examined the foraging behaviour of King Penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) breeding at South Georgia in relation to predictable and stable oceanographic features. We studied penguins during their long post-laying foraging trips during December 2005 and January 2006. For this investigation, we undertook a simultaneous analysis of ARGOS satellite-tracking data and Mk 7 Wild Life Computers Time Depth Recorder (TDR) dive data. To investigate correlations between foraging behaviour and oceanographic conditions, we used SST data from January 2006 from MODIS satellite AQUA. To determine changes in search effort, first passage time (FPT) was calculated; for analysis of dive behaviour, we used several dive parameters that are thought to be reliable indicators of changes in foraging behaviour. King Penguins appeared to target predictable mesoscale features in the Polar Front Zone (PFZ), either a warm-core eddy in the PFZ or regions of strong temperature gradients at oceanic fronts. Two different trip types could be distinguished: direct trips with a straight path to one foraging area at the edge of an eddy or at a thermal front, and circular trips where birds foraged along strong thermal gradients at the northern limit of the PFZ. It is likely that both trip types were a direct consequence of prey encounter rates and distributions, both of which are likely to be associated with these oceanographic features. Circular trips often included passages across the centre of an eddy where birds made deep foraging dives, but remained only a short time in the eddy, possibly because prey were too deep. All birds showed Area Restricted Search (ARS) at scales of <10 km. The two trip types had different ARS patterns, with clear ARS hotspots for direct trips and several ARS hotspots over the whole duration of the trip for circular trips. Dive behaviour had clear relationships with the changing water temperature and the time of day, presumably in response to different prey distribution. Especially for direct trips, dive behaviour showed significant differences within and outside of ARS hotspots. Thus, King Penguins appear to target predictable mesoscale features in the PFZ. They use ARS in different patterns to exploit the environment and adjust their foraging strategy and diving behaviour depending upon conditions they encountered. Diving behaviour showed correlations to ARS patterns, especially for direct trips, which may represent a favourable foraging strategy. The presence of predictable oceanic features allows King Penguins to focus their foraging effort, presumably allowing them to increase their foraging success and decrease their diving effort.

AB  - Introduction: The Chilean Army considers processes that can optimize physical capacities for responding to the impact of situations and given stressors. The study of the effect of hypothermia as a stressor agent (HSA) and its relationship with cardiovascular, hematological, anthropometric, endocrine, and immunological parameters has not been fully addressed experimentally in military populations. Objective: To identify the endocrine, hematological, cardiovascular, and immunological changes caused by HSA and to associate these variables with body composition and physical fitness in the military special operation courses of the Chilean Army. Materials and Methods: Forty-two male subjects were exposed to remain in cold water (10.6 degrees C) in the context of regular military operations training, the longest time of exposure was determined by individual volitional limits. The measurements were taken in prehypothermia conditions, then 2 d later under acute hypothermia condition, and finally during the course period of lesser physical and psychological stressors where the baseline measurements were taken. The statistical analysis consisted of testing normality of the distribution through the Shapiro-Wilk test, assessing the equality of variances through the Levene test, and variance analysis by applying the ANOVA test (analysis of variance). The Bonferroni test was used for multiple comparison correction and the Pearson test for correlations between two variables. The level of significance was of p < 0.05. Results: The main finding of this study is that HSA has a significant impact at the cardiovascular level and produces an increment in the cell population of the immune and hematologic systems. Significant hormonal changes were observed: ACTH (r = 0.50, p < 0.002), cortisol (r = 0.32, p < 0.03), free testosterone (r = 0.13, p < 0.002), total testosterone r = 0.31, p < 0.002), and anthropometrics (r = -0.51, p < 0.05). However, there is no significant correlation between physical fitness and HAS. Conclusions: All subjects experienced hypothermia stress elicited by immersion in cold water. This was evidenced by the decrease in core temperature as well as cardiovascular, endocrine, anthropometric, and immunological changes. Individual differences exist between subjects and their resistance to hypothermia in cold water. These differences are not explained by the physical fitness profile but rather respond to a greater body adiposity index and minor changes in the adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol hormone. An acute hypothermia stress condition also affects the anabolic/catabolic environment. Finally, HSA produces an increase in the cell population of the immune system. The authors believe that this study allows to standardize HSA exposure times during regular military operations training by identifying the physiological impacts under this extreme environment. At present, the availability of intra-abdominal temperature measurement apparatus with capsule thermometers raises the interest of corroborating the findings of the current study through the use of such measuring devices. Likewise, an interesting line of research for the future would be to compare the HSA against a psychological evaluation with the purpose of identifying the stress management mechanisms among subjects of these characteristics and include heart rate variability measurements as an indicator of sympathetic stress.

AB  - The dinoflagellate cyst, palynofacies and foraminiferal records from the Early Eocene Figols Group of the Spanish Pyrenees exhibit major changes associated with relative sea-level fluctuations and variations in efficiency of the fluvial systems. The mixed siliciclastic-carbonate marine succession exposed in the Merli-Esdolomada area was deposited on the shelf in a tectonically active basin, under oxic conditions, in shallow to moderately deep marine waters (close to the lower boundary of the photic zone) influenced by river discharge from adjacent emerged lands. Sedimentary cycles are mainly recorded by fine-grained deposits. The paleoenvironmental interpretation of palynological and calcareous microfaunal records allows the definition of depositional sequences and enables to trace basinward surfaces identified in more proximal settings by means of sedimentological facies analysis. At the same time, the solid regional stratigraphic framework already available for the Figols Group allows new insights on the paleoecology of extinct taxa.
   The Merli-Esdolomada section (ME) spans two 3rd order sequences. The upper sequence reflects more marginal marine conditions than the lower one, thus pointing to an overall shallowing trend with time. In the lower sequence the maximum flooding interval is characterised by a rich and diverse microfauna, highest relative abundances of marine phytoplankton and typically neritic dinoflagellate cyst (dinocyst) assemblages dominated by Spiniferites and Cordosphaeridium. The final phase of the highstand systems tract, in proximity of the main sequence boundary, is characterised by a decrease in abundance and diversity of dinocysts, with the dominance of the lagoonal genus Polysphaeridium, and by decreased microfaunal diversity (discorbids, miliolids, larger foraminifers).
   Palynological records permit the reconstruction of activation and deactivation phases of the fluvial systems, variations in runoff from the hinterland, nutrient delivery to the sea and productivity in surface waters of the Tremp-Graus Basin. The overall abundance of Spiniferites and the scarcity of peridinioid cysts, Lingulodinium, Pediastrum and Botryococcus algae are interpreted to indicate oligotrophic conditions during the deposition of the investigated succession. Recurrent intervals where the temporary disappearance of Spiniferites corresponds to highest relative abundances of Operculodinium and herbaceous debris are the main evidence for river plumes and denote periods of enhanced fluvial discharge reflecting a Milankovitch-type cyclicity. The Rotalia group, which shows abundance peaks of Cuvillierina spp. in the shallower intervals, is often associated with these episodes, thus suggesting for this taxon more tolerance to turbidity than larger foraminifera. Within the maximum flooding zone, a Thalassiphora patula acme corresponding to the local disappearance of Homotryblium is deemed to record the distal expression of a fluvial activation which triggered water salinity stratification. Despite broad morphological similarities, Homotriblium exhibits more cosmopolitan preferences than Polysphaeridium, which is instead confirmed as a lagoonal euryhaline taxon. The increase of Spinizonocolpites pollen toward the top of the Figols Group records the northwestward migration of Nypa mangrove-palms from southern Europe during the mid Early Eocene.

AB  - For decades, detailed studies on Early Weichselian deposits have been made in central Europe. In contrast, these studies are rare in Fennoscandia in northern Europe. We here integrate an extensive multi-proxy data set obtained on sediments of MIS 5d-c age that form part of a long sediment record preserved at Sokli in northern Finland. We make a detailed interpretation of the vegetation and depositional history for MIS 5d-c using pollen, macrofossils, diatoms and other siliceous microfossils, insect remains, and sediment characteristics, and combine these data with recently published estimates on July temperatures based on chironomids and selected plant indicator species in order to make inferences of paleo-climate regimes. The fossil record obtained on the seven meter thick MIS 5d-c deposit at Sokli is exceptionally rich in species due to the large variety of habitats associated with an overall fluvial depositional environment. A braided river system flanked by steppe-tundra vegetation is inferred for MIS 5d. Mean July temperatures of at least 12-14 degrees C are indicated by chironomids and plant indicator species and are in agreement with the presence of conifers and birch trees as recorded by macrofossils. The reconstructed environmental conditions suggest strong continental climate conditions at Sokli during MIS 5d. The gradual infilling of an oxbow lake and subsequent return to stream channel deposition is traced in great detail in the overlying gyttja and gravelly sediment of MIS 5c age. The terrestrial pollen and plant macrofossil record from the gyttja shows the establishment of birch forest followed by the spread of pine and then spruce. Rich plant indicator species assemblages indicate that the boreal environment at Sokli during MIS 5c experienced July temperatures several degrees higher than the present-day value of 13 degrees C. The high summer temperatures and presence of larch suggest more continental conditions. More open vegetation returned at Sokli during late MIS 5c and was followed by glaciation by the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet (MIS 5b). Despite the major differences in zonal vegetation types during MIS 5d-c, differences in reconstructed July temperatures are minor and suggest that winter temperatures combined with precipitation values mostly determined the stadial-interstadial climate variability. The most compelling conclusion from our study is that forest development during MIS 5c was remarkably similar to that recorded for the Eemian (MIS 5e) and Holocene Interglacials at the high-latitude site Sokli, and also to that inferred from MIS 5c sediments on the northern European mainland. Our results question the definition of MIS 5c in the terrestrial record of Europe as an interstadial interval of the last glacial cycle and suggest inclusion of MIS 5c together with the Eemian (MIS 5e) in an interglacial complex.

AB  - Die-offs of seabirds in Alaska have occurred with increased frequency since 2015. In 2018, on St. Lawrence Island, seabirds were reported washing up dead on beaches starting in late May, peaking in June, and continuing until early August. The cause of death was documented to be starvation, leading to the conclusion that a severe food shortage was to blame. We use physiology and colony-based observations to examine whether food shortage is a sufficient explanation for the die-off, or if evidence indicates an alternative cause of starvation such as disease. Specifically, we address what species were most affected, the timing of possible food shortages, and food shortage severity in a historical context. We found that thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia) were most affected by the die-off, making up 61% of all bird carcasses encountered during beach surveys. Thick-billed murre carcasses were proportionately more numerous (26:1) than would be expected based on ratios of thick-billed murres to co-occurring common murres (U. aalge) observed on breeding study plots (7:1). Concentrations of the stress hormone corticostemne, a reliable physiological indicator of nutritional stress, in thick-billed murre feathers grown in the fall indicate that foraging conditions in the northern Bering Sea were poor in the fall of 2017 and comparable in severity to those experienced by murres during the 1976-1977 Bering Sea regime shift. Concentrations of corticostemne in feathers grown during the pre-breeding molt indicate that foraging conditions in late winter 2018 were similar to previous years. The 2018 murre egg harvest in the village of Savoonga (on St. Lawrence Is.) was one-fifth the 1993-2012 average, and residents observed that fewer birds laid eggs in 2018. Exposure of thick-billed murres to nutritional stress in August, however, was no different in 2018 compared to 2016,2017, and 2019, and was comparable to levels observed on St. George Island in 2003-2017. Prey abundance, measured by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in bottom-trawl surveys, was also similar in 2018 to 2017 and 2019, supporting the evidence that food was not scarce in the summer of 2018 in the vicinity of St. Lawrence Island. Of two moribund thick-billed murres collected at the end of the mortality event, one tested positive for a novel re-assortment H10 strain of avian influenza with Eurasian components, likely contracted during the non-breeding season. It is not currently known how widely spread infection of murres with the novel virus was, thus insufficient evidence exists to attribute the die-off to an outbreak of avian influenza. We conclude that food shortage alone is not an adequate explanation for the mortality of thick-billed murres in 2018, and highlight the importance of rapid response to mortality events in order to document alternative or confounding causes of mortality.

AB  - Cartagena Bay, one of the Caribbean's hot spots of pollution, is an estuarine system connected to the Caribbean Sea by two straits. Large freshwater discharges from the Dique Canal into the south of the bay produce estuarine conditions strongly related to the seasonal variability of runoff from the Magdalena River watershed. The bay's seasonal conditions may be characterized by three seasons: strong winds/low runoff (Jan.-April), weak winds/intermediate runoff (May-Aug.), and weak winds/high runoff (Sept.-Dec.). This coastal zone is known to be impacted by land-based sources of pollution, including continental runoff, industrial effluents and domestic wastewater. However, previous studies have not sufficiently ascertained the spatio-temporal extent of this pollution. This study addresses the following research question: What is the current extent of water and sediment pollution in Cartagena Bay and which factors control its seasonal variability? Monthly seawater samples (Sept.2014-Aug.2015) were taken from surface and bottom depths at 16 stations in and around Cartagena Bay and analyzed for physical, chemical, and biological parameters. Surface sediments were sampled from the bay's bottom every three months and analyzed for various trace metals. Seasonal variability was observed in nearly all of the water quality parameters, with higher concentrations usually coinciding with the high runoff season. Potential pollution impacts are shown by wet-season averages of total suspended solids (45.0 +/- 89.5 mg/l), turbidity (26.1 +/- 59.7 NTU), biological oxygen demand (1.20 +/- 0.91 mg/l), chlorophyll-a (2.47 +/- 2.17 mu g/l), nitrate (171.1 +/- 112.6 mu g/l), phosphate (43.1 +/- 63.5 mu g/l), total phosphorus (85.3 +/- 77.2 mu g/l), phenol (2.9 +/- 17.4 mg/l), faecal coliforms (798 +/- 714 MPN/100 ml) and enterococci (32 +/- 30 CFU/100 ml) in excess of recommended threshold values for marine conservation and recreational adequacy. The bay's hypoxic conditions are evident with low dissolved oxygen concentrations (<4 mg/l) found at bottom depths during the wet season, moderate concentrations in the windy season, and low concentrations approaching surface waters during the transitional season, showing a seasonality related to the variability of water circulation and vertical stratification. Lower chlorophyll-a levels found in the water column during the wet season suggest that primary productivity in this eutrophic system is not limited by nutrients, which are abundant due to land-based effluents, but rather by water transparency which is significantly reduced during the wet season due to large sediment loads discharged from the Dique Canal. Sediments from the bay's bottom were found to have concentrations of mercury, cadmium, chromium, copper and nickel in excess of the Threshold Effects Levels (TEL) used as an indicator of potential impacts on marine life.

AB  - A total of 295 goats from 4 breeds (Alpine, n = 74; Angora, n = 75; Boer-cross, n = 73; Spanish, n = 73) were used to assess the retention of 3 types of electronic ruminal boluses (B1, 20 g, n = 95; B2, 75 g, n = 100; and B3, 82 g, n = 100) according to breed and feeding conditions. Time for bolus administration, reading with a handheld reader, and animal data recording (goat identification, breed, and bolus type) were registered. Each goat was also identified with 1 flag-button plastic ear tag (4.6 g, 51 x 41 mm). Retention of boluses and ear tags was regularly monitored for 1 yr. Ruminal fluid in 5 goats from each breed and management group was obtained with an oro-ruminal probe at 2 h after feeding. Ruminal pH was measured at 24 h and at wk 1, 2, 3, and 4 and used as an indicator of feeding conditions on rumen environment. Time for bolus administration differed by bolus type (B1, 14 +/- 2 s; B2, 24 +/- 2 s; B3, 27 +/- 2 s; P < 0.05) and goat breed (Alpine, 34 +/- 3 s; Angora, 17 +/- 2 s; Boer-cross, 16 1 s; Spanish, 19 +/- 2 s; P < 0.05), although differences were due to greater times for B2 and B3 in Alpine goats. Time for bolus administration averaged 22 +/- 1 s, and overall time for bolusing, reading, and data typing was 49 +/- 1 s on average. Ruminal pH differed according to breed and feeding management (lactating Alpine, 6.50 +/- 0.07; yearling Alpine, 6.73 +/- 0.07; Angora, 6.34 +/- 0.06; Boer-cross, 6.62 +/- 0.04; Spanish, 6.32 +/- 0.08; P < 0.05), but no early bolus losses occurred; rumen pH did not differ according to bolus type (B1, 6.45 +/- 0.05; B2, 6.39 +/- 0.07; B3, 6.49 +/- 0.05; P > 0.05). At 6 mo, electronic boluses showed greater retention than ear tags (99.7 vs. 97.2%; P < 0.05). At 12 mo, bolus retention was 96.3, 100, and 97.8% for B1, B2, and B3, respectively, not differing between B1 and B3 (P = 0.562). No effect of breed and bolus type on bolus retention was detected. No goat losing, at the same time, both bolus and ear tag was observed. Ear tag retention (91.7%) was less (P < 0.05) than all types of bolus (98.1%) on average. Ear tag retention in Boer-cross (98.6%) and Alpine (96.9%) goats was greater (P < 0.05) than in Spanish (88.7%) and Angora (82.9%) and tended to differ (P = 0.095) between Spanish and Alpine. In conclusion, unlike flag-button visual ear tags and mini-boluses used here, properly designed boluses (e. g., standard bolus) met International Committee for Animal Recording and National Animal Identification System retention requirements for goat identification under US conditions and are recommended in practice.

AB  - Existing conditionally sizeable possibility of interpretation of tax legislation and covering regulations of the Republic of Lithuania, abundance of practical employment subtleties and concretization makes extremely important the knowledge of taxpayer regarding which specific deductions, when and how can be applied while calculating the payable sum for one or another tax. Employment of provided taxation deductions not only provides proper environment for tax system existentialism, but also creates added value for the taxpayer. Deficiency of economic and accounting knowledge of the latter enables a legitimate overpay of the taxes payable for the state, though, not registering this fact with any economic operation.
   Reform of taxation for persons engaged in agricultural activities and real property trade, recently performed in Lithuania, conditions new scientific research in this area of tax system. Land site taxation, seems such a narrow profiled field of tax system, becomes more and more important tax within Lithuanian tax system. As the carried out statistical analysis of national budget administration data reveals, collection scope of taxes, where taxable object is real property, during the last decade is only increasing both in Lithuania and all EU countries. One of the most significant reasons determining such changes is micro economic condition of the country, however, state fiscal policy also plays quite a considerable role in this field.
   Lately, when budget becomes the basis for the stable state finance, debates, regarding both land site and other real property taxations are more frequent. Though, before initiating an exhaustive analysis of taxes, where a taxable object is the latter, it is important to emphasize that extremely wide range of application of taxation deductions exists in this field. Every municipality, in turn and on the budget account, may reduce the tax or even relief from the tax payable. As a performed empirical research shows, the latter taxation deductions, frequently applied in practice, do also increase demand for allocation while conditioning the lesser municipality budget income. Hereby, from the first sight, even pretty simple and insignificant taxes become more and more important, especially when national budget deficit and its control become the most important task both in the state and global financial market.
   Application of econometric models is being propagated for few decades now, however, in the field of the usage of taxing laws and regulations such models are not applied in worldwide practice. Adaptability of a graphic model is considered to be a real revolution in the field of tax system efficiency evaluation.
   A formed graphic model, in which taxable object is a land site, proves that even such a small taxable sector exhibits a lot of confusion, which can be exploited by the taxpayer to receive his fiscal benefit. Whereas the main purpose of laws, regulating the taxes, is calculation of the amounts payable and regulation of payment itself, construction of a graphic model allows us to evaluate not only budget and target funds fiscal income, but also influence of the latter on macro economic indicators of the country.

AB  - Deer Lake is an impoundment located near Ishpeming, Michigan, USA. Iron mining assay laboratories located in Ishpeming disposed of Hg salts to the city sewer whose outfall was located along an inlet to Deer Lake. An effort to remediate the system in the mid 1980s which consisted of drawing down water in the impoundment in order to volatize Hg from the sediments did not result in recovery of the system. Since the mid 1990s, the remediation strategy has been to allow the continual burial of the contaminated sediments, i.e., natural recovery. The goal of this study was to assess the effectiveness of this strategy. This was accomplished by investigating the state of the system in terms of its recovery and estimating the time frame for recovery. Sediment cores were collected in 2000 to determine historical trends in accumulation rates and concentrations of Hg and other metals. Sedimentation rates and sediment ages were estimated using Pb-210. Event-based dating (e.g., peak of Cs-137 in 1963) was used to supplement Pb-210 data due to non-monotonic features in the Pb-210 profile and activities that were not at supported levels at the base of the core. Selected results are that: (1) drawdown significantly influenced sedimentation patterns causing slopes for Pb-210 profiles that reflected the influx of older sediment, (2) periods of Fe production correlate to Hg loading indicating the point source for contamination, a relationship not previously identified, (3) Hg:Al ratios indicate a recent change to a watershed pathway for Hg loading and (4) Hg concentrations had decreased from their peak, remain elevated, and were increasing after 1997. The cause of the recent Hg concentrations may be related to influx of contaminated watershed soils or sediments. Estimating the time frame for recovery is challenging in this system because the process of natural recovery seems to have been arrested and deeper, uncontaminated sediments, were not recovered as a basis for reference. However, a recovery to background conditions is likely not achievable since rates of Hg loading to nearby lakes and the current rate of atmospheric deposition are greater than an estimate of background conditions for Deer Lake. Assuming recovery continued after 2000, estimates of the time required for recovery varied based on the system state used to define it (e.g., recent rates of wet Hg deposition or Hg surface concentrations/fluxes from similar systems), but were less than 12 a. However, the recent increasing values of recovery indicators (e.g., Hg concentrations) suggests that these estimates are conservative and will be longer if recovery remains arrested, which may in part be due to the legacy of Hg contamination on the landscape. This study shows that estimates of recovery of highly disturbed lake systems can be made in the absence of within lake reference conditions by using comparisons to reference systems and challenges of estimating ages from atypical Pb-210 activity profiles can be overcome in part using event-based dating techniques.

AB  - Fluvial suspended sediment typically consists of a variety of complex, composite particles referred to as flocs, Flee characteristics are determined by factors such as the source, size and geochemical properties of the primary particles, chemical and biological coagulation processes in the water column and shear stress and turbulence levels in the stream, Studies of flee morphology have used two contrasting methods of sampling and analysis. In the first method, particles settle on a microscope slide and are observed from below using an inverted microscope, The second method uses filtration at no or low vacuum and particles deposited on the filter are observed with a microscope. Flee morphology can be quantified using fractal dimensions. The aims of the present study were to examine the effect of the two sampling methods on the fractal dimensions of particle populations, and to evaluate for each method how well the fractal dimensions at the various sampling sites reflect basin conditions. Suspended solids were collected in triplicate on inverted microscope slides and on 0.45 mu m Millipore HA filters in two southern Ontario streams with contrasting riparian zones during a minor runoff event resulting from the melt of a freshly fallen snowpack. An image analysis system was used to determine area, longest axis and perimeter of particles. The morphology of the particle population of each sample was characterized using four fractal dimensions (D, D-1, D-2 and D-K). Systematic differences in fractal dimensions obtained with the two methods were observed. For the settling method, outlines of larger particles were frequently blurred because of the distance between the focal plane (the top of the inverted microscope slides) and the plane of the particle outline. In this method, the blurring of large particles can cause an increase in the projected area and length of the particle, The effect on the particle perimeter is unpredictable because it depends on the amount of detail lost through blurring and its effect on the apparent increase in particle size. Because of blurring, D and D-1 tend to be systematically lower for the settling method, whereas the net effect on D, is unpredictable. Particle size distributions derived from settling are typically coarser because small, low density particles may remain in the water column and all particles may not deposit on the slides, This loss of fines results in systematically lower DK values for the settling method compared with the filtration method. Fractal dimensions and particle size distributions obtained with the filtration method were sensitive to and clearly indicated differences between drainage basins and between sites within each basin. These differences were explained by basin characteristics and conditions. Fractal dimensions and particle size distributions obtained with the settling method were less sensitive to drainage basin characteristics and conditions, which limits their usefulness as process indicators, Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Simple Summary The sheltering of cows in shelters is a traditional practice in India. Old, abandoned and unproductive dairy cows are housed in shelters as cow slaughter is not legally permitted in most states. The welfare assessment of these old, abandoned, infertile, unproductive and rescued cows was carried out based on the measurement of cow-based and resource-based welfare parameters. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to explore the prevalence of lameness in these sheltered cows and the risk factors associated with it. Fifty-four shelters in six states of India were visited and 1620 cows were clinically examined for lameness and measurements of other animal and resource-based welfare parameters. The prevalence of lameness in these shelters was less than that recorded in dairy cows in conventional Indian farming systems. Lameness was associated with several cow factors: inadequate body conformation, lesions on the hock and carpal joints, dirty udders, overgrown claws and diarrhea. There was evidence of an association with an absence of bedding and a steep gradient of the floor. Improvement in the feeding practices, attention towards cleanliness, and improvements in shelter flooring may reduce the prevalence of lameness and improve cow welfare in the shelters.
   Abstract The sheltering of old, unproductive and abandoned cows in traditional cow shelters, known as gaushalas, has been practiced in India since ancient times. Cows are kept in these shelters until they die of natural causes. The welfare of the cows in these shelters was assessed through a cross-sectional study of 54 cow shelters in six states of India. A total of 1620 cows were examined to assess the prevalence of lameness in these cows, and the associated risk factors for lameness were identified through the measurement of animal-based and resource-based welfare indicators. The overall lameness prevalence was 4.2%. The majority (86%) had mild to moderate hock joint swellings but no or only mild carpal joint injuries. Approximately one-half had mild to moderate hock joint hair loss and most were free of hock joint ulcerations. Claw overgrowth was present in almost one half of the cows. Lameness prevalence was positively correlated with coat dirtiness, hock and carpal joint lesions, diarrhea and claw overgrowth scores. In a multivariate analysis, lameness prevalence increased as the Body Condition Score (BCS) decreased and was associated with increased udder dirtiness, the ulceration of the hock joint, carpal joint injuries and claw overgrowth. Resource-based indicators measured at the shelter level suggested that an absence of bedding in the sheds and an increase in the gradient of the shed flooring increased lameness. Addressing the principle risk factors identified for lameness in the sheltered cows (low body condition, dirty udders, lesions on the hock and carpal joints, overgrown claws, and a steep floor gradient) may help to reduce this serious animal welfare problem.

AB  - The 'catena concept', along with previously proposed meanings of this term, has recently acquired a soil evolutionary content. The prospects of wider special and chronological study of dated pedotopocatenas include the possibility of a more detailed analysis of the mutual dependence of soil-geomorphological relationships through distinguishing relatively homogeneous climatic stages of pedogenesis and denudation. With this purpose, the present study comprised earthen defensive constructions, which, within the 'rampart/ditch' system, combine erosive, trans-accumulative catenas and accumulators of pedolithosediments. The goal was to develop a system of the most information-rich pedogenetic indicators to reconstruct the dynamics of erosion-accumulative processes on the basis of dated earthen defensive constructions of a historical period (using the example of a frontier rampart within a ditch from the mid-17th century). Soil samples were collected within the limits of the erosion and trans-accumulative catenas, as well as in the closing alignment of the ditch (over the vertical profile in eight strata of pedosediments of up to 1 m high). The granulometric composition, concentration of macroelements and trace elements (25 metals and oxides) in soils and in particles with sizes < 1 mm, and the fractional composition of the humus were analysed in soil samples taken from different points in the catena and along the profile of the pedosediments. For the reconstruction of the humidity conditions over 3.5 centuries based on dendrochronological data, the cross-relation approach was applied. This allowed us to represent the chronostratigraphy of pedosediments as stages differing in the rate of accumulation processes. The system of soil indicators in pedosediments including the percentage of particles 0.001-0.005 mm and > 0.01 mm in size, the content of organic carbon and its qualitative composition, the sum of the elements accumulated in the soil (P, Ca, K, Mg, Mn, Cu), as well as the geochemical ratios which reflect the processes of leaching, can serve as palaeogeographic tracers of the climatic variability at the level of intra-secular changes under forest-steppe conditions. The history of the formation of pedosediments over 3.5 centuries in the forest-steppe zone of Eastern Europe comprises two wet periods (1890-1935, 1976-2013) when the average annual rates of pedosedimentogenesis were similar (2.80-2.85 mm yr(-1)) and two periods of geomorphological 'lull' and a xeromorphic climatic condition span (1821-1890 and 1666-1741). These periods correspond to diminution of the average rate of accumulation of sediments down to 2.47 mm yr(-1). The results of the present study suggest the need for purposeful research and wide inclusion of dated sites of the anthropogenic relief formation with flow-geochemical series over the topographic gradient into studies of soil-geomorphologic interrelations and calibration of mathematic models of natural processes using on-site data.

AB  - During the growing season of the exceptionally dry and warm year 2003, we assessed seasonal changes in nitrogen, carbon and water balance related parameters of mature naturally grown European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) along a North-South transect in Europe that included a beech forest stand in central Germany, two in southern Germany and one in southern France. Indicators for N balance assessed at all four sites were foliar N contents and total soluble nonprotein nitrogen compounds (TSNN) in xylem sap, leaves and phloem exudates; C and water balance related parameters determined were foliar C contents, delta C-13 and delta O-18 signatures. Tissue sampling was performed in May, July and September. The N related parameters displayed seasonal courses with highest concentrations during N remobilization in May. Decreased total foliar N contents as well as higher C/N ratios in the stands in central Germany and southern France compared to the other study sites point to an impaired N nutrition status due to lower soil N contents and precipitation perception. TSNN concentrations in leaves and phloem exudates of all study sites were in ranges previously reported, but xylem sap content of amino compounds in July was lower at all study sites when compared to literature data (c. 1 mu mol N mL(-1)). In September, TSNN concentrations increased again at the two study sites in southern Germany after a rain event, whereas they remained constant at sites in central Germany and southern France which hardly perceived precipitation during that time. Thus, TSNN concentrations in the xylem sap might be indicative for water balance related N supply in the beech trees. TSNN profiles at all study sites, however, did not indicate drought stress. Foliar delta C-13, but not foliar C and delta O-18 followed a seasonal trend at all study sites with highest values in May. Differences in foliar delta C-13 and delta O-18 did not reflect climatic differences between the sites, and are attributed to differences in altitude, photosynthesis and delta O-18 signatures of the water sources. Except of low TSNN concentrations in the xylem sap, no physiological indications of drought stress were detected in the trees analysed. We suppose that the other parameters assessed might not have been sensitive to the drought events because of efficient regulation mechanisms that provide a suitable physiological setting even under conditions of prolonged water limitation. The uniform performance of the trees from southern France and central Germany under comparably dry climate conditions denotes that the metabolic plasticity of mature beech from the different sites studied might be similar.

AB  - A sediment core from Lake Koucha (eastern Tibetan Plateau) was investigated using organic biomarkers and their stable carbon isotope signatures. The correlation between TOC content, total amount of aquatic macrophyte-derived n-alkanes (e.g. nC(23)) and delta C-13 values of TOC and nC(23) indicates that Lake Koucha was macrophyte-dominated before 8 cal ka BP. Shortly after the lake turned from a saline to a freshwater system at 7.2 cal ka BP, a variety of algal and bacterial markers such as hopanoids and isoprenoids emerged, of which phytane, pentamethylicosene (PMI), moretene and diploptene are particularly abundant. Phytane and PMI show different isotopic signals (a parts per thousand a'18 and a parts per thousand a'28aEuro degrees, respectively), which indicates that they originated from different sources. Phytane may have been derived from cyanobacteria, while methanogenic archaea may be the source of PMI. The isotopic depletion of diploptene and moretene (a parts per thousand a'60aEuro degrees) indicates the presence of methanotrophs. After 6.1 cal ka BP, the saturated C-20 highly branched isoprenoid (HBI) became the dominant constituent of the aliphatic hydrocarbon fraction. Such dominance has rarely been reported in lacustrine environments, and indicates a strong presence of algae (most likely diatoms) or cyanobacteria. At 4.7 cal ka BP, the appearance of an unsaturated C-25 HBI, which is a specific biomarker for diatoms, was noted. Furthermore, the level of nC(17)-alkane was observed to increase in abundance in the uppermost two samples. These results suggest that the lake was phytoplankton-dominated during the last 6.1 ka. Relatively low biomarker concentrations and delta C-13 values at 6.0, 3.1 and 1.8 cal ka BP indicate the occurrence of cool periods, which is in agreement with inferences from other locations on the Tibetan Plateau. The delta C-13 values of nC(23) range from -23.5 to -12.6aEuro degrees, with high values at the peak of macrophyte abundance at ca. 11 cal ka BP and at the phytoplankton maximum between ca 6.1 and 2.8 cal ka BP. Thus, aquatic macrophyte-derived mid-chain n-alkanes have been found to be excellent indicators of carbon-limiting conditions, which lead to the assimilation of isotopically-enriched carbon species. The limitation of carbon sources could be a localized phenomenon occurring in dense plant stands (as in the older section of the core), or it may be induced by high primary productivity (as in the younger section). Since the delta C-13 value of the inorganic carbon source may vary, the offset between the delta C-13 values of nC(23) and TIC could serve as a more precise proxy for carbon-limiting conditions in lacustrine environments, which could in turn be interpreted with respect to lacustrine paleo-productivity.

AB  - Current climate changes require special attention to the implementation of environmental activities in arid regions. The study of the biotic component of water bodies of such ecosystems and the patterns of their spatial distribution is an important area of scientific research. The river network of the semi-desert zone of the Russian Plain is one of the least studied lotic systems in the Lower Volga basin. In this river network, the plain Yeruslan River is of the greatest importance because it largely determines the environmental characteristics of this arid territory. Therefore, it is important to study the structural indicators and spatial dynamics of macrozoobenthos communities in the Yeruslan River. The aim of the work was to study species composition, the structural and quantitative indicators of macrozoobenthos from the source to the mouth of the Yeruslan River and to determine the conceptual belonging of the bottom communities of the plain river of the semidesert zone to a certain type of distribution.
   The Yeruslan River (51 degrees 18'3 '' N, 47 degrees 46'19 '' E) flows through the semi-desert zone of the Russian Plain (Volgograd region, Russia) and it is a tributary of Volgograd reservoir. The length of the Yeruslan River is 282 km, with a catchment area of 55700 km(2). We collected samples of macrozoobenthos at 9 stations of the Yeruslan River (See Fig. 1) in June 2015 and July 2016. In the ripal zone, the integrated samples for quantitative macrozoobenthos analysis were taken using an Ekman-type grab sampler (surface area 25 cm(2)) in replicates (8X) and a handle blade trawl (0.2 M x 0.5 M). In the medial zone, samples were taken by an Ekman-type grab sampler (surface area 250 cm(2)) in replicates (2X). Samples were washed in the field using a mesh screen with 300-310-mu m mesh size and preserved in 4% formaldehyde. At each station of the Yeruslan River, we used field analytical instruments for measuring pH and oxygen content. Water samples were taken for hydrochemical analysis at different sections of the river (See Table 1). We used the model of isolation by distance (Malecot, 1948), Monmonier's maximum difference algorithm (Manni et al., 2004) and the Dickey-Fuller test (Dickey and Fuller, 1979) to perform statistical analysis of changes in the species structure of macrozoobenthos.
   The Yeruslan River flows within the geochemical province of continental salinity, which is characterized by an evaporative type of natural water regime, leading to progressive accumulation of salts. In this research, we found out that water was brackish at several stations of the river (1250-1420 mgl(-1)) due to water drainage of saline soils. We revealed that the Yeruslan River is polluted with nitrite nitrogen (at station 1) and phosphorus compounds (at stations 4 and 8) but concentrations of ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, cadmium, copper, zinc and lead did not exceed the MPC. Comparative analysis has shown that from the source to the mouth of the river there are no significant changes in the speed of water velocity flow, and the physical and chemical conditions are specific for each station. In the river, we collected 132 species: 47 - Diptera, 20 - Oligochaeta, 11 - Mollusca, 11 - Grustacea, 11 - Coleoptera, 7 - Trichoptera, 7 - Heteroptera, 6 - Hirudinea, 4 - Odonata, 4 - Ephemeroptera, 1 - Lepidoptera, Hydracarina, Polychaeta and Megaloptera. The macrozoobenthos of the river is represented by limnophilic species in the upper, middle and lower reaches. This is due to the small slope of the Yeruslan River and the presence of permanent and temporary dams. In the mouth reaches, the macrozoobenthos communities included species of the Ponto-Caspian and Ponto-Azov zoogeographic complexes. At all stations of the river, Oligochaeta and Chironomidae were of high density. Also, in the river mouth, Mollusca were of high density (See Fig. 2). Statistical analysis of sequences of hydrobiological characteristics along the longitudinal gradient of the Yeruslan River using the Dickey-Fuller test showed that the presence of a stationary distribution trend with random "wandering" is typical of the series of total density and biomass of macrozoobenthos, the number of worms of the family Tubificidae, larvae of chironomids of the subfamily Tanytarsini and mayflies of the family Baetidae. For the other series of observations, the presence of a nonlinear trend is noted (See Table 3 and Fig. 3). The selection of a sequence of borders (barrier) between river communities within the ecosystem by Montmonier's method using a matrix of species distances by the Bray-Curtis method made it possible to identify the source (station 1) with a high level of nitritic nitrogen in the water as one of the specific areas. The second most important border separates station 3 with a low content of dissolved oxygen, and the third one allocates the mouth reaches (station 9) as an independent area, where there is a cohabitation of river and reservoir species (See Fig. 4). Based on the analysis of fauna and using statistical methods, we found out that macrozoobenthos communities do not change from the source to the mouth of the river in accordance with the "the river continuum concept". The habitat of taxa depends on local abiotic and biotic factors at each river station, therefore, we can assume that the distribution of macrozoobenthos communities, generally, corresponds to "the patch dynamics concept". At the same time, stations 1, 3 and 9 form fairly isolated hydrogeomorphological areas, which is postulated by the concept of "the functional process zones". It seems that the spatial distribution of macrozoobenthos communities in the Yeruslan River can be explained by a complex combination of two concepts: "the patch dynamics concept" and "the functional process zones".
   This type of distribution seems to be typical of plain rivers with very low water velocity and the presence of dams.

AB  - A new measure of community well-being is developed based on the notion that community residents perceive the quality-of-life (QOL) impact of community services and conditions in various life domains (e.g., family, social, leisure, health, financial, cultural, consumer, work, spiritual, and environmental domains). These perceptions influence residents' overall perception of community well-being, their commitment to the community, and their overall life satisfaction. Survey data were collected in the Flint area (Michigan, USA) in four waves (1978, 1990, 2001, and 2006). The data supported the nomological validity of the measure.

AB  - The EU Water Framework Directive has created research opportunities and challenges for water-quality managers and palaeolimnologists alike. Opportunities have arisen through increased attention to water-quality issues, and these in turn have led to enhanced funding for palaeolimnlogical research. Scientific challenges include identifying aquatic-system pressures, assessing risks, defining non-impacted reference conditions and developing new indicator and classification systems. These challenges have provided the aquatic science research communities with a range of highly relevant and urgent research questions. Addressing these questions requires a collaborative, systematic, whole-catchment approach that, in addition to palaeolimnologists, involves modellers and scientists from other disciplines, water-quality managers, policy-makers and the general public.

AB  - The influence of copper (II) ions on the growth, accumulation properties and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity of a growing culture of Aspergillus niger B-77 were studied. Microbial growth, the level of copper (II) accumulation and SOD activity depended on the initial copper (II) concentration. Aspergillus niger is able to accumulate large amounts of copper (II) from the nutrient medium with 200 mg.l(-1) copper (II) ions without loosing its biological activities. Addition of copper (II) ions increased the SOD activity in the growing cell cultures. The changes in enzyme activity induced by heavy metal ions might be used as an indicator of intracellular oxy-intermediate generation in a cell culture growing under stress conditions.

AB  - To investigate plant-soil reactions towards site salinity we chose Ruprechtia triflora as the dominant tree species in its natural habitat in dry forests of Paraguay. We applied freezing point osmometry to measure tree leaves and soil samples identically on the basis of colligative solute properties. In order to substantiate the first field findings, the relation of tree and soil in terms of salinity was further investigated under controlled conditions in the greenhouse. R. triflora shows extreme osmotic adaptability. In three independent greenhouse experiments with NaCl application, Ruprechtia seedlings and later Eucalyptus dunnii seedlings from E Australia (for inter-species comparison) showed highly significant responses to their soil salinities. We conclude that tree leaves can serve as bioindicator for soil salinity within the tree's rhizosphere.

AB  - Objective: Exegetic review of the three areas of common interest to the endocrinologist and the psychiatrist. Method: Literature review through Science Citation Index and references in BMJ, Lancet, Nature, and Science. Findings: Psychiatric symptoms, specific in each condition, may develop in the course of a classical endocrinopathy. Though introduced as a possible diagnostic aid, titration of the hypothalamico-pituitary control of the adrenal and thyroid glands has proved to be a useful research strategy and possible prognostic indicator in affective disorders. Growth in our knowledge of the behaviour effects, distribution, function and pathophysiology of neuropeptides during the last two decades opens a magic casement on their potential value in neuropsychiatric theory and therapy. Conclusion: The psychiatrist ignores endocrinology at his peril, as does the endocrinologist psychiatry, especially in regard to the emerging role of peptides in neuromodulation.

The relationships between the botanical composition of the goats' pasture to the fatty acid (FA) profiles and health indicators of the fat of cheese produced from their milk in artisanal conditions were also determined. Grazing of goats on natural pastures with greater floristic richness and, above all, the presence of more meadow species and herbs, not only increased the proportions of beneficial FAs in the cheese but also improved sensory characteristics valued by consumers.

AB  - The paper analyses the environmental correlates of cycling based on Danish transportation and urban form micro-data. The results show that established walkability factors such as density, connectivity and diversity are related to cycling, but access to retail concentrations/centres, public transportation level-of-service, as well as competition between walking and cycling depending on environmental features can be added. Attractive conditions for using public transportation or walking are related to less cycling. The findings quantify the effects of urban form on the probability of cycling and the distance cycled. A high probability of cycling generally implies short cycling distances leading to non-uniform, non-monotonous relationship between environmental indicators such as walkability and cycling.

AB  - The effects on child engagement of adult use of systematic, naturalistic instructional strategies within an embedded instruction context were examined. Following baseline observations of two children with disabilities and same-age classmates without disabilities, three different instructional strategies were implemented with each child with a disability and one child without disabilities using an alternating treatments design. Results indicated that levels of engagement for the three target children during baseline (embedded instruction only) were low. Engagement was higher (and approximated levels of same-class peers without disabilities) for two of three systematic instructional conditions designed to increase the probability of responding by ensuring complete learning trials. Described are implications related to the need to use systematic, naturalistic instructional strategies in embedded instruction contexts and the potential use of engagement as an indicator of response opportunities.

AB  - Advanced control in the area of turbojet engines defines many different applied complex control strategies. Highly theoretical approaches and designs are often presented in this area. The article is aimed at practical aspects of adaptive controller design for a class of small turbojet engines in triple loop control architecture. The article presents a non-linear dynamic model of a small turbojet engine taking in account the environmental conditions, which it operates in. The designed triple loop control architecture shows increased precision of control keeping acceleration schedule of the simulated engine and is not susceptible to outer disturbances. The article shows pilot dynamic simulation tests, showing feasibility of the taken approach. It can also be used for other classes of turbojet engines as well other similar technical systems.

AB  - The geochemical processes of sedimentation and diagenesis of bottom sediments west of the Yamal Peninsula occur on the background of high variability in the hydrological, chemical, and biological conditions of the Kara Sea. Despite the apparent absence of runoff in this area, the bottom sediments are markedly influenced by river runoff, the relatively high biological productivity of waters, and the entry of organic matter, which determines the specific character of the sediment diagenesis. Chemical analysis of samples of surface sediments and pore waters collected during the 54th trip of the R/V Akademik Mstislav Keldysh in 2007 indicate the known stages of organic matter oxidation by inorganic components, including oxygen, oxyhydroxides of manganese and iron, sulfates, and carbon acid.

AB  - The habitat preferences, seasonal activity cycles and optimum sampling protocols of an ant community in the Australian arid zone were assessed by pitfall trapping. Diversity and abundance of ants peaked in the hotter summer months and varied greatly between different habitats. Sand dunes vegetated with tall perennial shrubs proved to be the most useful habitat for environmental monitoring using ants. Dominant ant genera were suppressed by environmental stresses caused by salt spray from an underground mine. Remediation of the salt spray resulted in a general, yet inconsistent, recolonization of dominant ants at the expense of opportunistic genera. A greater understanding of the ecology of key ant species is required before ants can be used as unequivocal indicators of environmental condition at the Olympic Dam mine site.

AB  - Surface sediments of mangrove, freshwater wetland and rainforest sites in northeast Queensland were sampled to obtain pollen signatures from a range of climatic and vegetational settings as a basis for interpretation of fossil pollen diagrams. Maximum terrestrial pollen diversity was predicted by curve fitting using the Putter No. 1 growth curve. Taxonomic diversity was found to be a better indicator of rainfall zone than the presence or absence of any one taxon. However, the presence of Chenopodiaceae pollen and a general lack of rainforest pollen types are characteristic of low-rainfall environments. High Values for pteridophytes indicate fluvial conditions, while high-altitude taxa were found in lowland sites fed by streams draining upland vegetation. Local habitat indicators provide good evidence for the type of depositional environment, in keeping with other published studies.

AB  - Sustainable intensification (SI) is at the forefront of food security discussions as a means to meet the growing demand for agricultural production while conserving land and other resources. A broader definition of SI is emerging that takes into account the human condition, nutrition and social equity. Next steps require identification of indicators and associated metrics, to track progress, assess tradeoffs and identify synergies. Through a systematic, qualitative review of the literature we identified SI indicators, with a primary focus on African smallholder farming systems. We assessed indicators and metrics for which there is consensus, and those that remain contested. We conclude that, while numerous metrics for evaluating SI systems exist, many often-cited indicators lack strong sets of associated metrics.

AB  - A set of indicators are proposed to determine the effect of traffic-calming devices on the environment and economy. They are based on vehicular emissions and energy consumption and are used to evaluate the viability and positioning of traffic-calming devices. First, a time window is defined on which the influence of a traffic-calming device can be determined providing a convenient frame of reference. Second, a concept of local cruising conditions is defined in order to have a basis of comparison between cases "with" and "without" traffic calming devices. The emissions considered were: HC, NOx, CO, PM10, and CO2. From the latter fuel consumption was estimated. Valuation of speed bumps on a secondary road in Mexico City was obtained as an example application of the proposed methodology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, theory, methodology and example application are developed and shown for a PW6000 high-bypass turbofan engine in terms of exergo-sustainable perspective. To obtain exergetic sustainability indicators, first, detailed exergy analysis is performed for the engine. The investigated exergetic sustainability indicators are exergy efficiency, waste exergy ratio, exergy destruction factor, environmental effect factor and exergetic sustainability index. These parameters are obtained as 29.7%, 70.3%, 59.4%, 2.367 and 0.423 for the engine at maximum take-off flight condition, respectively. Finally, these parameters are also expected to help understand the linkage between propulsion system design parameters and global aspects in terms of environmental impact and sustainable development and hence make the engine more environmentally benign and more sustainable.

AB  - This article explains the level of respect for civil liberty in post-communist countries. The methodological triangulation employs both QCA methods and OLS-regression to test the influence of structural conditions, the democratization literature emphasizes. The results show that the political legacy, that is, previous experience with civil liberty and a rule-abiding bureaucracy relates strongly to present civil liberty performance. The importance of the remaining factors (modernization indicators, dependence on natural resources, and ethno-religious diversity) is somewhat unclear because the results of the methods applied diverge. Expect a lack of congruence given their different assumptions and logics. As to the QCA methods in specific, they are apparently valuable supplements, and at times even plausible alternatives, to standard statistical tests. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A total of 418 taxa from 76 genera, were identified. The taxa are predominantly oligotrophic or dystrophic. Total floristic similarity between the neighbouring mountain sytems (100 km apart) was only 22.74%. One of the sites has been influenced by glaciation, while the other contained habitats that served as glacial refugia. Taxa from the refugia are highly similar to the those of the ancient Ohrid and Prespa lakes in Macedonia. The morphological features and taxomic position of 11 taxa are discussed.

AB  - Oospores of Phytophthora cactorum were produced in cleared V-8 broth supplemented with 30 mg/l beta-sitosterol in the dark at 20-22degreesC for 2-3 months. Environmental conditions during oospore formation or maturation such as light, low temperature and also ageing could not compensate the light requirement for oospore germination. Dark grown oospores did not infect hypocotyl of susceptible safflower seedlings, an indicator plant for the pathogen, if they were not photoactivated 3-15 days or longer prior to infection. If oospores are the sole source of survival of P. cactorum in soil, then the collar region of the plant would be the main site of infection. Thus any treatment which reduce the chance of oospore germination on the soil surface may support management of this disease.

AB  - Spherical optical nanosensors, or PEBBLEs (probes encapsulated by biologically localized embedding), have been produced in sizes including 20 and 200 nm in diameter. These sensors are fabricated in a microemulsion and consist of fluorescent indicators entrapped in a polyacrylamide matrix. A generalized polymerization method has been developed that permits production of sensors containing any hydrophilic dye or combination of dyes in the matrix. The PEBBLE matrix protects the fluorescent dye from interference by proteins, allowing reliable in vivo calibrations of dyes, Sensor response times are less than 1 ms. Cell viability assays indicate that the PEBBLEs are biocompatible, with negligible biological effects compared to control conditions. Several sensor delivery methods have been studied, including liposomal delivery, gene gun bombardment, and picoinjection into single living cells.

AB  - With nearly 6000 species. Syrphidae represents one of the largest families of Diptera. Their widespread distribution, availability of excellent taxonomic keys for species identification (particularly in Europe), and differences in environmental requirements of larvae are features that promote Syrphidae as potentially good bioindicators. This paper presents a brief description of Syrphid morphology, biology and collection methods, followed by examples of their application as monitors of environmental conditions. Given the high mobility of adults, Syrphidae are probably most suitable for environmental evaluation at a larger scale, e.g., for assessment of landscape diversity. Future research aimed at a better understanding the environmental requirements of both adults and larvae should promote the utilization of these insects as bioindicators.

AB  - A hybrid ground source heat pump (HGSHP) system can provide cost-effective heating and cooling for buildings. This system is normally designed to minimise lifetime costs. However, the lowest lifetime cost solution is typically not the one with the lowest emissions. With the recent increase in the awareness of climate change, society often desires to minimise the emissions generated from heating and cooling systems. In this paper, an HGSHP system design method is proposed with the objective that considers both costs and emissions by using a Pareto optimal approach. The design of such system is affected by the climatic conditions, the efficiency of the heating and cooling systems, the energy price and emissions for electricity and gas at each location. Potential changes in these factors are also investigated in this paper.

AB  - Background
   Varicose veins are a common condition. Presentations can range from those that are noticed incidentally to those causing significant symptoms. Management options range from conservative to surgical approaches, with many alternatives available that offer different advantages, disadvantages and long term outcomes.
   Objective
   To describe the natural history, assessment and management of varicose veins.
   Discussion
   Surgical or other intervention is only necessary in a small percentage of patients, and is seldom urgent, perhaps only in the setting of progressive thrombophlebitis. Duplex ultrasound has become an essential modality for diagnosis, treatment and follow up. All the current modalities of endoluminal and open surgical treatment have similar short term outcomes and risks. Appropriate surgical treatment has the best long term outcomes and evidence base. Treatment of choice, however, depends on many factors, including local expertise.

AB  - Easily synthesized aldoximes have been converted to the corresponding nitriles under very mild conditions by a simple reaction using two halogen-free SO3H-functionalized ionic liquids, 3-methyl-1-(4-sulfonic acid)butylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate [MIM(CH2)(4)SO3H][HSO4] and 1-(4-sulfonic acid) butylpyridinium hydrogen sulfate [PY(CH2)(4)SO3H][HSO4], as catalyst and reaction medium without any additional organic solvent. The method was equally effective for aromatic aldoximes bearing electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents. Taking into account environmental and economical consideration, the protocol presented here has the merits of environmentally friendly, simple operation, easy work-up and very good yields. The catalysts could be recycled and reused for several times without noticeably decreasing in their catalytic activities.

Different stationary phases, buffer conditions and two MCSGP configurations were used in order to demonstrate the broad applicability of MCSGP in the field of charged protein variant separation. Batch chromatography and MCSGP were compared with respect to yield, purity, and productivity. In case of Herceptin (R), also the biological activity of the, product stream was taken into account as performance indicator. The robustness of the MCSGP process against feed composition variations was confirmed experimentally and by model simulations. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2010;107: 652-662. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Puerto Galera Bay is a coastal lagoon with a variety of marine habitats and high species diversity. It is an area in the Philippines where the growing influence of human activities is affecting the quality of its marine resources. This study examined the distribution and behaviour of nutrients and the physical hydrography of Puerto Galera Bay and determined how its physico-chemical nature affected the condition of biotic components in the bay. The relative importance of the nitrogen and phosphorus signals were used as indicators to implicate the influence of sewage and run-off into the bay. A nutrient pool accumulated in the bay as a result of low flushing rates. The interaction of hydrodynamic forcing with the biota have implications on the phytoplankton production and coral communities in the area.

AB  - This study aims to introduce the institutional evaluation process and your dimension in pedagogical practice developed within the course of pedagogy in the sight of the students. Assuming the assessment understood as seizure of Pedagogy course quality in the context of the institutional reality, in the sense of a conscious and responsible. The methodology used for obtaining information was available to students in the Virtual learning environment (VLE) a evaluation questionnaire in each discipline and in all semesters of the course. The analysis of these data has qualitative and quantitative character, that unveil possibilities of subsequent actions capable of conducting didactic-pedagogical changes and consequently the quality training of the future educator. This practice of evaluation comes explaining the dimensions and indicators improving travel conditions on the part of students.

AB  - In the fear of crime literature, there is a consensus that women consistently report higher levels of fear. I examine how men and women assess their risks in light of prior experience, the environmental conditions that signal risk, and perceived personal vulnerability to provide a more thorough account of the gender disparity. Findings from in-depth interviews with New York City residents suggest that subjective evaluations of vulnerability are strong indicators of fear of crime for men and women. Furthermore, qualitative data reveal that gender assessments of vulnerability are related to issues of socialization, social learning processes and notions of effective agency. Little evidence supports fear of rape as the driving force behind perceived vulnerability for women.

AB  - Reactive nitrogen species (RNS), such as nitric oxide and its higher oxides, play important roles in cell signaling during many physiological and pathological events. Elucidation of the exact functions of these important biomolecules has been hampered by the inability to detect RNS reliably under biological conditions. A surge of research into RNS chemistry has resulted in the design of a new generation of fluorescent probes that are specific and sensitive for their respective RNS analytes. Progress in the field of nitric oxide, peroxynitrite, and nitroxyl sensing promises to advance our knowledge of important signaling events involving these species and lead to a better understanding of oxidative biochemistry crucial to health and disease.

AB  - A rapid and inexpensive quantitative method was developed for evaluating the physiological condition of intact lichens and cultured symbionts. Formation of the colored product triphenyl formazan (TPF), which is produced after reduction of triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC), was used as an indication of dehydrogenase activity. Low pH, exposure to copper, supplemental UV and temperature extremes significantly reduced the capacity of cultured lichens and bionts to produce formazan, suggesting each of these treatments may produce physiological damage. It is projected that this method may also be suitable for monitoring impact of various environmental stresses on field-collected lichens. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) can be transmited mechanically as well as biologically through insect vector (Aphis gossypii). CMV has a wide host range particularly it infects Solanaceous crops. Sixty one different hosts were tested against Pakistani isolates of CMV, among them only 33 hosts were found to be infected with CMV upon inoculation while rest remained asymptomatic and showed negative response to ELISA test. Weed flora was also tested as an alternate host of CMV. Datura stramonium, Datura metal, Portulaca olercea (Kulfa). Cyprus rotundus (Deela) and Trianthema pentandra (itsit) showed positive reaction to CMV infection. Different inocula of CMV were applied on test plants/indicator hosts and only Chenopodium quinoa was found to be susceptible to CMV infection while Nicotiana tabacum cv. samsum remained resistant to each tested isolate under controlled conditions.

AB  - In this work, interactions of three phthalate acid esters (PAEs), including dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP), with trypsin have been studied in vitro, under simulated physiological conditions using multi-spectroscopic techniques and molecular modeling. The results show that these PAEs can bind to the trypsin, forming trypsin-PAEs complexes, mainly via hydrophobic interactions, with the affinity order of DMP > DEP > DBP. Binding to the PAEs is found to result in molecular deformation of trypsin. The modeling results suggest that only DBP can bind with the amino acid residues of the catalytic triad and S1 binding pocket of trypsin, leading to potential competitive enzyme inhibition.

AB  - Pine forest vegetation in the "Mallertshofer Holz" nature reserve was sampled stratified by tree canopy types, classified and interpreted in terms of site ecology and dynamics based on ordination and Ellenberg indicator values. Against a background of homogeneous primary site conditions, the vegetation reflects a marked nutrient gradient caused by differing land-use history, self-melioration and nitrogen deposition. There are three options for forest management: I. Continued spontaneous succession of eutrophic pine forests; 2. Active restoration of potential natural vegetation by planting shade-tolerant broadleaved trees; 3. Canopy opening and de-eutrophication by strong intervention into woody (whole-tree harvesting) and ground vegetation (grazing). The biodiversity value of the reserve could be preserved and optimised by practicing 2 and 3 side by side.

AB  - Water shortage risk assessment is full of uncertainty. Hence a water shortage assessment model was developed based on the variable fuzzy set, which reasonably identifies the relative membership degree and function of simple index and standard interval of each level. The model is used to assess water shortage risks in the Yangtze River Delta (which comprises the cities of Shanghai and Nanjing) and in the Capital-area of China (including the cities of Beijing and Tianjin). Results show that the proposed model rationally determines the membership grade in the range of rankings for all related indicators. More importantly, the proposed model is flexible and adaptable for diagnosing water shortage risks for different ecological conditions.

AB  - Facial expressions of emotion can convey information about the world and disambiguate elements of the environment, thus providing direction to other people's behavior. However, the functions of facial expressions from the perspective of learning patterns over time remain elusive. This study investigated how the feedback of facial expressions influences learning tasks in a context of ambiguity using the Iowa Gambling Task. The results revealed that the learning rate for facial expression feedback was slower in the middle of the learning period than it was for symbolic feedback. No difference was observed in deck selection or computational model parameters between the conditions, and no correlation was observed between task indicators and the results of depressive questionnaires.

AB  - Activated oncogenes or anticancer therapies evoke senescent cell-cycle arrest in (pre-) malignant cells, thereby interrupting tumor formation or progression. Physiologically, cellular senescence contributes to embryonic development and tissue regeneration. These observations and the overlap of numerous gene products in senescence and stem cell signaling prompted investigations into whether epigenetic establishment of the senescent state may concomitantly reprogram the cell into a latent stem-like condition, whose functional impact becomes evident when arrested cells resume proliferation. We review here recent discoveries underscoring the unexpected senescence-stemness alliance, elucidate underlying molecular mechanisms, and discuss its fundamentally different implications in normal tissue repair - to replenish the exhausted repopulation capacity - as compared to cancer biology, where usurpation of this natural principle accounts for particularly aggressive tumor behavior.

AB  - This paper provides an analysis of adaptation to extreme climate changes using the Australian animal husbandry data. The paper finds that farmers have adapted to a hot and arid climate regime through animal husbandry. The number of sheep vastly increases into arid ecosystems while the number of beef cattle does not decline in high temperatures. In the future climate system in which Australia becomes hotter and more arid, we predict that farmers will increase by large percentages the numbers of beef cattle and/or sheep owned in order to adapt to a highly unfavorable climate condition, especially into the arid ecosystems. This paper shows how humanity has adapted to climate extremes taking into account changing ecosystems.

AB  - The effect of climate variability on the shrimp fishery in the upper Gulf of California and the west coast of southern Baja California was investigated using artisanal and industrial catches of blue shrimp (Litopenaeus stylirostris) and brown shrimp (Farfantepenaeus californiensis). Catch data were compared with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and remotely sensed environmental parameters, including sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a, coloured dissolved organic matter, and particulate organic carbon (Rrs412 and Rrs490). Overall, temperature was the best environmental indicator of commercial shrimp catches. Catches of blue shrimp varied directly and of brown shrimp indirectly with the SOI in their dominant areas, suggesting that the two species are influenced by El Nino conditions in different ways.

AB  - The worldwide decline of coral reefs necessitates the development of strategies aimed at controlling coral disease. As a result, various biological approaches are being considered as tools for coral disease management. For example, phage therapy has been shown to be effective in removing pathogens under laboratory conditions, showing promise for the treatment of specific pathogens; in addition, mutualistic bacteria compete with pathogens and produce antibiotics, properties that are both known to be important for biological control. Here we evaluate the probiotic potential of native mutualistic bacteria as a means of controlling coral diseases caused by opportunistic pathogens or their consortia. Monitoring native coral-associated microbiota for functions associated with resistance to pathogens could also serve as an additional indicator of reef health.

AB  - This work describes the statistical analysis of three mathematical models, modified for describing the kefir grain biomass growth curve. Experimental data of time-dependent kefir grain mass increase were used. The propagation was performed in RC1 batch reaction system under optimal bioprocess parameters (temperature, rotational frequency of stirrer, glucose mass concentration) using traditional cultivation in fresh, high-temperature, pasteurized whole fat cow's milk. We compared values of biological parameters obtained by applying the nonlinear regression of experimental data in logistic, Gompertz and Richards models. The most statistically appropriate model was determined using the seven statistical indicators. We established that the kefir grain biomass growth curve during batch propagation under optimal bioprocess conditions can be most successfully described using the Gompertz growth model.

AB  - A novel series of sedimentary aromatic lycopane derivatives, cyclolycopatrienes, has been found in an outcrop sample from the Messel oil shale. The predominant monoaromatic compound 4 from this hydrocarbon series has been isolated using reversed phase HPLC and its structure determined using 1D and 2D H-1 NMR spectroscopy, as well as from identification of the RuO4 degradation products. From examination of its structure, related to that of lycopane, and from its stable carbon isotopic composition, this compound and related isomers can be considered as new proxies for Botryococcus braunii race L in sediments deposited under freshwater and/or brackish conditions.

AB  - Distribution and abundance of Chironomidae in 5 urban brooks of the Niederberg Region (NW'Germany) are investigated in comparison with the situation in natural or nearly natural brooks of that area.  At 19 sampling stations only 22 species were found in total.  This is considered to depend primarily upon the physiographic instability of these running waters, as they are principally fed by soilwater.  The successive reduction of Chironomidae in number of species and abundance of individuals can be traced back to the influence of organic and inorganic materials supplied by polluted municipal surface-water.  The physiographical conditions are found to be basic for the qualitative as well as for the quantitative differences between the compared Chironomidae coenoses of these brooks.

AB  - Populations of rock hyraxes (Procavia capensis) increasingly occur in urbanizing areas of the Palestinian West Bank, and throughout the Middle East, in part due to construction methods that create rock piles that shelter hyraxes. We quantified activity densities of the hyraxes, environmental variables, and plant cover at four sites that differ in urbanization. The highest numbers occurred in the most urban site and peaked in June and October, with hyraxes traveling farther distances from their dens late in the season (October). Sites with higher activity densities of hyraxes had higher vapor pressures, signifying more mesic conditions. Thus, urbanization aids the expansion of hyraxes.

AB  - Groundwater flows and travel times were analyzed under a landfill site characterized by a thick unsaturated zone, in an arid environment, using two-dimensional models. Transport in the unsaturated zone is important in arid environments with thick vadose zones and usually determines the travel time of groundwater from the landfill site to the regulatory compliance surface. The combined use of a parallel flow (Dupuit-Forchheimer) areal model and vertical cross-sectional model is explored at a site typical in the utility industry. Flow paths and travel times to the compliance zone are obtained for use in landfill site design or environmental impact assessments. Sensitivity analysis shows that boundary conditions are important factors influencing the entire analysis and thus need to be confirmed with field measurements.

AB  - We empirically explore the differences in innovativeness between family and nonfamily businesses in selected post-transition economies. The data for Bulgaria, Croatia, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia are derived from the 2018 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Adult Population Survey. We build a binary logistic regression model. Results suggest that family businesses are less likely to be innovators as compared to the non-family businesses but, after including a combination of individual and environmental/institutional factors into the model, being a family business is not significant when comparing innovative and imitative businesses. We also find that gender, age, education, perceived opportunities and perceived entrepreneurial skills are not significant indicators of business innovativeness within the investigated sample.

AB  - Community-based nonprofits have been recognized by funders and policymakers as a vital component in the revitalization process in distressed neighborhoods. Though research on the effectiveness of these organizations has expanded in recent years, very little is yet known about what internal management characteristics and conditions in their local environments contribute to their performance. This article seeks to address this gap in the literature. Using survey data from 122 NeighborWorks nonprofit organizations in the United States, this article examines what internal management factors and external environmental factors influence the effectiveness of community-based nonprofits. The findings from an ordinary least squares regression model suggest that performance indicators, political capacity, board governance, and organizational age are important predictors of community-based nonprofit effectiveness.

AB  - A range of diagnostic criteria are required to help identify palaeotsunami deposits. Although chemical signatures have long been used as indicators of palaeosalinity in sedimentary sequences, their use in the studies of palaeotsunami deposits is rarely applied and is yet to be widely recognised. The chemical composition of interstitial water in coastal ponds and sedimentary sequences in coastal marshes and lagoons has been used successfully as an indicator of tsunami inundation. Chemical signatures can also provide clues about the landward limit of runup of a tsunami, beyond the area of sediment deposition. Like most palaeotsunami proxies however, the preservation of chemical signatures varies with environmental conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The TRIS buffer system is frequently used to calibrate electrodes and indicators that are used to determine the pH of natural waters. Most of the potentiometric and spectrophotometric systems used to measure the pH are calibrated with TRIS buffers. Since most natural waters contain high concentrations of NaCl, it is useful to be able to determine the pK of TRIS using ionic interaction models. In this paper, the dissociation constants of TRIS in NaCl solutions from (0 to 100) degrees C and (0 to 5) mol.kg(-1) have been fitted to Pitzer equations. This allows one to estimate the values of the pH for TRIS buffers for natural brines over a wide range of conditions.

Geraldton) and to test some natural and synthetic antioxidants as ozone protectants. The results obtained showed that ambient ozone concentrations were high enough to cause visible leaf injury in clover. All used substances showed partial ozone protective effect on clover. Water extracts from the leaves of plants, known to contain flavonoids-antioxidants showed weaker ozone protective effect and were less stable in the field conditions than synthetic antioxidants. Among the studied extracts, those from Ocimum basilicum and Tagetes patula were more effective as ozone protectants than the one from Salvia sclarea. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many insect species have evolved different overwintering survival strategies such as cold tolerance and/or diapause. This study investigated the relationship between Aphidius rhopalosiphi mummy colour and cold tolerance and diapause. Mummy colour was insufficient to discriminate diapausing from non-diapausing individuals. This phenotypic character seems to reflect environmental conditions rather than direct developmental time and cocoon thickness (identification criteria of diapause). There is, however, a relationship between cold tolerance and mummy colour. Dark mummies exhibited significantly higher water content, survival at low temperature and lower supercooling point values than pale mummies. Mummy colour in Aphidius rhopalosiphi seems to be a phenotypic indicator of the cold tolerance.

AB  - The primary focus in this paper is on position estimation of an unknown sensor node in indoor environment. Received signal strength (RSS)-based algorithm was used for position estimation in which Gaussian filter and averaging filter were used for distance estimation, and for localization, trilateration and least square estimation were used. IRIS motes from MEMSIC were used for the experiments and were configured in real time to record the RSSI. Effect on distance estimation and localization was studied in indoor environment by conducting several experiments. Simulation results show that the proposed sensor selection, distance estimation based on RSSI as well as localization method helps in improving accuracy of position estimation in different environmental conditions.

AB  - The sustainability is a hot topic in the international debate, enphasizing the importance of cities and focusing on the issues of planning inefficiency, occupation disorder, precarious housing, environmental degradation and social insecurity. Under the same context, the idea of neighborhood sustainability was developed, adressing sustainability on a scale of greater detail. Through this perspective, this article aims to partially analyze the sustainability of two neighborhoods in the city of Campo Mourao, Parana. Selected indicators were applied based on principles and premises published in international Charters. Results indicate that both neighborhoods present similarities in structural terms, but do not meet desirable results in all applied indicators. This situation reflects a growing condition in Brazilian cities, where neighborhoods have ceased to gain functional relevance in terms of mobility and health infrastructure, education and recreation.

AB  - Iranian dolomite (CaMg(CO3)(2)) which consists of double-layered carbonates with Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions was utilized as a heterogeneous base catalyst in the C-C, C-N, and C-S bond forming reactions via the Henry, Knoevenagel, aza-Michael, and thia-Michael transformations under mild conditions in water. Iranian dolomite has been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) and XRF chemical analysis, while its basic strength was evaluated by following the Hammett indicators procedure. This water-insoluble natural catalyst demonstrated high activity and was reusable. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Structures observed within experimentally deformed serpentinite gouges provide information that may be used to identify the seismic behavior of natural fault zones. In laboratory friction experiments serpentinite exhibits two modes of behavior: one can only result in stable fault creep, and the other may result in stable slip, but has the potential for earthquakes. The microstructures that form during these experiments reflect the deformation style of the serpentinite: distributed deformation results from aseismic fault creep, and localized deformation results from conditions favorable for seismic slip, Distributed deformation produces a crystallographic preferred orientation of the serpentine grains (S foliation), Localized deformation forms Riedel shears. Similar structures occur within a natural serpentinite shear zone from Monterey County, California, and suggest a history of stable fault creep with intermittent seismic events.

AB  - Environmental assessment (EA) is intended to ensure that environmental considerations are properly weighed in the decisions made by local planning authorities on planning applications, This paper analyses whether, to what extent, and how, EA has influenced LPA decisions, Forty case studies were analysed by examining relevant documentation and conducting interviews with participants in the EA process, EA appears to have had a gradual rather than a revolutionary effect on decision-making. Its main benefits have been the enhanced provision of environmental information and, to a lesser extent, assistance in setting conditions and in modifying proposals, However, these benefits are not occurring in all cases, and changes are needed if the expected advantages of EA - better integration of environmental considerations into project planning and decision-making - are to be fully realised in the UK.

TI  - Fast by Nature - How Stress Patterns Define Human Experience and Performance in Dexterous Tasks
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - In the present study we quantify stress by measuring transient perspiratory responses on the perinasal area through thermal imaging. These responses prove to be sympathetically driven and hence, a likely indicator of stress processes in the brain. Armed with the unobtrusive measurement methodology we developed, we were able to monitor stress responses in the context of surgical training, the quintessence of human dexterity. We show that in dexterous tasking under critical conditions, novices attempt to perform a task's step equally fast with experienced individuals. We further show that while fast behavior in experienced individuals is afforded by skill, fast behavior in novices is likely instigated by high stress levels, at the expense of accuracy. Humans avoid adjusting speed to skill and rather grow their skill to a predetermined speed level, likely defined by neurophysiological latency.

AB  - Activity in the human somatosensory system was measured by regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and by the binding of [C-11]nimodipine to L-type Ca2+ channels. These physiological variables were considered to be indicators of neuronal and synaptic activity. In general, structures in the cerebellum, thalamus and the somatosensory cortices which increased their rCBF in response to somatosensory stimulation also showed high binding of [C-11]nimodipine. Voluntary movements carried out largely independently of sensory feedback, natural somatosensory stimulation and passive stimulation of the somatosensory system all activate the somatosensory system. However, it is possible by subtraction techniques to show that differences in activations between these conditions exist in the cerebellum and the somatosensory cortices in the anterior part of the parietal lobe.

AB  - Indicators were established to determine critical variables in pig agroecosystems. Five producers were interviewed at Jesus Enrique Lossada county, Zulia state. The current value of the variables was measured, and the critical condition was identified comparing the ideal value (5) and threshold value (3). Critical situations were observed in the environmental dimension regarding the knowledge and application of laws and environmental rules and norms (1.8) and environmental education (1.0), there was little participation and access to the market on the economic aspect (1.0) as well as little input and output capacity (1.0); the social aspect did not present critical values. The results obtained allowed creating recommendations that will improve the current system. Finally, the critical variables compromised the sustainability of pig production agroecosystems in the county.

AB  - Intermediate cities have become key actors in the quest for a model of integrated development. This is because they have played a very important role as a link between large cities and rural areas, and therefore enable the territorial dissemination of development.
   In order to analyze the behaviour of intermediate cities from this perspective, it is necessary to use indicators that reflect not only their socio-economic dynamism and their innovative capacity, but also others that show their welfare, their environmental conditions and the quality of life of their inhabitants.
   In this context, the aim of this paper is to identify, select and systematize some significant indicators of the dynamism, innovative capacity, welfare and environmental quality of these cities, and test their application in Andalusia.

AB  - A survey of larval midge remains from surficial sediments in 37 New England lakes was undertaken in order to relate midge distributions to environmental factors. The lakes are located along a transect from northern New Hampshire to southern Connecticut. The midges proved to be a very diverse group of insects in these freshwater habitats. A total of 65 chironomid taxa were recovered. Canonical correspondence analyses indicated that the environmental variables which best explain the distribution of chironomid taxa were mean July air temperature, percent sediment organic matter, pH, and lake depth. This knowledge about the relationship between midge distribution and mean July air temperature can be applied to midge assemblages preserved in older lacustrine sequences to improve our understanding of past environmental conditions in the region.

AB  - Microwave radiation has been widely used in various fields, such as communication, industry, medical treatment, and military applications. Microwave radiation may cause injuries to both the structures and functions of various organs, such as the brain, heart, reproductive organs, and endocrine organs, which endanger human health. Therefore, it is both theoretically and clinically important to conduct studies on the biological effects induced by microwave radiation. The successful establishment of injury models is of great importance to the reliability and reproducibility of these studies. In this article, we review the microwave exposure conditions, subjects used to establish injury models, the methods used for the assessment of the injuries, and the indicators implemented to evaluate the success of injury model establishment in studies on biological effects induced by microwave radiation.

AB  - A series of Pt/Nb2O5 catalysts were synthesized at different temperature conditions to investigate metal-support interaction effect on the catalytic activities in the aqueous phase hydrodeoxygenation of 1,6-hexanediol at 523 K and 5.5 MPa. The increase of calcination temperature of Nb2O5 support over 773 K lowered surface area as well as acidity of Nb2O5, which altered the electron density of the active center Pt as characterized by XANES analysis. It was demonstrated that the bifunctional catalytic nature of Pt/Nb2O5 catalyst having high acidity and electron deficiency could promote the dehydration of 1,6-hexanediol followed by hydrogenation with high selectivity toward n-hexane.

AB  - In this report the various elements of the safety and nutritional assessment procedure for genetically modified (GM) plant derived food and feed are discussed, in particular the potential and limitations of animal feeding trials for the safety and nutritional testing of whole GM food and feed. The general principles for the risk assessment of GM plants and derived food and feed are followed, as described in the EFSA guidance document of the EFSA Scientific Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms.
   In Section I the mandate, scope and general principles for risk assessment of GM plant derived food and feed are discussed. Products under consideration are food and feed derived from GM plants, such as maize, soybeans, oilseed rape and cotton, modified through the introduction of one or more genes coding for agronomic input traits like herbicide tolerance and/or insect resistance. Furthermore GM plant derived food and feed, which have been obtained through extensive genetic modifications targeted at specific alterations of metabolic pathways leading to improved nutritional and/or health characteristics, such as rice containing P-carotene, soybeans with enhanced oleic acid content, or tomato with increased concentration of flavonoids, are considered.
   The safety assessment of GM plants and derived food and feed follows a comparative approach, i.e. the food and feed are compared with their non-GM counterparts in order to identify intended and unintended (unexpected) differences which subsequently are assessed with respect to their potential impact on the environment, safety for humans and animals, and nutritional quality. Key elements of the assessment procedure are the molecular, compositional, phenotypic and agronomic analysis in order to identify similarities and differences between the GM plant and its near isogenic counterpart.
   The safety assessment is focussed on (i) the presence and characteristics of newly expressed proteins and other new constituents and possible changes in the level of natural constituents beyond normal variation, and on the characteristics of the GM food and feed, and (ii) the possible occurrence of unintended (unexpected) effects in GM plants due to genetic modification. In order to identify these effects a comparative phenotypic and molecular analysis of the GM plant and its near isogenic counterpart is carried out, in parallel with a targeted analysis of single specific compounds, which represent important metabolic pathways in the plant like macro and micro nutrients, known anti-nutrients and toxins. Significant differences may be indicative of the occurrence of unintended effects, which require further investigation.
   Section 2 provides an overview of studies performed for the safety and nutritional assessment of whole food and feed. Extensive experience has been built up in recent decades from the safety and nutritional testing in animals of irradiated foods, novel foods and fruit and vegetables. These approaches are also relevant for the safety and nutritional testing of whole GM food and feed.
   Many feeding trials have been reported in which GM foods like maize, potatoes, rice, soybeans and tomatoes have been fed to rats or mice for prolonged periods, and parameters such as body weight, feed consumption, blood chemistry, organ weights, histopathology etc have been measured. The food and feed under investigation were derived from GM plants with improved agronomic characteristics like herbicide tolerance and/or insect resistance. The majority of these experiments did not indicate clinical effects or histopathological abnormalities in organs or tissues of exposed animals. In some cases adverse effects were noted, which were difficult to interpret due to shortcomings in the studies.
   Many studies have also been carried out with feed derived from GM plants with agronomic input traits in target animal species to assess the nutritive value of the feed and their performance potential. Studies in sheep, pigs, broilers, lactating dairy cows, and fish, comparing the in vivo bioavailability of nutrients from a range of GM plants with their near isogenic counterpart and commercial varieties, showed that they were comparable with those for near isogenic non-GM lines and commercial varieties.
   In Section 3 toxicological in vivo, in silico, and in vitro test methods are discussed which may be applied for the safety and nutritional assessment of specific compounds present in food and feed or of whole food and feed derived from GM plants. Moreover the purpose, potential and limitations of the 90-day rodent feeding trial for the safety and nutritional testing of whole food and feed have been examined.
   Methods for single and repeated dose toxicity testing, reproductive and developmental toxicity testing and immunotoxicity testing, as described in OECD guideline tests for single well-defined chemicals are discussed and considered to be adequate for the safety testing of single substances including new products in GM food and feed.
   Various in silico and in vitro methods may contribute to the safety assessment of GM plant derived food and feed and components thereof, like (i) in silico searches for sequence homology and/or structural similarity of novel proteins or their degradation products to known toxic or allergenic proteins, (ii) simulated gastric and intestinal fluids in order to study the digestive stability of newly expressed proteins and in vitro systems for analysis of the stability of the novel protein under heat or other processing conditions, and (iii) in vitro genotoxicity test methods that screen for point mutations, chromosomal aberrations and DNA damage/repair.
   The current performance of the safety assessment of whole foods is mainly based on the protocols for low-molecular-weight chemicals such as pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals, pesticides, food additives and contaminants. However without adaptation, these protocols have limitations for testing of whole food and feed. This primarily results from the fact that defined single substances can be dosed to laboratory animals at very large multiples of the expected human exposure, thus giving a large margin of safety. In contrast foodstuffs are bulky, lead to satiation and can only be included in the diet at much lower multiples of expected human intakes. When testing whole foods, the possible highest concentration of the GM food and feed in the laboratory animal diet may be limited because of nutritional imbalance of the diet, or by the presence of compounds with a known toxicological profile.
   The aim of the 90-days rodent feeding study with the whole GM food and feed is to assess potential unintended effects of toxicological and/or nutritional relevance and to establish whether the GM food and feed is as safe and nutritious as its traditional comparator rather than determining qualitative and quantitative intrinsic toxicity of defined food constituents. The design of the study should be adapted from the OECD 90-day rodent toxicity study. The precise study design has to take into account the nature of the food and feed and the characteristics of the new trait(s) and their intended role in the GM food and feed.
   A 90-day animal feeding trial has a large capacity (sensitivity and specificity) to detect potential toxicological effects of single well defined compounds. This can be concluded from data reported on the toxicology of a wide range of industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food substances, environmental, and agricultural chemicals. It is possible to model the sensitivity of the rat subchronic feeding study for the detection of hypothetically increased amount of compounds such as anti-nutrients, toxicants or secondary metabolites. With respect to the detection of potential unintended effects in whole GM food and feed, it is unlikely that substances present in small amounts and with a low toxic potential will result in any observable (unintended) effects in a 90-day rodent feeding study, as they would be below the no-observed-effect-level and thus of unlikely impact to human health at normal intake levels.
   Laboratory animal feeding studies of 90-days duration appear to be sufficient to pick up adverse effects of diverse compounds that would also give adverse effects after chronic exposure. This conclusion is based on literature data from studies investigating whether toxicological effects are adequately identified in 3-month subchronic studies in rodents, by comparing findings at 3 and 24 months for a range of different chemicals.
   The 90-day rodent feeding study is not designed to detect effects on reproduction or development other than effects on adult reproductive organ weights and histopathology. Analyses of available data indicate that, for a wide range of substances, reproductive and developmental effects are not potentially more sensitive endpoints than those examined in subchronic toxicity tests. Should there be structural alerts for reproductive/developmental effects or other indications from data available on a GM food and feed, then these tests should be considered.
   By relating the estimated daily intake, or theoretical maximum daily intake per capita for a given whole food (or the sum of its individual commercial constituents) to that consumed on average per rat per day in the subchronic 90-day feeding study, it is possible to establish the margin of exposure (safety margin) for consumers. Results obtained from testing GM food and feed in rodents indicate that large (at least 100-fold) 'safety' margins exist between animal exposure levels without observed adverse effects and estimated human daily intake.
   Results of feeding studies with feed derived from GM plants with improved agronomic properties, carried out in a wide range of livestock species, are discussed. The studies did not show any biologically relevant differences in the parameters tested between control and test animals. The studies have shown that targeted compositional analysis is the cornerstone for the safety assessment of GM plants modified for agronomic input traits, and once compositional equivalence has been established, feeding studies with livestock species add little to their safety assessment.
   Examples of models for livestock feeding studies with GM plants with increased concentration of desirable nutrients are provided, Such studies should be conducted on a case-by-case basis to establish the nutritional benefits. Possible effects of the new feed resource on animal performance, animal health, efficacy, and acceptability of the new feed ingredient should be investigated, and time spans for such studies should be determined on a case-by-case basis.
   The feasibility and limitations of human studies with foods derived from GM plants are discussed, as well as the potential and limitations of post-market monitoring to detect unintended effects of these foods. Post-market monitoring is not a substitute for a thorough pre-market risk assessment.
   In Section 4 standards for test sample preparation, test materials, diet formulation and analysis are evaluated. Specific attention is paid to the choice of control diets and comparators, dietary stability, and nutritional balancing of diets.
   When testing whole foods, it is desirable to obtain the highest concentration possible of the GM food and feed in the laboratory animal diet without causing nutritional imbalance. Normal practice is to use a minimum of two test dose levels and negative control with which to create nutritionally equivalent balanced diets in a comparative protocol.
   It is recommended to include a relevant number of commercial varieties as control diets to demonstrate the biological range of the parameters which are measured in order to assess the biological relevance of statistically significant differences between the GM plant and its counterpart.
   The choice of the comparator for GM food and feed testing is crucial, and can be found in the parental (near isogenic) line. For modified macronutrients a comparator is the unmodified form of the macronutrient. For investigating GM food and feed with enhanced nutritional properties, choices for control diets should be made on a case-by-case basis.
   Section 5 provides information on the collection, analysis and interpretation of data and findings obtained from animal feeding studies.
   Data generation for the prediction of safety and nutritional value of GM plant derived food and feed must be of high quality in order to perform a proper hazard identification and risk assessment. This should be based on the use of standardised study designs conducted to the principles of Good Laboratory Practise, incorporating random quality assurance audits of all phases of the study.
   Expert data evaluation and analysis are critical for establishing any association between exposure and outcome. This involves specialists from a broad range of scientific disciplines such as toxicologists, haematologists, clinical biochemists, pathologists, human and animal nutritionists and also biostatisticians.
   One of the pivotal requirements in data analysis is to distinguish those effects which are potentially treatment related from spurious occurrences or the result of normal individual biological variation. If differences exist between test and control, comparison to historical control data from the same laboratory as well as published data for the strain, sex and age of the animal being investigated is helpful, as well as data obtained with commercial reference lines.
   In Section 6 strategies are outlined for the safety and nutritional assessment of GM plant derived food and feed. The generation of studies for pre-market assessment of the safety and nutritional properties of food and feed from GM plants should follow a structured approach with stepwise development and consideration of the data obtained at each step in order to formulate the questions to be asked and answered at the next step (see Fig. 3).
   Hazards related to the intended genetic modifications are evaluated applying in silico, in vitro and in vivo safety studies of newly expressed protein(s), newly formed metabolites, and of natural substances whose levels may have been altered as a result of gene insertion. Guidelines have been developed by OECD describing detailed protocols for the safety testing of these substances in food and feed.
   A detailed testing strategy should be designed based on the prior knowledge regarding the biology of these products, so that the relevant endpoints are measured in the individual test.
   Testing of the safety and nutritional value of the whole GM plant or derived food and feed should be considered where the molecular, compositional, phenotypic, agronomic and other analyses have demonstrated differences between the GM plant derived food and feed and their conventional counterpart, apart from the inserted trait(s), or if there are any indications or remaining uncertainties for the potential occurrence of unintended effects. In such a case, the testing program should include at least a 90-day rodent feeding study.
   In the context of the safety and nutritional assessment of GM plant derived food and feed, the adapted 90-day rodent feeding study, if triggered by the outcome of the molecular, compositional, phenotypic or agronomic analysis, functions as a sentinel study designed to assess potential unintended effects of toxicological and/or nutritional relevance rather than determining qualitative and quantitative intrinsic toxicity of defined food constituents.
   In the situation where molecular, compositional, phenotypic, agronomic and other analyses have demonstrated equivalence between the GM plant derived food and feed and their near isogenic counterpart, except for the inserted trait(s), and do not indicate the occurrence of unintended effects, experiences with GM plants modified for agronomic input traits have demonstrated that the performance of 90-day feeding trials with rodents or feeding trials with target animal species have provided little if anything to the overall safety assessment (except for added confirmation of safety).
   The use of 90-days studies in rodents should be considered for the detection of possible unintended effects in food and feed derived from GM plants which have been more extensively modified in order to cope with environmental stress conditions like drought or high salt conditions, or GM plants with quality or output traits with the purpose to improve human or animal nutrition and/or health.
   Ninety-day studies with rodents are normally of sufficient duration for the identification of general toxicological effects of compounds that would also give adverse effects after chronic exposure. In general, long term, chronic toxicity testing of whole GM food and feed is not expected to generate information additional to what is already known from in silico/in vitro testing and from subchronic testing.
   In cases where structural alerts or other information is available about the possibly altered occurrence of food components in the GM food and feed compared to its counterpart, the performance of specific toxicological testing, e.g. chronic, reproductive, etc., should be considered case-by-case, but preferentially only for the single substance of concern.
   Livestock feeding studies with target animal species should be conducted on a case-by-case basis to establish the nutritional benefits that might be expected from GM plants with claimed nutritional/health benefits. Possible effects of the new feed resource on animal performance, animal health, efficacy, and acceptability of the new feed ingredient should be investigated, and time spans for such studies should be determined on a case-by-case basis.
   There is a need for a more uniform approach to the design and analysis of animal feeding trials, and in particular for appropriate statistical analysis of data. The process of data interpretation requires extensive professional experience of the field, together with a thorough understanding of the concept of causality. One of the pivotal requirements is to distinguish those effects which are potentially treatment related from spurious occurrences or result from normal individual biological variation.
   Post-market monitoring is not a substitute for a thorough pre-market risk assessment, neither should it be considered as a routine need. Knowledge gained through post-market monitoring might at best describe only broad patterns of human nutritional exposure. In general it cannot be relied upon as a technique for monitoring adverse events or other health outcomes related to the consumption of GM plant derived food and feed.
   It can be anticipated that in the future the predictive value of a 90-day rodent feeding studies used for the safety assessment of whole food and feed will be enhanced by the integration of new technologies like transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics into the experimental risk assessment approach. Moreover, the use of 'profiling' technologies may also facilitate a non-targeted approach in compositional analysis in order to aid the detection of unintended effects in GM plant derived food and feed due to the genetic modification. These technologies are still under development, and need validation before they can be used for routine safety assessment purposes.

AB  - Radiolarites are used as environment indicators, but indicators of which environment? Moreover in literature, one commonly encounters opposition between calcareous and siliceous sediments. Is this correct for the initial environment of deposition ?
   Backtracking from the geological message to the biological signal of the initial environment requires a comprehensive knowledge of the different filters which have tangled it and of the actors which generate the signal.
   Siliceous plankton
   Radiolarians are planktonic organisms and as such obey the common rules of planktonic life: abundance/scarcity of nutrient. For decades one has evoked the necessity of a minimum silica content in sea water to allow these organisms to precipitate their skeleton, to develop and to be profuse. Consequently geologists have considered it logical to find abundant Radiolarians in rocks associated with ophiolites.
   However, the evidence to support this view, based on the study of Recent sediments, is lacking, indeed, Radiolarians are not most abundant along oceanic ridge areas but they are profuse in peripolar and equatorial belts and on some western sides of continents. These are all regions where the overall plankton levels (phyto- or zoo-) are prolific and where nutrient levels are high close to the water surface. There are no marked differences in the way oi life between siliceous and calcareous organisms.
   After death the only remnant of the organism is the test, as the cytoplasmic envelope soon disintegrates and exposes the mineral skeleton to the vagaries of nature. The dissolution of siliceous skeletons is more pronounced in surface waters. Moreover, the non-existence of a silica compensation depth explains how a present day Radiolarian can occur in sediment at 1000 m as well as at 10000 m water depth: the critical zone for its dissolution is within waters above c. 500 m. There is a ''behavioural'' difference between siliceous and calcareous organisms concerning their depth of dissolution.
   Siliceous sediments
   Siliceous skeletons are often very rare in sediments except in those deposited from high productivity zones. Indeed, if the original signal is reflected in the sediment, its variations are strongly enhanced and several times exaggerated. All occurrences indicate that the siliceous signal must be preserved beyond a critical threshold for tests to remain abundant. In moderate productivity zones for instance, 1/3 to 1/2 of the surface production reaches the ocean floor, while in zones of high productivity, 2/3 is deposited. On a global scale, it is generally estimated that less than 1 % of the biogenous silica produced is found in the geological record.
   Siliceous rocks: example of Mesozoic radiolarites
   Radioiarian tests are made of opal-A which is highly instable and is successively transformed into opal-CT and then into quartz. These two transformations occur in a liquid phase (one can here understand the risk that a Radiolarian with a delicate and fragile morphology will disappear before it reaches posterity) which explains both the relatively small number of well-preserved Radiolarians and the frequent concentration of silica as nodules. These transformations are associated with a considerable porosity reduction. This porosity variation is coupled with a major decompaction factor which has to be considered when reconstructions of sedimentary piles are put forward. One may generally estimate a multiplication of the present thickness by a factor of 5. Application of this factor to tethyan radiolarites leads to the following original thicknesses for cherts: 20 cm (mean present thickness: 4 cm, factor. 5) and for shares: 1 cm (mean present thickness: 0.5 cm, factor: 2). Using this formula, 100 m of radiolarites, a common thickness for this series in the Tethys, corresponds to an original thickness of approximately 450 m.
   The silica phase in most siliceous rocks is transformed from opal-A through opal-CT to quartz during progressive diagenesis. The transformations are principally controlled by temperature and time. This explains why quartz predominates in older rocks (Mesozoic and older) and opal-CT in the Cenozoic (porcelanites, tripoli,...). Host rock lithology, together with porewater chemistry, also plays an important role. The presence of primary carbonate tends to promote the opal-A to opal-CT transformation, whereas the presence of clay tends to hinder it. For a primary alternation with slight lithological variations, an onset of the opal-A to opal-CT transformation can be different, depending on the lithologies. The beds with an early onset of this transformation import silica from the beds in which the transformation is delayed or inhibited. Local redistribution of silica between the contrasting lithologies is possible during the opal-A to opal-CT transformation, whereas the redistribution seems more restricted during the opal-CT to quartz transformation. Field evidence also suggests the formation of chert nodules and pinch-and-swell beds by additional silica cementation within the opal-A zone, especially within calcareous siliceous rocks. Silica redistribution during the opal-A to opal-CT transformation enhances the variations in composition between originally clay-rich and clay-poor layers. The majority of siliceous rocks lose their porosity by mechanical and chemical compaction and reprecipitation associated with the opal-A to opal-CT transformation.
   One estimates that 30 to 40 My are necessary for a transformation from opal-A to quartz in zones with a high sedimentation rate and 60 to 70 My for those with a moderate sedimentation rate. For the tethyan radiolarite, the quartz stage was thus reached around the Lower Cretaceous which explains: (1) irregular levels because of incomplete lithification, only the porcellanite stage being reached during the Tithonian tectonic phase (Hellenides structures); (2) the difficulty in dating cherts associated with ophiolites of inner zones, which were tectonically deformed before the outer zones (i.e. Pindos-Olonos zone) where dating is relatively easier.
   Domains of deposition and age of radiolarites
   Radiolarites are Tethyan (those which are not of unknown origin !). They have been compared to the red clays of deep oceans. Current knowledge indicates that this comparison is not valid, their only common characteristic being their colour (their deposition below the CCD not being systematic).
   Were they deposited in large or small basins? The problem with large basins is that they have mostly disappeared. On the other hand some radiolarite were deposited in small basins. The important requirement is a strong upwelling. One notices that radiolarites were deposited during Liassic, Dogger-Malm and Albian-Cenomanian times in general and in some local regions, such as marginal basins of East Arabian platform (Hawasina, etc.), siliceous sedimentation occurred from the Permian to Late Cretaceous. One may compare these localities with the present Owen and Somalia basins, all places of active upwellings, but only partially influenced by fully open-marine conditions.

AB  - The aim of this work was to identify morpho-functional and biochemical changes in erythrocytes in students with different daily educational - training regimens after dosed physical exertion. The study involved 50 male students aged 20-22 years who study at the Faculty of Physical Education and Sports. Of these, 25 were untrained students (control group) and 25 were students studying for the highest sports qualification who were engaged in sports in which training was conducted to improve overall endurance (skiing, biathlon, long-distance running). At the end of the school year, all students were required to carry out a single session involving physical loading of maximum intensity on a veloergometer. According to the results of the questionnaire, it was found that the combination of intensive training and training processes caused a mismatch between the functional capabilities of the students' and athletes' biological systems and the increased volume and intensity of their psycho-physical loading, which is closely correlated with a decrease in their level of physical health. In the blood of untrained students, under the influence of dosed physical activity, reversibly altered forms of erythrocyte appeared, which accounted for 2.0% of the total number of erythrocytes. In the morphological study of student athletes, an increase in the content of reversibly and irreversibly altered erythrocytes was observed, the number of which exceeded 2.0% of the total number of erythrocytes. In individual student athletes echinocytes with small-focal microdefects of the outer membrane were observed in the peripheral blood, as well as acanthocytes and stomatocytes, which have low resistance to acid hemolysis. The mechanism of this phenomenon is a decrease in the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and glutathione reductase, which leads to a deficiency of reduced glutathione in erythrocytes. Such cells under the influence of oxidizing agents quickly undergo lysis, which is manifested by a violation of their structural integrity. This can lead to the development of "anemia of loading", which is manifested by a decrease in the concentration of hemoglobin and the number of erythrocytes with their morphometric recalibration due to the appearance of macro-microcytic forms. The presence of such changes can adversely affect both the athletic performance and the state of health of students. This requires appropriate correction of the training process, as well as the development and timely application of adequate measures aimed at eliminating the development of the pathological process and eliminating possible undesirable consequences.

AB  - Forward osmosis (FO) is an emerging technology which can be applied in water reuse applications. Osmosis is a natural process that involves less energy consumption than reverse osmosis (RO), and therefore can be applied as a dilution process before low-pressure RO; it is expected to compete favourably against current advanced water reuse technologies that use microfiltration/ultrafiltration and RO. The focus of this research was to assess the efficiency of different cleaning procedures to remove fouling from the surface of a FO membrane during the operation of a submerged system working in FO-mode (active layer (AL) facing feed solution) intended for secondary wastewater effluent (SWWE) recovery, using seawater as draw solution (DS), which will be diluted and can further be fed to a low-pressure RO unit to produce fresh water. Natural organic matter (NOM) fouling was expected to affect the AL, while for the support layer (SL), transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) were used as indicators of fouling due to their stickiness and propensity to enhance the attachment of other foulants in seawater on the membrane surface. The composition of the NOM fouling layer was determined after proper characterisation with a liquid chromatograph coupled with organic carbon detection (LC-OCD), showing biopolymers and protein-like substances as the main constituents. NOM fouling showed high hydraulic reversibility after a 25% flux decline was observed, up to 89.5% when in situ air scouring for 15min was used as a cleaning technique. Chemical cleaning with a mixture of Alconox, an industrial detergent containing phosphates, and sodium EDTA showed to increase the reversibility (93.6%). Osmotic backwash using a 4% NaCl solution and DI water proved to be ineffective to recover flux due to the salt diffusion phenomena occurring at the AL. Part of the flux that could not be recovered is attributable to TEP fouling on the SL, which forms clusters clearly identifiable with an optical microscope and TEP-specific dyeing/staining of the membrane. Two solutions were tested to clean in place of the SL: a 1% NaOCl solution and the same detergent solution used to clean the AL. The former agent compromised the integrity of the FO membrane, as proved with flux and conductivity measurements; 94.5% of flux was recovered with the latter agent, showing that chemically irreversible fouling for the FO membrane is on the order of 5.5%, which might be associated with the adsorption of biopolymers on the AL and some TEP residuals on the SL. Physical cleaning (air scouring) of the AL proved to be the most effective way to control fouling.

AB  - The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) defined the technical and financial modalities of policy approaches and incentives to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD+). Substantial technical challenges hinder precise and accurate estimation of forest-related emissions and removals, as well as the setting and assessment of reference levels. These challenges could limit country participation in REDD+, especially if REDD+ emission reductions were to meet quality standards required to serve as compliance grade offsets for developed countries' emissions. Using Panama as a case study, we tested the matrix approach proposed by Bucki et al (2012 Environ. Res. Lett. 7 024005) to perform sensitivity and uncertainty analysis distinguishing between 'modelling sources' of uncertainty, which refers to model-specific parameters and assumptions, and 'recurring sources' of uncertainty, which refers to random and systematic errors in emission factors and activity data. The sensitivity analysis estimated differences in the resulting fluxes ranging from 4.2% to 262.2% of the reference emission level. The classification of fallows and the carbon stock increment or carbon accumulation of intact forest lands were the two key parameters showing the largest sensitivity. The highest error propagated using Monte Carlo simulations was caused by modelling sources of uncertainty, which calls for special attention to ensure consistency in REDD+ reporting which is essential for securing environmental integrity. Due to the role of these modelling sources of uncertainty, the adoption of strict rules for estimation and reporting would favour comparability of emission reductions between countries. We believe that a reduction of the bias in emission factors will arise, among other things, from a globally concerted effort to improve allometric equations for tropical forests. Public access to datasets and methodology used to evaluate reference level and emission reductions would strengthen the credibility of the system by promoting accountability and transparency. To secure conservativeness and deal with uncertainty, we consider the need for further research using real data available to developing countries to test the applicability of conservative discounts including the trend uncertainty and other possible options that would allow real incentives and stimulate improvements over time. Finally, we argue that REDD+ result-based actions assessed on the basis of a dashboard of performance indicators, not only in 'tonnes CO2 equ. per year' might provide a more holistic approach, at least until better accuracy and certainty of forest carbon stocks emission and removal estimates to support a REDD+ policy can be reached.

AB  - The Eastern and Western mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki and G. affinis) are potential bioindicator organisms for endocrine disruptors. Male mosquitofish have an elongated anal fin (gonopodium) used for internal fertilization whose formation is driven by androgens. Normal female mosquitofish have a normal, rounded anal fin which undergoes elongation into a gonopodium structure when female mosquitofish are exposed to androgenic chemicals. Significant issues with using mosquitofish as a bioindicator include the lack of knowledge on how anal fin growth in females corresponds to endpoints relevant to biological integrity and the lack of information on the molecular pathways that regulate anal fin growth. The objectives of this study were to understand how androgen-induced anal fin elongation relates to changes in endpoints related to the female reproductive system and to understand how anal fin elongation occurs in androgen-exposed female mosquitofish. To achieve these objectives, adult female G. holbrooki were exposed to a vehicle control or one of three doses of the androgen 17 p-trenbolone (TB) at nominal concentrations of 0.1, 1 or 10 mu g TB/L. Anal fin measurements were taken and livers were used for quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of vitellogenin (vtg) mRNA expression at multiple time points. 10 mu g TB/L induced anal fin elongation after 7 days of treatment (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.05) as did 0.1 and 1 mu g TB/L at later time points (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.05). 10 mu g TB/L significantly reduced hepatic vtg gene expression at all time points assessed (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.05). There was no correlation between anal fin elongation levels and vtg gene expression (Spearman's rho, p > 0.05). In a separate experiment, female G. holbrooki and G. affinis were exposed to the vehicle control or 1 mu g TB/L. Anal fins were used for qualitative gene expression analysis of the genes sonic hedgehog (shh), muscle segment homeobox C (msxC), and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (fgfr1) by in situ hybridization. Shh was expressed in the distal tip of the gonopodium while msxC and fgfr1 were more widely expressed along the same anal fin rays during androgen exposure. These data provide insight into the molecular pathways involved in anal fin elongation and pave the way for future work toward developing the mosquitofish into a bioindicator organism for endocrine disruptors.

AB  - The article summarizes the arguments and counterarguments within the scientific discussion on the quantification of various spheres of enterprise activity based on their system representation. The main purpose of the study is to improve the basic model of systemic economics as the basis for developing a method for quantitative assessment of the harmonious process of development of innovative project-oriented enterprises. Systematization of literary sources and approaches to solving the problem of choosing a basic model has shown that the most reasonable and developed approach is based on the model of the economic tetrad. Various authors used the model when developing indicators of balance and stability of economic systems. However, the known results were not compared, and the model was not used to describe the innovative development of enterprises. The urgency to solve this scientific problem is in the fact that in the era of knowledge economy, innovation development is becoming one of the main directions of activity of modern enterprises, which needs the scientific ground. Studying of the point related to creation of a method for quantitative assessment of the innovative project-oriented enterprises development is carried out in the following logical sequence: making the economic tetrad matching requirements of the system integrity and completeness; conducting an analysis of resource interchange in the triad of the economic tetrad; revealing the essence of the mechanism for managing processes of growth and development of enterprises; developing a mathematical apparatus to describe the dynamic structural changes of enterprises; conducting a computer experiment using five different approaches to calculating the indicators of dynamic structural changes during the introduction of innovations; conducting a comparative analysis of the results. The methodical toolkit of the research considers the postulates of systematicity, scale, harmony, and positions of qualitative mathematics and the triple convolution method. The object of the study is the selected phases of the innovation project life cycle since they determine the peculiarities of the dynamic structural changes of enterprises during the introduction of innovations. The article presents the results of the empirical analysis, carried out based on computer modelling of the innovation project implementation within six different approaches. This showed a fundamentally different nature of the change in structural balance indicators for these approaches. The study theoretically proves and empirically confirms that the proposed indicator of the internal coherence of opposite actions (chaotic and organized) corresponds to the logic of the harmonious implementation of innovation activity. The results of the study can be applied when creating monitoring and management systems for the development of innovative project-oriented enterprises.

AB  - The responses of non-target organisms to pesticide exposure are still poorly explored in what concerns the development of adjustments favouring population success. Owing to the vital role of DNA integrity, it is important to identify genome-maintenance skills and their determinant factors. Thus, the major aims of the present study were: (i) to assess the genotoxicity of the penoxsulam-based herbicide (Viper (R)) to the crayfish Procambarus clarkii; (ii) to understand the influence of gender and contamination history in the genotoxic responses following exposure to this herbicide; (iii) to investigate the damage mechanisms involved in putative adjustments shown by P. clarkii. Two populations were tested, one from a reference site and the other from a historically contaminated site. Specimens from both populations were exposed to Viper (R), considering environmentally relevant penoxsulam concentrations (20 and 40 mu g L-1) and to a model genotoxicant (EMS). Comet assay was adopted to assess the genetic damage in gills. The results disclosed the genotoxicity of the herbicide to crayfish (a non-target organism). Additionally, organisms exposed to the highest concentration of penoxsulam signalized the influence of factor "population" towards the genotoxic pressure (measured as effective DNA breaks): P2 males from the historically impacted population displayed a significantly higher susceptibly (by up to 53.98%) when compared to control, while the homologous group from the reference population presented levels similar to its respective control. When DNA lesion-repair enzymes were considered, DNA oxidation patterns suggested an increased ability of this gender (39.75% lower than negative control) to deal with this particular type of damage, namely considering pyrimidines oxidation. It is worth remarking that the influence of the exposure history on the protection/vulnerability to the penoxsulam-based herbicide was only evident in males, despite depending on the type of DNA damage: when the non-specific damage was considered, organisms from the impacted population seemed to be more vulnerable while regarding to the oxidative damage, males from the impacted population appeared to be more protected than organisms that have never been exposed to penoxsulam. Overall, the influence of factors "gender" and "contamination history" was demonstrated as well as its dependence on DNA damage type was evident. EMS groups did not present the differences between populations, reinforcing the agent-specific adjustment hypothesis.
   These findings highlighted the importance of considering differential physiological backgrounds in ecogenotoxicological analysis, hence favouring the elaboration of more plausible and holistic approaches integrating the environmental risk assessment of pesticides.

AB  - Hou et al. (2016) recently developed a water quality index (WQI) for assessing water quality of five typical reservoirs. Despite all the merits of the practical WQI, it suffers from lack of uncertainty consideration; a fact that motivated the present discussion focusing on mitigation of uncertainty in water quality assessment. In this regard, superiority of employing fuzzy WQI (FWQI) rather than crisp WQI is emphasized. Due to robustness of FWQI in handling uncertainties surrounding data acquisition, employment of fuzzy concept can improve water quality assessment and monitoring to generate results which are more consistent with real world conditions.

AB  - The length weight relationship of the pontellid copepods Labidocera diandra and L. johnsoni was estimated in a coastal lagoon of the southeastern Gulf of California, Mexico. The equation that describes the relationship for L. diandra is W = 9.564e(0.92PL(mm))) (r(2) = 0.83, p < 0.05) and for L. johnsoni is W = 103.95e(0.06PL(mm))) (r(2) = 0.01, p > 0.05); L. diandra had tlie-greatest weight and size variation. The condition factor in both species had a significantly negative trend respect to size, being more pronounced in L. johnsoni. The equations representing the weight-length relationship of pontellid copepod species are indicators of the species biomass and are useful for estimating the rate of secondary production in ecosystems with different levels of anthropogenic intervention.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES
LA  - English
KW  - DYNAMICS
AB  - The U.S. unemployment rate has remained stubbornly high since the 2007-2009 recession, leading some observers to conclude that structural rather than cyclical factors are to blame. Relying on a standard job search and matching framework and empirical evidence from a wide array of labor market indicators, we examine whether the natural rate of unemployment has increased since the recession began, and if so, whether the underlying causes are transitory or persistent. Our preferred estimate indicates an increase in the natural rate of unemployment of about one percentage point during the recession and its immediate aftermath, putting the current natural rate at around 6 percent. An assessment of the underlying factors responsible for this increase, including labor market mismatch, extended unemployment benefits, and uncertainty about overall economic conditions, implies that only a small fraction is likely to be persistent.

AB  - The plant communities on the wetlands of an agricultural landscape in central Italy were studied. Indicator species, dominant life forms, alien species cover and prevailing habitat conditions (using Ellenberg indicator values) were shown to characterize the four groups that emerged from a classification analysis. 31 vegetation units were documented by 98 original phytosociological relev,s and a floristic, synecological and distributional description was presented with syntaxonomic notes for each unit. A new association, Rorippo amphibiae-Potentilletum reptantis, was described. The high phytocoenotic diversity, the 7 coenoses belonging to habitat of Community or regional interest and the higher risks affecting these wetlands in an anthropic countryside (eutrophication, invasion of alien species, human modifications of the landscape) underline the fact that these wetlands are of high conservation value and the goal of protecting this very important environment.

AB  - We here investigate the relationship between oceanographic processes and variability in parasite recruitment to host populations using existing data from host-parasite systems encountering differing hydrographic conditions. Combined epidemiological data obtained from both exploited fish and cephalopod populations indicate that variability in recruitment of parasite infracommunities tends to be associated with major current systems of the World's oceans. It appears that instability in water masses caused by physical perturbations (e.g. water mass convergence and turbulent mixing in upwelling systems) is associated with instability of trophic interactions over time, which in turn leads to a paucity of parasite communities in that area. The likely relationship between parasite recruitment and oceanographic regime should be extremely useful to the fishing industry and also as an indicator of ecosystem health.

AB  - Egg quality is a multidimensional concept that depends on many different parameters. Many studies have evaluated different egg quality attributes subjected to various storage conditions. The present work aimed to study the influence of three environmental parameters (temperature, storage time and relative humidity) on egg quality indicators. Through application of response surface methodology, it was verified that the temperature is the most important environmental factor affecting egg quality attributes followed by the storage time and relative humidity, respectively. Principal Component Analysis showed that most quality indexes are similar except for the eggshell percentage that represents an exterior quality indicator. An artificial neural network composed by one hidden layer and four neurons provided accurate predictions of the Yolk index and is a promising tool to evaluate egg quality.

AB  - Multistimuli-responsive camouflaging and autonomously propelled swimmers are presented. These bioinspired artificial swimmers are capable of color changing in response to a variety of environmental stimuli such as temperature, pH, and light. By multiplexing different stimuli responsive materials on a single swimmer, a vast library of independently addressable colors can be achieved. Unlike other color-changing robots, our color-changing swimmers can move autonomously in solution and are decoupled from tethered supports. The utilized leuco dyes, pH indicators, and phosphorescent powders display excellent reversibility and prolonged color retention. Finally, we design camouflage patterns which render the swimmers invisible against virtually any background, while revealing the swimmer upon changing the environmental conditions. By mimicking animal camouflage strategies these artificial swimmers present a significant step toward realizing multienvironmental stimuli-responsive color-changing strategies for the next generation of smart robotics. Such capabilities can be further enhanced by coupling color-changing ability with stimuli-triggered speed or shape change.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule in biology. Both NO excess and insufficiency have been implicated in numerous physiological and pathological conditions. In order to study the diverse biological roles of NO in cells and tissues, many techniques have been developed for assaying NO. Recently, new generations of fluorescent probes have become indispensible tools for the study of NO biology because of their sensitivity, selectivity, spatiotemporal resolution, and experimental feasibility. Rational application of these probes in the study requires the understanding of the molecular mechanism that the probes are involved in. In this review, we will present an arsenal of fluorescent probes used to detect NO in living cells and animal tissues. We will also discuss the molecular mechanisms, actualities and prospects of fluorescent probes in detecting NO in cell biology.

AB  - Although many process-based studies appear in the strategic management literature, little attention has been devoted to the formation process of marketing strategies. Drawing on enactment and information-processing theories, this study views the external environment as a source of information (i.e. enacted) and organizations as information-processing entities. We propose a conceptual framework of antecedents and market performance consequences of emergent marketing strategies and test it with a sample of 214 UK enterprises. The results suggest that dimensions of market uncertainty (i.e. dynamism and complexity) and strategic feedback systems influence the formation of emergent marketing strategy. Furthermore, the data reveal that market uncertainty aspects condition the association between emergent marketing strategies and market performance in different ways. These findings provide new insights into how emergent marketing strategies evolve and influence organizational outcomes.

AB  - In recent years, Iran's government has emphasized the development of enanotechnology-based industry, so many Iranian companies have gravitated to this subject, or some new companies have established on nanotechnology fields such as nano-composite products. Technology strategy (TS) is one of the most important aspects of any firm's strategic posture especially in dynamic environments; therefore this research is focused on adjusting a dynamic model of technology strategy development for Iranian nano-composite companies' conditions. This article spots four key environmental moderators (Iran as a developing country, high nanotechnology, nano-composite companies, and information availability) which affect Chiesa's dynamic model for technology strategy, and investigates these moderators' effects on the dynamic model's indicators. The results show that 22 indicators of Chiesa's model have changed for this case.

AB  - Contemporary salt marsh deposits are described from elevations up to 9m above present sea level on a high wave-energy, mainly rocky coast in Northern Ireland. The salt marshes contain several distinctive salt marsh species including Juncus gerardii, Glaux maritima and Scirpus maritimus on a thin sandy substrate. Development of elevated or perched salt marshes is attributed to a combination of freshwater drainage and an impermeable substrate which creates waterlogged conditions, together with the frequent occurrence of salt spray which permits salt marsh halophytes to outcompete freshwater marsh plants. Although they are small in area, such marshes are fairly widespread in their distribution. The occurrence of these deposits at high elevations urges caution in the use of salt marsh deposits resting on bedrock as sea level indicators in such environmental settings.

AB  - The practical utility of chlorophyll fluorescence to forestry applications is reviewed. Major subjects include a review of past applications, sampling protocols, important fluorescence features, and instrumentation. Applications including the study of various stress effects, seasonal effects, and comparative sun/shade leaf physiology are provided. Chlorophyll fluorescence has been used mainly in applied research, rather than directly in operational forestry, but work has begun in this area. Sampling protocols include the selection and treatment of samples before assessment, and control of environmental conditions during assessment. Instrumentation is evaluated based on accuracy, versatility, ease of operation, and cost. Chlorophyll fluorescence ranks high among stress detection tests in forestry applications, because it is rapid, reliable, non-destructive, quantitative, diagnostic, and the physiological basis of the assessment is understood.

AB  - Chronic pain is a common, complex, and distressing problem that has a profound impact on individuals and society. It frequently presents as a result of a disease or an injury; however, it is not merely an accompanying symptom, but rather a separate condition in its own right, with its own medical definition and taxonomy. Studying the distribution and determinants of chronic pain allows us to understand and manage the problem at the individual and population levels. Targeted and appropriate prevention and management strategies need to take into account the biological, psychological, socio-demographic, and lifestyle determinants and outcomes of pain. We present a narrative review of the current understanding of these factors.

AB  - A study of bone orientation patterns at a wildebeest bonebed deposited in the floodplain of Lake Masek (Tanzania) shows that portions of the assemblage exhibit anisotropy probably caused by the combined action of lake transgression and regression, and the watersheet formed during the rainy season, which is also responsible for a large part of the microtopographical features of the surface where the bonebed was formed. Some taphonomic indicators (absence of polished or abraded bone, similar representation of Voorhies' anatomical groups I and III) show that the anisotropic trend was formed under very low-energy conditions. Anisotropy can be locally produced in autochthonous assemblages. Bone orientation patterns need to be combined with other taphonomic techniques to determine the depositional nature of any given assemblage. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB  - Remodeling a chromatin structure enables the genetic elements stored in a genome to function in a condition-specific manner and predisposes the interactions between cis-regulatory elements and transacting factors. A chromatin signature can be an indicator of the activity of the underlying genetic elements. This paper reviews recent studies showing that the combination and arrangements of chromatin remodeling marks play roles as chromatin code affecting the activity of genetic elements. This paper also reviews recent studies inferring the primary DNA sequence contexts associated with chromatin remodeling that suggest interactions between genetic and epigenetic factors. We conclude that chromatin remodeling, which provides accurate models of gene expression and morphological variations, may help to find the biological marks that cannot be detected by genome-wide association study or genetic study.

AB  - The research was performed in a new and isolated ink disease outbreak. Nine sweet chestnuts of comparable age, growing under same environmental and site conditions, and belonging to three phytosanitary classes (healthy, infected but asymptomatic and symptomatic) were randomly selected. Their ectomycorrhizal community was monitored during two periods, with regard to species abundance, to verify whether the community composition can be useful as an ink disease bioindicator. From the 216 samples, 29 ectomycorrhizal species were recorded, with abundances that changed with the health status of the tree. The results demonstrated that the mycorrhizal community composition was highly related to the ink disease level, allowing the consideration of the use of this parameter as a tool for the quick detection and control of the early stages of the disease.

AB  - This article presents models of random fields with continuous univariate distributions that are defined by simple operations on stationary or intrinsic Gaussian fields. Realizations of these models can be conditioned to a set of data by using iterative algorithms based on the Gibbs sampler, while parameter inference relies on the fitting of the sample univariate and bivariate distributions. The proposed models are suited to the description of regionalized variables with a spatial clustering of high or low values, patterns of connectivity and curvilinearity, or an asymmetry in the spatial correlation of indicator variables with respect to the median threshold. The simulation procedure is illustrated by a case study in environmental science dealing with nickel concentrations in the topsoil of a polluted site. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The infralittoral benthos was studied on three islands of the Northern Sporades in the Aegean Sea. Thirteen stations were sampled on both hard and soft substrata and 408 taxa were identified, some of zoogeographical interest. Multivariate statistical methods such as classification, ordination and Similarities Terms Analysis were combined with existing ecological information to delineate the various communities present and to point to the indicator species characterising them. The communities were then defined using the indicator species and their affinities to typical biocoenoses. The main factor responsible for the observed distribution proved to be the type of substratum (algal cover or sediment type), which reflects the light and hydrodynamic conditions. The observed bathymetric zonation was similar to that of the Balearic Islands in the western Mediterranean.

AB  - Monitoring selected populations of the only two native Antarctic vascular plant species (Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica) over a 27-year period has revealed a significant and relatively rapid increase in numbers of individuals and populations at two widely separated localities in the maritime Antarctic. There is strong evidence that this increase is a response to a warming trend in summer air temperatures, which has been evident throughout the region since the late 1940s, enhancing seed maturation, germination and seedling survival. This study provides the only known long term monitoring data for any terrestrial organisms in Antarc-tica. Because their response to ameliorating conditions is more rapid than that of the dominant crypt ogamic groups, Antarctic phanerogams may be useful bioindicators of climate change in West Antarctica.

AB  - Inequity in public space distribution has important repercussions on integration ties for different social groups coexisting within the territory. Based on this idea, this paper aims to explore the relationship between population territorial distribution according to socioeconomic status and public space accessibility in Bogota, Colombia. To this end, a quality of life indicator was constructed at micro-level scale. In regards to the public space indicator, a matrix between origins and destinations was generated, which produced the amount of square meters of public space a person would access by a short walk from the dwelling. To relate both variables, a geographically weighted regression performed. A strong relationship was found between the highest levels of quality tsf life and greater accessibility to public space. This finding reveals the existence of structural conditions which foment social segregation.

AB  - Human experience is the result of a complex process in which two poles are united intrinsically: on the one hand, there are bodily changes related to the environment in which our perceptive system is involved. On the other, a series of relational mental assessments which condition, not only perception itself, but also the response to the environment. Both aspects are inseparable: perception and "feeling felt" and hermeneutics and language. Both constitute our experience. This article is a reflection from phenomenology and perennial philosophy on the constitutive aspects of human experience and its relation to the practice of mindfulness meditation as a transforming process of experience. In this sense we wonder: Can the practice of mindfulness modify or influence consciousness and in what sense does it produce a change in human experience and its interpretation?

AB  - In the meadow closer to the fish cages, total inorganic nitrogen, ammonium, chlorophyll-a concentrations and organic matter content in sediment were determined. It is relatively higher than those recorded at the control meadow. In order to test significant differences among stations, sampling periods and depths, environmental variables together with morphological characters of the both sites were analyzed by Canoco. Shoot density, adult leaf length, adult leaf surface area, and leaf area index (LAI) showed significant spatial and temporal changes. Additionally, except shoot density, the values obtained other morphological characters showed increasing trend towards deeper stations and further meadow from the cage activities. A coefficient values were relatively higher in the near cages and decreased related with depth.

AB  - Previous studies in deliberately infected sheep have shown an association between IgA activity against 4th-stage larvae of Teladorsagia circumcincta and parasite growth, development and fecundity. The purpose of this research,,vas to determine if these results could be confirmed in naturally infected sheep and to explore the hypothesis that plasma IgA activity could help to identify resistant lambs with shorter adult nematodes. Plasma IgA activity was skewed with most animals having relatively low levels of IgA activity. Plasma IgA activity, was repeatable and highly heritable. Animals with increased IgA activity had lower egg counts and shorter adult female T. circumcincta. Therefore, under conditions of natural parasite challenge, plasma IgA activity, may help to identify lambs resistant to T. circumcincta.

AB  - The article examines the occurrence of extremely cold and extremely warm days as an indicator of environmental changes in the Pirin Mountain (Bulgaria). The study is based on hourly air temperature data recorded by an automatic weather station. By averaging the hourly data, daily values are calculated. The occurrence of extremely cold and extremely warm days during the period 2015-2018 for January, April, July and October are analyzed. Extreme temperature days are determined by threshold values for the 10th and 90th percentiles. Characteristic synoptic situations related to the manifestation of extreme temperatures are presented. As a result of the research it was established that the advections of air masses are the leading factor for the occurrence of extreme temperatures. In addition very important for the extremely low temperatures is the high air pressure over the Balkan Peninsula.

AB  - Photocatalytically active building materials can contribute to better air quality by mineralizing the hazardous nitrogen oxides to nitrate. Evaluation of these materials is very important for optimization and implementation at target sites. However, the currently widely used ISO 22917-1:2016 test is unsuitable to estimate the effect on real scenarios since it employs too high concentrations and only evaluates the NO oxidation potential, completely ignoring the more relevant NO2. Herein, we present a methodology to better simulate the real-world performance of these materials based on its effect on the ternary mixture NO/NO2/O-3 under environmentally relevant concentrations, which can also be simulated by means of kinetic analysis of experimentally less complex single component measurements. From this, a new figure of merit - the trend value - is derived to rate the materials' performance.

AB  - An analysis of the bryophyte flora of the so far studied Sicilian beech woods is carried out. Overall, 151 mosses and 23 liverworts are reported for these forest systems localized in the Madonie, Nebrodi, Peloritani and Etna (northern and north-eastern Sicily). The bryofloras show a quite high diversity level in species composition (similarity always below 50%) and include several taxa rare in Europe or phytogeographically interesting. A survey of ecological and chorological features reveals the occurrence of peculiar bryophyte floras in accordance with meso- and microclimatic as well as with edaphic conditions of the different woods. The bryophytes, therefore, may be particularly useful for monitoring the conservation status of these woods, which in Sicily reach the European southernmost latitudinal and highest altitudinal limit.

AB  - For the very first time a jump diffusion process with Markovian covariates is used for prognostics and health monitoring. This paper aims to give a methodology for reliability and lifetime estimation of a non-increasing, deteriorating system where the increments are not normally distributed and the Wiener process cannot be used. We propose, first to study of the statistical properties of increments. Afterward the measures dependency is tested. A jump diffusion process with a covariate is considered to fit the deterioration model. The covariate models the environmental conditions. The proposed deterioration model is applied to a large set of collected data corresponding to the health indicators in ageing components in hydraulic electrical production systems and prognostic results are given.

AB  - The International Energy Agency, in its report on energy efficient building facades, maintains that building envelopes play a fundamental role in determining thermal and visual comfort and energy consumption for indoor lighting and thermal conditioning. Within this framework, the goal of this article is to conduct a review of the opto-thermal evaluation of building envelope materials and components, regarding the state of transfer and possibilities for technology development in Argentina, in order to estimate the thermal and optical properties and energy indicators of building envelopes. This review shows that for energy-savings resulting from the implementation of energy certification programs to be effective, it is imperative to have databases on the opto-thermal behavior of local materials and technologies. It also demonstrates that in the socioeconomic context of developing countries, this requires the study of low-cost methods.

AB  - The transitioning of land from forest to other uses is of increasing interest as urban areas expand and the world's population continues to grow. Also of interest, but less recognized, is the transitioning of land from other uses into forest. In this paper, we show how rates of conversion from forest to non-forest and non-forest to forest can be estimated in the US from a continuously improving publicly available annual forest inventory database, under varying definitions of conversion. Two estimation approaches are considered and contrasted. The approaches are a simple ratio estimator and the weighted maximum likelihood estimator. The latter involves a statistical procedure that incorporates the binomial nature of the indicator variables, the transition of mapped plot conditions and an intuitively appealing way to combine data from varying remeasurement periods for a temporally dependent variable.

AB  - An ecological assessment of lowland deciduous dipterocarp-oak, seasonal, hardwood forest on the base of the east side of Doi Sutep-Pui, Chiang Mai province, was conducted. Seven selected sites representing the most intact condition to the worst one were surveyed. Plant species diversity and abundance declined as fire damage increased. Details on the number of species, their habits, size classes of trees, pioneer vs climax species, woody seedlings, coppices, and herbaceous ground flora are presented. Species lists for all these categories and their abundance are also included. Profile diagrams and photographs of some sites are shown. The conservation value of lowland forests has been largely neglected and now many places require reforestation. The degree of degradation is serious and will continue to deteriorate unless effective protective and remedial action is done.

TI  - RISK ANALYSIS OF DISEASE EPIDEMICS ON WHEAT BY SIMULATION STUDIES
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
LA  - English
AB  - Risk analysis on disease epidemics of wheat was studied by simulations, using a weather model (based on the weather generator developed by Shen (1988, Ph.D. thesis, Beijing Agricultural University)) and a multiple disease epidemic simulation model for wheat (Dong, 1988, Ph. D. thesis, Beijing Agricultural University). Monte-Carlo simulations were used to link these two models. Expected yield losses in wheat caused by three diseases under various weather conditions combined with different initial inoculum levels could be estimated The information about the risk of disease epidemics was primarily obtained from analysis of the frequency distribution of expected simulated yield losses. Two sets of simulations were performed to study the risk of yield loss on wheat in general.  Two additional sets of simulations were run for the Beijing and Gangu districts to pro vide examples of risk assessment tables in specific environments. Risk assessment tables could provide decision makers with a powerful tool to manage diseases.

AB  - As a global persistent organic pollutant, perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) have aroused great public concern. However, little is known regarding the effect of ship navigation disturbance on the transport and fate of PFAAs in inland waterways developed regions. In the present study, overlying water, pore water, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and sediment were collected from waterways (WWs), non-navigable channels (NCs), and ports (PTs) in Taihu Lake Basin. The results revealed that the total concentrations of PFAAs (Sigma PFAAs) in WWs, NCs, and PTs varied considerably in different media. In overlying water, the mean Sigma PFAAs in WWs were the highest, while those of NCs were relatively higher in the remaining three media. A comparison of PFAA distribution coefficients revealed that the values in NCs were generally higher than those of WWs and PTs, suggesting the critical role of ship navigation in PFAA transport. Furthermore, a structural equation model was applied to estimate direct and indirect effects of environmental factors on PFAA partitioning behavior. The results revealed that ship traffic volume (STV) exerted indirect effects on PFAA distribution between solid and dissolved phases by influencing dissolved oxygen, total suspended solid concentration, clay and sand contents, and median diameter. PFAAs were more readily to be released into overlying water from pore water than in sediment, and the Sigma PFAAs carried per gram of SPM decreased with an increase in STV. Ecological risk assessment and Monte Carlo simulation results revealed that ship navigation could exert adverse effects on aquatic organisms, making the average probability of RQmix values to exceed corresponding risk values in WWs, which were 1.3-2-fold higher than in NCs. The present study provides crucial information for simulating the environmental behaviors of PFAAs under the influence of ship navigation and is significant for the integration of inland water transport development and aquatic environmental protection.

AB  - In the literature, there is widespread consensus that methods in plastic research need improvement. Current limitations in quality assurance and harmonization prevent progress in our understanding of the true effects of microplastic in the environment. Following the recent development of quality assessment methods for studies reporting concentrations in biota and water samples, we propose a method to assess the quality of microplastic effect studies. We reviewed 105 microplastic effect studies with aquatic biota, provided a systematic overview of their characteristics, developed 20 quality criteria in four main criteria categories (particle characterization, experimental design, applicability in risk assessment, and ecological relevance), propose a protocol for future effect studies with particles, and, finally, used all the information to define the weight of evidence with respect to demonstrated effect mechanisms. On average, studies scored 44.6% (range 20-77.5%) of the maximum score. No study scored positively on all criteria, reconfirming the urgent need for better quality assurance. Most urgent recommendations for improvement relate to avoiding and verifying background contamination, and to improving the environmental relevance of exposure conditions. The majority of the studies (86.7%) evaluated on particle characteristics properly, nonetheless it should be underlined that by failing to provide characteristics of the particles, an entire experiment can become irreproducible. Studies addressed environmentally realistic polymer types fairly well; however, there was a mismatch between sizes tested and those targeted when analyzing microplastic in environmental samples. In far too many instances, studies suggest and speculate mechanisms that are poorly supported by the design and reporting of data in the study. This represents a problem for decision-makers and needs to be minimized in future research. In their papers, authors frame 10 effects mechanisms as "suggested", whereas 7 of them are framed as "demonstrated". When accounting for the quality of the studies according to our assessment, three of these mechanisms remained. These are inhibition of food assimilation and/or decreased nutritional value of food, internal physical damage, and external physical damage. We recommend that risk assessment addresses these mechanisms with higher priority.

AB  - In this paper, we describe the species composition of biotopes occurring in a wide range of environments and present their geographic distribution based on results from quantitative analyses of video-records collected as part of the Norwegian seabed mapping program MAREANO. We present results from an analysis of annotated video records at 757 stations from an area exceeding 100,000 km(2) in the Barents Sea and Norwegian Sea. A two-way indicator species analyses (TWINSPAN) was used to identify sample groups and species assemblages for biotope classification. Environmental conditions were compared for the station groups identified at different similarity levels to detect environmental drivers behind each division and hence biotopes indicated by the analysis. In total, 27 groups were identified as potential biotopes in the study area giving a geographic resolution suitable for management needs and subsequent predictive modeling. The faunal composition was mainly correlated with water masses (temperature and salinity). The most distinct biotope identified occurred on Spitsbergenbanken, a shallow area (<50 m) with strong bottom currents. The other biotopes formed two main groups characterized by different oceanographic properties: (1) Atlantic Water and Arctic Intermediate Water associated with higher temperatures and stronger current speed and (2) Arctic Water, Atlantic Water, and Norwegian Sea Deep Water (NSDW) associated with both lower temperatures and slower current speeds. The cold-water species occurred both in the shallow (<200 m) Artic Water in the north-eastern part of the study area, and the deep (>600 m) NSDW, separating into two TWINSPAN groups. Further divisions of these groups reflected variations in sediment and terrain attributes. Ten biotopes were characterized by indicators species of vulnerable marine ecosystems (e.g., coral gardens, sea pen communities, and sponge aggregations). Knowledge about megafauna composition and biotopes is poor for deep-water benthic habitats in the Arctic region, and better classification of benthic biotopes will be valuable for management purposes such as design of monitoring program for documenting the effects of climate change on ecosystems.

AB  - Testate amoebae are ubiquitous unicellular eukaryotic micro-organisms. They occur in high abundances in terrestrial habitats and contribute to important ecological and biogeochemical processes like silicon cycling. Little is known about the growth of testate amoeba populations under hyperosmotic stress, as caused by salinity pulses due to coastal flooding. Given the increasing sea-levels in response to climate change we address this knowledge gap by jointly considering results from a laboratory experiment and a field study in Tuvalu (South Pacific). In the laboratory experiment, Trinema galeata cultures tolerated up to 1 g NaCl L-1 but showed a pronounced decrease in growth rate probably due to interactions with other micro-organisms. Tracheleuglypha dentata cultures had the highest growth rate at 0.5 g NaCl L-1. At higher salt concentrations (5-10 g NaCl L-1), a strongly reduced growth and rapid closing of the shell aperture with a plug occurred, which can be considered as rapid pre-encystment. Euglypha rotunda cultures had the highest growth rates at 1 g NaCl L-1. At higher salt concentrations (5-10 g NaCl L-1), a strongly reduced growth and spherical shrinking of cell plasma occurred, which is again considered as rapid pre-encystment. After seven weeks of exposure, a replacement of the 5 and 10 g NaCl L-1 culture medium by NaCl-free medium resulted in a quick recovery of T. dentata and E. rotunda cultures, but not of T. galeata cultures. Generally, cultures of T. dentata showed the highest growth rates and shortest generation times (up to 0.37/1.91 day(-1), respectively). In the field study, different flooding regimes resulted in fundamental changes of the composition of soil amoeba communities. In conclusion, terrestrial testate amoebae can tolerate at least short periods of exposure to moderate salinity caused by flooding stress due to their ability to form cysts and fast growth rates.

AB  - The relevance of the research is caused by the need to extend options for stand-alone power supply systems. Photovoltaic is a part of a government decree related to the ratification by Russia of the Paris climate agreement of 23.09.19. DC power supply systems with the integration of renewable energy sources for decentralized consumers can be the preferred alternative to AC. By using this, that most of the Paris Climate Agreement obligations would be met, as well as requirements for improving energy safety.
   The main aim of the research is improving the quality of electric energy in 0,4 kV distribution networks, decarbonizing the environment from hydrocarbon pollutions, increasing the energy security of a stand-alone power supply system by increasing the contribution to the energy balance of renewable energy resources, as well as reducing the cost of generated electric energy, in the frame of transition from AC to DC.
   Methodology. Due to the complexity of the full-scale study of electric power systems with the generation of various physical nature, the following research tools were identified: mathematical modelling with subsequent computer implementation in high-level software systems. Among the extensive range of software tools, MatLab meets the most complete simulation conditions, in particular, its Simulink modelling application with support for transient tracking - the SimPowerSystems library.
   Results. The authors have developed the software tool that allows simulating the operating modes of photo-diesel power supply systems, including generation with current power consumption and insolation in order to determine the rational technical and economic parameters of hybrid generating systems; identified the criteria for the feasibility and effectiveness of designing photo-diesel systems with DC for power supply to rural settlements; proposed new technological solutions to improve energy safety and technical and economic indicators of stand-alone power supply systems and the options of using smart algorithms with adaptive properties that provide improved technical and economic characteristics of the electric power system.

AB  - In 2015, the Fundao tailing dam collapsed over the district of Bento Rodrigues (Mariana, Minas Gerais, Brazil) causing deaths, hundreds of homeless families and incalculable environmental degradation. Environmentally, economically and socially sustainable strategies are needed for the recovery of the affected areas. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the development, biomass production and toxic mineral elements absorption of three species of aromatic grasses (Chrysopogon zizanioides, Cymbopogon citratus and Cymbopogon winterianus). These three species were planted on polypropylene pots filled with the iron ore tailings collected from the topsoil of the Bento Rodrigues district. The pots were fertilized with increasing doses of organic compost associated with mycorrhizae as a phytomanagement strategy. A 4 x 2 factorial scheme was used. The seedlings were fertilized with four doses of organic compost, with or without mycorrhizae. At the highest dose of the organic compost (2 kg.plant(-1)), the total dry matter (dry matter of the aerial part + dry matter of the roots) for C. zizanioides was 4.5 times higher than the control (tailing only). For C. winterianus and C. Citratus was 3.8 and 2.8 times higher than the control, respectively. Inoculation with mycorrhizae improved biomass production, especially in C. zizanioides. The Fe and Mn levels found in the aerial part of the plants fertilized with organic compost were lower than those just growing on the iron ore tailings for the three species, which suggest that the organic matter apparently helped the plants in the exclusion of the hazardous substances and therefore increased the tolerance to these adverse environmental conditions. C. zizanioides, associated with organic matter and mycorrhizae, would be the recommended species. The proposed phytomanagement strategy can have a significant contribution to the gradual recovery of the affected area and also serve as a source of income for the local population.

AB  - The aesthetic appreciation of natural places is one of the most fundamental ways in which people relate to their environment. It provides wellbeing, an opportunity for recreation and reflection, a sense of place, and cultural enrichment. It also motivates people to take care of natural places and to conserve them for current and future appreciation. Aesthetically valuable places also support significant economic activity. However, there is little guidance available to assist environmental managers and policy-makers to consider and integrate aesthetic values into decision-making processes. In this study, we present an approach for developing robust and practical indicators of aesthetic value to enable environmental managers to consider, assess and report on aesthetic condition and trend. We demonstrate its utility using the case of the Great Barrier Reef, a region currently undergoing significant social, economic and environmental change and an area formally protected, in part, for its aesthetic values. A qualitative scoping study with 30 key informants identified over 180 potential qualities contributing to reef aesthetics. We tested five for their utility in capturing key aspects of the coral reef aesthetic: (i) coral cover, (ii) coral pattern, (iii) coral topography, (iv) fish abundance, and (v) visibility. We asked 1,417 online Australians to aesthetically rate 50 out of 181 underwater coral reef images that varied in relation to these five attributes. Coral topography, fish abundance, and visibility were significantly correlated with aesthetic ratings, whilst coral cover and coral pattern were not. We also tested for demographic patterns in aesthetic ratings. Our pilot study has demonstrated that readily measurable characteristics of coral reefs can provide useful indicators of aesthetic quality, opening up opportunities for coral reef managers and policymakers to assess and track changes in aesthetics in ways that are relevant to the public. There is considerable scope to further advance capacity for monitoring and managing aesthetic values of coral reefs through additional research that resolves nuances in the meanings associated with aesthetics in coral reef settings.

AB  - Vegetation cover is a commonly used indicator for evaluating terrestrial environmental conditions, and for revealing environmental evolution and transitions. Spatiotemporal variations in the vegetation cover of the Hexi Corridor and surrounding areas from 2000 to 2010 were investigated using MODIS NDVI data, and the causes of vegetation cover changes were analyzed, considering both climatic variability and human activities. The vegetation cover of the study area increased during 2000-2010. The greenness of the vegetation showed a significant increase from the northwest to the southeast, which was similar to the spatial distribution of the annual precipitation. Variations in vegetation have a close relationship with those in precipitation within the Qilian Mountains region, but the NDVI is negatively correlated with precipitation in oasis areas. Increasing temperatures led to drought, inhibiting vegetation growth in summer; however, increasing temperatures may have also advanced and prolonged the growing periods in spring and autumn. The NDVI showed a slight degradation in March and July, primarily in the Qilian Mountains, and especially the Wushao Mountains. In March, due to low temperatures, the metabolism rate of vegetation was too slow to enable strong plant growth in high elevations of the Qilian Mountains. In July, increasing temperatures enhanced the intensity of transpiration and decreasing precipitation reduced the moisture available to plants, producing a slight degradation of vegetation in the Qilian Mountains. In May and August, the NDVI showed a significant improvement, primarily in the artificial oases and the Qilian Mountains. Abundant precipitation provided the necessary water for plant growth, and suitable temperatures increased the efficiency of photosynthesis, resulting in a significant improvement of vegetation in the Qilian Mountains. The improvement of production technologies, especially in irrigation, has been beneficial to the growth of vegetation in oasis areas. The implementation of large-scale vegetation management has led to several beneficial effects in the artificial oases and grasslands of the Qilian Mountains.

AB  - Patterns in aquatic Clitellata assemblage composition are known to be driven by several environmental gradients, with water chemistry and substratum characteristics being particularly important. In this study we explored 54 isolated spring fens across the eastern Czech Republic and Slovakia. These fens varied in calcium and magnesium concentrations, forming a sharp and well defined environmental gradient running from calcium-poor acidic fens to extremely calcium-rich tufa-forming fens. We found that the main changes in clitellate species composition were controlled by this gradient, and/or total organic carbon content, over a wide area, including fen sites differing in other environmental conditions and historical development. However, this pattern was weakened in sites with a high organic matter content, which represented a second driver of change in assemblage composition along with water temperature. Three main types of fens were determined using cluster analysis based on clitellate assemblage composition. However, only the first type, which included tufa-forming fens, was found to fit with the previously established spring fen types based on vegetation (i.e. extremely mineral-rich fens with a tufa, brown-moss mineral-rich fens, mineral-rich Sphagnum fens and mineral-poor Sphagnum fens). The second clitellate type included sites with low temperatures and occasional desiccation, while the third type was characterised by high temperatures and trophy. Using eight environmental predictors, we were able to significantly explain changes in the population abundances of all 12 common species (i.e. recorded at 15-plus sites). The results from individual species modelling also suggests that an increase in organic matter content can trigger compositional shifts towards assemblages of common eurytopic tubificid species. Thus, human-induced eutrophication and negative changes in spring fen hydrology, mainly drying up, can represent a serious threat for species-specific assemblages of aquatic clitellates, especially at alkaline sites due to their isolated and spatially limited nature.

AB  - Successful management of reintroduced populations requires recognizing that ecological conditions may have changed between extirpation and reintroduction. For example, characterizing dietary patterns of generalist apex predators in the past and present can help to define how their functional role may change as translocated populations grow. We identified prey remains collected from Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) nests and used carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope analysis to quantify diet composition of the recently reintroduced Bald Eagle population on the Channel Islands off southern California, USA. We collected >6,000 prey items from recently occupied nests on Santa Catalina, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, and Anacapa islands in 2010 and 2011. Prey identification and stable isotope analysis yielded similar results and showed that eagles on Santa Catalina Island consumed a high proportion (similar to 60%) of marine fish and a lower proportion (25-30%) of seabirds, while their counterparts on the Northern Channel Islands consumed equal proportions (similar to 40-45%) of these prey types. Terrestrial resource use was low with the exception of eagles from one nest on Santa Catalina Island, where eagles primarily consumed ground squirrels and freshwater fish. We suggest that a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors is responsible for the interisland differences in Bald Eagle diet. Bald Eagle interactions with a robust recreational fishery off Santa Catalina Island may enhance access to fish species that are not available to eagles on the Northern Channel Islands, where the availability of breeding seabirds is far greater. The proportion of seabirds consumed by eagles on the Northern Channel Islands today is similar to that consumed by eagles from this region historically and prehistorically. This suggests that the restoration of breeding seabirds on the Channel Islands will benefit the long-term viability of eagle populations in the northern archipelago.

AB  - Small mammals comprise an important component of forest vertebrate communities. Our understanding of how small mammals use forested habitat has relied heavily on studies in forest systems not naturally prone to frequent disturbances. Small mammal populations that evolved in frequent-fire forests, however, may be less restricted to specific habitat conditions due to the instability of these resources in time and space. We investigate how canopy cover and the volume of coarse woody debris (CWD), covariates that are considered important for small mammals, impact abundance and body mass of eight small mammal species. Based on live-trapping data collected across 23 sites over three years in a frequent fire forest in the Sierra Nevada we apply capture-recapture models for stratified populations, a statistically rigorous, rarely used framework that allows joint modeling of detection, abundance and its response to covariates. Canopy cover had a strong negative association with the abundance of yellow-pine chipmunks and California ground squirrels, and a strong positive association with deer mice. CWD had a strong negative association with the abundance of golden-mantled ground squirrels, yellow-pine and long-eared chipmunks, and a strong positive association with deer mice. Whereas canopy cover influenced abundance and body mass similarly, CWD had a positive association with body mass and a negative association with abundance in some species. These patterns could arise if suitable habitat is monopolized by socially dominant individuals. Despite these habitat associations, the small mammal community in our study was dynamic and diverse, with spatial and temporal variation in dominant species suggesting that species were flexible in their use of habitat. This study suggests that it is important to understand the disturbance regimes when investigating habitat requirements, coexistence and evolutionary ecology of small mammal species.

AB  - Understanding the soil and climatic conditions affecting the partitioning of snowmelt to runoff and infiltration during spring snow ablation is a requisite for water resources management and environmental risk assessment in cold semi-arid regions. Soil freezing and thawing processes, snowmelt runoff or infiltration into seasonally frozen soils have been documented for natural, agricultural or forested systems but rarely studied in severely disturbed systems such as reclaimed lands. The objective of this study was to quantify the snowmelt infiltration/runoff on phosphogypsum (PG) tailings piles capped with varying thicknesses of topsoil (0.15, 0.3, and 0.46 m) at a phosphate fertilizer production facility in Alberta. There are currently no environmental regulations specifying topsoil capping thickness or characteristics for these types of tailings piles. Generally, the function of the topsoil cap is to facilitate plant growth and minimize the amount of drainage into the underlying PG. Experimental plots were established in 2006 to better understand the vegetation and water dynamics in this reconstructed soil. In 2011, time domain reflectometry (TDR) probes and temperature sensors were installed at various depths for continuous, simultaneous, and automated measurement of composite dielectric permittivity (epsilon(eff)) and soil temperature, respectively. An on-site meteorological station was used to record routine weather data. Liquid water and ice content were calculated with TDR-measured effective permittivity (epsilon(eff)) and a composite dielectric mixing model. Spatial and temporal change of total water content (ice and liquid) revealed that snowmelt infiltration into the topsoil cap increased with increasing topsoil depth and net soil water flux from the topsoil cap into the PG material was positive during the snowmelt period in the spring of 2011. Given the objective of the capping soil is to reduce drainage of water into the PG material it is recognized that a capping soil with a higher water-holding capacity could reduce the amount of meteoric water entering the tailings.

AB  - The sustainability in the marine and coastal environment was conceptualized significantly since the Earth Summit in 1992 where Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) was proposed as one of the solutions that can support the decision makers to work together and provide decisive actions for the better coastal management. A right balance between the socio-economic growth and the environmental protection is the most important goal in the coastal management. In order to achieve the goal, a framework-based strategy, financial planning and policy enforcement must be implemented in the coastal management.
   Indonesia as one of the archipelagic states has adopted this concept within two Indonesian cooperation laws which were intended to enable the Indonesian government to manage the coastal areas more responsibly and accountably in the aim for the improved environment for future generations. Since the endorsement of those laws, however, the implementation has been lagging and the Indonesia government's focus is rather on the land-based development despite the consequence of the negligence in the coastal management. This is evident in the impact on the coastal environment that is caused by rapid and ill-planned developments in Indonesian coastal regions. As a result, Indonesia already lost four islands associated with Seribu Islands by 1999. It proves that Seribu Islands lack in the policy enforcement and were unnoticed by both the central government and the local government.
   This paper aims to assess the ecological vulnerability with a focus on coral reefs in Seribu Islands using Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing technologies. From the study results, it can be summarized that the urban pressures and pollutants from four main rivers in Jakarta Bay and Banten Province played a significant role in the environmental degradation. Most of the islands associated with Seribu Islands are at risk, if the urban development continues. The vulnerability analysis of Seribu Islands can assist the decision makers to prepare pivotal actions in order to adapt the changes and develop essential recovery programs for the region.

AB  - Bathymodiolus mussels of the Mytilidae family live in ecological niches at marine vent sites where hydrothermal fluids discharge at the seafloor and mix with ambient seawater. We report the first concentration data for rare earth elements and yttrium (REV) of Bathymodiolus shells and of low-temperature diffuse hydrothermal fluids venting in their respective habitat at three hydrothermal vent fields along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) and for littoral Mytilus edulis shells from the western North Atlantic, Dingle Bay, Ireland, and from the southern North Sea, German Bight, Germany. Similar to high-temperature hydrothermal solutions expelled in the respective area, the low-temperature diffuse fluids from the hydrothermal vent sites display positive Eu anomalies. These indicate that the fluids carry a component previously involved in high-temperature water-rock interaction, as decoupling of Eu from neighbouring REV requires temperatures above about 200 degrees C. While the Bathymodiolus shells from the hydrothermal vent fields reflect these positive Eu anomalies, the littoral M. edulis shells studied for comparison, do not show Eu anomalies, consistent with the lack of any high-temperature hydrothermal activity in their coastal environments. Shells of mussels of the Mytilidae family, such as Bathymodiolus and M. edulis, therefore, are archives whose REY distribution can be used as a proxy for the Eu anomaly of the waters in which the mussels grew. Although the Ca carbonate of a mussel shell is precipitated from the extrapallial fluid of the mussel and not directly from seawater, the Eu/Eu* ratio of seawater is not significantly modified under the low-temperature conditions prevailing during vital processes and biomineralization. This allows one to use the positive Eu anomalies in the REV distribution patterns of Bathymodiolus shells as a tracer for hidden or fossil high-temperature hydrothermal systems where other indicators of high-temperature hydrothermalism are not available.

AB  - The establishment of woody fallow systems is an option for the improvement of degraded agricultural landscape within the ecologically deteriorated Aral Sea area in northwest Uzbekistan. Growth and development of ten tree species, differing in tolerance to drought and salinity, were studied over 24 months. To determine species suitability for afforestation, conventional diameter and height measurements were compared to Relative Growth Rate (RGR) and its underlying components, Net Assimilation Rate (NAR), Specific Leaf Area (SLA) and Leaf Weight Ratio (LWR), as well as the Crop Growth Rate (CGR) as a function of NAR and Leaf Area Index (LAI). RGRs varied between 0.46 and 2.16 mg g(-1) day(-1) and showed highly significant differences among species, but also between years, which reduces the parameter's suitability for species selection. The same is true for NAR and SLA. CGR values ranged from 0.01 to 0.71 g m(-2) day(-1), increased with age of the trees, and showed significant species differences. CGR correlated better with NAR (r = 0.89) and SLA (r = 0.86) than RGR. Overall CGR correlated highly with the RGRs in height and diameter (in 80% and 71% of all cases, respectively). Thus, CGR appears to be a suitable indicator complementing RGR, NAR and SLA estimates to decide on species suitability for afforestation. The intensive measurements for RGR should be done later, rather than earlier in the tree life cycle. At an early age, CGR and diameter measurements are more meaningful. A combination of estimates, not a single factor, best assesses the long-term sustainable growth under natural conditions and allows early selection of species suitable for afforestation of degraded patches in the agricultural landscape. Ranking of all parameters concurrently showed the high potential of Elaeagnus angustifolia and Populus euphratica, which matched previous rankings based on total biomass production and financial added value.

AB  - Lake Myvatn, northern Iceland is unique in that almost all the inflow is supplied through the groundwater by artesian springs. Hardly any surface water is encountered in the area which is covered by young and porous lava fields and transected by faults. The inflow of water and its chemical composition is, therefore, very stable. Geo-thermal and volcanic activities affect the groundwater system in the Lake Myvatn area and greatly influence the lake's chemistry and thus the biological conditions especially by providing continuous and ample sources of silica and sulphate. Groundwater studies have been intensified in the area during the last years for further developing the Namafjall geothermal field in the area and the Krafla geothermal field about 10 km from Namafjall. Groundwater chemistry was monitored regularly for 2 years at 22 sampling sites and for determining selected indicator constituents in the samples. Concurrently, several tracer tests were performed in the area, the rate of groundwater flow measured, a reservoir model of the groundwater system established. These studies enabled us to divide cold groundwater and geothermal effluent in the Lake Myvatn area into six distinct groups, based on stable isotope ratios, chemical composition and geographical position. The groundwater has separate origins in the local high ground north of Lake Myvatn and the highlands far to the south, possibly as far south as the glacier Vatnajokull. The waters are to a different extent affected by geothermal activity, and effects of volcanic activity were noted during the Krafla fires in 1975-1984. Although these have diminished, they have not completely disappeared. The effluent from Krafla seems to travel to the east of Lake Myvatn and traces of it have not been found to enter the lake. The Namafjall effluent on the other hand travels along fissures to the lake. Attempts made to simulate the evolution of the geothermal water of Krafla and by theoretically titrating local groundwater with rock at elevated temperatures and adding volcanic gas seem promising and result in a composition close to the natural one.

AB  - To compare the effects of supplementary ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation on a tropical/subtropical and a temperate plant, two indica rice cultivars (Er Bai Ai and Lemont) and peas were exposed to supplementary UV-B radiation for 8 days (biologically effective irradiance of 0.68 W m-2, 12 h per day). Marked decreases occurred in the ratios of variable to maximum chlorophyll fluorescence yield and in the quantum yield of photosynthetic oxygen evolution over the 8 day treatment period. The greatest decline always occurred in pea leaves, while in rice, cv. Er Bai Ai was more susceptible to UV-B radiation than cv. Lemont. Compared with control plants, the content of soluble protein and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) protein decreased significantly after the UV-B treatment; the greatest decrease occurred in pea leaves, while the rate of decrease in rice was greater in cv. Er Bai Ai than cv. Lemont.
   Over the 8 day UV-B treatment period, the increase of UV-B-absorbing compounds was greater in rice leaves than in pea leaves, and greater in cv. Er Bai Ai than in cv. Lemont, although cv. Lemont was more UV-B tolerant. We suggest that the increase in these compounds is not the only indicator of resistance to UV-B damage; other factors, yet to be identified, may also confer UV-B tolerance. While leaf orientation may be related to the severity of UV-B damage, naturally near-horizontal pea leaves were still much more susceptible to UV-B damage compared with rice leaves which were held horizontally over the 8 day treatment period. Brown spots appeared on the upper surface of leaves of cv. Er Bai Ai after 2 days of UV-B treatment and showed a cumulative increase with the duration of exposure. Our study confirms the multiplicity of photosynthetic responses and of different protective strategies that may account for the differential sensitivity of plants to supplementary UV-B radiation.

AB  - Purpose - This paper has two purposes. First is to operationalise the concepts of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and trust in the context of a developing country, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Second purpose is to test in a disaggregated perspective the impact of each CSR dimension on trust.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 264 customers of six banks and processed with exploratory, confirmatory factor analysis and structural equations using LISREL 9.1.
   Findings - CSR is found to have five dimensions: legal responsibility, social needs responsibility, product responsibility, environmental responsibility and employee responsibility; trust is found to be a three-dimensional construct: integrity, compassion and partnership. Each CSR dimension has a positive impact on customers' perception of trustworthiness.
   Research limitations/implications - Reliability of trust is not high enough, suggesting the need to deepen research in order to find a more adapted CSR scale for banks. The smallness of sample size might have influenced the robustness of our psychometric results. CSR and trust relationships might be analysed in a more enriched framework including service quality, reputation and banks' employee performance as moderating variables. This paper has measured the two concepts from the customers' perspective only. However, both CSR and trust are best understood in a stakeholder perspective. So, it might be insightful to extend future research in a stakeholder orientation perspective.
   Practical implications - Banks from developing countries are also concerned with CSR and should invest in it. Clearly, each dimension of CSR should receive enough importance if Congolese banks are to recover their customers' trust. The findings of the study also suggest that banks' customers are aware of the necessity for banks to comply with the country's legislation. Non-compliance can have severe influence on customers' trustworthiness to banks.
   Social implications - Financial institutions are generally evaluated through financial indicators. The findings suggest that banks customers and other stakeholders begin a shift towards requiring their banks to invest in social and environmental activities in order to improve their local milieu. These aspects are still very neglected, or adopted only as marketing strategies to improve image, without a true willingness to be socially responsive.
   Originality/value - The two concepts are measured in a context where they did not receive enough importance (developing country), hence providing new knowledge in the field. Further, a disaggregated approach allowed understanding the way each CSR dimension impacts trust, which had not been the case in previous research.

AB  - Trees and shrubs of green spaces can tolerate some physiological parameters. They can adapt to climatic conditions, hence, reduce air pollution and can be used as biological indicators in various researches. The present study aimed to explore the impact of urban air pollution on some parameters such as fresh, thy and turgor weight, amounts of chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments, and electrolyte leakage of 18 ornamental tree and shrub species in marginal and downtown parks of Rasht, Iran. The results revealed significant differences in turgor weight, photosynthetic pigments, and chlorophyll a/b ratio, but insignificant differences in electrolyte leakage between the marginal and downtown sites. The results indicated that all quantitative variables of the leaves differed significantly (p <= 0.01) among the species, except for fresh weight.

AB  - We compared the proliferation of neonatal and adult airway smooth muscle cells (ASMC) with no/moderate lung disease, in glucose-(energy production by glycolysis) or glucose-free medium (ATP production from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylations only), in response to 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and PDGF-AA. In the presence of glucose, cell counts were significantly greater in neonatal vs. adult ASMC. Similarly, neonatal ASMC DNA synthesis in 10% FCS and PDGF-AA, and [Ca2+]i responses in the presence of histamine were significantly enhanced vs. adults. In glucose-free medium, cell proliferation was preserved in neonatal cells, unlike in adult cells, with concomitant increased porin (an indicator of mitochondrial activity) protein expression. Compared to adults, stimulated neonatal human ASMC are in a rapid and robust proliferative phase and have the capacity to respond disproportionately under abnormal environmental conditions, through increased mitochondrial biogenesis and altered calcium homeostasis.

TI  - Development and Validation of PCR-RFLP Assay to Identify Three Japanese Brown Frogs of the True Frog Genus Rana
T2  - CURRENT HERPETOLOGY

KW  - CANCRIVORA
AB  - Two species of the true frog genus Rana (R. japonica and R. ornativentris) are widely distributed on the main islands of Japan with some degree of habitat overlap. These species could be key indicators for environmental conditions and accurate identification is important. However, morphological characters in early stages of development are often insufficient to distinguish the two species, although their presence is often inferred from egg masses. Therefore, we developed a PCR-RFLP protocol for efficient and cost-effective identification of the species. We used a short partial 16S rRNA fragment (approx. 550 bp) and two diagnostic restriction enzymes (Spe I and Hph I) to identify species from DNA material. This approach allowed us to accurately assign all samples even without locality data. We also confirmed the performance of our method using another brown frog, R. t. tagoi.

AB  - Echinoderms have long been considered to be one of the animal phyla that is strictly marine. However, there is growing evidence that some recent species may live in either brackish or hypersaline environments. Surprisingly, discoveries of fossil echinoderms in non-(open) marine paleoenvironments are lacking. In Wojkowice Quarry (Southern Poland), sediments of lowermost part of the Middle Triassic are exposed. In limestone layer with cellular structures and pseudomorphs after gypsum, two dense accumulations of articulated ophiuroids (Aspiduriella similis (Eck)) were documented. The sediments with ophiuroids were formed in environment of increased salinity waters as suggested by paleontological, sedimentological, petrographical and geochemical data. Discovery of Triassic hypersaline ophiuroids invalidates the paleontological assumption that fossil echinoderms are indicators of fully marine conditions. Thus caution needs to be taken when using fossil echinoderms in paleoenvironmental reconstructions.

AB  - The distribution of aquatic Heteroptera (Corixidae and Gerromorpha) in three backwater systems of the Austrian Alluvial Forest National Park differing in connectivity to the Danube River was examined at 44 locations between 1999 and 2003. The most common species were Aquarius paludum and Gerris lacustris (Gerridae).
   Various statistical analyses were used to define the relationship between species occurrence and 15 environmental variables and to test their influences on species distribution. Canonical correspondence analysis suggested that the main environmental gradients were the transitions from water surface richly covered with branches and Lemna and vegetated shoreline, which most species preferred, to open habitats with little shoreline vegetation, which only a few species preferred.
   This study shows the potential significance of heteropterans as indicator groups for paleopotamic conditions and aquatic habitats with strong terrestrialisation processes. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - The partitioning of some elements in sediments of two Baltic Sea basins (the Bothnian Sea and the Gotland Deep) was established by leaching experiments. Both partial (dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate) and "total" (HCl-KClO3) leach were used. Trace metals of both natural and anthropogenic sources (Co, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn) were evaluated for affinity to terrestrial material and to authigenic mineral elements (Fe, S). The results indicate that the easily leachable "mobile" fraction is not necessarily a good indicator for pollution. Longer stagnation periods result in intensive pyrite formation in the Gotland Deep which mask pollution trends. The permanent oxic conditions in the Bothnian Sea may affect a dissolution capability for selected elements. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To better understand how women respond to conditions of urban poverty in a developing country a sample of 85 women living in. Call, Colombia was studied. Anthropometric indicators of nutritional status were normal for the group. However, many women indicated that they did not always have sufficient money to purchase food, and described the strategies they used when financial resources were inadequate. These strategies included changes in meal composition, reductions in food portion size, and reductions in the number of meals eaten. Evidence of the use of these strategies was identified in 17.1% of all diet records (n = 509). The adequate nutritional status of this group of women suggests that their strategies were usually successful in maintaining adequate energy intake, but the frequent use of these strategies suggests that the women are potentially at risk for undernutrition.

AB  - The calculation of a species sensitivity distribution (SSD) is a commonly accepted approach to derive the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) of a substance in the context of environmental risk assessment. The SSD approach usually is data demanding and incorporates a large number of ecotoxicological values from different experimental studies. The probabilistic SSD (PSSD) approach is able to fully consider the variability between different exposure conditions and material types, which is of great importance when constructing an SSD for any chemical, especially for nanomaterials. The aim of our work was to further develop the PSSD approach by implementing methods to better consider the uncertainty and variability of the input data. We incorporated probabilistic elements to consider the uncertainty associated with uncertainty factors by using probability distributions instead of single values. The new PSSD method (named "PSSD+") computes 10 000 PSSDs based on a Monte Carlo routine. For each PSSD calculated, the hazardous concentration for 5% of species (HC5) was extracted to provide a PNEC distribution based on all data available and their associated uncertainty. The PSSD+ approach also includes the option to consider a species weighting according to a typically constituted biome. We applied this PSSD+ approach to a previously published data set on carbon nanotubes and silver nanoparticles. The evaluation of the uncertainty factor distributions and species weighting have shown that the proposed PSSD method is robust with respect to the calculation of the PNEC value. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the PSSD+ can handle both small and more comprehensive data sets because the PNEC distributions are a close representation of the data available. Finally, the sensitivity testing toward data set variations showed that the maximum variation of the mean PNEC was of a factor of about 2, so that the method is relatively insensitive to missing data points as long as the most sensitive species is included.

AB  - Sap flow is an important indicator reflecting water transport in a soil-plant-atmosphere continuum system. Therefore, identifying the effects of different factors on sap flow is imperative for understanding its physiological responses to environmental conditions and other associated ecological processes. However, conventional statistical methods have produced unsatisfactory results due to the complex and nonlinear relationship between sap flux density (vs) and its driving factors. This study illustrated the utility of the back-propagation (BP) neural network method for sap flow estimation and compared the performance of BP models with the multiple-linear regression (MLR) technique. Based on the measured sap flow of Pinus massoniana in the field, three-layer BP models trained by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm were developed with an architecture of 4-10-1, corresponding to four, ten and one nodes in the input, hidden and output layers, respectively. The BP models were trained and validated in the MATLAB environment with four different combinations of air temperature (T-a), relative humidity (RH), average net radiation (ANR) and the phenological index. High degrees of correlation were observed between the measured and simulated results by BP, and the coefficients of determination (R-2) and fitting accuracies (Acc) (greater than 0.9 and 80%, respectively) were higher than the corresponding values from the MLR (0.78 and 69%, respectively). Furthermore, the performance of the BP models could be greatly improved by including the phenological index and a time-lag effect, thereby suggesting that these two factors were crucial variables in modelling vs by BP approaches. The BP models were also tested with cross-validation method and 50% of the collected data that were not used in model development. We conclude that the BP model had a higher degree of accuracy in predicting sap flow due to its superior performance for complicated, nonlinear and uncertain processes, especially with inclusion of the phenological index and time-lag effect.

AB  - Acrylonitrile (ACN) spills in marine environment have the potential to cause ecological hazards and consequences, but currently little is known about the disruptive effects of ACN on marine organisms. In the present study, we investigated the lethal and sublethal effects of ACN on juvenile flounder Paralichthys olivaceus. The results showed that the 96-h LC50 of ACN to P. olivaceus juveniles was 6.07 mg/L. The fish were then exposed to different sublethal concentrations (0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/L) of ACN for 28 days and then transferred to clean seawater and keep in clean seawater for 14 days to simulate the conditions of a spill incident. Biomarkers (EROD, GST, SOD, AChE activity, and levels of LPO and DNA alkaline unwinding) were tested in liver and brain. The weight gain rates and specific growth rate of juvenile marine flounder exposed to ACN (>= 0.1 mg/L) for 28 days decreased significantly, indicating that ACN had an inhibitory effect on juvenile growth. Deformity of fish tails was observed on individuals exposed to the highest concentration (0.4 mg/L ACN) for 14 days, and the malformation rate was 38% after 28-day exposure. The present study provides the first evidence that ACN causes inhibition of AChE activity in fish brain. Furthermore, the results showed that ACN can significantly inhibit SOD activity and cause lipid peroxidation and DNA damage in fish brain. The results indicated that brain is more sensitive to ACN toxicity compared to liver and provides a suitable tissue for biomonitoring. The biomarkers measured during the depuration period showed that the effects caused by ACN were reversible when the exposure concentration was lower than 0.4 mg/L. These results highlight the adverse effects of ACN in brain of fish, which should be considered in environmental risk assessment. Biomarkers including AChE activity, LPO, and DNA damage of brain tissue should be included in fish bioassays for toxic effect assessment of ACN spills.

AB  - In invertebrate biomonitors of chemical pollution, emphasis has been generally given to mean accumulation patterns and how they reflect varying environmental levels of contamination. Infra-population variability, and how it relates with individual phenotypic traits, has received less attention. Here, a set of analytes including trace elements (B, Ba, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Li, Mn. Ni, Pb, Sr, V, and Zn), macroelements (C, Ca, K, Mg, N, Na), and carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-13) was measured in two populations of the crayfish Procambarus clarkii from Lake Trasimeno and Lake Bolsena (Central Italy). The influence of location, sex, body size, and condition factor was assessed; in addition, the analyte correlation profiles of the two populations were compared to verify their congruence. In general, significant inter-lake differences were observed in the concentration of both trace- and macroelements in crayfish tissues, generally mirroring the local chemistry of water and of benthic non-living matrices (sediment and plant detritus). Crayfish CN isotopic signatures excluded the occurrence of inter-lake variations in their omnivorous trophic habits. Correlation profiles varied considerably between the two populations in the nature and strength of bivariate relationships. However, Mantel tests and procrustean analyses indicated a general, significant congruence; C, N, and, to a lesser extent K. Li, Ni, Pb, and delta C-13 showed the highest procrustean residuals, suggesting that their associations with other analytes may be partially influenced by inter-population differences in growing phases. Our study indicates that the local geochemistry of the lacustrine environment influences the elemental fingerprint of Procambarus clarkii; the considerable inter- individual variability in the concentration of analytes, however, does not significantly reflect on their association, thus corroborating its effectiveness as an indicator species.

AB  - Chemosymbiotic bivalves harboring endosymbiotic, chemotrophic bacteria have been investigated from a variety of hydrocarbon seeps worldwide. It has been shown that carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur isotopic compositions of the animal soft body parts are excellent indicators for evaluating energy transfer and food sources for the respective deep-sea habitats. However, recognition of chemosymbiosis has proven to be difficult for bivalves that dwelled at ancient seeps due to the lack of soft tissue. Here, we investigated delta C-13, delta N-15, and delta S-34 signatures of the tissue (mantle) and the shell organic matrix (SOM) of the same specimens of three bathymodiolin mussel species with different chemotrophic symbionts (methanotrophs in Bathymodiolus platifrons and B. childressi and thiotrophs in B. aduloides) and one vesicomyid clam (Calyptogena sp.) from a variety of hydrocarbon seeps from the South China Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. The data obtained demonstrate that all seep bivalves regardless of species or locations reveal overall small differences in delta C-13 (<= + 4 parts per thousand), delta N-15 (<= + 1 parts per thousand), and delta S-34 (<= + 5 parts per thousand) values between SOM and mantle (Delta(SOM-mantle)) of the specimens. Relatively larger Delta(SOM-mantle) for d13C values (as high as + 10 parts per thousand)in B. platifrons and larger Delta(SOM-mantle) for delta S-34 values (up to 16 parts per thousand) in B. aduloides and Calyptogena sp. might be due to different symbionts in their gills. Since SOM can be extracted from fossil bivalve shells, the proxy can be used as a fingerprint of chemosynthesis-based food chains, although its utility will depend on the quality of preservation of the shell organic matter. Despite this uncertainty, the new proxy has great potential to reconstruct energy flow through different types of chemosynthesis-based ecosystems.

AB  - The effects of deicing salt on water ecosystems have been studied in the Sumava National Park and Protected Landscape Area. A pilot study was conducted in the Upper Vltava River basin, a habitat of the strictly protected pearl mussel. Dataloggers were used to investigate conductivity, often recommended as an important indicator of water quality.
   In this pilot project two pairs of dataloggers were installed in two streams crossed by the roads with different road maintenance regime. The first site was established in location, where deicing salt has not been allowed at all, but preliminary results of soil and vegetation monitoring indicated some impacts of deicing salts in this location. The records from dataloggers confirmed this, but conductivity was not so high at the second site. The second site was established on a priority road, permanently maintained by deicing salt. In this site, we often recorded conductivity higher than 75 mu S/cm, water quality limit for suitable habitats of the strictly protected pearl mussel. High conductivity may negatively affect viability of the population.
   From a methodological point of view, there are two main outputs of this pilot project. (1) We found that dataloggers can be frozen and out of records in shallow water during longer frost period. (2) We also confirmed hypotheses that not all ions are transported rapidly through the soil and groundwater. Conductivity was lower during winter and increased with snow melting. During vegetation season dataloggers recorded decrease of conductivity after heavy rains or longer rain period. Conductivity increased again in dry period.
   We conclude that the dataloggers improve our knowledge of impact of deicing salt in water ecosystems and offer relevant arguments for EIA in the area of high conservation value. Of course more statistical analyses are necessary; more detail information about annual differences in weather conditions and amount of deicing salt applied in different locations (not only a total amount of salt for a whole road) could help to interpret our data.

AB  - 1. Seabirds and pinnipeds are vulnerable to reductions in prey availability, especially during the breeding season when spatial constraints limit their adaptive capacity. There are growing concerns about the effects of fisheries on prey availability in regions where large commercial fisheries target forage fish.
   2. For breeding seabirds and pinnipeds, prey availability depends on a combination of abundance, accessibility, patchiness and distance from the colony. An understanding of the aspects of prey availability that determine foraging success is essential for the design of effective management responses.
   3. We used a mechanistic individual-based foraging model based on observed data for two sea-bird species, the Peruvian Booby Sula variegata and Guanay Cormorant Phalacrocorax bougainvilliorum, to simulate the foraging patterns of seabirds feeding on schooling fish. We ran the model over simulated prey fields representing eight possible combinations of high or low prey abundance, shallow or deep prey, and broadly distributed or spatially concentrated prey.
   4. The results highlight the importance of the accessibility of prey. Depth distribution was the primary factor determining modelled foraging success for both species, followed by abundance, and then spatial configuration.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The individual-based foraging model provides a spatially explicit framework for assessing the effects of fisheries on the foraging success of seabirds and other central place foragers, and for evaluating the potential effectiveness of marine-protected areas and other fisheries management strategies for safeguarding central place foragers in dynamic ecosystems. Our analysis indicates that broad-scale fisheries management strategies that maintain forage fish above critical biomass levels are essential, but may need to be supplemented by targeted actions, such as time-area closures, when environmental conditions lead to low prey abundance or reduce prey accessibility for seabirds or pinnipeds of conservation concern. The individual-based foraging model is adaptable and could be reconfigured for application to other species and systems.

AB  - Several dairy farms in the Netherlands aim at reducing environmental impacts by improving the internal nutrient cycle (INC) on their farm by optimizing the use of available on-farm resources. This study evaluates the environmental performance of selected INC farms in the Northern Friesian Woodlands in comparison to regular benchmark farms using a Life Cycle Assessment. Regular farms were selected on the basis of comparability in terms of milk production per farm and per hectare, soil type and drainage conditions. In addition, the environmental impacts of INC farming at landscape level were evaluated with the integrated modelling system INITIATOR, using spatially explicit input data on animal numbers, land use, agricultural management, meteorology and soil, assuming that all farms practised the principle of INC farming. Impact categories used at both farm and landscape levels were global warming potential, acidification potential and eutrophication potential. Additional farm level indicators were land occupation and non-renewable energy use, and furthermore all farm level indicators were also expressed per kg fat and protein corrected milk. Results showed that both on-farm and off-farm non-renewable energy use was significantly lower at INC farms as compared with regular farms. Although nearly all other environmental impacts were numerically lower, both on-farm and off-farm, differences were not statistically significant. Nitrogen losses to air and water decreased by on average 5 to 10% when INC farming would be implemented for the whole region. The impact of INC farming on the global warming potential and eutrophication potential was, however, almost negligible (<2%) at regional level. This was due to a negligible impact on the methane emissions and on the surplus and thereby on the soil accumulation and losses of phosphorus to water at INC farms, illustrating the focus of these farms on closing the nitrogen cycle.

AB  - Models of mass extinctions caused by greenhouse warming depend on the ability of warming to affect the oxygenation of the ocean, either through slowing circulation or changes in biological productivity and the organic carbon budget Opal Creek, Alberta, Canada is a biostratigraphically continuous Permian-Triassic Boundary (PTB) section deposited in deep water on an outer shelf setting in the vast and understudied Panthalassic Ocean, along the western margin of Pangaea. The latest-Permian extinction is here represented as the disappearance of the previously dominant benthic fauna (siliceous sponges). On the basis of nitrogen and reduced sulfur isotopes as well as productivity-sensitive trace elements, the Middle Permian at Opal Creek is interpreted as a highly productive coastal upwelling zone where vigorous denitrification and sulfate reduction occurred in a mid-water oxygen minimum. Similar conditions appear to have continued into the latest Permian until the onset of a euxinic episode represented by a discrete pyrite bed and several trace element indicators of high productivity. This euxinic pulse is followed by the extinction of benthic fauna and a shift in nitrogen and sulfur isotopes to more normal marine values, suggesting the cessation of coastal upwelling and the consequent weakening of the mid-water oxygen minimum. The Lower Triassic appears to be a dysoxic, relatively unproductive environment with a bottom water oxygen minimum. Rhenium-osmium isotope systematics show a minimum of radiogenic Os near the main extinction event, which may be due to volcanic input, and increasingly radiogenic values approaching the PTB, possibly due to increased continental erosion. The Opal Creek system demonstrates that, while the biogeochemical crisis in the latest Permian was capable of impacting the coastal upwelling modality of ocean circulation, a transient increase in productivity likely drove the system toward euxinia and, ultimately, extinction.

AB  - Rhizosphere is a microbiosphere with chemical, physical, and biological properties different from those of bulk soils. Knowledge of the changes in the microbial properties of plant rhizospheres is important in understanding the interactions between soil and plant communities. The present study aims to investigate the effect of bulk and rhizosphere soils on the microbial properties of eight croplands abandoned for 1, 3, 5, 10, 13, 15, 20, and 30 years and to evaluate the change in the rhizosphere soil microbial properties with time in the Loess Plateau, China. The results show that during the succession on the abandoned croplands, the pioneer species, Artemisia capillaries Thunb, was an important species in the 1- to 13-year sites, whereas the late species. Artemisia sacrorum Ledeb, emerged into the community after 13 years and became the dominant community species in 30 years. The species richness of the community exhibited an increasing trend during the first 15 years, and rapidly decreased thereafter. The organic carbon, total nitrogen, microbial biomass carbon, and microbial biomass nitrogen contents in the rhizosphere soil increased compared with those in bulk soil. Basal respiration and saccharase, alkaline phosphatase, catalase, and peroxidase activities were also enhanced, and the pH value decreased. Compared with the companion species, the dominant species showed higher organic carbon, total nitrogen, microbial biomass carbon, and microbial biomass nitrogen contents as well as enhanced respiration, but no significant difference in urease, catalase, alkaline phosphatase, and peroxidase activities was observed. As the succession proceeded, both A. capillaries and A. sacrorum showed increased microbial biomass carbon and microbial biomass nitrogen, and a decreased metabolic quotient. The soil enzymes of these two species behaved differently. Coverage and aboveground biomass of A. capillaries and A. sacrorum exhibited different relationships with microbial biomass and enzymes. In conclusion, the soil microbial activity in the rhizosphere is affected by plants, the soil condition, and the successional stage. Plant root exudates play an important role in the change in rhizosphere microbial properties. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Species richness of terrestrial ferns and fern allies (Pteridophyta) may indicate forest habitat quality, as analysed here for a tropical lowland area in Sumatra. A total of 51 standard 0.16 ha plots in primary forest, rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) agroforests and rubber plantations was compared for plot level diversity (average number of species per plot) and landscape level diversity (species-area curves). Average plot level species richness (I I species) was not significantly different amongst the three land use types. However at the landscape level the species-area curve for rubber agroforests (also called jungle rubber) had a significantly higher slope parameter than the curve for rubber plantations, indicating higher beta diversity in jungle rubber as compared to rubber plantations. Plot level species richness is thus not fully indicative of the (relative) richness of a land use type at the landscape scale because scaling relations differ between land use types. Terrestrial fern species can serve as indicators of disturbance or forest quality as many species show clear habitat differentiation with regard to light conditions and/or humidity. To assess forest habitat quality in rubber production systems as compared to primary forest, terrestrial pteridophyte species were grouped according to their ecological requirements into 'forest species' and 'non-forest species'. Species-area curves based on 'forest species' alone show that the understorey environment of jungle rubber supports intermediate numbers of 'forest species' and is much more forest-like than that of rubber plantations, but less than primary forest. Species richness alone, without a priori ecological knowledge of the species involved, did not provide this information. Jungle rubber systems can play a role in conservation of part of the primary rain forest species, especially in areas where the primary forest has already disappeared. In places where primary forest is gone, jungle rubber can conserve part of the primary forest species, but large areas of jungle rubber are needed. In places where primary forest is still present, priority should be given to conservation of remaining primary forest patches. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim Electronic distribution atlases and lists of ecological indicator values are becoming important tools in plant geography. In this contribution, we combine a geographical and an ecological data bank, and map out patterns of indicator value spectra ( instead of single or average values) across a physiographically complex landscape. For our study, we select indicators of soil pH and carbonate content as key environmental factors that strongly affect overall plant diversity patterns in the temperate zone. Our goal is to relate the distribution and diversity of plant groups that are indicators of soil pH and carbonate content to environmental controls at the landscape-scale, and thus contribute to a causal understanding of species pools.
   Location We studied the Bavarian Alps, which represent the German portion of the Northern Alps.
   Methods Based on the existing floristic survey, we calculated relative frequencies of nine classes of indicator plants for soil pH and carbonate content in grid cells. The resulting attribute matrix ( cells by indicator class frequencies) was subjected to principal components analysis and to k-means clustering. Results were compared and mapped out in the grid array of the whole region, resulting in continuous and discrete representations of species pool structure. We used a geographical information system to derive physiographical landscape properties from a geological map and a digital elevation model, and analysed their statistical relationship with the shapes of indicator spectra.
   Results and Main conclusions Averages of indicator values for soil pH and carbonate content follow the geological structure quite closely. Surprisingly, the diversity of indicator plant groups does not appear to be a function of geological or topographic heterogeneity. Rather, it seems to be related to areas of high elevation with uniform geology. The effect is a matter of additional acidophytes in high mountain areas and, in the high calcareous Alps, extreme calciphytes, while species with intermediate requirements are rarer than usual. For explanation, we suggest two facts: ( 1) a frequent lack of mature soils at high elevations and ( 2) particularities in soil genetic processes occurring under the harsh climatic conditions of high mountains.

AB  - Intestinal helminths of fish are of increasing interest as potential bioindicators for heavy metal contamination in aquatic habitats. Among these parasites cestodes and acanthocephalans in particular have an enormous heavy metal accumulation capacity exceeding that of established free living sentinels. Metal concentrations several thousand times higher in acanthocephalans than in host tissues were described from field and laboratory studies. Whereas larval stages inside their intermediate hosts are not able to take up high quantities of metals, young worms begin to take up metals immediately after infection of the final host. After four to five weeks of exposure, the parasites reach a steady-state concentration orders of magnitude higher than the ambient water level. Thus, acanthocephalans are not only very effective in taking up metals, but they can also respond very rapidly to changes in environmental exposure. The mechanism which enable acanthocephalans to take up metals from the intestinal lumen of the host appears to be based on the presence of bile acids, which form organo-metallic complexes that are easily absorbed by the worms due to their lipophilicity. Investigations of the environmental conditions affecting metal uptake have shown that the parasites are more consistent and reliable indicators for metal pollution than the host tissues as metal levels of the latter are much more dependent on the water chemistry. Thus, after some years of research on the uptake of metals by acanthocephalans and on the factors affecting metal accumulation in intestinal parasites it should be asked if acanthocephalans meet the criteria commonly accepted for sentinels. If parasites can be considered as promising sentinels, we need reasons for the establishment of 'new' indicators. Therefore, this review summarises the present knowledge about parasites as bioindicators and compares the accumulation properties of parasites and established free living indicators. Finally, this review presents possible answers to the question why it could be advantageous to have new and even more sensitive indicators for environmental monitoring purposes.

AB  - The standard pharmacopoeial steam sterilisation procedure, i.e. exposure to 121 degrees C for not less than 15 min, cannot be used for thermolabile solutions or for solutions in thermolabile containers (i.e. polyethylene containers).
   In these cases equivalent sterilisation processes (F-0 concept) which are mentioned in the non-mandatory section of the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. fur.) may be used for sterilisation of those solutions on the condition that a sufficient sterility assurance level (SAL) of 10(-6) or less is achieved. The respective text in the non-mandatory section of the British Pharmacopoeia (BP) states that a F-0 value of equal or above 8 applicable to every container in the steriliser load is considered satisfactory to achieve a SAL which complies with the requirements of the Ph. fur. The text of the BP states further that the application of the F-0 concept requires microbiological validation.
   As the F-0 concept is mostly applied to thermolabile solutions, the sterilisation temperature generally will be below 121 degrees C. The use of thermoresistant spores of Bacillus stearothermophilus for the microbiological validation as recommended in the Ph. fur. of such an equivalent sterilisation process seems to be problematic as full inactivation of these spores cannot be guaranteed. Nevertheless, according to BP 93, full inactivation of bioindicator spores is not required in case of validation. If the D-values of these spores at various temperatures and the corresponding microorganism-specific z-value are determined accurately this data can be used to calculate the proportion of test organisms surviving the exposure to the sterilisation procedure and related to the expected lethality of such a process.
   It was the objective of this study to prove that Bacillus stearothermophilus spores can be used as biological indicators in F-0-based sterilization cycles which operate at plateau temperatures < 121 degrees C in order to show the adequate and calculatable lethality of this procedure in accordance with the respective statements of the BP 93.

AB  - Efficient land-use management could be optimized through appropriate advice regarding land suitability and achieving a reasonable yield while preserving soil and environmental conditions. The main objective of this study was to determine and define those locations capable of wheat cultivation with irrigation in the municipality of N'goussa (Southern Algeria). Expert opinion (EO) method was used for selecting minimum soil data set (MDS-EO), where six influencing soil properties (sand, pH, salinity, organic matter, gypsum and lime) and other three key parameters (slope, land use/land cover, and proximity to roads and electricity network) were considered important for irrigated wheat cultivation in the study area. Indicators were weighted according to principal component analysis (PCA) loadings and summed. PCA revealed that the selected nine indicators are appropriate for accounting 73.63% of the total variance. Two maps of land suitability were created here (expressed as a soil quality index within a range from 0 to 1) from multivariate analysis and already known standard scoring functions (SSFs) by using two data sets (pure and scored). The distribution of soil quality index (IQI) showed that above 70% of the land was moderately (MS) to highly suitable (HS) for irrigated wheat. The estimation accuracy of soil quality classes has been evaluated using random forests (RF), having as a dependent variable the final class of land suitability used in each map. It was determined that estimation accuracy could reach 60% (pure data set) and 65% (scored data set) at 0.5 cut-off value for soil quality classes. Final prioritizing according to ranks of sensitivity index (SI) and efficiency ratio (ER) showed that IQI obtained from scored data set is the most suitable approach in soil quality assessment of arid areas. Therefore, it could be applied in southern Algeria for land management, integrated planning and environmental assessments.

AB  - Aim Biodiversity is a multi-dimensional property of biological communities that represents different information depending on how it is measured, but how dimensions relate to one another and under what conditions is not well understood. We explore how taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity can differ in scale-of-effect dependence and habitat-biodiversity relationships, and subsequently how spatial differences among biodiversity dimensions may arise. Location Nebraska, United States. Taxon Birds. Methods Across 2016 and 2017, we conducted 2,641 point counts at 781 sites. We modeled the occupancy of 141 species using Bayesian Bernoulli-Bernoulli hierarchical logistic regressions. We calculated species richness (SR), phylogenetic diversity (PD) and functional diversity (FD) for each site and year based on predicted occupancy, accounting for imperfect detection. Using Bayesian latent indicator scale selection and multivariate modeling, we quantified the spatial scales-of-effect that best explained the relationships between environmental characteristics and SR, PD and FD. Additionally, we decomposed the residual between-site and within-site biodiversity correlations using our repeated measures design. Results Although relationships between specific land cover types and SR, PD and FD were qualitatively similar, the spatial scales at which these variables were important in explaining biodiversity differed among dimensions. Between-site residual biodiversity correlations were negative, yet within-site biodiversity residual correlations were positive. Main conclusions Our results demonstrate how spatial differences among biodiversity dimensions may arise from biodiversity-specific scale-dependent habitat relationships, low shared environmental correlations and opposing residual correlations between dimensions, suggesting that single-scale and single-dimension analyses are not entirely appropriate for quantifying habitat-biodiversity relationships. After accounting for shared habitat relationships, we found positive within-site residual correlations between SR, PD and FD, suggesting that habitat change over time influenced all biodiversity dimensions similarly. However, negative between-site residual correlation among biodiversity dimensions may indicate trade-offs in achieving maximum biodiversity across multiple biodiversity dimensions at any given location.

AB  - Concern over declining populations of fish with drifting eggs due to the barrier effect caused by dam construction has led to intense interest in their conservation and management. As a major regulatory method, the studies on replenishing ecological flow through dam operation have mainly focused on the spawning period of fish with demersal or sticky eggs, and the potential impacts of this phenomenon on the reproduction of species with drifting eggs are not fully understood. With the establishment of an ecological model and status indicators, we quantified the barrier effect on spawning and hatching of the drifting-egg species, Coreius guichenoti, a dramatically declining endemic species in the Yalong River, China, and proposed that ecological base flow (EBF) closely links spawning and hatching opportunities to fish habitat demands. The results implied that the impacts differed across periods, with negative effects on fish spawning, while the most evident impacts occurred during hatching. The unsatisfactory hydraulic conditions during the hatching period were the drivers that limited local recruitment. Analysis of conservation strategies indicated that compared with regulating mainstream dams alone, the coordinated conservation of mainstream tributary dams caused a high positive change in fish resource supplementation. Reducing the water level of the downstream dam and cooperatively increasing the discharge of the tributary cascade when the upstream dam released EBF during the spawning (231.66 m(3)/s) and hatching periods (315.00 m(3)/s) were offered as management recommendations to reduce the barrier effect and preserve fish resources. Collectively, dammed mountain rivers offer a cautionary tale for developing nations with hydropower development intents, suggesting that while spawning habitat protection should remain an important component in fisheries management strategies, it will be crucial to link conservation with management strategies that encompass other early life stages.

AB  - Given the complexity of the correlation of economic growth with financial development, and their interactive impacts on environmental quality, this study attempted to present new insights into indecisive outcomes from the contribution of financial development in determining the impressionability of environmental indicators under economic growth conditions. Previous studies only employed a single environmental indicator for analyzing the correlation between economic factors and environmental quality. However, six environmental indicators are adopted in this study to evaluate environmental quality and to reach major goals of this research. To this end, using 2-stage system generalized technique of moment estimator, the association of economic growth, energy consumption, financial development, environmental indicators, and trade openness is determined in selected OPEC countries for years 2010 to 2019. Findings indicated that accompanied by the effects of economic growth on any EFI, ANS, PN, and EPI variables, the financial development enhances such effect. This is while, the financial development would weaken the economic growth effect on the ESI variable. Regarding EVI, no significant association was observed. Regarding to ESI, EPI, and PN, trade openness applies a significantly positive impact on environmental quality; on the other hand, it has positive role in environmental degradation based on EFI and ANS. This is while, according to the EVI variable, trade openness has not meaningful impact on environmental status. Finally, energy use has significant and positive effects on environmental degradation in each of environmental indicators. However, this variable has not shown significant impact on EPI and ANS. Alternatively, findings indicated that financial development can be considered an important and key variable in improvement of the environmental quality due to the moderating role it plays relative to the negative economic growth effect on the environmental quality. At the end of this paper, some limitations are presented, and some suggestions for further studies are provided as well.

AB  - The Hawkesbury-Nepean River (HNR) is the largest catchment in the Sydney region and is undergoing unprecedented population growth. The HNR system receives a mix of anthropogenic inputs such as treated sewage, stormwater and agricultural runoff. Combined, these can diminish the ecological system health and pose potential concerns to human health. Of particular concern are inputs of untreated sewage, that can occur due to a range of different reasons including illegal point source discharges, failure of the sewerage network, and overloading of wastewater treatment plants during storm events. Here, we present findings of an intensive assessment across the HNR catchment where we used a weight-of-evidence (WOE) approach to identify untreated sewage contamination in surface waters against the background of treated effluent and diffuse inputs during post high flow conditions. Total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were used to assess treated effluent and diffuse inputs, and microbial analysis, including both culture-based traditional methods for E. coli and enterococci and qPCR analysis of Bacteroides and Lachnospiraceae, were used to assess raw sewage contamination. Despite a background of diffuse inputs from recent high flow events and the influence of treated wastewater, we found no gradient of faecal contamination along the HNR system or its tributaries. We observed two sites with evidence of untreated sewage contamination, where the human markers Bacteroides and Lachnospiraceae qPCR copy numbers were high. The biological and chemical approaches suggested these latter two hotspots originate from an industrial runoff source and possibly from a dry weather sewage leak. Our findings demonstrate the potential of a WOE approach in the assessment of human faecal signal in an urban river that can also pinpoint small sources of contamination as a strategy that can reshape the way monitoring is performed and the chemical end-points chosen to provide pertinent information on the potential risks to aquatic system health.

AB  - Understanding the relationships between ecosystem services (ES) and their underlying socioecological drivers is essential for forming the efficient management decisions of ecosystems. We use a large watershed area as a case-study to analyze trade-offs/synergies and bundles of ESs and identify the associated socioecological variables (SEVs). This study assessed the supply of 7 ES indicators, namely, three provisioning services (crop production, livestock production, and industrial production), three regulating services (water conservation, soil conservation, and carbon sequestration), and one cultural service (recreation), across 65 municipalities in the Yellow River Basin (YRB) in China. We analyzed the paired trade-offs/synergies using Spearman's coefficient and identified the ES bundles (ESBs) by applying principal component analysis and K-means clustering. Subsequently, we detected the SEVs that affect the ES supply using the geo-detector model and characterized the associations between ESBs and socioecological clusters according to the spatial overlap. The results demonstrated that the synergies between ESs substantially exceeded the trade-offs, among which the strongest synergies were between the crop production and the livestock production, and both responded strongly to the cropland and the population density. Trade-offs were identified between provisioning services and soil conservation. Municipalities were grouped into three ESBs in the YRB. The ESB, which was dominated by provisioning ESs, was associated with areas where cropland, precipitation and socioeconomic conditions were all important, and the regulation of ESB was linked to regions with distinct ecological characteristics. We also identified an ESB that was dominated by carbon sequestration, as determined by extensive grassland and bare land. The land use/land cover strongly affected the characteristics of the ESBs. The findings can be used by land managers to identify areas in which ESs are dominant, to determine the associations of these compositions of the ESs with SEVs, and to support the formulation of optimal ES management in large-scale basins.

AB  - Raptors as top predators have been used as effective sentinels of environmental stressors in agricultural areas worldwide. Pollutants in agricultural areas have negative effects on top predator populations. Biomarkers such as erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities have been used as an effective measure of genotoxicity caused by exposure-particularly short-term exposure-to pollutants. We took blood samples from 54 wild specimens of American kestrel (Falco sparverius) captured in an agricultural area in Valle de Santo Domingo, Baja California Sur, Mexico in the autumns of 2018 and 2019 (n = 25) and the winters of 2019 and 2020 (n = 29). We prepared and examined blood smears to look for erythrocyte abnormalities as a means to evaluate genotoxicity. The number of abnormality types and the total frequency of abnormalities (MNs and NAs: notched, symmetrically or asymmetrically constricted, displaced, or indented nuclei) per 10,000 erythrocytes were calculated for all the specimens. We found a high frequency of abnormalities in numerous individuals, similar to those found in raptors from highly polluted areas. The best-fit generalized linear model for the number of abnormality types included season-of-the-year as the main significant predictor; the model for the total frequency of abnormalities included season and wing chord, an indicator of body size and health condition, as significant predictors. MNs frequencies were significantly related to season; NAs frequencies were related to season, wing chord length, and coverage of native vegetation around the area where the birds were captured. Abnormalities observed in the autumn closely coincide with the time when agrochemicals are applied in the area, mainly after the rains and during hot spells in late summer and early autumn. Small-sized kestrels showed higher frequencies of NAs, with an additional impact if native vegetation had been cleared for agriculture; this suggests both that resident birds are more exposed, and the observed genotoxicity has a local origin. These results, together with the ecological and physiological characteristics of the American kestrel suggest that this charismatic and widely distributed species might constitute a suitable biomonitor of genotoxicity in rural landscapes.

AB  - An important challenge for silvicultural practices is the conservation of tree diversity while fulfilling the traditional objectives of forest management, most notably timber harvesting. The purpose of this study was to compare the tree diversity before and after the application of silvicultural treatments in a temperate forest in northern Mexico. Fifteen experimental plots, each measuring 2500 m(2), were established to evaluate the immediate effect of four silvicultural treatments. These treatments were identified by their levels of management: intensive (clearcut, removal 100%), semi-intensive (removal of 59-61% of basal area), conservative (removal of 29-31% of basal area), and a control group. New forest guidelines, in contrast to conventional approaches, were applied to the semi-intensive and conservative treatments based on health and diversity conditions. Basal area, canopy cover, tree and total volume were measured in each plot. The Importance Value Index, alpha diversity, and evenness were estimated before and after treatments. Eighteen species belonging to five genera and five families were found in the study area. The species with the highest ecological values were Pinus durangensis, P. teocote, Quercus sideroxyla, and Quercus convallata with IVI numbers between 13.6 and 24.5%. Alpha diversity was intermediate (Margalef: 2.9 to 3.8), while dominance and evenness were above average compared to other studies (Simpson: 0.69 to 0.77; Shannon-Wiener: 1.44 to 1.6; Pielou: 0.76 to 0.85). The species evenness index in the conservative treatment was high (Sorensen, Jaccard, quantitative Sorensen and Morisita-Horn; 88 to 99%), although abundance decreased. Overall, there were no significant differences in IVI values and diversity indicators before and after treatments, with the exception of the clearcut treatment. When associating the diversity indices with stand variables, only the Pielou's evenness index showed a significant relationship between them. We concluded that both the conservative and semi-intensive treatments did not generate significant changes in tree diversity, but the former had slightly higher alpha diversity indices. These results can provide a better insight on silvicultural practices and their effects on species composition.

AB  - The Great Miami (GM) and Little Miami (LM) watersheds in Ohio are included in the 51 major river systems in the United States for long-term assessment of conditions of water quality under the USGS National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loadings have decreased over the years in the GM and LM basins, however, they still remain among the highest concentrations detected in the nation. The latest nutrient loading analysis from Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) showed slightly above period of record averages for N and P. Significant amounts of mobilized agricultural N and P from fertilizers in watersheds are transported to the Ohio River and other coastal marine systems such as the Gulf of Mexico, leading to increased growth of harmful algal blooms. In the GM and LM watersheds, changes in flood frequency and intensity are projected to occur in the future as heavy precipitation events are likely to increase as a result of climate change. As climate plays a role for nutrient transformation and transport, studies have shown that N and P inputs to surface waters from agriculture and other sources are projected to continue to increase over the next several decades. This paper reviewed the means of how the GM and LM watersheds are ecologically affected by the N and P nutrient pollution and how climate change impacts the quantity of N and P loadings that go into the river systems. Without better understanding of the nutrient loading processes and their association with various agricultural practices and interactions with climate, there could be additional threats to water quality in both the GM and LM watersheds in decades to come. This literature review has made references to many pertinent new publications that have become available in recent years, as well as to the classic literature.

AB  - Biogas has been considered as an alternative renewable energy, and raw biogas needs to be upgraded in order to be used as vehicle fuels or injected into the natural gas grid. In this work, the conceptual process for biogas upgrading using aqueous choline chloride (ChCl)/urea (1:2 on a molar basis) was developed, simulated and evaluated based on the commercialized software Aspen Plus. Reliable thermophysical properties and phase equilibria are prerequisite for carrying out process simulation. In order to carry out the process simulation, the thermophysical properties of ChCl/Urea (1:2) and its aqueous solutions as well as the phase equilibria of gas-ChCl/Urea (1:2), ChCl/Urea (1:2)-H2O and gas-ChCl/Urea (1:2)-H2O were surveyed and evaluated. After evaluation, the consistent experimental data of these thermophysical properties were fitted to the models embedded in Aspen Plus. The properties needed but without available experimental results were predicted theoretically. The Non-Random Two-Liquid model and the Redlich-Kwong equation (NRTL-RK) model were used to describe the phase equilibria. The equilibrium approach was used for process simulation. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the reasonable operating parameters. With a set of reasonable operating conditions, the effects of ChCl/Urea (1:2) content on the total energy utilization, the diameters and pressure drops of absorber and desorber as well as the environmental assessment of the process were studied. The simulation results showed that, with the addition of ChCl/Urea (1:2), the total energy utilization decreased by 16% compared to the process with pure water, and the diameters of both absorber and desorber decreased with increasing content of ChCl/Urea (1:2). The process using aqueous ChCl/Urea (1:2) was more environmentally benign than that with pure water. Therefore, aqueous ChCl/Urea (1:2) is a promising solvent for biogas upgrading.

AB  - Intertidal coastal environments are prone to changes induced by sea level rise, increases in storminess, temperature, and anthropogenic disturbances. It is unclear how changes in external drivers may affect the dynamics of low energy coastal environments because their response is non-linear, and characterized by many thresholds and discontinuities. As such, process-based modeling of the ecogeomorphic processes underlying the dynamics of these ecosystems is useful, not only to predict their change through time, but also to generate new hypotheses and research questions. Here, we used a three-point dynamic model to investigate how seagrass might affect the behavior of coupled marsh-tidal flat systems. The model directly incorporates ecogeomorphological feedbacks among wind waves, salt marsh vegetation, allochthonous sediment loading, seagrasses and sea level rise. The model was applied to examine potential behaviors of salt marsh systems in the Virginia coastal bays. Differences due to the presence or absence of seagrass and stochastic vs. constant drivers lead to the emergence of complex behaviors in the coupled salt marsh-tidal flat system. In intertidal areas without seagrass, small tidal flats are unlikely to expand and provide enough sediment to the salt marshes to combat sea level rise. However, as the tidal flat expands, the concurrent increase in sediment supply due to wave-induced processes allows for the salt marsh to maintain pace with sea level at the expense of salt marsh extent. The presence of seagrass has two effects: (1) it decreases near bed shear stresses thus reducing the sediment flux to the salt marsh platform; (2) it reduces the wave energy acting on the salt marsh scarp, thus reducing boundary erosion. Model results indicate that the reductions in wave power and near bed shear stresses when seagrass is present provide an overall stabilizing effect on the coupled marsh-tidal flat system; but as water depth increases due to sea level rise or as external sediment supply increases, light conditions decline and the system reverts to that of a bare tidal flat.

AB  - Mining provides inputs for other industrial sectors that are vital for sustaining population wellbeing and the functioning of global economies. At the same time, it can generate social and environmental impacts, which could compromise public acceptance of the sector. Given this twofold role in human society, the improvement of the sustainability performance is a very important objective both for industry and for the European policy, willing to boost a sustainable supply of raw materials.
   In various contexts, social impacts of mining are assessed with different sets of indicators and targets. In this study we perform a review of the associated literature, identify a list of typical social impacts occurring in the sector, and explore their geographical distribution. The list of identified impacts is compared against the indicators used for assessing and promoting sustainability in different contexts and at different scales: (i) the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), (ii) the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), (iii) the EU policy making through the analysis of the Better Regulation policy and three impact assessment reports, and (iv) the databases used in Social Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA).
   Land use-related impacts and environmental impacts affecting human health and human rights appear to be the most concerning social aspects in the mining sector. Benefits from income and employment are, instead, the main positive impacts identified in the screened literature.
   The paper compares the different indicator sets used in the above-mentioned frameworks with the list of impacts emerged from the literature review. Working conditions and human rights are well-covered aspects in the indicator lists. Main differences concern demographic changes and migration due to the presence of a mine and land use-related impacts, which are described in literature and partially covered in other schemes. A challenge for sustainability assessment is the evaluation of the mining sector's contribution to society, beyond the mere economic value added, and in general the assessment of positive impacts.

AB  - Taking into account biological nature of acute radical damage mass medulloblasts mortality conditioned of radiation induced toxic radicals attack, antitoxic and antiradical action of pectin and chitin containing medication we undertook current studies aimed at correction hematopoiesis of irradiated animals on the back of api-phyto protector based on pectin and chitin containing feed supplement application. Experiments were carried out on 90 white outbred rats with live weight of 180-210 g. divided into 4 groups: intact (1), irradiated(2), api-phytoextract + irradiation(3), irradiation + apy-phyto extract(4). The animals were exposed to single gamma irradiation on the hamma ray unit "Puma" at a dose of 8,0Gy. During 10 days before irradiation (the 3 group) and during 10 days after irradiation (the 4 group) animals were injected 10% apiphyto extract with water or feed at dose 5-7,5 ml/kg. The animals were dead with etherization and in the dynamic researched total number myelocytesin bone marrow of femoral bone. In cell smear of bone marrow, we counted percentage of certain myelocariocytes and absolute count of different generation cells. Peripheral blood morphological examination was conducted by means of standard methods. The results of the experiments showed that irradiation at a dose of 9,0Gy causes bone marrow cell devastation of rats in the first hours after irradiation, achieving minimal rate to the second day. So, total number of cells in bone marrow in 48 hours decreased by 87%. In a group of animals that were injected api-phyto extract 10 days before irradiation a total number ofbone marrow at the period of first reaction for irradiation exceeded this rate of irradiated control group by 33-41%. This regularity was illustrative for rates of peripheral blood leukocytes, erythrocytes, platelets; in similar percentage and anti radical defense of organism in general. Parallel biochemical studies of blood serum of irradiated on the back of acceptation of api-phyto extract animals illustrated that hemoprotective effect realized by neutralization and detoxication of toxic radicals-radiotoxins, causing interphase (apoptic) death of myelocariocytes of bone marrow.

AB  - This study analyses how indicators of water quality (thirteen physico-chemical variables) and drivers of change (i.e., monthly aggregated air temperature and streamflow, population density, and percentage of agricultural land use) coevolve in three large European river basins (i.e., Adige, Ebro, Sava) with different climatic, soil and water use conditions. Spearman rank correlation, Principal Component Analysis, and Mann-Kendall trend tests were applied to long-term time series of water quality data during the period 1990-2015 in order to investigate the relationships between water quality parameters and the main factors controlling them. Results show that air temperature, considered as a proxy of climatic change, has a significant impact, in particular in the Adige and Ebro: positive trends of water temperature and negative of dissolved oxygen are correlated with upward trends of air temperatures. The aquatic ecosystems of these rivers are, therefore, experiencing a reduction in oxygen, which may exacerbate in the future given the projected further increase in temperature. Furthermore, monthly streamflow has been shown to reduce in the Ebro, thereby reducing the beneficial effect of dilution, which appears evident from the observed upward patterns of chloride concentrations and electrical conductivity. Upward trends of chloride and biological oxygen demand in the Adige and Sava, and of phosphate in the Adige appears to be related to increasing human population density, whereas phosphates in the Sava and biological oxygen demand in the Ebro are highly correlated with agricultural land use, considered as a proxy of the impact of agricultural practises. The present study shows the complex relationships between drivers and observed changes in water quality parameters. Such analysis can represent, complementary to a deep knowledge of the investigated systems, a reliable tool for decision makers in river basin planning by providing an overview of the potential impacts on the aquatic ecosystem of the three basins.

AB  - The existence of strong potential synergies between the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the Habitats Directive (HD) is widely acknowledged. Indeed, ensuring favourable conservation conditions for aquatic habitats and species of conservation concern is closely related to the achievement of a good ecological status in water bodies. However, since these two sets of European laws are generally applied without any coordination, an inefficient use of resources may adversely affect their goals. The main negative outcome is an increase in the cost of monitoring programs for collecting data in nature (i.e., physical and chemical parameters, species and habitats, plant communities). The use of macrophytes as a bioindicator, as imposed by the WFD, may instead help to integrate data on aquatic EU habitats and enhance knowledge of such habitats outside the Natura 2000 network. The aim of present study was to evaluate the usefulness of data collected in WFD monitoring surveys as a means of inferring the occurrence and the distribution of lacustrine aquatic habitats in countries belonging to the European Union (EU). The main aim of the analysis was to identify the depth gradient distribution of diagnostic macrophyte taxa in two EU habitats (3140, i.e., Chara-dominated benthic communities, and 3150, i.e., natural eutrophic lakes) using data collected in lakes in Lombardy (northern Italy), some of which are included in the Natura 2000 network (10 out 16). While recognizing the limitations of the data collected within the two frameworks, the results confirmed the marked usefulness of WFD data as a means of enhancing the knowledge available on lacustrine aquatic habitats in the EU. WFD data can actively help to improve the basic information on aquatic habitats, thereby more effectively supporting regional strategies for biodiversity conservation as well as recovery programs.

AB  - AimsCliff communities tend to be compositionally simple but taxonomically diverse at the phylum/division level. As a result, they provide a setting for examining the responses of distinct phyla (e.g. Anthophyta, Bryophyta and lichens), species within these phyla and communities comprised of these phyla, to the same environmental gradients. Our aims were both descriptive and hypothesis-driven. We sought to identify major community shifts across water-substrate gradients in a poorly studied system (inland North American cliffs), while considering extant hypotheses concerning the relationships of organisms to environments at different taxonomic scales.
   LocationSub-alpine cliffs in northeastern Yellowstone National Park.
   MethodsCliff faces on two mountains were blocked at nine waterfalls. At each block, community composition was recorded from random samples obtained for three levels of water availability (xeric, mesic and hygric) on two substrates (limestone and andesite). Patterns of cover and richness were compared using Friedman's Rank F-tests. Community patterns were discerned using permutation MANOVAs, ordinations, and cluster analyses.
   ResultsPhyletic composition varied in response to water availability. In general, lichens dominated dry sites, while vascular plants dominated wet sites. Anthophyta was the most narrowly specialized phylum, and Bryophyta was the most generalized. Beta diversity was higher at drier sites, due to the dominance of the diverse lichen group. As a result, communities on lime and andesitic substrates were indistinguishable in hygric environments, but significantly different at drier sites. This may have occurred because, while water is limiting for neither substrate in hygric environments, andesites are more likely to absorb and store atmospheric water in drier environments. Indicator species analyses identified 27 distinct species distinguishing water and substrate conditions, or their interactions.
   ConclusionsOur experimental design uniquely accounted for extraneous variables in its examination of water and substrate effects on cliff communities. Water strongly controlled community composition both among and within phyla through both direct effects and interactions with substrate.

AB  - Presence and spatio-temporal habitat characterization of Dermatemys mawii (Testudines: Dermatemydidae) in the Grijalva-Usumacinta watershed, Tabasco, Mexico. The Central American River Turtle (Dermatemys mawii) is an endangered species that has been poorly studied. There are no reports on their population status, habitat condition, and the species distribution area is still unknown. This study analyzes the seasonal and spatial variations of their habitat and the presence/absence of D. mawii in three rivers within the Pantanos de Centla Biosphere Reserve (Tabasco, Mexico). For habitat characterization, natural segmentation of rivers was used and three sites per segment were identified. 9 in each rivers (Grijalva and Usumacinta) and 6 in Tabasquillo. Additionally. the evaluation of 11 environmental variables such as water hydrological, physicochemical characteristics and riparian and hydrophytic vegetation were carried out during two different seasons (dry and rainy). The presence/absence of species was assessed with eight fike nets that were set per segment, with a capture effort of 384 hours per trap. The capture per unit effort (CPUE) was used as an indicator of relative abundance. The results indicated spatio-temporal variations in habitat characteristics and the presence of environmental gradients. The principal components analysis (PCA) applied allowed us to determine that the first three components explained 67.8% of the environmental variability. The species presence was confirmed in all rivers, however significant differences exists in their relative abundance: the highest was registered in the Tabasquillo River where the species was present in both seasons and in all segments. Of the 11 environmental variables analyzed, the gradient, shelter and depth were the most indicative of species presence. The obtained results evidenced the importance of riparian vegetation as habitat for Dermatemys.

AB  - Assessing environmental impacts on coral reef communities has become a growing discipline. As most corals grow relatively slowly, the common method of monitoring changes in coral communities may limit our ability to identify stressors and stress responses. Since chlorophyll density (amount of chlorophyll a + c(2) per unit of coral surface area) in corals may correlate with coral color, the latter has been suggested as an indicator of the natural seasonal changes in undisturbed ("healthy") corals, as well as an indicator of environmentally-induced stresses in corals, including those related to bleaching. However, the color of underwater objects as perceived through the naked eye or a camera is affected by attenuation of irradiance with depth, changes in spectral properties of underwater light, turbidity and dissolved materials in the water, among other factors. Thus, methodological issues have so far held back the use of color as a quantitative indicator for chlorophyll content. Presented here are two accurate and easy to use methods for quantitative measurements of chlorophyll density from digital photographs of corals. In these methods, the intensities of the red, green and blue channels in digital photographs were compared to measured chlorophyll densities in Stylophora pistillata. Variations in external light, known to bias the true color in underwater images, were eliminated either by photographing corals through a specially built funnel with an internal light source or by mathematically normalizing color channels to a gray reference scale. In both methods, chlorophyll density was highly correlated with the intensity of the red channel, despite large variations in lighting conditions during the photography.
   These photographic methods enabled the estimation of natural spatial and temporal changes of the chlorophyll density of corals. By predicting chlorophyll density in corals at very low costs, both methods presented here could facilitate the study of large-scale physiological changes in corals. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ammonia is known to be an important toxicant in aquatic environments. Although ammonia toxicity has been well studied in many fish species, effects of chronic exposure on slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus), a critical biomonitoring species for northern aquatic habitats, are not well known. Further, with increasing mining development in Canada's north, this information is critical to better predict potential effects of mine effluent discharges on northern fish species. Slimy sculpin were exposed to six concentrations of unionized ammonia (NH3) relevant to concentrations found in northern mining effluents: control (0 ppm), 0.278 ppm, 0.556 ppm, 0.834 ppm, 1.112 ppm, and 1.668 ppm. An LC50 of 1.529 ppm was calculated from mortality data. Histopathological examination of gills indicated significant tissue damage, measured as lamellar fusion and epithelial lifting, at 0.834 ppm, 1.112 ppm, and 1.668 ppm. Using gill endpoints, NOEC and LOEC were calculated as 0.556 ppm and 0.834 ppm, respectively. An EC50 of 0.775 ppm was determined for lamellar fusion and an EC50 of 0.842 ppm for epithelial lifting. Hemorrhage of gills was present in mortalities, which occurred at 1.668 ppm of un-ionized ammonia. A significant decrease in liver somatic index (LSI) was seen in both male and female fish at 0.834 ppm and 1.112 ppm, respectively. Gonadosomatic index (GSI) in female fish significantly increased at 1.668 ppm un-ionized ammonia with an associated significant increase in total wholebody testosterone concentrations. GSI in male fish also significantly increased at 1,668 ppm but no differences were seen in testosterone concentrations. No significant differences were seen in gonad histopathological assessments or condition factor. Gill histopathology endpoints may be a more sensitive indicator for detecting effects in slimy sculpin exposed to ammonia than traditional chronic endpoints. Results from this study indicate that ammonia concentrations commonly reported in northern mine effluents hold potential to affect the health of slimy sculpin including acute, chronic, histological and endocrine endpoints.

AB  - Sustainability is a key concept in resource management and environmental issues, but implementation is fraught with difficulty due to lack of agreement as to what it means. Because of the ubiquity of disturbance, ecosystem sustainability inevitably involves change. We define stand-level biophysical sustainability as non-declining patterns of change over at least three cycles of disturbance, and landscape-level sustainability as a shifting mosaic of non-declining stand change, the overall character of which remains within acceptable limits over time. Simple empirical assessment (i.e., monitoring) of this concept of sustainability is generally not practical in forestry because of the long time and large spatial scales involved. Adaptive management (AM), another key resource management concept, involves monitoring to assess the consequences of management actions. It requires forecasts of expected change in sustainably managed, post-disturbance ecosystems against which to assess monitoring data. Without these forecasts, which constitute temporal fingerprints of sustainable change, short-term monitoring data cannot be used reliably as a basis from which to assess longer-term sustainability. A comprehensive monitoring system to address biophysical sustainability locally and at the landscape scale for a large management unit over a rotation-length time scale would involve the key elements of ecosystem structure and function and the effects thereon of management and climate change. This would be prohibitively expensive and demanding of human resources and the results would not be available until the end of the rotation. A strategy that honours the intent of AM is an intimate linkage between predictive monitoring and process-based ecosystem management decision support systems - ecosystem process-based monitoring - the emphasis of which is on temporal patterns of indicator change rather than comparisons between static indicators and audits of current ecosystem conditions (the certification approach). It involves a combination of monitoring and ecosystem management modeling that reduces the long-term cost of monitoring and increases the utility of the data collected for the assessment of, sustainability and for the design of policy and adaptive practice in forestry.

AB  - Aim The aims of this study are: (1) to explore the relationships between the Ellenberg indicator values (light, temperature and moisture) recently developed for two Mediterranean regions (Italy and Greece); and (2) to evaluate the possibility of using these values in other Mediterranean areas.
   Location Southern Greece and the Mediterranean part of Italy.
   Methods A global matrix containing 966 items of information (161 species x 3 indicator variables x 2 values assigned in each study, one in Italy and one in Greece) was constructed. A test of the accuracy of the values in predicting actual environmental conditions was provided using a detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) on published vegetation releves from the Mediterranean region. The gamma statistic was used to express relationships of ecological indicator values between the two regions, and pairs of indicator values calculated for each species were compared using Wilcoxon matched pairs tests.
   Results The results showed that indices developed for Greece and Italy were not similarly correlated to sample scores along DCA axis 1. Species' indicator values for Italy and for Greece were highly significantly correlated for light and moisture and significantly correlated for temperature, but the correlations were weak (0.20 <= gamma <= 0.31). Pairwise testing gave significantly different indicator values for the two regions. Discrepancies below or equal to 2 units on 9-point scales (12 points for moisture) were found for 88%, 70% and 54% of the species respectively for light, temperature and moisture indices. A substantial number of species showed higher discrepancies, from 3 up to 6 units.
   Main conclusions In the light of the present work, it seems clear that the indicator values developed for Italy and for Greece should not be used outside the region for which they were defined. This constitutes additional evidence that indicator values can be influenced by the identity of potential competitors. It also underlines the need to use standardized methods for calibrating indicator values against measured variables in such a way that indicator systems can serve as general reference systems.

AB  - Decomposition of organic matter integrates collective activities of organisms within the soil food web. We compared decomposition of museum board (predominantly cellulose) and balsa wood substrates in 18 sites chosen to represent a completely nested design with two disturbance levels nested within three ecosystems (agriculture, wetland, and forest) and ecosystems nested within three land resource regions (LRR) in North Carolina. Percentage mass remaining and daily rate of mass loss of museum board and balsa wood substrates were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of covariance with soil physical and chemical properties as covariates. At the end of the two-year monitoring period, the percentage of museum board and balsa wood substrates remaining was least in agricultural and wetland and greatest in forest ecosystems. Soil pH influenced the percentage of substrate remaining based on days of incubation, and its effects were greater than electrical conductivity, percentage soil organic matter, and total available soil nitrogen (N). Percentage of substrate remaining (museum board or balsa wood) was correlated negatively with pH for all sites, suggesting that pH should be included as a covariate if measures of decomposition are used as environmental indicators. Overall, rate of decomposition of museum board substrates distinguished between relative levels of disturbance in agricultural and wetland but not forest ecosystems. The rate of balsa wood decomposition distinguished between relative levels of disturbance in wetland but not forest or agricultural sites. Forest soils had consistently lower total N and electrical conductivity, and sometimes lower pH, associated with slower decomposition than disturbed wetlands or agricultural lands. We conclude that for short-term monitoring, measures of decomposition of predominantly cellulose substrates can be used to distinguish between relative levels of disturbance in agricultural and wetland but not forest systems. Differences in decomposition may signal either a change in decomposer community or condition of biotic and abiotic resources at a site. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorders are neurodevelopmental complex diseases with causative de-novo and inherited genetic factors. They include a range of cognitive and behavioral conditions such as pervasive developmental disorder, Asperger's syndrome, and autism. Cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay, as a cytogenetic study has been considered as one of the indicators of chromosomal damage in peripheral blood. This study aimed to investigate the frequency of micronucleus (MN) in peripheral blood lymphocytes of parents with autistic children. The study was case-control and the cases were parents of autistic children referring to the psychiatric department of the Ali-Asghar Hospital of Tehran. The total number of samples was 60 cases and 30 controls. The results showed that autistic children's parents had a significant increase in MN frequency in binucleated lymphocytes. Further researches are suggested to analyze the environmental and genetic reasons for MN increase in autistic children parents.

AB  - A novel heterogeneous solid base catalyst was prepared by loading of Ca-Al-graphite oxide with mixed potassium salts and applied in the transesterification of soybean oil with methanol to produce biodiesel. The catalysts were characterized by Hammett indicators, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, and transmission electron microscopy. The effects of the methanol-to-oil molar ratio, catalyst amount, reaction temperature, stirring rate, and reaction time were investigated to optimize the transesterification reaction conditions. Moreover, the prepared catalyst retains its activity after being used for four cycles. In particular, the solid base catalyst can be effectively and easily separated from the reaction system, which may provide significant benefits for the development of an environmentally benign and continuous process for preparing biodiesel.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to provide an alternative operationalization of amenities that does not privilege certain kinds of natural resources and climatic conditions and that can be used for assessing the quality of life in small towns. The amenity inventory presented here extends previous literature by including a broad range of amenities (natural resource, indoor and outdoor built recreational facilities, public and private services, and downtown amenities). The community level of analysis and small town focus are also unique. The inventory uses both secondary data from public sources and primary data that can be gathered by researchers or community residents. Therefore, in addition to the scholarly contribution of the inventory, the process of defining and assessing community amenities may be a valuable tool for building interpersonal relationships within communities, generating community spirit, and developing strategies for enhancing the local quality of life.

AB  - The decomposition reaction of the purple dye murexide in acidic media is used as a probe indicator for protons in nonionic microemulsions The reaction kinetics primarily rely on the proton concentration and permit assessment of the proton activity in the nonionic microemulsions of water/cyclohexane/Igepal and water/heptane/Igepal The experiments performed in the two microemulsions covered a wide range of water-to-oil mass fraction for the two systems The kinetic runs were monitored under pseudo-first order conditions by the stopped-flow technique The equilibrium constants for the formation of purpuric acid and the kinetic constants for the ensuing decomposition reaction fulfill a trend consistent with the micro compartmentalized nature of the multicomponent medium and support the use of murexide as an indicator of the proton activity in microemulsions (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved

AB  - As more utility markets are deregulated and competition is introduced, there is an increasing need to understand how the planning methods used under monopoly have to change to take the new deregulated environment into account. Although this might seem relatively trivial, it has been a major problem for a large number of utilities which have continued using the same planning approaches that they used when they were monopolies. In this paper, we first describe the environment which, under monopoly conditions, gave rise to the use of mainly operational research methods for planning. We then argue that deregulation has changed the fundamental assumptions, making the planning methods used under monopoly less useful after deregulation. Finally, we review a number of methods that utilities should consider using when they formulate strategy in deregulated markets. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soil erosion is a natural process often accelerated by several anthropogenic disturbances, such as uncontrolled land use, deforestation, and overgrazing. It is one of the most serious environmental problems of northern Algeria. In particular, the soil erosion affects a large part of the land in the north of the country, causing the siltation of dam reservoirs, reducing their storage capacity, and the degradation of cropland soil fertility. Our study aimed to determine the potential soil erosion and sediment yield in the Wadi Isser basin in northwest Algeria by integrating geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and a sediment delivery ratio (SDR). RUSLE is an empirical, parametric model tested and validated under diverse soil, climate, topographic parameters, management conditions, and a factor that accounts for the effects of soil conservation practices. The SDR represents the level of eroded soil transport in a basin and is an essential indicator for examining the relationship between basin erosion and river sediment yield. We categorized the potential soil erosion into different groups. Our results found that the potential soil erosion ranged from very low to extremely high in different sub-watersheds across the study area. The average annual soil loss in the Wadi Isser basin varied spatially from 0 to 150 t ha(-1) year(-1), and the average annual soil loss for the entire basin was estimated at 9.4 t ha(-1) year(-1). Based on the erosion estimates, the basin landscape was grouped into four different classes of erosion intensity: low, moderate, high, and very high. We found that approximately 80% of the area (i.e., 900 km(2)) of the Wadi Isser basin was identified as being affected by moderate to high erosion severity (> 5 t ha(-1) year(-1)), indicating that measures are urgently needed to control soil erosion and sediment losses.

AB  - Crop rotation is an ecologically crucial phenomenon for the sustainable development of plastic shed production systems, possibly affecting soil properties and microbiome structure. However, little is known about how soil microbial shifts in cropping system capacity could play a key role in agroecosystem functions under different soil environmental conditions. Here, we examined the high-throughput sequencing of soil microbial community structures and characterized key microbes or ecological functions under environmental changes after seven years of plastic shed cucumber planted soil. The results showed that coriander-cucumber (CC), non-heading Chinese cabbage-cucumber (NCCC), and spinach-cucumber (SC) rotation systems significantly impacted the succession of microbial community structure than fallow-cucumber (FC). In particular, NCCC rotation altered the beneficial soil microbial shift by promoting more antagonistic microbial abundance than leafy lettuce-cucumber (LLC) rotations or FC cropping. Both NCCC and CC rotations have affected mainly the pathways of energy metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism. Soil available nitrogen (N) and soil organic matter were the key factors in the succession of bacterial metabolic functions. Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and mycorrhizal taxa were significantly contributed to soil N-cycles (nitrification, nitrate reduction, and N-fixation). Acidobacteria and Ascomycota are potential candidates for hydrocarbon and aromatic compound degradations. The pH-dependent Bacteroidetes in NCCC1 group increased the function of metalloid metabolism and suggested as an indicator of arsenic (As)-rhizoremediation. The functional shift in the soil fungal community under NCCC2 and CC1 groups was primarily related to symbiotrophs, while available potassium and available phosphorus served as significant predictors of fungal functional guilds. The findings indicated that certain cropping systems are crucial for the sustainable development of plastic shed cucumber production by improving the potential capabilities of soil microbial communities to reduce the environmental risk of soil contaminants.

AB  - In weed biological control programs, the safety assessment of an agent currently relies on no-choice and choice feeding, development, and oviposition cage tests. However, confined conditions restrict insect behavior, potentially producing false positive host-use results that can prematurely disqualify agents, reducing opportunities for successful weed biocontrol. To minimize risks of nontarget attack and maximize successful biocontrol outcomes, it is useful to investigate an agent's pre-contact responses to olfactory cues from target and nontarget plant species during host-selection. Here, we tested how the locomotory behavior of the biocontrol agent Mogulones crucifer Pallas (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) differed when exposed to olfactory cues from its host, the invasive herbaceous Cynoglossum officinale L. (Boraginaceae), versus cues from closely related nontarget species. We used olfactometer behavioral assays, comparing M. crucifer responses to volatiles from C. officinale and nontarget plant species. We observed and measured the duration of resting and walking behaviors, as well as frequencies of arrestment or persisted resting, by M. crucifer in response to these odor sources. In total, 22 confamilial plant species were tested, including five species federally listed as threatened or endangered (T&E) in the USA. Mogulones crucifer consistently responded to C. officinale volatiles with greater duration of resting and frequencies of arrestment behavior compared to other plant species. In contrast, M. crucifer behavior was unaffected by odors of confamilials of C. officinale or responded with repellence to these odors in the olfactometer. These data suggest that in the invaded North American range, M. crucifer is unlikely to use nontarget olfactory cues to find or come into contact with tested nontarget plants, including the tested T&E species. Results from this study improve predictions of M. crucifer's host-use in the introduced range and illustrate the potential of this novel approach as a component of pre-release environmental safety assessments of weed biocontrol agents.

AB  - This study investigates the influence of upwelling induced seasonal hypoxia in the sediment-water interface on the distribution, bioavailability and geochemical partitioning of selected trace metals in surficial sediments along the southwest coast of India based on two successive cruises. The first cruise was during the southwest monsoon (SWM) season when coastal waters exhibited intermittent bottom hypoxia due to upwelling. The second cruise during the northeast monsoon (NEM) season was characterised by a uniformly warm and well-oxygenated water column in the study region. The results showed that grain size, organic carbon and Fe are the major factors influencing the distribution of trace metals in the surface sediments. Based on the geochemical indices (contamination factor, enrichment factor and geo-accumulation factor), the study region appears to be moderately contaminated by Ni, Cr, and Pb. Based on the ecological risk assessment criteria, the enrichment of Pb, Cr and Ni may cause adverse effects on the benthic organisms. The fractionation studies demonstrated that the major pathway of metal deposition in the sediment is lithogenic. The data also showed that labile and organic fractions are the second dominant forms, while other fractions (exchangeable and carbonate) are insignificant. The consistency in the reactive Fe concentrations during SWM and NEM could be due to the absence of Fe dissolution in sediments under mild reducing condition (intermittent hypoxia). In addition to the above, an enrichment of organic matter also leads to increased deposition of trace metals in sediments. Conversely, the secondary phase enrichment factor and risk assessment code calculated based on the metal fractionation data indicated low risk and contamination along the southwest coast of India except for Zn that showed moderate contamination in some transects. The study provides the need for regular geochemical assessment to control metal pollution in the coastal environment, which is a major resource of the fishery.

AB  - Studies show that just over 620 non-native naturalised plant species have been recorded within the Australian rangelands, some of which have a capacity to cause significant impacts on rangeland flora and grazing activity. Although Psilocaulon granulicaule (Haw.), Schwantes is listed as a highly invasive environmental weed species, there has been no previous research into its seed ecology. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the effects of temperature, light, pH, water stress, heat-shock, and salinity on the germination of P. granulicaule. In this study, four temperature regimes covering four different day and night temperature variations (17-7 degrees C, 25-15 degrees C, 30-25 degrees C and 40-30 degrees C) and two light regimes (12-h light-12-h dark, 24-h dark) were investigated. The effects of pH, water stress, heat-shock and salinity were investigated, using pH buffers, polyethylene glycol solutions, three heat shock events under four temperatures and a range of NaCl solutions. These tests were conducted under the identified optimum temperature range (25/15 degrees C) and light regime for seed germination. The results showed that both temperature and photoperiod significantly influenced the germination rate, with 94.2% germination in the 25-15 degrees C range under a 12-h light-12-h dark regime. Higher temperatures (30-40 degrees C) reduced seed germination to <58% germination in both light regimes (57.5%, 12-h light-12-h dark; 54.17%, 24-h dark). The highest germination rates were observed in low pH solutions, high moisture levels, low heat-shocks and low salinity. The study showed that this species is sensitive to environmental factors such as temperature, light, pH, moisture, heat shock and salinity, suggesting that these factors can be used as critical indicators to guide effective management practices to address this weed problem. Given that seeds are sensitive to radiant heat, burning could be used as a tool to effectively manage this species.

AB  - Globally, estuaries are ecologically important, but many are threatened by anthropogenic activities. Macrozoobenthos organisms are suitable ecological indicators in estuaries because they can detect the effects of stress and pollution. Spatial and temporal composition of macrozoobenthos communities were quantified and compared within and between the three estuaries (uMvoti, Thukela, and aMatikulu estuaries) in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, with different levels of human pressure in their catchments. Macrozoobenthos of each estuary was also related to its respective environmental variables. The aMatikulu estuary was selected as a reference site because of its relatively good ecological condition. Sampling dates represented low flow (August and September) and high flow (March and April) from 2014 to 2016. Macrozoobenthos abundance expressed as individuals per square meter (ind.m(-2)) was highest in aMatikulu estuary (39,167 ind.m(-2)), followed by Thukela estuary (29,299 ind.m(-2)) and then uMvoti estuary (10,336 ind.m(-2)). Within estuaries, number of taxa and abundance between years were significantly different (p < 0.05), and number of taxa and species diversity between estuaries were also significantly different (p < 0.05). Coarse and very coarse sand were the important environmental determinants in structuring the macrozoobenthos community in the uMvoti estuary, whereas turbidity and water temperature were the important determinants in structuring the macrozoobenthos community in the Thukela estuary. Very fine sand, mud, and salinity were among the most important environmental variables in structuring macrozoobenthos communities in the aMatikulu estuary. Environmental variables differed between estuaries; consequently, macrozoobenthos communities differed between these three systems. Outcomes of the present study indicated that macrozoobenthos communities respond to changes in environmental variables. Results of this study showed that different levels of human pressure in the catchments of these three estuaries could explain variation in their environmental variables. Such variation could increase differences in taxon composition and abundances between the three estuaries, although they are from the same geographical region with similar river-dominated functions.

AB  - In the present study, we choose the Weishan Lake, one of important water transfer and storage lakes on the eastern route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWD) in China, to clarify how the community structure and assemblage-environment relationships of macroinvertebrates varied across three typical habitats (the River Mouth, Canal and Lake regions) over the four seasons in 2012. A total of 72 taxa belonging to 3 phyla, 9 classes and 24 families were recorded, with tolerant oligochaetes and chironomids as the dominant taxa. The environmental conditions and macroinvertebrate assemblages were clearly separated at spatial and temporal scales. Assemblage structure showed both significant but larger spatial than seasonal variations, with a clear separation of sites from three regions in an ordination plot. Compared to the temporal scale, more indicator species were retained to be responsible for the regional differences according to the two-way cluster analysis. Different environmental variables were significant for distinguishing macroinvertebrate assemblages among four seasons, and among them, pH was the only variable which was retained in all models. Our study provided useful background information of environmental characteristics and macroinvertebrate communities in a typical water transfer and storage lake before the water transfer of the SNWD. After the operation of SNWD, we envisage inter-basin water transfer (IBWT), which is usually accompanied by water level rise, nutrient pattern change and biota succession, will seriously affect recipient basins. Therefore, we propose several management strategies for SNWD: (1) target and detailed data should be collected on a timely basis; (2) government should prevent water pollution and adopt effective measures to protect the water environment; (3) the environmental assessments and other aspects of IBWT planning should be coordinated; (4) an overall consideration of different basins should be given to achieve a greater range of water resources planning, scheduling, and allocation; and (5) the migration and invasion of species should be of concern during the operation of the project.

AB  - Periphyton plays an important role in lake ecosystems processes, especially at low and intermediate nutrient levels where periphyton contribution to primary production can be similar to or exceed that of phytoplankton. Knowledge of how periphyton responds to key drivers such as climate change and nutrient enrichment is, therefore, crucial. We conducted a series of mesocosm experiments over four seasons to elucidate the responses of periphyton communities to nutrient (low and high, TN-0.33 mg L-1 TP-7.1 mu g L-1 and TN-2.40 mg L-1 TP-165 mu g L-1, respectively), temperature (ambient, IPCC A2 scenario and A2 + 50%) and plant type (two submerged macrophytes with different morphological structural complexity: Potamogeton crispus and Elodea canadensis, and their corresponding plastic imitations with similar size and structure). We found a noticeable seasonality in the abundance and composition of periphyton. In spring and summer, periphyton abundances were significantly higher in the turbid-high-nutrient state than in the clear-low-nutrient state, and in summer they were notably higher at ambient temperature than in climate scenario A2 and A2 + 50%. In contrast, periphyton abundances in autumn and winter were not influenced by nutrient and temperature, but they were notably higher on plants with a more complex morphological structure than simple ones. The genus composition of periphyton was significantly affected by nutrient-temperature interactions in all seasons and by plant type in winter. Moreover, periphyton functional composition exhibited noticeable seasonal change and responded strongly to nutrient enrichment and temperature rise in spring, summer, and autumn. Our results suggest that the effect of warming on periphyton abundance and composition in the different seasons varied with nutrient state and host plant type in these mesocosms, and similar results may likely be found under field conditions.

AB  - Aquatic pollution with faecal bacteria and subsequent consumption of contaminated water or food is a worldwide issue that causes severe health effects (e.g. meningitis, salmonellosis, dysentery). In addition, the excessive use of antibiotics in animal husbandry and human medicine has enhanced the selective pressure on pathogenic bacteria, further increasing human health risks and detrimental effects on natural microbial communities. This urges the need to monitor faecal contamination using a time-integrated approach, as grab water samples can miss pathogen peaks. We tested the ability of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) to take up and depurate faecal indicator bacteria such as Escherichia coli and intestinal enterococci. Furthermore, we quantified the frequency of antibiotic resistant bacteria in water and mussels both in controlled laboratory tests and under in situ conditions downstream of a sewage treatment plant (STP). Laboratory results show that bacterial indicators in mussels were 132 times higher than their concentration in water, and that mussels retained bacteria up to 2 days after pulse exposure. Field results show decreasing bacterial concentrations in both water and mussels downstream the STP, with maximum E. coli concentrations ranging 173-9 cfu mL(-1) in water and 2970-330 cfu g(-1) in mussels. Similarly, enterococci ranged 59-4 cfu mL(-1) and 1450-240 cfu g(-1) in water and mussels, respectively. High proportions of antibiotic resistant E. coli were found in mussels (72%) and water (65%), and slightly lower proportion of resistant enterococci was found in mussels (47%) and in water (34%). Moreover, 33% of the bacteria isolated from mussels were resistant to multiple antibiotics, which emphasizes that resistance is a common feature in surface waters and highlights the need for safe water management. Our results show that zebra mussels provide an efficient, time-integrating tool for quantifying faecal indicators, including resistant and multidrug resistant bacteria. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Water quality deterioration caused by an enrichment in inorganic and organic matter due to anthropogenic inputs is one of the major local threats to coral reefs in Indonesia. However, even though bacteria are important mediators in coral reef ecosystems, little is known about the response of individual taxa and whole bacterial communities to these anthropogenic inputs. The present study is the first to investigate how bacterial community composition responds to small-scale changes in water quality in several coral reef habitats of the Spermonde Archipelago including the water column, particles, and back-reef sediments, on a densely populated and an uninhabited island. The main aims were to elucidate if (a) water quality indicators and organic matter concentrations differ between the uninhabited and the densely populated island of the archipelago, and (b) if there are differences in bacterial community composition in back-reef sediments and in the water column, which are associated with differences in water quality. Several key water quality parameters, such as inorganic nitrate and phosphate, chlorophyll a, and transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) were significantly higher at the inhabited than at the uninhabited island. Bacterial communities in sediments and particle-attached communities were significantly different between the two islands with bacterial taxa commonly associated with nutrient and organic matter-rich conditions occurring in higher proportions at the inhabited island. Within the individual reef habitats, variations in bacterial community composition between the islands were associated with differences in water quality. We also observed that copiotrophic, opportunistic bacterial taxa were enriched at the inhabited island with its higher chlorophyll a, dissolved organic carbon and TEP concentrations. Given the increasing strain on tropical coastal ecosystems, this study suggests that effluents from densely populated islands lacking sewage treatment can alter bacterial communities that may be important for coral reef ecosystem function.

AB  - The purpose for the research is to study the resilience of regional human population against environmental impacts based on evaluation of quality indicators of environmental living conditions and promotion of population's health on the one hand, and on population's mortality for a number of causes related to environmental degradation on the other hand. Indicators of environmental degradation may include expanding industrial production, energy consumption, population density, growing number of motor vehicles etc. The study is initiated by the trends of the second epidemiologic transition according to which diseases and causes of mortality are mostly attributable to endogenous factors related to natural ageing of a human body, its declining age-related vitality and resistance to adverse external impacts including environment. The novelty of the research lies in assessment of both population's resilience against this kind of impacts in regions with varied concentration of population and facilities used for economic purposes, and causes of morbidity and mortality from this type of impacts. The system approach used for the research helps both take into account the multicomponent influence of factors over a substantial period of time (a ten year period) and assess their cumulative impact on the sustainability of population's self-preservation behavior. According to the research results, highly industrialized regions strengthen the negative dynamics of working-age population mortality. The situation is different in less industrialized regions where the population is sufficiently adapted to environmental impacts. According to econometric estimates, causes of cancer mortality are closely correlated with respiratory diseases and indicators of environmental impact - environmental pollution with vehicle emissions (exhaust fumes). The research results can be used in justification and adoption of strategic solutions in creating "new quality" of life. The application of research results is focused on making decisions based not only on their interpretation, from the standpoint of improvement or deterioration of the regional situation, but also on the regional assessment of resilience of the human population to environmental impacts adversely affecting population's health.

AB  - In Europe, mainly the Mediterranean region, intensive use of fertilizers and pesticides has been recorded over the past 30 years, exceeding, in some cases, the limits of contamination authorized by the European Union. The intensive use of pollutants in fields near ecological coastal wetlands has led to implementation of pesticide monitoring programs to recover aquatic systems such as the Mondego estuary (Figueira da Foz, Portugal). According to information from the agricultural cooperatives of the Mondego valley, Primextra(R) Gold TZ is the most-used herbicide in corn crop fields. Biomarkers, such fatty acids (FAs), proved to be new and potentially powerful tools to detect, illustrate, and evaluate exposure to and the effects of contamination hazards. They play important roles in establishing neural levels in organisms' biochemical and physiological responses and are considered good bio-indicators of stress and potential indicators of ecosystem health. Bivalves are currently used in ecotoxicological bioassays because of their ecological importance, wide geographic distribution, ease of handling in the laboratory and in the field, and their ability to filter and ingest large volumes of water and sediment particles. Thus, the main goal of this work was to determine the toxic and biochemical (namely fatty acid profiles) responses of two size classes (small and big) of the two marine bivalve species Cerastoderma edule and Scrobicularia plane to the herbicide Primextra Gold. Furthermore, we aimed to compare the fatty acid contents, and thus the nutritive values, of both species and size classes collected in the field with those under laboratory conditions. Results show S. plana is more sensitive to the herbicide than C edule. In general, among the larger-sized specimens in the field, S. plum is more nutritive than C. edule, but among the smaller-sized specimens, the opposite tendency is seen, where C. edule presents a greater abundance of FAs.

AB  - Gelidium corneum (Hudson) J.V. Lamouroux is a very important primary producer in the Cantabrian coastal ecosystem. Some local declines in their populations have been recently detected in the Basque coast. Occurrences of yellowing and an unusual branch breakdown pattern have also been reported for some G. corneum populations. In order to gain further insight into those environmental stressors operating at a local scale, here we investigate if shallow subtidal populations of G. corneum living under potentially different conditions of irradiance (PAR and UVA) and water temperature exhibit differences in some biochemical indicators of stress, namely C:N, antioxidant activity (radical cation of 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate); ABTS(+) assay) and mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) (Asterine 330 and Palythine). We hypothesised that G. corneum subjected to higher ambient levels of irradiance and water temperature would show higher C:N ratios, lower antioxidant activity and higher MAA concentrations. Our results partially support this hypothesis. We found that G. corneum exposed to increased levels of irradiance (PAR, UVA) exhibited greater C:N ratios and lower antioxidant activity (higher IC50), whereas no relationship was found regarding MAAs. No differences in biochemical performance in relation to temperature were detected among G. corneum exposed to comparable high light. Similarly, G. corneum growing under lower UVA radiation levels showed no differences in any of the measured biochemical variables with regard to PAR and water temperature. These findings suggest that, among the environmental factors examined, UVA radiation may be an important driver in regulating the along-shore variation in G. corneum biochemical performance. Therefore, the role of irradiance, especially UV radiation, in potential future alterations in Cantabrian G. corneum populations cannot be ruled out as a potential underlying factor.

AB  - Linear disturbances associated with on-and off-road vehicle use on rangelands has increased dramatically throughout the world in recent decades. This increase is due to a variety of factors including increased availability of all-terrain vehicles, infrastructure development (oil, gas, renewable energy, and ex-urban), and recreational activities. In addition to the direct impacts of road development, the presence and use of roads may alter resilience of adjoining areas through indirect effects such as altered site hydrologic and eolian processes, invasive seed dispersal, and sediment transport. There are few standardized methods for assessing impacts of transportation-related land-use activities on soils and vegetation in arid and semi-arid rangelands. Interpreting Indicators of Rangeland Health (IIRH) is an internationally accepted qualitative assessment that is applied widely to rangelands. We tested the sensitivity of IIRH to impacts of roads, trails, and pipelines on adjacent lands by surveying plots at three distances from these linear disturbances. We performed tests at 16 randomly selected sites in each of three ecosystems (Northern High Plains, Colorado Plateau, and Chihuahuan Desert) for a total of 208 evaluation plots. We also evaluated the repeatability of IIRH when applied to road-related disturbance gradients. Finally, we tested extent of correlations between IIRH plot attribute departure classes and trends in a suite of quantitative indicators. Results indicated that the IIRH technique is sensitive to direct and indirect impacts of transportation activities with greater departure from reference condition near disturbances than far from disturbances. Trends in degradation of ecological processes detected with qualitative assessments were highly correlated with quantitative data. Qualitative and quantitative assessments employed in this study can be used to assess impacts of transportation features at the plot scale. Through integration with remote sensing technologies, these methods could also potentially be used to assess cumulative impacts of transportation networks at the landscape scale.

AB  - There is a long tradition of sustainable forest policy in Finland. Today, forests should be managed on the basis of the principles of sustainable forestry. However, economics have driven such forestry practices, resulting in dramatic changes to the natural structure and dynamics of Finnish forests. Commercial forests should, however, also provide habitats for various organisms, and forestry activities should not reduce forest biodiversity. Indicators can provide useful information on the ecological status and trends in sustainable forestry, such information can then be used by decision-makers. In attempts to develop accurate and reliable indicators, it has been suggested that statistical data, inventory data and data on many taxa may prove useful. The richness of game species and the abundance of the Siberian flying squirrel have been considered as candidate indicators for sustainable forestry. Indicators of sustainable forestry are commonly used separately and the interrelations between the ecological, economic and social dimensions of forestry have rarely been studied. In this paper we examine associations between the abundance of animal species (16 game species and Siberian flying squirrels) and their co-occurrence with forest structural characteristics that are considered to be indicators of sustainable forestry. We were also interested in examining regional patterns of the variables, and determining which socioeconomic indicators and land-use factors were associated (positively or negatively) with areas of forest for which there were indicators suggesting a good ecological condition. The study area consisted of 39 observation units. Based on our exploratory and descriptive analyses we suggest that using indices for different wildlife species groups and relative abundances of the Siberian flying squirrel together with forest structural characteristics and adequate socio-cultural variables could provide relevant information about trends in sustainable forestry. The application of indicators always depends on socio-cultural contexts and biogeographical factors, and these must be taken into consideration when making predictions or comparing different regions.

AB  - We present a chironomid-based reconstruction of late-Holocene temperature from Lake Anterne (2060 m a.s.l.) in the northern French Alps. Chironomid assemblages were studied in 49 samples along an g m long sediment core covering the last 1800 years. July air temperatures were inferred using an inference model based on the distribution of chironomid assemblages in 100 Swiss lakes. The transfer function has a leave-one-out cross-validated coefficient of determination (r(2)) of 0.88, a root mean square error of prediction 1.40 degrees C. Despite possible biases induced by methodological aspects and the ecological complexity of the chironomid response to both climate and environmental changes, the concordance of the Lake Anterne temperature reconstruction with other Alpine records suggests that the transfer function has successfully reconstructed past summer temperature during the last two millennia. The twentieth century is the only section of the record which shows a poor agreement with other climate reconstructions and the distinct warming found in most instrumental records for this period is not apparent in the Lake Anterne record. Stocking of the lake with fish from the early twentieth century onwards was found to be a possible cause of changes in the chironomid fauna and subsequent distortion in the inferred climate signal. Evidence was found of a cold phase at Lake Anterne between AD 400 and 680 a warm episode between AD 680 and 1350, and another cold phase between AD 1350 and 1900. These events were possibly correlated to the so-called 'Dark Age Cold Period' (DACP) the 'Mediaeval arm Period' (MWP) and the 'Little Ice Age' (LIA). The chironomid-based inference model reconstructed a July air temperature decrease of c. 0.7 degrees C for the DACP and 1.3 degrees C for the LIA compared with the temperature prevailing during the MWP.

AB  - The local environment of a functional molecule or nanoscale assembly has tremendous impact on it and thus can be used for functional control. In addition, the local environment is critical in the interface to the physical, chemical, and biological worlds beyond the assemblies that are the most common applications targeted. Functional measurements without local structural information lack key insight into both the details and the roles of the environment. This Account focuses on progress toward and challenges in the controlled assembly and measurements of functional nanostructures; in well-defined environments.
   The study of single precise supramolecular assemblies in well-defined environments offers unique insights into both interactions and function. By designing interactions between molecules and controlling assembly conditions, we can create and place atomically precise nanostructures. The tools to test the structures targeted and to measure the function of these assemblies are just now being developed and becoming available. Advances in this field have depended on gaining access to measurements at this scale. In particular, we recognize but do not yet understand the critical role of the chemical and physical environment of the assemblies. Likewise, we are just now realizing the important role that the substrates to which the assemblies are attached play in these processes. In order to develop a predictive understanding and the ability to design and to optimize functional assemblies, we must elucidate the physical, chemical, and electronic couplings among the molecules in the assemblies and with their substrates. With a suite of atomic- and molecular-resolution analytical tools, we are able both to ascertain whether the targeted structures have been formed and to measure their function. One of the keys to our ability to determine structure and measure function has been the development and application of methods for the automated acquisition, analysis, and associations of thousands or tens of thousands of single-molecule/particle/assembly structural, dynamic, spectroscopic, and functional data points.

AB  - Eutrophication in subtropical wetland ecosystems can lead to extensive displacements of vegetative communities and as a result changes in overall environmental conditions (loss of indigenous habitat, substrate quality, etc.). This has generated a demand for a set of sensitive indicator(s) that prelude these structural changes. The functional response of bacterial communities may indicate the effect and extent of the impact on the overall system. The effects of nutrient enrichment on the microbial community and its ecophysiology were measured in a subtropical marsh (Water Conservation Area 2a) in the northern Everglades, USA. We investigated the microbially mediated organic matter decomposition processes and nutrient cycling in three areas of the marsh, a nutrient enriched site, an intermediate site and a unimpacted (oligotrophic) site. We chose measures associated to the hydrolytic enzyme activities of alkaline phosphatase, P-glucosidase and aminopeptidase. We also monitored microbial biomass carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) and the associated elemental turnover rates (C, N and P). We found a significant (alpha = 0.05) spike in microbial biomass C, N, and P in the intermediate site. The elemental turnover rates (C, N and P) where significantly higher in the impacted and intermediate site when compared to the unimpacted site. The enzymatic profiles at the unimpacted site illustrate a system regulated for optimal use of P. In the intermediate zone between the overall P-limited and P-impacted areas, the nutrient inputs alleviates the stress imposed by the P-limitation. Microbial biomass increased dramatically without a decrease in the overall microbial metabolic efficiency. The metabolic coefficients (particularly q-Potentially Mineralizable P - qPMP and qCO(2)) indicated that after the disturbance, the impacted areas in the Everglades are characterized by relatively open, inefficient nutrient cycles. The nonlinear shifts (threshold behavior) in microbial parameters indicate that microbial indicators function effectively as early warning signals. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A model capable of quantifying the potential environmental impacts of agricultural application of composted or anaerobically digested source-separated organic municipal solid waste (MSW) is presented. In addition to the direct impacts, the model accounts for savings by avoiding the production and use of commercial fertilizers. The model is part of a larger model, Environmental Assessment of Solid Waste Systems and Technology (EASEWASTE), developed as a decision-support model, focusing On assessment of alternative waste management options. The environmental impacts of the land application of processed organic waste are quantified by emission coefficients referring to the composition of the processed waste and related to specific crop rotation as well as soil type. The model contains several default parameters based on literature data, field experiments and modelling by the agro-ecosystem model, Daisy. All data can be modified by the user allowing application of the model to other situations. A case study including four scenarios was performed to illustrate the Use of the model. One tonne of nitrogen in composted and anaerobically digested MSW was applied as fertilizer to loamy and sandy soil at a plant farm in western Denmark. Application of the processed organic waste mainly affected the environmental impact categories global warming (0.4-0.7 PE), acidification (-0.06 (saving)-1.6 PE), nutrient enrichment (-1.0 (saving)-3.1 PE), and toxicity. The main contributors to these categories were nitrous oxide formation (global warming), ammonia volatilization (acidification and nutrient enrichment), nitrate losses (nutrient enrichment and groundwater contamination), and heavy metal input to Soil (toxicity potentials). The local agricultural conditions as well as the composition of the processed MSW showed large influence on the environmental impacts. A range of benefits, mainly related to improved soil quality from long-term application of the processed organic waste, could not be generally quantified with respect to the chosen life cycle assessment impact categories and were therefore not included in the model. These effects should be considered in conjunction with the results of the life cycle assessment.

AB  - The experience of river scientists leads them to propose ecosystem variability as a central theme in management. The real challenge however lies in developing collective understanding, and integration, within and between scientists, citizens and management agencies. The prevailing view of scientists as experts who solve environmental problems is fallacious. A broad societal response, supported by humble public service agencies and scientists in the service of society, is more likely to succeed. This paper proposes a framework for structuring the science/management/society partnerships, and is based on experiences from managing rivers flowing through the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Scientists need to place between-discipline communication, constructive synthesis of their collective understanding and diffusion of this understanding into civil society, much higher on their collective agenda. Entering problem solving situations as co-learners, rather than experts, facilitates partnership building. Managers need to focus on: (1) preparing society to engage the knowledge, the problem and the solutions needed to achieve some collectively defined set of future conditions; (2) actively engage scientists in the development of technology for altering patterns of resource use and (3) undertake actions needed to achieve the desired future distribution of the costs and benefits of resource use in society. Managers have a very limited tool box with which to work, and modern society has largely transferred the risk of failure to them. Society therefore needs to accept more responsibility in these partnerships of co-operative decision-making. It should engage in them with a 'public good' ethic, a vision for a shared future, and an acceptance that resource and technological limits ultimately determine the distribution of costs and benefits of ecosystem services. Successful partnerships are based on adaptive management processes driven by consensus decision-making to ensure better distribution of knowledge, risks, humility and rewards in common property resource management. To achieve this we need to learn new ways to manage, while managing new ways to learn. Three models, social learning, learning communities and learning organizations, provide focus for learning.

AB  - Effects of periodic hypoxia (O2 < 2 mg l-1) on distribution of three demersal fish species, spot (Leiostomus xanthurus), hogchoker (Trinectes maculatus) and croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), and of two crustacean species, mantis shrimp (Squilla empusa) and blue crab (Callinectes sapidus), were investigated in the lower York River, Chesapeake Bay, USA.  Trawl collections were made in four depth strata (5 to 10, 10 to 14, 14 to 20 and > 20 m) during normoxia and hypoxia from 26 June to 20 October 1989.  Three periods with hypoxia in the bottom water (below 10 m depth) occurred in mid-July, early August and early September, each with a duration of 6 to 14 d.  The demersal fish and crustaceans studied were all affected by hypoxia, and a general migration from deeper to shallower water took place during July and August.  However, when oxygen conditions improved after a hypoxic event all species, except S. empusa, returned to the deeper areas.  The degree of vertical migration was related to levels of oxygen concentration and varied for the different species.  M. undulatus was the most sensitive species to low oxygen, followed by L. xanthurus and C. sapidus.  T. maculatus and S. empusa were more tolerant and survived in 14 to 25% oxygen saturation by increasing ventilation rate and, for S. empusa, by also increasing blood pigment (haemocyanin) concentration.  Periodic hypoxia driven by the spring-neap tidal cycle may represent a natural phenomenon with which the fishes and crustaceans are in a delicate balance.  Areas experiencing periodic short-lived hypoxia may be good nursery grounds for fisheries species, and there is no indication that the habitat value in the study area of lower York River is lessened.  However, if eutrophication lengthens the time of hypoxia or brings the system closer to anoxia the system may change and become characteristically stressed.  The migratory and physiological responses of these species to hypoxia are good indicators of the severity of oxygen stress and could be used as part of an early warning monitoring system for changes in environmental quality.

AB  - Machine-learning algorithms used for modelling olive-tree phenology generally and largely rely on temperature data. In this study, we developed a prediction model on the basis of climate data and geophysical information. Remote measurements of weather conditions, terrain slope, and surface spectral reflectance were considered for this purpose. The accuracy of the temperature data worsened when replacing weather-station measurements with remote-sensing records, though the addition of more complete environmental data resulted in an efficient prediction model of olive-tree phenology. Filtering and embedded feature-selection techniques were employed to analyze the impact of variables on olive-tree phenology prediction, facilitating the inclusion of measurable information in decision support frameworks for the sustainable management of olive-tree systems.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition affecting about 1 in 100 children and is currently incurable. ASD represents a challenge to traditional methods of assessment and diagnosis, and it has been suggested that direct measures of brain activity and connectivity between brain regions during demanding tasks represents a potential pathway to building more accurate models of underlying brain function and ASD. One of the key behavioural diagnostic indicators of ASD consists of sensory features (SF), often characterised by over- or under-reactivity to environmental stimuli. SF are associated with behavioural difficulties that impede social and education success in these children as well as anxiety and depression. This review examines the previous literature on the measurement of EEG connectivity and SF observed in individuals with ASD.
