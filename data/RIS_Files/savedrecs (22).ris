AB  - The Pantanal is the world's largest tropical wetland and a biodiversity hotspot, yet its response to Quaternary environmental change is unclear. To address this problem, sediment cores from shallow lakes connected to the Upper Paraguay River (PR) were analyzed and radiocarbon dated to track changes in sedimentary environments. Stratal relations, detrital particle size, multiple biogeochemical indicators, and sponge spicules suggest fluctuating lake-level lowstand conditions between similar to 11,000 and 5300 cal yr BP, punctuated by sporadic and in some cases erosive flood flows. A hiatus has been recorded from similar to 5300 to 2600 cal yr BP, spurred by confinement of the PR within its channel during an episode of profound regional drought. Sustained PR flooding caused a transgression after similar to 2600 cal yr BP, with lake-level highstand conditions appearing during the Little Ice Age. Holocene PR flood pulse dynamics are best explained by variability in effective precipitation, likely driven by insolation and tropical sea-surface temperature gradients. Our results provide novel support for hypotheses on: (1) stratigraphic discontinuity of floodplain sedimentary archives; (2) late Holocene methane flux from Southern Hemisphere wetlands; and (3) pre-colonial indigenous ceramics traditions in western Brazil.

AB  - Laser Doppler vibrometry enables the telemetry-free measurement of online turbomachinery blade vibration. Specifically, the Eulerian or fixed reference frame implementation of laser vibrometry provides a practical solution to the condition monitoring of rotating blades. The short data samples that are characteristic of this measurement approach do however negate the use of traditional frequency domain signal processing techniques. It is therefore necessary to employ techniques such as time domain analysis and non-harmonic Fourier analysis to obtain useful information from the blade vibration signatures. The latter analysis technique allows the calculation of phase angle trends which can be used as indicators of blade health deterioration, as has been shown in previous work for a single-blade rotor.
   This article presents the results from tests conducted on a five-blade axial-flow test rotor at different rotor speeds and measurement positions. With the aid of artificial neural networks, it is demonstrated that the parameters obtained from non-harmonic Fourier analysis and time domain signal processing on Eulerian laser Doppler vibrometry signals can successfully be used to identify and quantify blade damage from among healthy blades. It is also shown that the natural frequencies of individual blades can be approximated from the Eulerian signatures recorded during rotor run-up and run-down. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Water washing with a handheld hose was performed on beef surfaces to ascertain the most effective combination of methods needed to remove potentially harmful microorganisms. For these experiments, beef brisket surfaces were experimentally inoculated with a fecal slurry containing Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, Campylobacter coli, and Campylobacter jejuni. In a pilot study, surfaces were washed with cold water (15 degrees C) at various water pressures, spray distances, application times, and drip times, and remaining bacterial populations were determined following the enumeration and isolation of pathogens and naturally occurring hygiene indicators (mesophilic aerobic bacteria, coliforms, and E. coli). The most efficacious combinations of these washing conditions were applied subsequently to artificially contaminated beef brisket surfaces in conjunction with hot (77 degrees C), warm (54 degrees C), and additional cold (15 degrees C) water washes. in the cold water washing pilot study, combinations of physical washing conditions significantly reduced all bacterial populations (P < 0.05). Further studies clearly indicated the superior bactericidal effectiveness of hot water washing; E. coli 0157:H7 and Salmonella Typhimurium were reduced by 3.8 and 4.1 log CFU/cm(2), respectively. Overall, higher water temperature, longer application times, and shorter spray distances more effectively removed pathogens from inoculated beef surfaces. These findings will be used to formulate water washing recommendations for very small meat processing establishments.

AB  - CERES-Maize simulates kernel set as a source-limited process based on average plant growth rate during the lag phase after flowering. Yet the number of kernels formed by maize (Zea mays L.) also depends on timely interaction between male and female flowers, which can limit formation of reproductive sinks under some conditions. Failure to account for sink-limited kernel, set may contribute to simulation error observed under conditions that affect dynamics of pollen shed or silking, but do not alter crop growth rate. We developed algorithms for a Flowering Model to simulate sink-limited kernel set from flowering dynamics. This model was calibrated against kernel production in hybrid seed production fields and then linked to CERES-Maize. The Modified CERES-Maize was calibrated against two years of field data involving three hybrids, eight population densities, and seven N levels. Integrating the capacity to simulate sink-limited kernel set with source-limited kernel set increased simulation accuracy dramatically, relative to original CERES-Maize. For 13 commercial fields tested, Modified CERES-Maize decreased simulation error for kernels per plant from 17.1 to 2.3%, improved e between measured and simulated values from 0.77 to 0.87, and decreased simulation error indicators mean error, root mean square error, and mean square deviation by 85, 40, and 64%, respectively. Modified CERES-Maize accounts for a much greater range of variability in the biological processes controlling kernel set.

AB  - Fifty-two samples of virgin olive oil from various regions of Greece were examined for the presence and levels of chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments using normal phase liquid chromatography and spectrometry. Pheophytin alpha (Pheo alpha) was the main pigment in all the oils examined (> 10 mgkg(-1) in more than 70% of samples). Two pheophytin alpha derivatives (peaks A and B), eluted close to Pheo alpha may potentially be used to examine handling conditions and length of storage of oil until analysis. Analysis of 25 Greek commercial oils obtained from retail stares verified the above observations. Chlorophyll alpha may be present in a virgin olive oil just after production. Its absence should not be exclusively attributed to cultivar characteristics or extraction conditions, since pheophytinisation occurs rapidly. Lutein content varied between 0.2 and 3.9 mgkg(-1) and beta -carotene content from 0.4 to 5.1 mgkg(-1). The lutein/ beta -carotene ratio was characteristic (<1) for samples from Koroneiki, the major Greek cultivar for on production. The total Pheo <alpha> (Pheo alpha +peak A- peak B)/ total carotenoid (lutein+ beta -carotene) ratio ranged between 2 and 11 owing to prevailing green hues. This ratio may be used as an indicator of oil typicality along with other analytical parameters. (C) 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - A synthesis of intervals of rapid climatic change evident in the geological record reveals some of the Earth system processes and tipping points that could lead to similar events in the future.
   The geological record shows that abrupt changes in the Earth system can occur on timescales short enough to challenge the capacity of human societies to adapt to environmental pressures. In many cases, abrupt changes arise from slow changes in one component of the Earth system that eventually pass a critical threshold, or tipping point, after which impacts cascade through coupled climate-ecological-social systems. The chance of detecting abrupt changes and tipping points increases with the length of observations. The geological record provides the only long-term information we have on the conditions and processes that can drive physical, ecological and social systems into new states or organizational structures that may be irreversible within human time frames. Here, we use well-documented abrupt changes of the past 30 kyr to illustrate how their impacts cascade through the Earth system. We review useful indicators of upcoming abrupt changes, or early warning signals, and provide a perspective on the contributions of palaeoclimate science to the understanding of abrupt changes in the Earth system.

AB  - In this study, the mechanisms of environmentally relevant doses of Cu and Zn mixtures influencing lipid deposition and metabolism were investigated in freshwater teleost yellow catfish Pelteobagrus fulvidraco (2 months old, 4.95 (t0.01 g, mean +/- SEM). Our study indicated that waterborne Cu exposure increased lipid content, while Zn activated lipophagic flux and alleviated Cu-induced lipid accumulation. Yellow catfish hepatocytes treated with Zn or Zn + Cu activated autophagy-specific lipophagy, decreased lipid storage, and increased nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) release, suggesting a causal relationship between lipophagy and lipid droplet (LD) breakdown under Zn and Zn + Cu conditions. Our further investigation found that Beclin1 deacetylation by sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) was required for Zn- and Zn + Cu-induced lipophagy and lipolysis, and lysine residues 427 and 434 were key sites for Beclin1 deacetylation. Taken together, these findings show that the Zn-induced deacetylation of Beclin1 promotes lipophagy as an important pathway to alleviate Cu-induced lipid accumulation in fish, which reveals a previously unidentified mechanism for understanding the antagonistic effects of Cu and Zn on metabolism at their environmentally relevant concentrations. Our results highlight the importance of combined exposure when the biological effects of heavy metals are evaluated during environmental risk assessments.

AB  - Concentrations of heavy metals and trace elements in marine environments have increasingly become a problem for several ocean ecosystems, due to increments in pollution. Habitats daily exposed to extreme conditions, such as the intertidal rocky platforms and pools, are more vulnerable to pollution effects. In the coast of Punta del Hidalgo (Tenerife, Spain), we have located a water-treatment plant that could be pouring periodically pollutants to the near shore. We studied coverage and survival rates of the cirriped Chthamalus stellatus inhabiting the intertidal near the sewage pipe of the water plant of Punta del Hidalgo and in a control area in a proximate location. Concurrently, water samples from intertidal pools were obtained from both affected and control areas in order to corroborate the presence of pollutants, analyzing the concentrations of metals and trace elements. The results obtained clarified that the area near the underwater outfall presented higher percentage of coverage and mortality of C. stellatus than the control zone. The analysis of metal content in water samples also showed higher concentrations of metals for the affected area compared to the control one. We therefore propose the use of survival rates of populations of C. stellatus in the intertidal as bioindicators of metal pollution.

AB  - High-mountain areas provide excellent opportunities to study the effects of combined abiotic stresses on plant physiology given their variety of steep ecological gradients, low anthropogenic disturbance and remarkable levels of taxonomic diversity. Efficient photoprotective and antioxidant scavenging mechanisms are vital for survival in high-mountain plants, having its altitudinal and seasonal variations determined by environmental or ontogenetic factors such as the decrease in mean temperatures and water availability. A number of stress indicators have been described in order to rapidly assess plant fitness in high-mountain environments. For instance, carbon isotope (C-13) and proline content as drought and temperature stress indicators, because of their link to water-use efficiency and osmotic adjustment; photosynthetic pigments, related to phenology, nutrient status, light and temperature stress; and non-structural carbohydrate accumulation in response to mild or brief drought conditions. The present review unveils the wide research opportunities available for the study of adaptive responses in high-mountain plants via stress indicators, and calls attention to the substantial knowledge gap existing between alpine zones and other mountainous regions, such as Mediterranean high-mountains. The aim is to grant a more holistic understanding of the physiological mechanisms driving plant life in high altitudes and improve the predictions of the effects of changing environments in these species and across ecological scales.

AB  - The global consumption and production of pharmaceuticals is increasing concomitantly with concern regarding their environmental fate and effects. Active pharmaceutical ingredients are mainly released into the aquatic environment through wastewater effluent discharge. Once in the environment, pharmaceuticals can undergo processes of natural attenuation, i.e. dilution, sorption, transformation, depending on physico-chemical properties of the compound, such as water solubility, lipophilicity, vapour pressure, and environmental conditions, such as pH, temperature and ionic strength. A major natural attenuation process is the sorption on dissolved organic matter, colloids, suspended solids and sediments, which in turn control pharmaceuticals distribution, residence time and persistence in aquatic systems. Here we review studies of sorption capacity of natural sorbents to pharmaceuticals. These report on the importance of several environmental and sorbent-specific properties, such as the composition, quality, and amount of the sorbent, and the environmental pH, which determines the speciation of both the sorbent and compound. The importance of accounting for distribution processes on freshwater sorbents for any determination of environmental concentrations of pharmaceuticals is apparent, while the reliability of surrogate standards for measuring dissolved organic matter (DOM) distribution is evaluated in the context of the need for robust environmental risk assessment protocols.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is one of the most common and widespread heavy metals in the environment. Cd has adverse effects on photosynthesis that are countered by photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII); however, the protective responses of these photosystems to heavy metal stress remain unclear. Using the model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, a biological indicator that is widely used to assess the impact of environmental toxins, we simultaneously measured the effects of Cd on PSI and PSII and examined the levels of pigments in response to high light treatments before and after Cd exposure. Cd significantly reduced the quantum yield and electron transport rates of PSI and PSII. The quantum yield of non-photochemical energy dissipation in PSI due to donor side limitation increased faster than the quantum yield due to acceptor side limitation. The Cd treatment activated the P. tricornutum xanthophyll cycle under artificial light conditions, as indicated by an increased diatoxanthin content. Xanthophyll is important for photoprotection; therefore, the accumulation of diatoxanthin may down-regulate PSII activities to reduce oxidative damage. Together, our results suggest that the rapid reduction in PSII activities following Cd exposure is an adaptive response to heavy metal stress that reflects the variable exposure to external stressors in the native P. tricornutum environment.

AB  - Fertilisation practices are increasingly recognised as factors influencing the soil microbial communities, and they have a pivotal role in maintaining soil fertility and regulating ecosystem functions. Soil microbial communities react to different fertilisation practices and environmental conditions. It is known that vineyards harbour a specific set of microorganisms. The vineyard microbiome has been extensively investigated to decipher the associated microbial populations in soil, as well as the dynamics of microorganisms in grapes and the phyllo-sphere. Wine harbours a wide range of microorganisms originating from the belowground environment, many of which are recognised for their role in driving the grapevine quality. This study evaluates the long term-effect of two fertilisation practices (mineral, MD and organo-mineral, OMD) on the soil bacterial community in a nine-year-old vineyard. Sequencing was done on environmental DNA soil samples to amplify the hypervariable region V3-V4 of the 16S rRNA gene using an Illumina platform. The results provide information on the distribution of different bacterial groups in relation to fertilisation practices and temporal variability. Our work reveals that the assortment and distribution of microorganisms in agricultural systems depend on several factors, underlining the importance of fertilisation strategy in the overall management of soil quality and fertility.

AB  - Low-cost flight-based hyperspectral imaging systems have the potential to provide important information for ecosystem and environmental studies as well as aide in land management. To realize this potential, methods must be developed to provide large-area surface reflectance data allowing for temporal data sets at the mesoscale. This paper describes a bootstrap method of producing a large-area, radiometrically referenced hyperspectral data set using the Landsat surface reflectance (LaSRC) data product as a reference target. The bootstrap method uses standard hyperspectral processing techniques that are extended to remove uneven illumination conditions between flight passes, allowing for radiometrically self-consistent data after mosaicking. Through selective spectral and spatial resampling, LaSRC data are used as a radiometric reference target. Advantages of the bootstrap method include the need for minimal site access, no ancillary instrumentation, and automated data processing. Data from two hyperspectral flights over the same managed agricultural and unmanaged range land covering approximately 5.8 km(2) acquired on June 21, 2014 and June 24, 2015 are presented. Data from a flight over agricultural land collected on June 6, 2016 are compared with concurrently collected ground-based reflectance spectra as a means of validation.

AB  - Aesthetic value is an important factor that should be considered in lake environments. However, there is a lack of research examining and undertaking investigation of the aesthetic value of multifunctional lake ecosystems. There are two major purposes for this study: (1) to define and investigate the important perceived attributes related to the aesthetic value of multifunctional lakes using a video-questionnaire method and (2) to provide some suggestions for the further development of a visual quality index facilitating decision making in management and policies. An enhanced visual quality method was used in this study to record the conditions of the multifunctional lakes in each location in the study area. The findings of the study defined water color and clarity, percentage of water hyacinth, types of debris, percentage of debris, and facilities and land values as the important attributes related to aesthetic value in multifunctional lakes. In summary, the perceived attributes in the visual ecology criteria indicated more significant relationships with the functional morphology criteria than the financial profitability criteria. The results showed that the video-questionnaire method used in this study is efficient, easy to use, and understandable in terms of identifying and measuring aesthetic value in relation to perceptions of perceived attributes.

AB  - This contribution describes a novel process systems engineering framework that couples advanced control with sustainability evaluation for the optimization of process operations to minimize environmental impacts associated with products, materials and energy. The implemented control strategy combines a biologically-inspired method with optimal control concepts for finding more sustainable operating trajectories. The sustainability assessment of process operating points is carried out by using the U.S. EPA's Gauging Reaction Effectiveness for the ENvironmental Sustainability of Chemistries with a multi-Objective Process Evaluator (GREENSCOPE) tool that provides scores for the selected indicators in the economic, material efficiency, environmental and energy areas. The indicator scores describe process performance on a sustainability measurement scale, effectively determining which operating point is more sustainable if there are more than several steady states for one specific product manufacturing. Through comparisons between a representative benchmark and the optimal steady states obtained through the implementation of the proposed controller, a systematic decision can be made in terms of whether the implementation of the controller is moving the process towards a more sustainable operation. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is illustrated through a case study of a continuous fermentation process for fuel production, whose material and energy time variation models are characterized by multiple steady states and oscillatory conditions.

AB  - The Loess Plateau region of northwestern China has unique geological and dry/semi-dry climate characteristics. However, knowledge about ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) communities in the Loess Plateau is limited. In this study, we investigated EMF communities in Populus simonii and Pinus tabuliformis patches within the forest-steppe zone, in pine forests within the forest zone, and the transitional zone between them. We revealed high species richness (115 operational taxonomic units [OTUs]) of indigenous EMF resources at the Loess Plateau, of which Tomentella (35 OTUs), Inocybe (16), Sebacina (16), and Geopora (7) were the most OTU-rich lineages. EMF richness within the forest-steppe zone and the transitional zone was limited, while the natural pine forest maintained diverse EMF communities in the forest zone. The changes of EMF community richness and composition along arid eco-zones were highlighted for the complex factors including precipitation, soil factors, host, DBH, and altitude. Indicator analysis revealed that some EMF showed clear host preference and some taxa, i.e., genera Geopora and Inocybe, were dominant in drought and alkaline-saline conditions attributed to their environmental preference. This study revealed that EMF communities were quite limited in the forest-steppe zone, while the forest region contained diverse EMF communities in the Loess Plateau.

AB  - Reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a reliable technique for quantifying gene expression across various biological processes, of which requires a set of suited reference genes to normalize the expression data. Coleomegilla maculata (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), is one of the most extensively used biological control agents in the field to manage arthropod pest species. In this study, expression profiles of 16 housekeeping genes selected from C. maculata were cloned and investigated. The performance of these candidates as endogenous controls under specific experimental conditions was evaluated by dedicated algorithms, including geNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper, and Delta Ct method. In addition, RefFinder, a comprehensive platform integrating all the above-mentioned algorithms, ranked the overall stability of these candidate genes. As a result, various sets of suitable reference genes were recommended specifically for experiments involving different tissues, developmental stages, sex, and C. maculate larvae treated with dietary double stranded RNA. This study represents the critical first step to establish a standardized RT-qPCR protocol for the functional genomics research in a ladybeetle C. maculate. Furthermore, it lays the foundation for conducting ecological risk assessment of RNAi-based gene silencing biotechnologies on non-target organisms; in this case, a key predatory biological control agent.

AB  - National parks have mandates both to preserve and protect natural settings and to assist visitors in viewing and interacting with those settings. Considerable scholarship has examined the trade-offs between preservation and recreation goals, such as protection of a natural setting when some visitors want to experience it from noisy aircraft or ground vehicles. The current project expands on previous noise research that showed the presence of aircraft noise to be detrimental to aesthetic and affective environmental assessments. Participants rated 25 scenes under quiet conditions or while hearing 45 dB(A) or 60 dB(A) of either natural sounds (bird calls, breeze through foliage), natural sounds with aircraft sounds, natural Sounds with ground traffic sounds, or natural Sounds with human voices. Results indicated that the presence of any anthropogenic noise-air traffic, ground traffic, or voices-negatively impacted environmental assessments, and more so at louder levels, while the natural soundscape had little to no effect on assessments. Additionally, the presence of air traffic, ground traffic, and human voices significantly decreased participant ratings of serenity while also increasing ratings of hostility, These effects were strongest for scenes that were high in scenic beauty. Results are discussed in the context of sound quality management in national parks and other settings. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A sequential injection analysis (SIA) system was developed to on-line monitor the concentrations of trehalose in biological processes. The system is based on the enzymatic reaction of trehalose to glucose in an immobilized trehalase reactor and the subsequent reaction of glucose in the presence of glucose oxidase. The peroxide produced is detected using horseradish peroxidase with a redox indicator (ABTS, 2,2'-azino-di(3-ethylbezthiazoli-sulfonic acid-6)) and a spectrophotometer set at 435 nm. The SIA was fully automated using software written in the LabVIEW (TM) development environment. A number of system variables e.g. flow rate of the carrier buffer solution and volume ratio of sample to reagents, were evaluated to increase the sensitivity and performance of the SIA system. The performance of the trehalose-SIA system was linear under partially optimized operating conditions in the concentration range of 0.3 to 2.0 g/L (R-2 = 0.999) with a sample frequency of 6 1/h. The SIA system was successfully employed to on-line monitor the concentrations of trehalose in a continuously stirred tank reactor. The on-line monitored data were in good agreement with the off-line data measured by a HPLC with a refractive index detector (n = 14, R-2 = 0.9865). (c) KSBB

AB  - The ideas behind peatland restoration and the utility of testate amoebae in informing such schemes are briefly reviewed and discussed in the context of two lowland raised-mire sites in northwest England (Astley Moss, part of the Chat Moss complex in Greater Manchester, and Danes Moss, Cheshire). Our study indicates a high degree of correspondence between the sites in their response to major documented climatic deteriorations during the last five millennia. In particular, the c. 2300 BP event appears to correspond with greatly increased water-table fluctuation at both sites and pronounced declines in characteristic mire taxa of testate amoebae. These do not regain their former dominance save for a brief episode at c. 300 BP affecting both sites. Despite some restoration attempts at both sites, testate assemblages bear little resemblance to what might be considered a typical mire assemblage and do not appear to have done so with any degree of stability for c. 2500 years. This raises important issues regarding the practicability and suitability of such sites for large-scale restoration attempts and the range of conditions that can be considered natural for such sites; these questions should form the basis of future research.

AB  - Distributions of free and sulfur-bound biomarkers in organic-rich sediments from the lower and upper Keg River formation (Elk Point group, western Canada) reveal deposition of these sediments under reducing conditions, in agreement with the geological data. The predominance of aryl isoprenoids of Chlorobiaceae origin indicates that photic zone anoxia occurred during time of deposition. A series of novel aryl isoprenoids with a carboxylic acid function was identified by GC-MS and the structure of the predominant 3-methyl-5-(2',3',6'-trimethylphenyl)pentanoate was proven by synthesis of an authentic standard. The occurrence of these acids gives evidence that oxidative breakdown at least partially accounts for the diagenetic fate of aromatic carotenoids. Li/EtNH(2) desulfurization of two kerogen concentrates yielded only low amounts of sulfur-bound hydrocarbons, and suggests that either sulfur sequestration was not a predominant process or, more probably, that a major part of the hydrocarbons, initially sulfurized, were released upon maturation, giving further evidence that (poly)sulfide bonds are cleaved at relatively low levels of thermal stress.

AB  - Macroinvertebrate communities and environmental variables were assessed seasonally for I year in a temporary river in South Portugal receiving an effluent with high conductivity, pH, sulphates, nitrates and low oxygen content. The usefulness of the ordination method canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and the classification method cluster analysis (UPGMA) were examined to evaluate the perturbation, Macroinvertebrate samples were segregated along the first ordination axis by CCA, which in turn correlated with sulphates and nitrates. CCA produced a two-dimensional distribution of sites similar to the grouping formed by cluster analysis. In general, three or four groups were distinguished. Immediately downstream of the effluent discharge point, only taxa tolerant to law oxygen, high pH and high sulphate and nitrate concentrations were present. Further downstream, sites had a community similar to the reference sampling locations. During flowing conditions the CCA ordination axis I was also correlated with several classic measures of water quality (i.e. taxon richness, diversity and biotic indices). In other periods, only the percentage of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (%EPT) and the ratio EPT/(Chironomidae + EPT) were significantly correlated with CCA axis one. This suggests that ordination methods outperform benthic indices in detecting pollution during low flows and segregated polluted from clean/recovered sites in all periods.

AB  - The amount of nitrogen (N) deposition onto forests has globally increased and is expected to double by 2050, mostly because of fertilizer production and fossil fuel burning. Several studies have already investigated the effects of N depositions in forest soils, highlighting negative consequences on plant biodiversity and the associated biota. Nevertheless, the impact of N aerial inputs deposited directly on the tree canopy is still unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the influence of increased N deposition on the leaf-associated fungal and bacterial communities in a temperate forest dominated by Sessile oak [Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.]. The study area was located in the Monticolo forest (South Tyrol, Italy), where an ecosystem experiment simulating an increased N deposition has been established. The results highlighted that N deposition affected the fungal beta-diversity and bacterial alpha-diversity without affecting leaf total N and C contents. We found several indicator genera of both fertilized and natural conditions within bacteria and fungi, suggesting a highly specific response to altered N inputs. Moreover, we found an increase of symbiotrophic fungi in N-treated, samples which are commonly represented by lichen-forming mycobionts. Overall, our results indicated that N-deposition, by increasing the level of bioavailable nutrients in leaves, could directly influence the bacterial and fungal community diversity.

AB  - Metal pollution of fluvial systems remains a major problem and biomonitoring can be a useful tool for assessing the metal contamination. To assess their potential as new bioindicators of copper stress, we treated a field collected live periphytic diatom community (dominated by Amphora, Navicula, and Nitzschia) with dissolved Cu under optimal growth conditions. We studied the effects of Cu on five live-cell attributes: motility, protoplasmic content, lipid body number and biovolume, and frustule morphology. In all three genera, motility and protoplasmic content decreased, whereas the LB number, biovolume and deformity increased when Cu and exposure time increased. The sensitivity to Cu was highest for % MF, % CPC and % BCLB in Navicula and the LB number and deformity in Nitzschia. Amphora appeared to be more tolerant to Cu in comparison with other genera. The five cell attributes were inter-related. A heatmap showed that a recommended indicator for rapid screening of Cu toxicity was % BCLB for Amphora and % MF for Navicula and Nitzschia. % MF might be the most common representative indicator that can be applied to all three genera to evaluate the lethal effects of Cu stress if only one of the five cell attributes must be selected.

AB  - The issue of training of social workers in higher education is considered. The relevance of the research is caused by changes of socio-economic and technological nature, taking place in modern society, implying the training of specialists of higher level: "multifunctional," meeting international standards of training professionals to implement certain urgent tasks. Professionalization refers to the process of improving a person's knowledge, skills and abilities in the context of an activity that involves the presence of a certain subject represented in the culture of a given society, and ways of working with it. The authors rely on the indicators of the level of professional training offered by Yu. P. Povarenkov: professional effectiveness, professional identity and professional maturity. The novelty of the research lies in destinguishing three levels of "co-existence essence" of professional training of social professionals: adaptive-orientational, subject-effective and innovative-creative. The authors dwell on the position, according to which the student evolves as a subject of activity only in certain educational conditions: motivating environment of the educational institution as a factor contributing to the active development of new knowledge, skills and abilities; well-organized training and education aimed at increasing the effectiveness of students and teachers; tracking the dynamics of creative development of students, their improvement in personal and professional relationships.

AB  - In the last decade, it was found in Brazil an increase in the number of Payment for Environmental Services (PES) programs focused on quantitative and qualitative conservation of waters in the territories. Among the main demands for improvement of these programs, there is a need to proof the provided ecosystem services. It is in this context that the present research was developed to evaluate the directives of water quality monitoring in watershed covered by PES and to assess the applicability of these to the watershed of the Couves Stream in Sao Jose dos Campos, Sao Paulo. For this applied research, besides the bibliographical research on the subject, a historical research in the documents of the Municipal Secretary of Environment and a monthly analysis of the water quality data provided by municipal utility were performed. From the results, it was verified that, at present, the Couves Stream waters do not meet the limits of Class 1 for the parameter Escherichia coli. At its various stages, PES demands differentiated monitoring conditions in relation to the number of sampling points and the frequency of analysis. Finally, even understanding the characterization of all parameters that compose the Water Quality Index (WQI) as essential, this study showed a minimum set of indicators for assessing the increases of water quality in watersheds covered by PES.

AB  - Anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are causing ocean acidification (OA), which affects calcifying organisms. Recent studies have shown that Padina pavonica investigated along a natural pCO(2) gradient seems to acclimate to OA by reducing calcified structures and changing mineralogy from aragonite to calcium sulfate salts. The aim of the present study was to study the potential for acclimation of P. pavonica to OA along the same gradient and in aquaria under controlled conditions. P. pavonica was cross-transplanted for 1 week from a normal pH site (mean values of pH(Ts) 8.1 and pCO(2) = 391 mu atm) to a low pH site (mean values of pHTs 7.4 and pCO(2) = 1044 mu atm) and vice versa. Results showed that this calcifying alga did survive under acute environmental pH(Ts) changes but its calcification was significantly reduced. P. pavonica decalcified and changed mineralogy at pH(Ts) 7.4, but once brought back at pH(Ts) 8.1, it partially recovered the aragonite loss while preserving the calcium sulfate phases that formed under low pH(Ts). These results suggest that P. pavonica could be used as a bioindicator for monitoring OA as well as localized anthropogenic acidity fluctuations.

AB  - Ria de Aveiro is a mesotidal coastal lagoon with one of the largest continuous salt marshes in Europe. The objective of this work was to assess C, N and P stocks of Spartina maritima (low marsh pioneer halophyte) and Juncus maritimus (representative of mid-high marsh halophytes) combined with the contribution of Halimione portulacoides, Sarcocornia perennis, and Bolbochenous maritimus to the lagoon approximate to 4400 ha marsh area. A multivariate analysis (PCO), taking into account environmental variables and the annual biomass and nutrient dynamics, showed that there are no clear seasonal or spatial differences within low or mid-high marshes, but clearly separates J. maritimus and S. maritima marshes. Calculations of C, N and P stocks in the biomass of the five most representative halophytes plus the respective rhizosediment (25 cm depth), and taking into account their relative coverage, represents 252053 Mg C, 38100 Mg N and 7563 Mg P. Over 90% of the stocks are found within mid-high marshes. This work shows the importance of this lagoon's salt marshes on climate and nutrients regulation, and defines the current condition concerning the 'blue carbon' and nutrient stocks, as a basis for prospective future scenarios of salt marsh degradation or loss, namely under SLR context.

AB  - The production of bioenergy is dependent on the supply of biomass. Biomass production for bioenergy may cause large land use conversions, impact agricultural production, food prices, forest conservation, etc. The best solution is to use biomass that does not have agricultural or ecological value. Some of such unconventional sources of biomass are found within urban spaces. We employed Geographic Information System (GIS) and quantitative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodologies to identify and estimate bioenergy potential of green roofs and other bioenergy options within urban areas. Net Energy Gain (NEG) and Energy Return on Energy Invested (EROEI) were used as indicators to assess the bioenergy potential of urban spaces within the Overijssel province of the Netherlands as a case study. Data regarding suitable areas were geometrically extracted from available GIS datasets, and used to estimate the biomass/bioenergy potential of different species with different yields per hectare, growing under different environmental conditions. We found that potential net-energy gain from built-up areas can meet 0.6-7.7% of the 2030 renewable energy targets of the province without conflicting with socio-ecological concerns, while also improving human habitat.

AB  - Comprehensive assessment of ecological change after fires have burned forests and rangelands is important if we are to understand, predict and measure fire effects. We highlight the challenges in effective assessment of fire and burn severity in the field and using both remote sensing and simulation models. Wedraw on diverse recent research for guidance on assessing fire effects on vegetation and soil using field methods, remote sensing and models. We suggest that instead of collapsing many diverse, complex and interacting fire effects into a single severity index, the effects of fire should be directly measured and then integrated into severity index keys specifically designed for objective severity assessment. Using soil burn severity measures as examples, we highlight best practices for selecting imagery, designing an index, determining timing and deciding what to measure, emphasising continuous variables measureable in the field and from remote sensing. We also urge the development of a severity field assessment database and research to further our understanding of causal mechanisms linking fire and burn severity to conditions before and during fires to support improved models linking fire behaviour and severity and for forecasting effects of future fires.

AB  - Decisions often need to be made about the ecological status of regions based on limited or variable quantities of data. The United States Forest Service, for example, has developed a subwatershed condition classification approach to classify status of National Forest subwatersheds (level 6 hydrological units) based on a variety of indicators including biological indicators. For forests in Western Virginia, benthic macroinvertebrate data are commonly collected and used to estimate biological status. Available data varies in sample size from 1 to 20 samples per HUC. One approach to improve estimation of the biological status of a region using the biological indicator is to use a model based estimate. A hierarchical model is proposed to aid in estimating the status of regions based on a HUC level 6 classification. The hierarchical model involves components associated with regressors at both the subwatershed and sampling level, a model for the error that allows for extreme values and for a spatial component. The model based estimates have lower mean square error than the estimates using the mean and the model may be used to estimate the status as well as the associated uncertainty or variability. The distribution of the multimetric is used to predict the risk category associated with each subwatershed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban trees are frequently subjected to stress-causing environmental factors and cultural practices, requiring a permanent monitoring of their health condition. Stress detection in woody plants usually relies on a visual assessment of symptoms: inventories are mostly based on the parameters of the percentage of foliage reduction and leaf colour, both of which require a subjective interpretation. The main goal of this study was to detect whether the foliar chlorophyll (Chl) and nitrogen contents of linden trees, in an urban environment, can be useful and objective diagnostic indicators of the plant health and physiological performance, and whether it was possible to evaluate these data through a quick technique. Furthermore, as the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) community is a well-known bioindicator of the plant health status, its potential association with both variations in the Chl content and the different degrees of tree decline was verified. By determining the mathematical relationship between the instrument (SPAD-502) readings, the foliar Chl and nitrogen contents and the association with significant variations in the ECM community, the different stages of the visual symptoms of decline were accurately determined. This approach should help to integrate the methodology used for tree health inventories with new universal methods that do not entail individual interpretation.

AB  - Lernanthropus kroyeri (Copepoda, Siphonostomatoida: Lernanthropidae) is a gill parasite found on the European sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax. During a survey of sea bass of Corsican fish farms, we studied the biology of this parasite under culture conditions. We first chose to conduct a scanning electron microscopic study to give additional information about the lifestyle of the parasite. Our examinations made it possible to reveal some unreported superficial structures including details not described previously. Specializations associated with the tegument, in particular, sensory structures and anchoring systems were studied to understand the mechanisms of survival and dispersal of the species. Patterns variation of parasites communities was examined by taking into account environmental factors, such as temperature or salinity, and physiological parameters related to host. The relation between parasites and location of fish was also studied to quantify the importance of site influence on parasite communities. Prevalence and abundances of the infections in different culture systems, fish stocks, and sampling seasons are given. L. kroyeri was significantly present during spring and summer, coinciding with a period of increasing temperature. Significant differences were found grouping data by host size, with higher infection levels in the larger-sized fish.

AB  - Environmental flow (e-flow) release criteria are key parameters in water resources management and riverine ecosystem protection. The previous methods for e-flow criterion determination are based on the historical flow time series without the consideration of flow uncertainty. Due to low possibility of reoccurrence of the historical flows and the uncertainty of future flows, the flow uncertainty needs to be integrated in the process of determining e-flow release criteria. In this research, a new method is proposed to determine the optimal e-flow release criteria under flow uncertainty accounting for both the human and riverine ecosystem needs. In the new method, the scenario tree method is applied to generate the scenarios of flows, which can cover most of possible flow conditions and can effectively reflect the uncertainty of flows; the Range of Variability Approach (RVA), a most commonly used method to assess the flow regime alteration, is refined by incorporating the uncertainty of flows. The Tang River in Northern China is taken as a case study to test the effectiveness of the new method. The results show that the previous method obviously overestimates the optimal e-flow release criteria and the new method can get more suitable criteria that are suitable for both human and riverine ecosystems.

AB  - Ecosystem-based management (EBM) has emerged as a promising approach for maintaining the benefits humans want and need from the ocean, yet concrete approaches for implementing EBM remain scarce. A key challenge lies in the development of indicators that can provide useful information on ecosystem status and trends, and assess progress towards management goals. In this paper, we describe a generalized framework for the methodical and transparent selection of ecosystem indicators. We apply the framework to the second largest estuary in the United States - Puget Sound, Washington - where one of the most advanced EBM processes is currently underway. Rather than introduce a new method, this paper integrates a variety of familiar approaches into one step-by-step approach that will lead to more consistent and reliable reporting on ecosystem condition. Importantly, we demonstrate how a framework linking indicators to policy goals, as well as a clearly defined indicator evaluation and scoring process, can result in a portfolio of useful and complementary indicators based on the needs of different users (e. g., policy makers and scientists). Although the set of indicators described in this paper is specific to marine species and food webs, we provide a general approach that could be applied to any set of management objectives or ecological system.

AB  - Mind-wandering (MW) is among the most robust and permanent expressions of human conscious awareness, classically regarded by philosophers, clinicians, and scientists as a core element of an intact sense of self. Nevertheless, the scientific exploration of MW poses unique challenges; MW is by nature a spontaneous, off task, internal mental process which is often unaware and usually difficult to control, document or replicate. Consequently, there is a lack of accepted modus operandi for exploring MW in a laboratory setup, leading to a relatively small amount of studies regarding the neural basis of MW. In order to facilitate scientific examination of MW the current review categorizes recent literature into five suggested strategies. Each strategy represents a different methodology of MW research within functional neuroimaging paradigms. Particular attention is paid to resting-state brain activity and to the "default-mode" network. Since the default network is known to exert high activity levels during off-task conditions, it stands out as a compelling candidate for a neuro-biological account of mind-wandering, in itself a rest-based phenomenon. By summarizing the results within and across strategies we suggest further insights into the neural basis and adaptive value of MW, a truly intriguing and unique human experience.

AB  - Due to better wind conditions at sea, offshore wind farms have the advantage of higher electricity production compared to onshore and inland wind farms. In contrast, a greater material input, leading to increased energy consumptions and emissions during the production phase, is required to build offshore wind farms. These contrary effects are investigated for the first German offshore wind farm alpha ventus in the North Sea. In a life cycle assessment its environmental influence is compared to that of Germany's electricity mix.
   In comparison to the mix, alpha ventus had better indicators in nearly every investigated impact category. One kilowatt-hour electricity, generated by the wind farm, was burdened with 0.137 kWh Primary Energy-Equivalent and 32 g CO(2)-Equivalent, which represented only a small proportion of the accordant values for the mix. Furthermore, the offshore foundations as well as the submarine cable were the main energy intensive components. The energetic and greenhouse gas payback period was less than one year.
   Therefore, offshore wind power, even in deep water, is compatible with the switch to sustainable electricity production relying on renewable energies. Additional research, taking backup power plants as well as increasingly required energy storage systems into account, will allow further calculation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The impact of mussel farms on the benthic environment was investigated using free-living nematode assemblages as indicators of environmental condition of the Enseada do Brito, a shallow embayment in South Brazil. The studied area is located at the State of Santa Catarina, responsible for 90% of the production of mussel farmed in the country. Samplings were carried out quarterly, from July 2004 to May 2005, below mussel ropes and at control sites located 300 m apart from the longlines. The results suggested that the mussel culture changed ecological functioning of the benthic environment at studied coastal embayment. The intense organic loads due to the biodeposition of the mussel farms, which had been in production for more than 10 years, have turned fine and well-sorted sand bottoms into a muddy deposit with significantly higher total organic content than the control. The number of nematode genera, diversity, dominance and trophic diversity were significantly lower under the mussel farms than at the control sites. The mussel farms biodeposition had also affected the temporal variability of nematode assemblages, which was detected only for samples at the control sites. The low depth and environmental energy, together with the age of the farms, were probably responsible for the observed changes in the nematode assemblages.

AB  - Soil decomposition is mainly dependent on the nature and characteristics of organic matter within the soil, the environmental conditions and the activity of microorganisms and soil fauna. Isopods play an important role in decomposition through litter fragmentation and stimulating and/or ingesting fungi and bacteria.
   The aim of this study was to jointly evaluate the effect of different food types and the effect of heavy metal contamination of those foods through isopod feeding performance assays. These studies used the terrestrial isopod Porcellionides pruinosus. After feeding with different leaf types for the study on feeding performance, alder leaves were chosen for the contamination experiments. Feeding parameters like consumption, assimilation, egestion and growth ratios were calculated and compared among treatments and food type.
   Lower quality food decreased isopods performance. Exotic food types were shown to be less preferred than alder or oak leaves. Contaminated food also resulted in a decrease in performance among the feeding parameters studies, although isopods can tolerate in certain cases high amounts of heavy metals. For this reason it is possible that in future this crustacean can be used as bioindicators of soil contamination or in the evaluation of contaminated sites or remediation processes.

AB  - Thienemann's 1922 'biological lake' classification indicates the increase in the trophic level of lakes. It is based on the sucession of the disappearance of certain benthic indicator organisms in relation to the gradient of a decreasing O(2)concentration in the deep water, i.e. from O-2-sensitive Chironomidae spp. (non-biting midges) to the less sensitive Chaoboridae ( phantom midges) larvae. As early as the mid 1930s, several lakes in Brandenburg, e. g. Lake Scharmutzel, belonged to the last category of this classification. They were O-2-deficient in deep water during summer and lacked the Chironomidae larvae. Simultaneously, filamentous cyanobacteria (Oscillatoriales) appeared. This lead to the replacement of Thienemann's indicators, i.e. O-2 by H2S and Chironomidae by Oscillatoriales, and to Wundsch's 1940 new 'H2S-Oscillatoria-Lake' type. Since H2S and Oscillatoriales were not clearly identified as symptoms of eutrophication, it is not justified to use them to characterise a separate lake type. However, these indicators are of ecological importance, since the regional and common creeping increase in SO42- concentration favoures the current high H2S formation. The successive deterioration in O-2 conditions, the increase in the extent of H2S formation related to the decrease in species diversity clearly indicates that Lake Scharmutzel reached a qualitatively new state of eutrophication within 60 years.

AB  - For the purposes of conducting environmental assessments, it has been suggested that benthic size distributions could serve as complementary or alternative measures to traditional taxonomic descriptions, which are labour intensive and require much expertise. Consequently, temporal patterns of invertebrate and algal size distributions, along a trophic gradient from St. Lawrence River navigational buoys, were investigated in this study. It was observed that the size distributions were not significantly related to physical or chemical parameters of the river, although variability in the data may have been too high to detect trophic effects, as indicated by Monte Carlo simulations. Size spectra on buoys, despite the fact that protozoans were not accounted for, had striking similarities with other complete size distributions (containing algae, protozoans and invertebrates) from stream (Cattaneo, 1993; characteristic size distributions of integral bethnic communities. Can. J. Fish aq uat. Sci. 38: 1255-1263), lake (Cattaneo, 1987; Size distribution in periphyton Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 44: 2025-2028) and marine littoral zones (Schwinghammer, 1981; Size spectra of bethnic communities in Laurantian streams. Can J. Fish. aquat. Sci. 50: 2659-2666). This suggests that size distributions, determined over broad size ranges, are relatively robust to environmental conditions and may be of limited use in assessing ecological degradation.

AB  - Outdoor lighting is an important element in creating an evening and nocturnal image of urban spaces. Properly designed and constructed lighting installations provide residents with comfort and security. One way to improve the energy efficiency of road lighting installation is to replace the electromagnetic control gear (ECG) with electronic ballasts (EB). The main purpose of this article is to provide an in-depth comparative analysis of the energy efficiency and performance of HPS lamps with ECG and EB. It will compare their performance under sinusoidal and nonsinusoidal voltage supply conditions for the four most commonly used HPS lamps of 70 W, 100 W, 150 W, and 250 W. The number of luminaires supplied from one circuit was determined based on the value of permissible active power losses. With the use of the DIALux program, projects of road lighting installation were developed. On this basis, energy performance indicators, electricity consumption, electricity costs, and CO2 emissions were calculated for one-phase and three-phase installations. The obtained results indicate that an HPS lamp with EB is better than an HPS lamp with ECG in terms of energy quality, energy savings, and environmental impact. The results of this analysis are expected to assist in the choice of HPS lighting technology.

AB  - A potential industrial waste-waste co-treatment process was proposed and verified for the recovery of the valuable metals Co, Ni, and Cu from copper smelting slag by utilizing high temperature SO2 off-gas. Sulfation roasting followed by water leaching under designed thermodynamic conditions was conducted to facilitate the selective formation of Co, Ni, and Cu sulfates while separating iron as oxide. Several parameters were studied such as roasting temperature, roasting time, the addition of Na2SO4, and leaching agent. Under the optimized sulfation roasting conditions (Gas flow: 500 mL/min, 5% SO2 + 20% O-2 + 75% Ar; Roasting temperature: 650 degrees C; Roasting time: 4 h; Addition of Na2SO4: 30%) followed by water leaching (Leaching temperature: 80 degrees C; Leaching time: 5 h; solid to liquid ratio: 0.05 g/mL), the extraction yields of Ni, Co, and Cu were shown to reach 95.8% and 91.8%, 81.6%, respectively. Furthermore, the sulfation roasting - water leaching process was confirmed on lab-scale as a feasible and efficient way to recover valuable metals and the mechanism was determined and verified from the microstructural evolution. Finally, a potential environmentally friendly industrial process in terms of the energy flow and material flow was presented based on preliminary assessments for environmental benefits, economic benefits, and heat recovery.

AB  - Cell-printing technology for obtaining a cell-laden structure has been extensively used in tissue engineering applications due to its advantages over the conventional scaffold, which is not simultaneously fabricated with cells. To date, a realistic villi model using cell-laden bioink with both the biocompatibility and mechanical strength to achieve villus structure has not been developed. Here, we developed a human intestinal villi model with an innovative cell-printing process. The cell-laden villus structure was fabricated using a cell-laden collagen bioink cross-linked with a natural polyphenol (tannic acid). The fabricating condition was optimized and a Caco-2-laden collagen villus structure was fabricated. Using the processing conditions, a 3D collagen villus structure with appropriate geometry and a high initial cell-viability (over 90%) was obtained. In vitro cellular activities of the cell-laden villus structure demonstrated satisfactory cell viability with a growth-rate meaningfully higher than that in the fabricated villi structure cultured with the cell-seeding method (control). Moreover, expression of MUC17, junction marker (E-Cadherin), and alkaline phosphatase, as differentiation indicators of the epithelial cells, was significantly higher and earlier in the cell-laden structure compared to that in the control. These results indicate that the modified cell-printing process using collagen-bioink would be a highly efficient model mimicking the human intestinal epithelium.

AB  - Understanding phosphorus (P) availability and its control on eutrophication in the Chesapeake Bay is complicated by variable sources and biogeochemical reactions transforming P forms. We investigated seasonal and spatial variability in P limitation and biological utilization in the Bay using nutrient stoichiometry (of both dissolved and particulate forms), phosphate oxygen isotope ratios, and alkaline phosphatase activity at three sites along the salinity gradient. We demonstrate that particulate nutrient ratios can be used as indicators of nutrient limitation in the Bay and suggest strong seasonal and spatial variability in P availability: the surface water is P limiting in spring, but this condition is alleviated in summer and in the deeper waters. Variability in P limitation is well reflected in the trends of phosphate oxygen isotope composition (O-18(P)), with values approaching isotopic equilibrium under P limiting conditions, suggesting rapid biological P turnover. Furthermore O-18(P) values suggest multiple phosphate sources including remobilization of terrestrial inorganic P phases and remineralization of organic P and P from both sources is sufficiently cycled by microorganisms, suggested by the extensive equilibrium oxygen isotope exchange. Our results further suggest high P utilization in the deeper euphotic zone where nutrients are abundant, raising caution on studying nutrient availability and limitation only in the surface water.

AB  - A detailed study of the Duvanny Yar section in the Kolyma Lowland (Yakutia) provides the most extensive knowledge to date about late-Pleistocene soil formation processes and environments in the North East Siberian Arctic. Late-Quaternary palaeoenvironmental changes were reconstructed using paleopedological data and a range of palaeoecological bio-indicators (palynomorphs, plant macrofossils and insects). The frozen sediments representing marine isotope stage 3 (MIS-3), which encompasses the Karginsky interstadial, include profiles of four palaeosols of different ages. The oldest palaeosol is early Karginskian, and three overlying soil horizons represent a late-Karginskian pedocomplex. Palaeopedological data indicate a change of from synlithogenic soil formation processes to epigenic ones during these intervals. The intervening periods of synlithogenic pedogenesis were accompanied by active accumulation of eolian deposits. The Earlier Karginskian period of pedogenesis occurred in the absence of eolian sedimentation and when summer conditions were warm. The wide spectrum of peaty and peaty-gley soils observed in the late-Karginskian deposits developed under conditions of progressive cooling. The structure and content of fossil rodent burrows dated to approximately 30 000 yr BP from frozen late-Pleistocene deposits at Duvanny Yar indicate an arid and severe climate, a depth of active layer of 60-80 cm, and a wide distribution of disturbed habitats with pioneer and steppe vegetation.

AB  - A growing body of research on calcifying marine invertebrates suggests that ocean acidification will have deleterious effects on development and various physiological processes in these organisms. In laboratory experiments designed to mimic seawater chemistry in future oceans, we examined the effect of pH reduction, driven by the carbon dioxide (CO2) acidification of seawater, on larvae of the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens. Following development under CO2-acidified conditions, we measured 2 indicators of physiological response to low pH in 4 stages of larval development: (1) tolerance of acute thermal challenges and (2) quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction-determined expression of 2 genes involved in shell formation (engrailed and ap24). The results showed that low pH (pH 7.87 vs. pH 8.05 for control treatments) had a significant effect and decreased larval thermal tolerance for some developmental stages (pretorsion and late veliger), but not for others (posttorsion and premetamorphic veligers). In contrast to the thermal tolerance data, decreased pH did not affect the expression pattern of the 2 shell formation genes in any of the abalone larval stages. The results indicate larval stages were differentially sensitive to low pH conditions and this variability may play into the resilience of individual species to withstand environmental change in the longer term.

AB  - The sources of variation (environment, genotype and date of measurement) of spectral reflectance indices describing biomass and its physiological status, and their potential use for providing accurate and non-destructive estimates of crop phenology and yield, were studied on canopies of several collections of durum wheat genotypes showing adaptation to different Mediterranean environments. Spectral reflectance was measured during grain filling. All spectral indices and grain yields showed significant differences between contrasting environments in terms of water availability. Photosynthetic area indices and senescence indices were good indicators, for all genotype collections, of biomass and phenology, respectively, when comparing a wetter site with a drier site. When crop development was accelerated by growing plants under high temperature, provided by a spring-sown trial under Mediterranean conditions, all spectral indices showed significant variation within a period of one week through grain filling, reflecting the changes in crop phenology and the onset of senescence. The reported changes in the values, and even the signs, of the correlation coefficients across genotypes between grain yield and some reflectance indices might reflect genotypic differences in response (by avoidance) to high temperature and drought during late grain filling. Spectral reflectance data may help to understand phenological characteristics of durum wheat canopies, such as crop duration, provided the date of measurement is well chosen.

AB  - Hematocrits and total plasma proteins were determined at 24 days old for 86 female and 85 male nestling American kestrels (Falco sparverius) from the wild in northern Saskatchewan. No sex differences were detected in either hematocrit or plasma protein. For females, hematocrit and plasma protein were not related to time of sampling, temperature at sampling, mass of nestlings or length of the tenth primary flight feather. In males, hematocrit correlated only with the length of tenth primary. For both sexes, concentrations of plasma protein declined as the season progressed. Differences in brood size, natural and experimental, did not affect hematocrit or plasma protein levels. Of six nestlings that died before leaving the nest, three showed depressed hematocrit values compared with those that successfully left the nest, whereas none showed significant deviations in plasma protein levels. For 42 birds, we took a second blood sample 2-5 days after the first. Changes in brood parameters of males between these sampling periods were not related to changes in weight, growth of tenth primary or changes in temperature. Among females, there were trends for changes in weight to be correlated with changes in both hematocrit and plasma protein. Our results suggest that hematocrits and plasma proteins of nestling kestrels are not robust indicators of nutritional status and condition. (C) 1991 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - One important reason for limited progress in selecting corn (Zea mays L.) with superior cold tolerance during germination and early growth is the unpredictable occurrence of cold, wet test springs.  Breeders need an efficient laboratory test paralleling field emergence under such climatic conditions.  Laboratory screening data from 30 corn hybrids with under 2400 corn heat unit ratings were compared to field emergence data in Atlantic Canada to evaluate the usefulness of a laboratory test as an indicator of cold tolerance.  Hybrids were ranked by mean percent emergence using 1985-1989 field data collected from seven locations in the Atlantic region.  From daily observations on seed germinated in a germinator at 11-degrees-C, mean times to 50% root and coleoptile initiation, and 1-cm coleoptile were calculated using probit analyses.  Field emergence ranked from 1 (highest percent) to 30 was compared to ranking of time to 50% 1-cm coleoptile in the laboratory (one represented most rapid growth).  Of the top 15 hybrids (by 1-cm coleoptile), 11 fell in the top half of the hybrids ranked by field emergence.  Removal of hybrids with low numbers of field observations, all made during the unusually warm spring of 1989, improved the comparison.  These results indicate that time to 50% production of a 1-cm coleoptile is a useful screening parameter to select corn hybrids with superior cold tolerance during germination and early growth.

AB  - Climate change is continuing to impact the social-ecological systems of polar regions. Climate models project substantial warming above the global average and high rates of environmental change in polar regions, but local impacts remain uncertain. These rapid alterations will affect biophysical, economic, and sociocultural conditions. This research aims to uncover early climate change indicators through climate model projections and individuals' perceptions by focusing on a sample of 39 municipalities north of the Arctic Circle in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and northwestern Russia. The study employs an exploratory sequential approach by combining representations of climate model projections in a geographic information system (GIS) with qualitative analysis from semi-structured interviews with local officials involved in planning decisions for each municipality. And, second, the study combined perceptions of early climate change indicators and their subsequent challenges and opportunities with regional climate projections. Results indicate an overall geographic 'match' between climate model projections and perceptions, but differences between north-to-south, coast-to-interior, and national perspectives are notable. Some of these differences point to the roles of nationally, regionally, and locally embedded geographies, producing a multitude of lived experiences. The implications of this study are relevant to global communities experiencing varying climate change risk perception from coastal-versus-interior regions.

AB  - The integration of ecosystem service (ES) knowledge into decision-making processes is increasingly endorsed by various policies and initiatives, with spatial planning targeted as one of the most relevant fields. Learning and feeding back from existing experiences is therefore a fundamental step to ensure appropriate and useful support by ES science. This paper aims to gather and critically analyse how ES science contributes to spatial planning practices. Through a systematic review of the literature about ES use in spatial planning, we map the level of integration of ES knowledge, the scale of case studies, and the type of planning addressed; and we identify and analyse case studies of real-world applications. Studies explicitly aimed at supporting spatial planning have increased over the last decade, but are still scarce. The real-world case studies reveal advantages of integrating ES knowledge into spatial planning processes, mainly concerning practical aspects such as synthesizing complex socio-environmental information and promoting participation. Windows of opportunity offered by regulatory frameworks and innovative processes and instruments, such as marine spatial plans and strategic environmental assessments, are key factors triggering the integration. However, supportive contextual conditions are necessary, including science-policy collaborations across the entire planning process and environmental awareness among policy-makers and stakeholders.

AB  - Rapid elevation-dependent warming (EDW) in high mountain environments can accelerate the rate of change in permafrost and further induce the degradation of alpine tundra systems. However, how changes in area of alpine tundra response to EDW is difficult to be directly quantified at regional scales. Here, we project future changes in areal extent of the Koppen alpine tundra climate type in the Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is a potential indicator describing the climate conditions for the development of alpine tundra system, based on a suite of latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate models under two emission scenarios (representative concentration pathways: RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). The results indicated that the Koppen alpine tundra climate type would gradually decrease in the TP for three future periods: 2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100, especially under the RCP8.5 scenario. The decline in area of Koppen alpine tundra climate type mainly occurs above 2500m above sea level (ASL) due to the EDW (>10 degrees C) in the warmest months. The projected changes in area of alpine tundra climate type are overall consistent among different climate models, emission scenarios, and post-processing approaches (bias correction or not) used. The results obtained would thus deepen our understanding of future elevation-dependent warming and its potential influences on alpine tundra ecosystems in the Tibetan Plateau.

AB  - The Monastir Bay is one of the most important resources of marine diversity in Tunisia. The marine biodiversity quality of its coastal area has been however affected by several industrial, fishing and fish-farming activities. A multidisciplinary characterization based on geochemical analyses of sediment and benthic foraminifera was undertaken to evaluate the environmental quality of marine sediments. The geochemical data combined with the statistical results suggests an overall contamination of sediment mainly by Zn, Ni and Cu and the identification of an area particularly polluted. This zone corresponds to the area in front of the Khniss drain that has been historically affected by the presence of multiple sources of pollution. The site is also characterized by a poorly diversified benthic foraminiferal assemblage, reflecting the poor environmental conditions. Some species such as Quinqueloculina seminula and Vertebralina striata appear to be positively related to EF and might be considered as tolerant taxa to pollution in the Monastir Bay. The present study further reinforces the application of benthic foraminifera as proxies of pollution and as bioindicators of the environmental quality and represents among the first contributions in a Tunisian coastal marine area based on living benthic foraminifera as bioindicators.

AB  - Abandoned croplands can be considered a new category of scattered elements of mountain landscapes. To gain a deeper understanding of the conservation status (sensu EEC Directive 92/43) of abandoned cropland in the northern Apennines, we used the concept of the social behavior type (SBT) of plant communities. SBTs refer to the behaviour and ecological attributes of species at a given observation level and allow the understanding of the plant community conservation status. We found that topographic and soil conditions drive species assemblage in pastures after crop abandonment, but that long-term abandonment does not lead per se to the recovery of the semi-natural grassland communities deemed worthy of conservation in the EEC Directive. It was mainly the lack of appropriate disturbance regimes that allowed the spread of dominant tall herbs,which, in turn, reduced site suitability for subordinate plants. Moreover, their spread fostered the presence of elements such as ruderals and fringe species. We concluded that these abandoned croplands had a good potential to develop into a Habitat as defined in the EU Directive but without appropriate management plans they would remain of low representativeness.

AB  - Neonicotinoid pesticides caused hazardous effects on pollinators and aquatic ecosystem. The new developed chiral cis-neonicotinoid cycloxaprid(CYC) is a highly potent substitute for low toxicity to bees and high efficiency on target-insects, but little is known about the metabolic dynamics of racemic CYC and its 2 enantiomers(SR and RS) in animal models. In this study, chiral separation of C-14-labeled racemic CYC was performed in high-performance liquid chromatography under optimal conditions. For the first time that the stereoselectivity of the chiral neonicotinoid insecticide CYC was exhibited in rats after single dose oral administration using C-14-labeled isotope trace technique. Enantioselective behaviors of racemic CYC, SR and RS were observed in blood metabolism, tissue distribution and excretion. The major deposition of C-14 were found in liver, lung, kidney and heart. After 24 h, skin and fat showed a strong bioaccumulation effect, and total excreted urine and feces of CYC, SR and RS were 50.4%, 59.7% and 74.5%, respectively. Enantiomer RS had the fastest absorption and elimination rates, and it was least bio-accumulated in rats. The results provide scientific basis and practical techniques for environmental risk assessment of chiral pesticides, especially neonicotinoids. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Landscape patterns in agro-pastoral ecotones are influenced by natural factors and human activities. However, the main factors that influence landscape metrics of agro-pastoral ecotones have not been fully elucidated. To further understand conditions influencing landscape formation, we conducted a series analysis to explore the relationship between ecological factors (annual average precipitation, annual average temperature, NDVI, altitude, aspect, slope, curvature, land use, and human disturbance) and landscape metrics pattern in the range of 100-5000 m spatial extent, within an agro-pastoral ecotone in Inner Mongolia, China. Using principal component analysis and the detrended canonical correspondence analysis from 43 landscape metrics, we successfully identified several key factors that determine the landscape metrics values. Agriculture and livestock grazing land use induce the landscape configuration to become homogeneous and simple. Nevertheless, our results show that the influences of human activities on landscape metrics are surprisingly not strong. Rather the natural ecological factors, in particular temperature, precipitation and altitude, had the greatest influence on landscape metrics values. This study provides a theoretical case for the scaling effects and develops techniques for identifying the key ecological factors influencing on landscape metrics, so as to improve landscape management decisions in semi-arid regions and other ecotones.

AB  - Knowing the impacts of different anthropogenic activities on ecosystems promotes preservation of aquatic organisms. Aiming to facilitate the identification of polluted or contaminated areas, the study of microalga Lingulodinium polyedrum in phenol-containing medium comprises the determination of toxic and metabolic phenol effects, featuring a possible use of this microorganism as bioindicator for this pollutant Marine microalga L. polyedrum exposure to phenol increases superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities. The 20% and 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC20 and IC50) of cells exposed to phenol were 40 mu mol L-1 and 120 mu mol L-1, respectively. Phenol biodegradation by L. polyedrum was 0.02 mu mol h(-1) cell(-1), and its biotransformation was catalyzed by glutathione S-transferase (GST), phenol hydroxylase and catechol 2,3-dihydroxygenase metabolic pathways. Phenol exposure produced the metabolites 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde acid, 1,2-dihydroxybenzene (catechol), and 2-oxo-4-pentenoic acid; also, it induced the activity of key antioxidant biomarker enzymes SOD and CAT by three folds compared to that in the controls. Further, phenol decreased the glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio (GSH/GSSG), highlighting the effective glutathione oxidation in L. polyedrum. Overall, our results suggest that phenol alters microalga growth conditions and microalgae are sensitive bioindicators to pollution by phenol in marine environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Assessing the iron (Fe) nutritional status of natural diatom populations has proven challenging as physiological and molecular responses can differ in diatoms of the same genus. We evaluated expression of genes encoding flavodoxin (FLDA1) and an Fe-starvation induced protein (ISIP3) as indicators of Fe limitation in the marine diatom Thalassiosira oceanica. The specificity of the response to Fe limitation was tested in cultures grown under Fe-and macronutrient-deficient conditions, as well as throughout the diurnal light cycle. Both genes showed a robust and specific response to Fe limitation in laboratory cultures and were detected in small volume samples collected from the northeast Pacific, demonstrating the sensitivity of this method. Overall, FLDA1 and ISIP3 expression was inversely related to Fe concentrations and offered insight into the Fe nutritional health of T. oceanica in the field. As T. oceanica is a species tolerant to low Fe, indications of Fe limitation in T. oceanica populations may serve as a proxy for severe Fe stress in the overall diatom community. At two shallow coastal locations, FLD1A and ISIP3 expression revealed Fe stress in areas where dissolved Fe concentrations were high, demonstrating that this approach may be powerful for identifying regions where Fe supply may not be biologically available.

AB  - There is a growing interest and concern for understanding the interaction among human population growth and the sustainability of natural resources. In fact, many agrarian societies experienced an increasing frequency of wars, famines and epidemics during the periods of resource depletion. People from Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have suffered the demographic consequences of famines, civil wars and political instabilities during the last 50 years. Almost half of the countries of SSA have undergone some form of demographic crisis over the past 50 years. Our analysis indicate that despite that environmental conditions were positively correlated with crop production across SSA, Malthusian factors correlated inversely with cultivation intensity, which in turn translated into a higher magnitude of depopulation suffered during the past 50 years. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence that population collapses in SSA during the last 50 years have been multifactorial, although more closely associated with "Malthusian" factors as proximal drivers. Other proximal drivers such as economic indicators, political stability and environmental determinants did not explain as much variance as Malthusian forces, suggesting that explanations of collapse magnitude in SSA are embedded in a complex multi-causal chain, in which demographic factors may play a modulating role yet to be explored in more depth.

AB  - In daily life, we often copy the gestures and expressions of those we communicate with, but recent evidence shows that such mimicry has a physiological counterpart: interaction elicits linkage, which is a concordance between the biological signals of those involved. To find out how the type of social interaction affects linkage, pairs of participants played a turn-based computer game in which the level of competition was systematically varied between cooperation and competition. Linkage in the beta and gamma frequency bands was observed in the EEG, especially when the participants played directly against each other. Emotional expression, measured using facial EMG, reflected this pattern, with the most competitive condition showing enhanced linkage over the facial muscle-regions involved in smiling. These effects were found to be related to self-reported social presence: linkage in positive emotional expression was associated with self-reported shared negative feelings. The observed effects confirmed the hypothesis that the social context affected the degree to which participants had similar reactions to their environment and consequently showed similar patterns of brain activity. We discuss the functional resemblance between linkage, as an indicator of a shared physiology and affect, and the well-known mirror neuron system, and how they relate to social functions like empathy.

AB  - Transfer of nutrients from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems is a natural process with climatic, biotic, and geologic controls. Recently, increasing concern about human manipulation of global nutrient cycles has required a long-term approach to assessing the nutrient status of aquatic systems. Data available in palaeorecords can assess current trophic status, baseline conditions, and long-term processes controlling nutrient fluxes on decadal to millennial timescales. Here, we review three palaeolimnological methods used to reconstruct nutrient cycling: (1) chemical compounds preserved in lacustrine sediment, (2) aquatic biotic indicators (often using a quantitative transfer function), and (3) quantitative empirical sediment flux estimates. The millennial-scale regulation of nutrient cycling by climate and catchment geochemistry leads to a gradual trajectory of dystrophication over the Holocene in many temperate lakes. In many systems, the magnitude of recent anthropogenic changes to nutrient cycling is large compared with natural fluctuations, but this perspective could also be due to the selection of study sites that are currently experiencing eutrophication. Increased nutrient loading to aquatic systems is not always accompanied by decreased ecosystem function. The powerful temporal perspective from palaeolimnology can be complemented with modern mechanistic approaches to lead to increased understanding of the rates, patterns, and mechanisms of nutrient fluxes.

AB  - The Arctic region undergoes rapid and unprecedented environmental change. Environmental assessment and monitoring is needed to understand and decide how to mitigate and/or adapt to the changes and their impacts on society and ecosystems. This letter analyzes the application of strategic environmental assessment (SEA) and the monitoring, based on environmental observations, that should be part of SEA, elucidates main gaps in both, and proposes an overarching SEA framework to systematically link and improve both with focus on the rapidly changing Arctic region. Shortcomings in the monitoring of environmental change are concretized by examples of main gaps in the observations of Arctic hydroclimatic changes. For relevant identification and efficient reduction of such gaps and remaining uncertainties under typical conditions of limited monitoring resources, the proposed overarching framework for SEA application includes components for explicit gap/uncertainty handling and monitoring, systematically integrated within all steps of the SEA process. The framework further links to adaptive governance, which should explicitly consider key knowledge and information gaps that are identified through and must be handled in the SEA process, and accordingly (re) formulate and promote necessary new or modified monitoring objectives for bridging these gaps.

AB  - Earthworms are important organisms for the soil ecosystem. They are sensitive to toxic chemicals and represent useful bioindicator organisms for soil biomonitoring. Recently the use of biomarkers in earthworms has been increasingly investigated for soil monitoring and assessment purpose. The aim of the preset paper was to analyze the pollutant-induced response of a suite of cellular and biochemical biomarkers in the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris exposed to copper sulphate or methiocarb in OECD soil at the maximal concentrations recommended in agriculture. These responses were compared to lifecycle parameters such as survival, growth and reproduction.
   Granulocyte morphometric alteration, lysosomal membrane stability, metallothionein concentration, and acetylcholinesterase activity were considered. In either copper sulphate or methiocarb exposure conditions the mean percentage variation of the pollutant-induced molecular and cellular biomarkers was consistent with the whole organism end-point responses. In particular pollutant-induced granulocyte enlargement, detected in either copper sulphate or methiocarb exposed organisms, showed to be a potential general biomarker that may be directly linked to organism health. Compared to the other biological responses to pollutants, it showed high sensitivity to pollutant exposure suggesting its possible applications as a sensitive, simple, and quick general biomarker for monitoring and assessment applications.

AB  - As an extension of the modelling on environmental dispersion in a single zone wetland [Zeng, L, Chen, G.Q., 2009. Ecological degradation and hydraulic dispersion of contaminant in wetland. Ecol. Model., 222, 293-300], the typical case of a pulsed contaminant emission into a steady flow through a distinctively vegetated two-zone shallow wetland channel is analytically explored in this paper in terms of the longitudinal evolution of the lateral mean concentration under environmental dispersion. The velocity profile of a fully developed flow through the wetland is derived, with that for a single zone wetland flow included as a special case. Taylor's classical analysis and Aris's method of concentration moments for solute dispersion in a single phase fluid flow are rigorously generalized for the two-zone case of a wetland flow to develop the dispersion model and to determine the dispersivity, which is illustrated with an asymptotic time variation characterized by stem dominated, transitional, and width-stem dominated stages. For typical contaminant constituents of chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, total phosphorus, total nitrogen and heavy metal, the evolution of contaminant cloud is illustrated with the critical length and duration of the contaminant cloud with constituent concentration beyond some given environmental standard level.

AB  - The marshland upwelling system (MUS) was developed as an onsite wastewater treatment approach for coastal dwellings. The MUS removes fecal bacteria in injected wastewater by utilizing the processes of filtration, straining, adsorption, predation, and die-off through saturated subsurface sediments. The objective of this research was to evaluate the long-term sustainability of the MUS by evaluating removal efficiency of fecal bacteria from raw wastewater and assessing the system background recovery after the MUS stopped operation. Based on 32-month monitoring on an MUS site located in Bayou Segnette Canal Waterway, Louisiana, we found that the MUS compared well with other constructed wetland systems. The MUS showed an enhanced efficacy of fecal bacteria removal after long-time operation due to the deposition of solid particles from primary wastewater and the growth of biofilm in subsurface over time. Moreover, the background recovery study indicates that the subsurface environment has recovered completely from the MUS fecal bacteria loading in less than 4 months after the MUS shut down. Natural die-off was the dominant kinetic account for the fecal bacteria level returning to baseline prior to system initiation. In conclusion, the long-term monitoring results suggest the MUS a sustainable wastewater treatment alternative for coastal dwellings.

AB  - In Turkey, as a developing country, the environmental pollution problems have particularly increased since 1960, due to the rapid growth of industry and widespread increase of population in Marmara region, specifically in the Izmit bay. Since the 1960s, more than 250 large industrial plants have been built in the area surrounding the bay. In addition to the land and atmosphere, the bay is receiving the majority of these wastes. The pollution of Izmit bay has caused great concern to local and national authorities.
   In this study, environmental impact assessments of the two alternatives, crossing the bay via tunnel or bridge, have been investigated. Measurement of oceanographic parameters shows the presence of a two-layer water body with seasonal variation in the bay. At project route surface concentrations of dissolved oxygen were found to be at their saturation values, whereas they drop down to 0.7 mg/l at the bottom. Polychaeta, species in the deep sludge characterized a retarding ecological system. The fauna species, observed in the benthic structure, would again be recovered after development the crossing via tube or bridge. The dredged material obtained from the bay crossing route can be used in sanitary land filling sites of Gebze. The most inconvenient conditions in terms of air pollution seemed to be caused by tube crossing the bay.

AB  - Within four-dimensional alluvial floodplain river systems, connectivity plays an important role for diverse fish communities. This is evident at three different temporal/spatial levels. The zoogeographic level (1) shows that connectivity at a large temporal and spatial scale is an important regulatory mechanism in the colonization of river systems. At the population level (2), three characteristic genera of Danube fish species demonstrate from a theoretical point of view - that connectivity plays an important role in the formation und functioning of metapopulations. The lowest level describes the significance of connectivity within various life history strategies (3) of Danube fish species. Examples presented in this paper demonstrate that fish are practical indicators of the consequences of human alterations to river connectivity conditions at various temporal/spatial levels. On the life history level, extensive and practically relevant information is now available to form a sound basis for the development of ecologically orientated river restoration concepts. At the metapopulation level the theoretical significance of connectivity for fish populations is evident: currently, however, lack of practical experience restricts its value as an indicator. Connectivity is relevant to ichthyogeography not only over geological time, but is also reflected in the present distribution and ongoing dispersal of fish species, a process which is additionally altered by human activity.

AB  - Nanomaterials become significant component of economics. Consequently, nanomaterials become object of environmental sciences. There is a traditional list of endpoints which are indicators of the ecological risk. Mutagenicity is one of important component in this list. The quasi-SMILES approach, that in contrast to majority of work dedicated to modelling behaviour of nanomaterials gives possibility to consider experimental conditions as well as other circumstances which can impact the behaviour of nanomaterials is suggested. This is carried out via so-called quasi-SMILES. The quasi-SMILES is a line on of codes that contains all the above available eclectic data. Modelling process aimed to build up a model involves Correlation Intensity Index (CII) that is a new criterion of predictive potential of models. The scheme of calculation of CII is described in this work in the first time. The applying of CII together with Index of Ideality Correlation (IIC) in modelling of mutagenicity of silver nanoparticles by the Monte Carlo method using the CORAL software (http://www.insilico.eu/coral) indicates that application of the CII improves the predictive potential of thesemodels for three randomsplits into the training set (75%) and validation set (25%).

AB  - The copepod assemblages and abiotic parameters were investigated at 11 stations in a large coastal lake (Lake Manzalah, Nile Delta) from 2009-2010 in order to verify any impacts of eutrophication and salinity on the copepod species composition. The environmental conditions and the copepod assemblages appeared to have changed in comparison with previous studies, possibly because of increasing eutrophication and invasions of non-indigenous species (NIS). The aim of the present study was the identification of species which can be used as ecological indicators of high trophic status. Among the nine copepod species of Lake Manzalah, Acartia tonsa, Mesocyclops ogunnus, and Apocyclops panamensis were reported for the first time. Acartia tonsa, a well-known NIS for the Mediterranean, numerically dominated the copepod assemblages in some portions of the lake. The distribution of Acanthocyclops trajani and Thermocyclops consimilis was insensible to eutrophication because they can stand high levels of nutrients and hypoxia. Compared with previous reports, the copepod assemblage of Lake Manzalah was richer in species. The invasions of NIS, in addition to the heterogeneous progress of eutrophication in the lake, created an environmental mosaic with many species in total, but with single areas suitable for only a small number of them.

AB  - Previous research has revealed the importance of body mass for biological fitness. However, studies that explore body mass index (BMI) in life-history perspective are still scarce. In the present research, we tested the hypothesis that a harsh environment facilitates faster growth, thus resulting in higher BMI; consequently. higher BMI should be related to fitness-related advantages, especially in individuals who grew up in a harsh environment. The research is conducted on a community sample of young adults (N = 218). In addition to BMI, we measured economic poverty and family dysfunctions as indicators of environmental harshness. A composite measure of short-term mating and the early onset of sexual activity was used as an operationalization of mating success, representing a fast life-history behavioral pattern. The results showed that BMI was positively related to environmental harshness and mating success; furthermore, a harsh environment and mating success were also positively associated. Finally, an interaction between BMI and poverty was detected: Mating success was especially highly pronounced in individuals with elevated BMI who grew up in conditions of economic scarceness. The results are in line with life-history theory, especially with developmental theories of psychosocial acceleration. Study findings suggest that higher BMI is a part of a fast life-history pathway, and it represents an adaptive morphological response to harsh environment.

AB  - Decreasing level of dissolved oxygen has recently been reported as a growing ecological problem in seas and oceans around the world. Concentration of oxygen is an important indicator of the marine ecosystem's health as lack of oxygen (anoxia) can lead to mass mortality of marine fauna. The oxygen decrease is thought to be a result of global warming as warmer water can contain less oxygen. Actual reasons for the observed oxygen decay remain controversial though. Recently, it has been shown that it may as well result from a disruption of phytoplankton photosynthesis. In this paper, we further explore this idea by considering the model of coupled plankton-oxygen dynamics in two spatial dimensions. By means of extensive numerical simulations performed for different initial conditions and in a broad range of parameter values, we show that the system's dynamics normally lead to the formation of a rich variety of patterns. We reveal how these patterns evolve when the system approaches the tipping point, i.e., the boundary of the safe parameter range beyond which the depletion of oxygen is the only possibility. In particular, we show that close to the tipping point the spatial distribution of the dissolved oxygen tends to become more regular; arguably, this can be considered as an early warning of the approaching catastrophe.

AB  - Drought is one of the most harmful hydro climatic threats to society. Mexico has been historically affected by recurring and long-lasting droughts that have severely impacted society and the economy. Consequently, public programs and policies have been developed in order to reduce the country's vulnerability to drought, hence the importance of identifying the spatial distribution and the dimension-even in relative terms only-of vulnerability in different regions from social, economic, and environmental perspectives. This article presents a method for obtaining indices and maps of vulnerability to drought in Mexico; indices and maps are based on a set of socioeconomic and environmental indicators that the method combines using an objective analytic procedure that identifies the most vulnerable states and municipalities from social, economic, and environmental perspectives, all of which converge in overall vulnerability to drought. The results obtained indicate that 38.9% of total Mexican population inhabits municipalities with high and very high degrees of overall vulnerability to drought. For this reason, it is necessary to continue implementing actions and preventive and mitigation strategies via public policies and social programs aimed at decreasing the country's vulnerability to the occurrence of drought events. This is the only way to facilitate the necessary conditions to reduce the impact of drought and to decrease people's vulnerability to this phenomenon.

AB  - In the next decades fossil fuels are expected to still play a fundamental role within the energy market, contemporarily to the increased exploitation of renewable energy sources. Among all fossil fuels, natural gas is predicted to be the key source to achieve the satisfaction of the forecasted increase in energy demand, due to its lower environmental impact. In particular, great attention is being paid on the transport sector where liquefied natural gas can be seen as an interesting opportunity. In this context, this paper aims to elaborate a novel solution for liquefied natural gas production directly at filling stations. With this purpose, in this work four different liquefaction process layouts will be proposed and analyzed, considering natural gas supply grid operating at middle pressure or at low pressure. The developed configurations will be analyzed by applying an in-house developed calculation model, which enables to define the physical conditions in each section of the process and the energy fluxes of the plant.
   In order to define a configuration which allows to minimize the process' energy consumption, a parametric analysis has been carried out to evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed processes. With this purpose, several performance indicators have been defined and applied to the considered scenarios.

AB  - Semi-natural grasslands are vital for maintaining grassland butterflies in Japan, as well as in Europe. However, severe decline in these grassland environments has recently attracted attention to linear grasslands, such as firebreaks and power-line corridors, as alternative habitats for grassland insects. We surveyed butterflies in an abandoned grassland and nearby linear mown firebreaks adjacent to different vegetation at the northern foot of Mt. Fuji, central Japan, over 5 successive years, particularly focusing on species on the 2012 Japanese Red List of Threatened Species ("red-list" species). We found that the firebreaks were consistently higher in species richness and abundance of butterflies than the long-term abandoned grassland, and that species composition differed among the firebreaks depending on conditions of the adjacent vegetation. The firebreaks surrounded by forests were mainly utilized by forest and edge species, whereas the firebreaks adjacent to the grassland were essential for conserving red-list grassland species. Thus, only the mown firebreaks adjacent to the grassland were regarded as a high-quality alternative habitat for many grassland butterflies, but the area was limited. Therefore, creating heterogeneity in the abandoned grassland by infrequent mowing could help conserve grassland butterflies, including red-list species.

AB  - The study focuses on identifying and assessing the effect of the presence of drainage and roadside ditches on the diversity of bryophytes in managed forests. We compared the composition of moss and liverwort species, their richness and abundance in plots that are located in ditches as well as corresponding control plots in the surrounding forests with regard to the forest type (coniferous, mixed and deciduous). ANOVA demonstrated the pronounced impact that the presence of ditches in managed forests has on an increase in bryophyte species richness. A comparison of forest and ditch types using DCA pointed to a correlation between the number of deciduous trees in the stands and an increased dissimilarity of ditch bryophytes when compared to the bryophytes of the corresponding control plots. Using the ecological indicator values, CCA confirmed the special significance of ditch settlements for hygrophilous species, which at present cannot otherwise find favorable conditions in managed forests. The study proves that ditches, and especially those with intermittent pools of stagnant water, may become a significant source of microhabitat diversity. Their presence may provide a welcome preserve for rare and protected species that cannot find suitable substrates in managed forests.

AB  - Soil ecotoxicology has been motivated by the increasing global awareness on environmental issues. Northern Hemisphere has been the main driver of this science branch; however, the number and quality of contributions from the Southern Hemisphere are increasing quickly. In this case study, Brazil is taken as an example of how soil ecotoxicology has developed over the last 30 years. It starts with a brief historical overview depicting the main events on soil ecotoxicology in the country. Following, an overview on the Brazilian legislation related to soil ecotoxicology is given, covering regulations with prospective focus, mainly on the registration of pesticides. Regulations with retrospective focus in contaminated areas are also given. Then, an outline of the actors in soil ecotoxicology and examples of prospective ecotoxicological studies performed with soil organisms and plants are given by stressor groups: pesticides, pharmaceuticals, metals, and residues. Experiences from retrospective studies, mainly looking at the assessment of industrial sites, are also covered. Emphasis is given on methodological aspects, pointing to needed actions, mainly regarding the different biotic and abiotic conditions of a tropical country. Finally, the last session discusses how soil ecotoxicology could be improved in methodological adaptations as well as legal requirements.

AB  - Aquatic community body size distributions are highly predictable with decreasing abundance and increasing body size. This basic relationship has led to significant increases in our understanding of the internal regulation processes of aquatic communities. However, most of our understanding of the patterns of community size structure is derived from large aquatic systems with little known about the dynamics of small lakes. Processes that promote predictable, or deterministic, community size structure likely differ with levels of biodiversity and disturbance patterns, both of which frequently co-vary with ecosystem size. Here we examine the influence of lake size, fish species richness, and natural disturbance regime on fish community size structure in six small lakes (<200 ha) on Beaver Island, Michigan, USA. Fish communities in three of the six lakes exhibited a deterministic size structure and it appears that disturbance regime is the most obvious barrier to developing and/or maintaining stable and predictable community size structure. In this study, lakes with less than 10 species and lakes experiencing periodic winterkills exhibited stochastic size structure. Lake size did not show any clear relation to fish community size structure. Collectively our results shed some light on the conditions that promote (or do not promote) deterministic size structure.

AB  - Complex interactions between bacteria and protists are essential to the ecosystem ecology of peatbogs. However, little is known about how short-term changes in environmental conditions may influence microbial and metazoan communities. Microbial processes and parameters may be used as sensitive indicators of eutrophication. We address the hypothesis that an increase in the concentration of nutrients (in an experiment simulating eutrophication) will affect species richness and abundance of microorganisms and small metazoans and will cause changes in food web structure in different types of peatbogs. The experiments were performed in a Sphagnum peatland and a carbonate fen. Four experimental treatments were established (control and fertilised: +P, +N, P+N). An increase in habitat fertility was found to modify the taxonomic composition and functioning of microbial communities. This was reflected in a decrease in the species richness of testate amoebae and a substantial increase in the abundance of bacteria, flagellates and ciliates in both types of peatbogs. A better understanding of which parameters regulate microbial populations in peatbogs is critical for more accurate prediction of how peatbogs will respond to global change or anthropogenic disturbances.

AB  - The population vulnerability of a species to pesticides is determined by the risk of its exposure to the pollutant, its sensitivity to the toxicant and the potential to sustain its populations if adversely affected (population resilience). This study uses population modelling to link the life cycle traits of a set of fish species which are highly susceptible to pesticide exposure, to their population resilience as a contribution to the needed identification of representative vulnerable species for higher-tier ecological risk assessment (ERA) of pesticides in Europe. Leslie matrix models for 21 species were parametrized using data from literature on field populations whose resilience was assessed. Phoxinus phoxinus was identified as the species with the least resilient populations for effects on fertility, Lampetra planeri for effects on juvenile survival and Esox lucius for effects on adult survival. Combining the measured effects from standard fish bio-tests with population models of these species would result in an ecologically relevant and protective risk assessment for field conditions in Europe.

AB  - A manipulative caging experiment was carried out to evaluate the role of wild fish and motile epibenthic invertebrates on the benthic system influenced by an open water fish farm. Chemical and biological parameters of the sediment were measured as indicators of the ecological benthic status. The combination of wild fish and currents notably lowered aquaculture waste sedimentation below the fish farm. The limited waste sedimentation rate could have limited the scavenger and predation activity of wild fish on the benthos, whose role may be taken over by motile epibenthic invertebrates. The interaction of these motile epibenthic invertebrates with the sediment differed from that observed with fish. The motile epibenthic invertebrates led to more reduced conditions with lower redox values, significantly decreased the number of species of macrofaunal benthic assemblages and significantly modified macrofaunal benthic assemblages. Therefore, epibenthic invertebrates do not seem to have an ameliorative effect on the benthic status produced by fish farming. Since the effects of epibenthic species on the benthic system can greatly vary according to their identity, further experiments should be performed to better understand the drivers that influence the epibenthic species identity that modulate the benthic system affected by fish farming.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the benthic macroinvertebrate distribution in the Kesap Stream (in the Eastern Black Sea Region of Turkey) for the summer period using biotic index. The water quality was assessed through the application of the Belgian biotic index. For this purpose, benthic macroinvertebrate sampling was performed in six sites along the Kesap Stream in the summer period, in July 2007. The distribution of dominant genera of the sites was evaluated according to water quality. According to the Belgian biotic index, II, III and IV water quality classes (slightly, moderately and heavily polluted, respectively) were determined in the stream. In addition, diversities of benthic macroinvertebrates in six sites were calculated. The biotic index values are found also consistent with the diversity values. Especially, in areas of the stream after industrial facilities water quality decreased. However, very heavy pollution was not observed accord to the biotic index values. It was found that Ephemeroptera was the dominant major taxon in all sampling sites. As a result of this biological evaluation, Ephemeroptera were concluded to be the most common taxa in the stream and the ephemeropterans, Potamanthus, Baetis and Ephemerella were dominant genera in the conditions of slightly, moderately and heavily polluted.

AB  - The Nador lagoon ecosystem (North-East of Morocco) displays a major socioeconomic interest. In fact, it is essential to evaluate consequences of anthropogenic activities in the lagoon especially by organic matter studies (nature and distribution) in the sedimentary compartment. Surface sediments show variable rates in total organic carbon and in sulfur, high in some cases (7.5 and 1.8% respectively). These high contents are recorded in the center of the lagoon. Their distributions are controlled by the hydrodynamism and the anthropogenic degree. The molecular biomarkers analyses and especially n-alkanes distribution reveal: a zone of marine influence; and a zone of continental influence. The occurrence of pentacyclic triterpanes with a typical distribution of a thermally mature organic matter reveals a contamination due to petroleum products in the entire lagoon except for the center. Coprostanol occurrence near cities indicates wastewater effluents inputs and reducing conditions underlined by high values of stanols/sterol ratios. Thus, the organic contamination (petroleum by-products and wastewater effluents) occurs in the vicinity of the cities whereas the littoral edge and center remain weakly affected by these contaminations.

AB  - Biodiversity is essential for multiple aspects of human life and well-being, but many current assessments of the functioning of biodiversity and ecosystems, understanding of risks posed by environmental change and the best practice of their management of ecosystems are lacking a unified scientific and conceptual basis. Methods such as scenario analysis, and terms such as ecosystem services, are widely used, but their meaning is understood in many different ways depending on context, user needs and experience of researchers. In order to advance the conceptual basis for ecosystem analysis and management in a rapidly changing world, as well as the ability of young scientists to reflect upon these concepts, we have organised five 2-week-long summer schools in Peyresq, a remote village in the Southern French Alps. In total 173 participants have worked intensively with 69 experienced researchers and a team of conveners and tutors in order to discuss a broad range of views on topics on ecosystem analysis and functioning. Topics ranged from conditions of and threats to various ecosystems due to environmental change, models and scenarios for assessment, stakeholder perceptions and needs for information, to the social and economic contexts for biodiversity. We report our experience from these schools, present the training concept which has emerged from them and suggest lines of further development.

FX  - The Peyresq summer schools would not have been possible without the generous support of the private charity foundation "Peyresq Foyer d'Humanisme'', owner of the buildings used in Peyresq and provider of all local services, based in Bruxelles (Belgium) and directed by a board under the leadership of Mme Mady Smets, Bruxelles. On behalf of the foundation, we also received generous and never-failing support by Dr. Monique Lejoly and Mr. Jean Vancompernolle. Several local staff members have provided enormous help in Peyresq - we particularly want to mention Mme Sylviane Garcia and Mme Sylviane Illy. The excursion was developed together with Dr. Fabien Que tier (Cordoba, Argentina) and supported by the Parc naturel regional du Verdon (Ilias Zinsstag and Gwenael Barreteau). The summer schools were supported financially by the EU FP5 Concerted Action AVEC (Integrated Assessment of Vulnerable Ecosystems under Global Change, EVK2-CT-2001-20010), the EU FP6 Network of Excellence ALTER-Net (A Long-Term Biodiversity, Ecosystem and Awareness Research Network, http://www.alter-net.info, GOCE-CT-2003-505298), the START programme, the Inter-American Institute, the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. On behalf of ALTER-Net, a "school board'' assisted in developing the summer school, under the leadership of Mr. Karl Baadsvik (Trondheim, Norway). We once again want to thank all participants and speakers for their personal contributions. We dedicate this paper to the memory of two summer school participants, Marco Hille and Juan Pena, who died terribly early in their promising careers.

AB  - Oxygen consumption by Daphnia magna Straus was investigated as a bioindicator for the presence of 11 common aquatic pollutants: Benzo[b]fluoranthene (BbF), mercury(II) chloride (HgCl2), 2-dimethoxyphosphinothioylthio-N-methylacetimide (dimethoate). hexachlorocyclohexane (lindane), 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methoxy-1-methylurea (linuron), 4-chloro-o-tolyloxy-acetic acid. bis(tributyltin) oxide (TBTO), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), tetramethylthiuram disulfide (thiram), 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, and arsenic trioxide (AS(2)O(3)). The measurement of oxygen consumption by D. magna was carried out after 15 and 210 min of exposure to the toxicants under controlled laboratory conditions. The technique applied in the present study was found to be useful for the detection of significant changes in oxygen consumption for most toxicants, with the exception of BbF, dimethoate, and CCl4. Significant differences in oxygen consumption were noted, relative to the control treatments, for six of the compounds after only 15 min of exposure. For thiram and TBTO, statistically significant changes in oxygen consumption were recorded after 2 10 min of exposure. The present results suggest that the measurement of oxygen consumption by D. magna is a useful biomarker and could possibly be used as a biological early warning system for detecting pollutants in the aquatic environment.

AB  - The provision of energy for households is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the domestic sector. There is significant scope for energy savings and thus emission reduction in this sector. This paper constructs a bridge between thermal analysis and environmental assessment in the occupancy stage of the dwelling life cycle, approaching both methods as being on a common system Environment-Dwelling-Inhabitant. The importance of the local level in the thermal analysis and assessment of either a dwelling or an inhabitant's behaviour is demonstrated. It is shown that the researcher can choose between natural experiment, computer experiment and mathematical modelling to analyze the system. Such a choice is discussed for two particular methods of thermal analysis. Thermal Nomograms are the result of mathematical modelling, and the Energy Score Sheet is the result of a computer experiment in energy rating. Despite being developed for the purpose of thermal analysis, these methods can also be utilized for environmental assessment at the local level. The discussion centres on Australian conditions where the majority of the population resides in a relatively benign climate wherein behavioural alterations have significant potential for energy savings and environmental impact. The purpose of the paper is to emphasise benefits apart from energy minimisation to promote the use of energy efficient housing strategies.

KW  - SOIL
KW  - TOXICITY
KW  - INSECTICIDES
AB  - Approaches in ecological risk assessment are usually based on estimating the probability that organisms will be exposed to environmental concentrations of chemicals greater than some toxicological criterion (LC50, NOEC). Following this approach, quality standards for persistent chemicals in soil can be derived. For readily degradable chemicals emitted at intervals, the ecological risk can be related to the time taken for the chemical concentration to fall to a level causing no effect on most, e.g. 95%, of the species. A formula is derived for the maximum acceptable half-life, assuming a log-logistic distribution of species susceptibilities and a simple exponential decay of the chemical. It is also assumed that the pesticide is distributed homogeneously through the top 20 cm of the soil. A numerical example is elaborated for carbofuran, demonstrating that for a recommended dose applied to soil, the maximum half-life should be 47 days, if the ecotoxicological protection level is to be reached within one year after a single application. This estimate may vary between 35 and 61 days, depending on the margins of uncertainty attached to ecotoxicological data. Complete recovery not only includes the disappearance of the chemical but also the recolonization of treated soils. The half-life condition derived in this paper should therefore be considered as a minimum requirement.

AB  - There is increasing recognition that soils fulfil many functions for society. Each soil can deliver a range of functions, but some soils are more effective at some functions than others due to their intrinsic properties. In this study we mapped four different soil functions on agricultural lands across the European Union. For each soil function, indicators were developed to evaluate their performance. To calculate the indicators and assess the interdependencies between the soil functions, data from continental long-term simulation with the DayCent model were used to build crop-specific Bayesian networks. These Bayesian Networks were then used to calculate the soil functions' performance and trade-offs between the soil functions under current conditions. For each soil function the maximum potential was estimated across the European Union and changes in trade-offs were assessed. By deriving current and potential soil function delivery from Bayesian networks a better understanding is gained of how different soil functions and their interdependencies can differ depending on soil, climate and management. Highlights
   When increasing a soil function, how do trade-offs affect the other functions under different conditions? Bayesian networks evaluate trade-offs between soil functions and estimate their maximal delivery. Maximizing a soil function has varied effects on other functions depending on soil, climate and management. Differences in trade-offs make some locations more suitable for increasing a soil function then others.

AB  - Background: New market trends and new challenges in meat quality lead us to improve animal handling. During the animal rearing, many stressful situations could impact on the biochemical process, affecting the transformation of muscle into meat. Dealing with this problem is complicated since stress is a very complex disorder of animals, depending on too many intrinsic and extrinsic factors.
   Scope and approach: To date, the most common stress indicators used were cortisol, creatine kinase and lactate in animal blood. However, currently there is an advanced development of proteomic techniques which enables us to obtain protein stress biomarkers, representing a powerful tool for food industry. In the literature, a large number of biomarkers could be identified in cattle, pigs or chicken linked to stress conditions. An integrative approach, based on functional enrichment analysis of biological processes, showed that the most relevant Gene Ontology term was "muscle filament sliding" for cattle and pig under stress conditions.
   Key findings and conclusions: From a proteomic point of view, a list of biomarkers was provided to control animal welfare at industrial level. Heat stress during the rearing and pre-slaughter management turned out to be one of the most studied factors in pork, beef and chicken. This stressor provoked significant differences in structural contractile skeletal proteins, altering meat quality.

AB  - Rivers are considered as one of the main resources of water supply for various applications such as agricultural, drinking and industrial purposes. Also, these resources are used as a place for discharge of sewages, industrial wastewater and agricultural drainage. Regarding the fact that each river has a certain capacity for acceptance of pollutants, nowadays qualitative and environmental investigations of these resources are proposed. In this study, qualitative investigation of the Talar river was done according to Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI), National Sanitation Foundation Water Quality Index (NSFWQI) and Wilcox indicators during 2011-2012 years at upstream, midstream and downstream of the river in two periods of wet and dry seasons. According to the results of OWQI, all of the values at 3 stations and both periods are placed at very bad quality category and the water is not acceptable for drinking purposes. According to NSFWQI, the best condition was related to the upstream station at wet season period (58, medium quality) and the worst condition was related to the downstream in wet season period (46, very bad quality). Also the results of Wilcox showed that in both periods of wet season and dry season, the water quality is getting better from upstream station to the downstream station, and according to the index classification, the downstream water quality has shown good quality and it is suitable for agriculture.

AB  - Drought is a complex natural phenomenon that can lead to reduced water supplies and can consequently have substantial effects on agriculture and socioeconomic activities that cause social crises and political problems. Different drought indicators are used for identifying droughts. This work explored the applicability of a near-real time drought monitoring methodology using Terra-MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) products. This approach is called the Vegetation Supply Water Index (VSWI), which integrates land surface reflectance and thermal properties. The results indicate that during a major drought event from 2012 to 2013, approximately 85% of the Brazilian semiarid region was affected. The number of days of soil moisture deficit, which was derived from a simple water balance model and the daily interpolated precipitation, were used to verify the results. A correlation analysis of VSWI, precipitation and soil moisture deficit shows that VSWI is closely related to rainfall and soil water content, especially under dry conditions, and indicates that the use of VSWI can be a suitable near-real time drought monitoring approach. The evaluation of the 2012-2014 drought considering the VSWI index highlighted two major characteristics of vegetation response to drought conditions, i.e., the recovery and memory effects of vegetation.

AB  - Many riverine organisms are well adapted to seasonally dynamic environments, but extreme changes in flow and thermal regimes can threaten sustainability of their populations in regulated rivers. Altered thermal regimes may limit recruitment to populations by shifting the timing of breeding activities and affecting the growth and development of early life stages. Stream-dwelling anurans such as the foothill yellow-legged frog (Rana boylii) in the Trinity River of northern California are model subjects for examining associations between water temperature and the timing of oviposition, hatching, and metamorphosis, and body condition and size of tadpoles and metamorphs. Breeding activity, hatching success, and metamorphosis occurred later, and metamorphs were smaller and leaner along the regulated and colder mainstem relative to six unregulated tributaries of the Trinity River. Persistently depressed summer water temperatures appear to play a seminal role in inhibited tadpole growth on the regulated mainstem and may be a causative factor in the pronounced decline of this population. Environmental flow assessments should account for the influence of the thermal regime on the development of vulnerable embryonic and larval life stages to improve outcomes for declining amphibian populations.

AB  - The objective of this study was to check if the tree component of a cloud forest, located in Urubici, SC, shows structural and floristic patterns variations associated to the environmental heterogeneity. For the tree community characterization, a total of 25, 20x20 m plots were allocated in the forest fragment. All trees with circumference at 1,30 m (CBH) >= 15,7 cm were measured (CBH and height) and identified. In each plot, environmental variables related to soils physical and chemical traits, terrain, canopy cover and environmental impact were collected. The data were analysed by Mann-Withney test, non-parametric multivariate ANOVA (NPMANOVA), nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS) and indicator species analysis. From exploratory analysis of data, it was observed that the NMDS indicated the occurrence of two floristic-structural groups associated to terrain declivity. The two sectors differed in their environmental characteristics, with the lower declivity sector demonstrating higher values of organic matter, sand, aluminum content and cation-exchange capacity, and the higher declivity sector with higher values of elevation difference, silt and calcium content, base saturation and pH. The environmental heterogeneity influenced the floristic-structural organization of the tree component and the occurrence of indicator species at the two sectors. The conditions of the physical environment, associated with the soil characteristics and declivity conditioned community organization in the fragment studied.

AB  - A simple anaerobic-activated sludge system, in which microorganisms are immobilized by a novel functional carrier, was used for removing nitrate in groundwater. The operating conditions, including hydraulic retention time (HRT), C/N ratio, temperature and NO3--N loading concentration were investigated. The NO3--N concentration, residual chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nitrite accumulation were used as indicators to assess the water quality of the effluent. The anaerobic biomass loading capacity in the carrier was 12.8 g/L and the denitrifying Pseudomonas sp. and Rhodocyclaceae bacterium were dominant among the immobilized microorganisms in the anaerobic-activated sludge. Under operating conditions of HRT = 1.5 h, C/N = 2-3 and T = 16.8-20 degrees C, the removal efficiency of NO3--N exceeded 93%, corresponding to a relatively high denitrification rate of 0.73 kg NO3--N m(-3) d(-1), when the NO3--N loading concentration was 50 mg/L. The NO3--N concentration of the effluent always met regulatory criteria for drinking water (<10 mg/L) in the main developed and developing countries. The effluent COD was also below 10 mg/L. Although some nitrite accumulated (0-1.77 mg/L) during the operating period, it can be decreased through adjusting the operating pH and HRT. The immobilized activated sludge system may be useful for the removal of nitrate from groundwater.

AB  - Oceanographic fronts and their associated physical processes create strong spatial patterns of food availability that may influence the metabolic processes of bivalves located within these areas. To investigate this prediction, we used mass size relationships, condition indices, and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stable isotopes to evaluate how the biological characteristics of the Patagonian scallop (Zygochlamys paragonica) are influenced by the Shelf Break Front (SBF) and the surrounding chlorophyll a concentration (CSAT). Scallops from 2 transects across the front (38-39 degrees S, 55-56 degrees W, southwest Atlantic Ocean) were sampled with a nonselective dredge in October 2005. The results show that the SBF position, estimated from satellite-derived sea surface temperature, was more stable than the CSAT maximum concentrations. If muscle tissue is considered a better indicator of food shifts as previous studies indicate, scallops located far from the front have lower C isotopic signatures and C/N ratios than scallops located near the front. However, the lack of a shift in scallop organ conditions suggest that spatial differences in food supply are not strong enough during the time of year we sampled to impact scallop development, as may happen at a seasonal scale. Our results show that complicated interactions exist between oceanographic structures, food supply, and scallop life history characteristics.

AB  - A psychrophilic glutathione reductase from Antarctic ice microalgae Chlamydomonas sp. Strain ICE-L was purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation and three steps of chromatography. The yield was up to 25.1% of total glutathione reductase in the crude enzyme extract. The glutathione reductase activity was characterized by the spectrophotometric method under different conditions. Purified glutathione reductase was separated by SDS-PAGE, which furnished a homogeneous band. The native molecular mass of the enzyme was 115 kDa. Apparent Km values for NADPH and NADH (both at 0.5 mmol L-1 oxidized glutathione) were 22.3 and 83.8 mu mol L-1, respectively. It was optimally active at pH 7.5, and it was stable from pH 5 to 9. Its optimum temperature was 25 degrees C, with activity at 0 degrees C 23.5% of the maximum. Its optimum ion strength and optimum Mg2+ were 50--90 and 7.5 rnmol L-1, respectively. Ca2+, Mg2+, and cysteine substantially increased the activity of the enzyme but chelating agents, heavy metals (Cd2+, Pb2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, etc.), NADPH, and ADP had significant inhibitory effects. This glutathione reductase can be used to study the adaptation and mechanism of catalysis of psychrophilic enzymes, and it has a high potential as an environmental biochemical indicator under extreme conditions.

AB  - Foraminiferal assemblages were studied in two Brazilian stratified lagoons: the restricted Cananeia-Iguape lagoon which exhibits inclined water stratification and the choked Lagoa da Conceicao, where strong horizontal stratification occurs during the rainy season. Water stratification has been shown to influence the distribution of foraminiferal assemblages. In the restricted lagoon, the transition from marine to continental water conditions induces a progressive change in foraminiferal assemblage, both horizontally and vertically. In the choked lagoon, the presence of two different water masses separated by a halocline leads to the presence of two distinct assemblages. The first, located in the depressions, characterized by the dominance of rotaliids indicates a stronger marine influence. The second, present in the shallow water, characterized by textulariids, indicates more restricted conditions. The dominance of calcareous species in the depressions, where organic rich sediments are potentially liable to dissolve calcareous tests shows that, even if it may greatly modify the thanatocoenoses, the dissolution does not destroy all the information. The differential impact of stratification on foraminiferal assemblages from these two sites clearly demonstrate: (1) that it is impossible to propose a universal model for foraminiferal distribution in lagoons; but (2) that the foraminiferal assemblages can provide valuable information for modem hydrodynamics and, with some caution, also for fossil lagoonal environments.

AB  - The evolutionary mechanisms behind cold and high-saline co-adaptation of proteins are not thoroughly understood. To explore how enzymes evolve in response to multiple environmental pressures we developed a novel in silico method to model the directed evolution of proteins, the Protein Evolution Parameter Calculator (PEPC). PEPC carries out single amino acid substitutions that lead to improvements in the selected user-defined parameters. To investigate the evolutionary relationship between increased flexibility and decreased isoelectric point, which are presumed indicators of cold and saline adaptation in proteins, we applied PEPC to a subset of core haloarchaea orthologous group (cHOG) proteins from the mesophilic Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1 and cold-tolerant Halorubrum lacusprofundi strain ATCC 49239. The results suggest that mutations that increase flexibility will also generally increase isoelectric point. These findings suggest that enzyme adaptation to low temperature and high salinity might be evolutionarily counterposed based on the structural characteristics of probable amino acid mutations. This may help to explain the apparent lack of truly psychrophilic halophiles in nature, and why microbes adapted to polar hypersaline environments typically have mesophilic temperature optima. A better understanding of protein evolution to extremely cold and salty conditions will aid in our understanding of where and how life is distributed on Earth and in our solar system.

AB  - Background: Araucaria forests are mountain ecosystems that might have expanded in the late Holocene, however past distributions remain uncertain. If current distribution reflects climatic conditions, past and future distributions may be projected using climate models. Aims: To contribute to the understanding of past and future distribution of Araucaria forests as a function of climate, we hypothesised that (1) they have increased their geographic distribution since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) until the present; and (2) would contract under predicted future climates. Methods: We modelled the spatial distributions of Araucaria forests under current, past and future climatic scenarios. Ecological niche models of 12 indicator species were developed using ensemble modelling. Results: The greatest extent of distribution of Araucaria forests appeared to have occurred during the LGM, after which a continuous retraction followed until the present. Our models suggested that Araucaria forests would experience an even greater retraction in the future. Conclusion: Araucaria forests could have covered larger areas during the LGM than suggested by earlier palynological studies, because climate was suitable for their distribution. The degree of loss of modelled distribution area since the LGM until today indicate these forests are likely to continue to shrink under projected future climatic changes.

AB  - The hydrologic regime of a river is one of the factors determining its ecological status. This paper tries to indicate the present hydrologic stress occurring across European rivers on the basis of model integration. This results in a pan-European assessment at the resolution of the functional elementary catchment (FEC), based on simulated daily time-series of river flows from the model PCR-GLOBWB. To estimate proxies of the present hydrologic stress, two datasets of river flow were simulated under the same climate, one from a hypothetic least disturbed condition scenario and the second from the anthropogenic scenario with the actual water management occurring. Indicators describing the rivers' hydrologic regime were calculated with the indicators of hydrologic alteration (IHA) software package and the river total mean flow and the relative baseflow magnitude over the total flow were used to express the deviations between the two scenarios as proxy metrics of rivers' hydrologic alteration or hydrologic stress. The alteration results on Europe's FEC-level background showed that Southern Europe is more hydrologically stressed than the rest of Europe, with greater potential for hydrology to be clearly associated with river segments of unreached good ecological status and high basin management needs.

AB  - Significant wetland losses across the globe have motivated large-scale restoration efforts to improve the quality of wetland habitats. However, previous studies have shown a high variability in the outcomes of restoration treatments. Post-restoration monitoring is critical to identifying factors constraining wetland recovery and diverting sites away from restoration goals but is often limited by a lack of funding. To circumvent limitations to the large-scale monitoring of wetlands, it is pivotal to identify metrics that can be implemented at low cost yet provide a reliable signal of restoration progress. We review scientific literature on methods to appraise post restoration progress in wetland ecosystems, focusing on vegetation-based indicators. We present a synthesis of demonstrated relationships between these indicators, site conditions, landscape context, and key ecosystem functions to highlight benefits and potential limitations to the widespread applications of these indicators to post-restoration monitoring. Based on this literature synthesis, we suggest adopting a multi-metric approach to fully measure ecosystem recovery. Potential solutions identified in this review to reduce costs associated with large-scale monitoring include: identifying correlation among indicators, focusing on the most widespread species, and using remote sensing to expand the spatiotemporal scope of monitoring and inform monitoring efforts.

AB  - The present study analysed the megabenthic diversity in subtidal soft bottoms and assessed the main environmental drivers of megabenthic community organisation along the Algarve coast (southern Portugal). We tested the hypothesis that megabenthic communities respond to the same environmental drivers than macrofauna. We found that similar to macrofauna, megafaunal communities were organised in relation to the depth of closure, light reaching the bottom, and the hydrodynamic conditions related with exposure within the shallower areas. The influence of the main river outflow prevailed over other drivers, but only up to 9 m depth. We found that seven different spatial units should be considered, each characterised by different indicator species. Additionally, among a total of 412 taxa collected between 4 and 50 m depth, we provide the characteristics of the 64 commonest species in terms of occurrence, frequency, distribution, abundance, bathymetric and sedimentary preferences, which constitutes most valuable information for ecosystem modelling. Megabenthic alpha diversity decreased with depth, contrary to evenness and was higher in the proximity of the river Guadiana and in highly exposed shores. We conclude that the megafauna, which is significantly quicker to collect and analyse, can provide an accurate alternative to macrofauna sampling, as their communities are shaped by the same drivers.

AB  - Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) has caused great concern in the greenhouse tomato industry after it was found causing a new disease in tomato in 1999. The objective of this paper is to investigate alternative hosts and compare important biological characteristics of the three PepMV strains occurring in Europe when tested under different environmental conditions. To this end we compared the infectivity and symptom development of three, well characterized isolates belonging to three different PepMV strains, EU-tom, Ch2 and US1, by inoculating them on tomato, possible alternative host plants in the family Solanaceae and selected test plants. The inoculation experiments were done in 10 countries from south to north in Europe. The importance of alternative hosts among the solanaceous crops and the usefulness of test plants in the biological characterization of PepMV isolates are discussed. Our data for the three strains tested at 10 different European locations with both international and local cultivars showed that eggplant is an alternative host of PepMV. Sweet pepper is not an important host of PepMV, but potato can be infected when the right isolate is matched with a specific cultivar. Nicotiana occidentalis 37B is a useful indicator plant for PepMV studies, since it reacts with a different symptomatology to each one of the PepMV strains.

AB  - Sexual signal evolution can be complex because multiple factors influence the production, transmission, and reception of sexual signals, as well as receivers' responses to them. To grasp the relative importance of these factors in generating signal diversity, we must simultaneously investigate multiple selective agents and signaling traits within a natural system. We use the model system of the radiation of Bahamas mosquitofish (Gambusia hubbsi) inhabiting blue holes to test the effects of resource availability, male body size and other life-history traits, key aspects of the transmission environment, sex ratio, and predation risk on variation in multiple male color traits. Consistent with previous work examining other traits in this system, several color traits have repeatedly diverged between predation regimes, exhibiting greater elaboration in the absence of predators. However, other factors proved influential as well, with variation in resource levels, body size, relative testes size, and background water color being especially important for several color traits. For one prominent signaling trait, orange dorsal fins, we further confirmed a genetic basis underlying population differences using a laboratory common-garden experiment. We illustrate a promising approach for gaining a detailed understanding of the many contributing factors in the evolution of multivariate sexual signals.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the effects of different intensities of non-point pollution on water quality and the periphyton community in natural eutrophic environments such as the Pampean streams. Non-point pollution caused by agricultural and farming activities is an important contributor to water quality deterioration. Our hypothesis was that, in spite of the natural water eutrophication in Pampean streams, pollution generated by rural activities promotes changes in water quality modifying nutrient concentrations and promoting or inhibiting the periphyton developed depending on the kind and intensity of land use. The most important periphyton parameters to assess the non-point pollution effect due to rural activities estimated in this study were chlorophyll-a, net production and alkaline phosphatase activity. Water quality parameters which proved useful in differentiating rural activities were soluble reactive phosphorus and conductivity. Agriculture caused an increase in autotrophic biomass and hence an increase in net production whereas cattle farming caused an increase in heterotrophic biomass. Chlorophytes were abundant in agricultural zones whereas cyanophytes or euglenophytes were more abundant in cattle farming areas. Thus, periphyton could be used as an indicator of non-point pollution, differentiating not only the types of activity but also the persistence and intensity of rural practices.

AB  - Public participation plays a role in the development and long-term maintenance of environmental institutions that are well-matched to local social-ecological conditions. However, the means by which public participation impacts such institutional fit remains unclear. We argue that one major reason for this lack of clarity is that analysts have not clearly outlined how humankind's sense of agency, or self-determination, influences institutional outcomes. Moreover, the concept of institutional fit is ambiguous as to what constitutes a good fit and how such fit could be diagnosed or improved. This is especially true for "social fit," or how well institutions match human expectations and local behavioral patterns. We develop an interdisciplinary framework based on principles of human agency and institutional analysis from social psychology to address these problems. Using the concept of "institutional acceptance" as an indicator of social fit, we show how analysts can define, diagnose, and improve social fit of participatory programs. We also show how such fit emerges and is sustained over time. This interdisciplinary perspective on fit and participation has important implications for participatory approaches to environmental management and the scientific study of institutional evolution.

AB  - Stress placed on individuals in a population from natural and anthropogenic disturbances can elevate developmental instability. We studied the result of a natural disaster when one-third of a forested nature preserve was destroyed by an F3 tornado. Populations of two abundant species of small mammals, Peromyscus maniculatus and P. leucopus, were monitored in both disturbed and undisturbed habitats. We used an X-ray technique to measure developmental instability as indicated by fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in cranial and skeletal features of live animals. FA in femur length was higher in disturbed habitat for P. leucopus but was higher in undisturbed habitat for P. maniculatus. This difference in developmental instability mirrors differences in habitat preference between these species: P. leucopus prefers forest habitat and P. maniculatus prefers open, herbaceous habitat. These results were not explained by either food availability or body condition, both of which were higher in the disturbed habitat suggesting higher quality for this habitat. Thus, the FA response may be related to other indicators of habitat quality, e.g., vertical stratification, coarse-woody debris, or population density, which may differ between undisturbed and disturbed habitats.

AB  - The mobility and bioavailability of Se depend on its redox state, and reduction of Se oxyanions to less mobile, reduced species controls transport of this potentially toxic element in the environment. Stable isotope fractionation of Se is currently being developed as an indicator of Se immobilization through reduction. In this study, Se isotope fractionation resulting from reduction of Se(VI) and Se(IV) oxyanions by natural microbial consortia was measured in sediment slurry experiments under nearly natural conditions, with no substrate added. Experiments were conducted with a wide range of initial Se concentrations and with sediment and water from three locations with contrasting environmental settings. The products of Se(VI) and Se(IV) reduction were enriched in the lighter isotopes relative to the reactants. Shifts of -2.6parts per thousand to -3.1parts per thousand and -5.5parts per thousand to -5.7parts per thousand, respectively, were observed in the Se-80/Se-76 ratio. These isotopic fractionations did not depend significantly on initial Se concentrations, which were varied from 22 mug/l to 8 mg/l, or on geochemical differences among the sediments. These results provide estimates of Se isotope fractionation in organic-rich wetland environments but may not be appropriate for substrate-poor aquifers and marine sediments.

AB  - Rapid urbanization is accompanied with intense construction activities, which fundamentally changes the national landform, aggravates the destruction of geological environment, and catalyzes various landslides. Located in mountainous regions of western Hubei, China, Gaoleshan Town, Xianfeng County faces an immense threat from landslides. Taking this town as the object, this paper summarizes the development features of 18 geohazards and carries out a susceptibility evaluation for geohazards by the information method. Considering the scale probability, time probability, and space probability of landslides in the study area, the hazard zoning was carried out under two conditions of landslide volumes (> 50,000 m(3) and > 100,000 m(3)), with 10, 20, 50, and 100 years as the return periods. The hazard of each element at risk was calculated for each return period and each landslide entropy value. Furthermore, four elements at risk, namely, forest land, garden land, farmland, and grassland, were identified in the study area, and the return period of 50 years and landslide volume of 50,000 m(3) were selected. On this basis, the three-dimensional evaluation framework of risk-vulnerability-potential loss was implemented to evaluate the ecological risks of landslides. The research results provide a scientific basis for the ecological risk assessment of urbanization in western Hubei.

AB  - There are strong interactions between an economic system and its ecological context. In this sense, livestock have been an integral part of human economies since the Neolithic, contributing significantly to the creation and maintenance of agricultural anthropized landscapes. For this reason, in the frame of the ERC-StG project 'ZooMWest' we collected and analyzed thousands of zooarchaeological data from NE Iberia. By considering these data in comparison with ecological indicators (archaeobotanical remains) and archaeological evidence (settlement characteristics and their distribution) this paper seeks to characterize changes in animal production and the relationship between people, livestock, and their environment. These methods allow for an investigation of the topic at different scales (site, zone, territory) with a broad diachronic perspective, and for consideration of orography and cultural traditions alongside climatic factors. Through this integration of various streams of evidence, we aim to better understand the structure of ancient economic systems and the way they conditioned human decision-making on animal production. Results show a shifting relationship with the territory between the Bronze Age and Late Antiquity, in which market requirements and an economic model with a higher degree of integration increasingly influenced husbandry strategies. These processes are reflected in changes in land use and forms of territorial occupation, although along different rhythms and trajectories.

AB  - Background. The Angulo River has been subject to environmental deterioration as a result of agriculture practices and industrial discharges to its tributary. Goal. Determine the species of diatoms that indicate contamination and their distribution in the Angulo river, a tributary of the Lerma river. Methods. Twelve sites including 2 springs were selected during the low-water and post-rain periods of 2005. The samples were obtained by scraping the rocks to separate the attached diatoms. These were cleaned by oxidizing the sample with hydrochloric acid and hydrogen peroxide; permanent preparations were made with Naphrax (R) resin, for review with light microscopy. Results. 50 taxa belonging to 20 genera were identified, of which 5 species belong to central forms and 45 to pennate species. The taxa present in both periods were Achnanthidium minutissimum, Amphora pediculus, Luticola geoppertiana, Nitzschia amphibia, Nitzschia dissipata var. dissipata, Pleurosira laevis, Staurosira pinnata and Ulnaria ulna. The temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen and total dissolved solids in the Angulo river presented spatial variations and with it the species records. Conclusions. Representative taxa of eutrophic and non-eutrophic environments were found throughout the tributary, such as Nitzschia palea and Amphora pediculus, respectively. This study has provided relevant information regarding the presence and distribution of diatom species that can be used as bioindicators of environmental conditions. specific.

AB  - Large-scale afforestation is a common measure to control desertification and soil erosion, especially in China. However, the massive afforestation may consume excessive water resources and cause the severe water shortage in the arid and semiarid regions. To understand the water consumption characteristics of afforestation, this study identifies the afforestation area and chooses the Water Footprint (WF) and Ecological Water Deficit (EWD) as the indicators to assess its water consumption, taking the Inner Mongolia as the typical arid and semiarid study area. The results showed that afforestation area in Inner Mongolia increased by 38,397.38 km(2) and NDVI presented a rising trend during 2000-2015. The afforestation WF increased from east to west in Inner Mongolia, with a maximum difference of 268.02 mm. Due to the difference distribution of precipitation, the afforestation EWD ranging from 74.6 mm to 609.9 mm which indicated that afforestation has suffered from different degrees of water shortage in Inner Mongolia. In the long term, afforestation might exacerbate the water shortage and soil erosion in Inner Mongolia. Therefore, afforestation should take full account of local water conditions, and government should seek other ways such as conserve natural vegetation to make the restoration more sustainable.

AB  - In a rapidly changing world, quantifying ecosystem resilience is an important challenge. Historically, resilience has been defined via models that do not take spatial effects into account. These systems can only adapt via uniform adjustments. In reality, however, the response is not necessarily uniform, and can lead to the formation of (self-organised) spatial patterns - typically localised vegetation patches. Classical measures of resilience cannot capture the emerging dynamics in spatially self-organised systems, including transitions between patterned states that have limited impact on ecosystem structure and productivity. We present a framework of interlinked phase portraits that appropriately quantifies the resilience of patterned states, which depends on the number of patches, the distances between them and environmental conditions. We show how classical resilience concepts fail to distinguish between small and large pattern transitions, and find that the variance in interpatch distances provides a suitable indicator for the type of imminent transition. Subsequently, we describe the dependency of ecosystem degradation based on the rate of climatic change: slow change leads to sporadic, large transitions, whereas fast change causes a rapid sequence of smaller transitions. Finally, we discuss how pre-emptive removal of patches can minimise productivity losses during pattern transitions, constituting a viable conservation strategy.

AB  - Antarctic seabirds well adapted to extreme environments often deal during their life cycle with sub-optimal conditions and occasionally with severe environmental stress. Climate changes, pollution, habitat loss, increasing human presence can all significantly affect organism's health status from molecular to individual up to population level. In the present study, erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities (ENAs) and white blood cells (WBCs) differential were investigated in 19 adults of Adelie penguin (Pygoscelisadeliae) breeding at Edmonson Point, Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA n. 165) in the Ross Sea. Micronuclei (MN) accounted for 10.50% of observed abnormalities in penguin erythrocytes while kidney-shaped nucleus (KSN) was the most abundant (20.88%). Heterophils (HE) were the most common WBC (36.93%) in agreement with the generic avian leukocytes profile while eosinophils (EO) were the lowest (7.45%). A low number of lymphocytes were detected resulting in a higher heterophils to lymphocytes ratio. ENAs and H:L ratio are confirmed as reliable indexes of penguin's health status since they reflect their individual adaptation during breeding season. These baseline data will be useful for future studies as indicators of penguin's health status mainly as response to environmental changes.

AB  - Ecosystem risk assessments after oil spills need at least one biological component's response to have some degree of understanding of the risks associated with the spill. In this study, crude oil spill impacts were studied under a spill scenario in Iskenderun Bay, which is a highly prone area to oil tanker accidents due to the high levels of transpassing. The study evaluated phytoplankton communities' response in 4 different seasons. Photosynthetic pigments data, obtained by HPLC, was used to assess community shifts of phytoplankton under different doses of the crude oil. It was found that the time of year of incidence is critical to understanding the consequences because a highly significant response difference was detected, which is more than an order of magnitude between winter and fall seasons. Due to physical conditions of seawater and initial phytoplankton compositions, the ecosystem showed more tolerance to the crude oil in winter than other seasons. EC50 values varied between 11.5 and 122.3 mu g/L total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) concentrations for all seasons. It is shown that the time of the year and known TPH concentrations of the seawater can possibly tell us about the potential impact of an oil spill in this region.

AB  - A novel label-free fluorescence assay for detection of Hg2+ was developed based on the Hg2+-binding single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and SYBR Green I (SG I). Differences from other assays, the designed rich-thymine (T) ssDNA probe without fluorescent labelling can be rapidly formed a T-Hg2+-T complex and folded into a stable hairpin structure in the presence of Hg2+ in environmental drinking water samples by facilitating fluorescence increase through intercalating with SG I in one-step. In the assay, the fluorescence signal can be directly obtained without additional incubation within 1 min. The dynamic quantitative working ranges was 5-1000 nM, the determination coefficients were satisfied by optimization of the reaction conditions. The lowest detection limit of Hg2+ was 3 nM which is well below the standard of U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. This method was highly specific for detecting of Hg2+ without being affected by other possible interfering ions from different background compositions of water samples. The recoveries of Hg2+ spiked in these samples were 95.05-103.51%. The proposed method is more viable, low-costing and simple for operation in field detection than the other methods with great potentials, such as emergency disposal, environmental monitoring, surveillance and supporting of ecological risk assessment and management.

AB  - Dogs discriminate human direction of attention cues, such as body, gaze, head and eye orientation, in several circumstances. Eye contact particularly seems to provide information on human readiness to communicate; when there is such an ostensive cue, dogs tend to follow human communicative gestures more often. However, little is known about how such cues influence the production of communicative signals (e.g. gaze alternation and sustained gaze) in dogs. In the current study, in order to get an unreachable food, dogs needed to communicate with their owners in several conditions that differ according to the direction of owners' visual cues, namely gaze, head, eyes, and availability to make eye contact. Results provided evidence that pet dogs did not rely on details of owners' direction of visual attention. Instead, they relied on the whole combination of visual cues and especially on the owners' availability to make eye contact. Dogs increased visual communicative behaviors when they established eye contact with their owners, a different strategy compared to apes and baboons, that intensify vocalizations and gestures when human is not visually attending. The difference in strategy is possibly due to distinct status: domesticated vs wild. Results are discussed taking into account the ecological relevance of the task since pet dogs live in human environment and face similar situations on a daily basis during their lives.

AB  - A variety of environmental problems have been observed in the Changjiang River Estuary and adjacent coastal area, including eutrophication, harmful algal blooms (HABs), and hypoxia in recent decades. Application of sedimentary biogenic element indicators on the study of paleoenvironment can reconstruct environmental evolution history of waters. Two Pb-210-dated cores were collected from the Changjiang River Estuary (S3) and adjacent coastal area (Z13), and total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), biogenic silicon (BSi), total phosphorus (TP) and phosphorus (P) species were analyzed. Three stages of environmental changes are deduced by the nutrient sedimentary records. First, nutrient concentration increased rapidly since the 1950s, which attributed to agriculture development and overused chemical fertilizers. Second, nutrient concentration kept high and primary production began to promote during the 1960s to 1980s, while diatom abundance and proportion began to decline since the 1970s, accompanied by reduced SiO32- concentration and flux from the river. Third, due to several dams and bridges constructed, river runoff and coastal hydrodynamic conditions reduced to a certain extent since the 1990s, which aggravated the unbalance in nutrient structure. Multi-nutrient proxies in sediment can reflect the natural environm-ental changes as well as influence of human activities.

AB  - Commercial buildings are central to cities and contribute significantly to the urban demand for natural resources, including freshwater. Green building benchmarking tools include more efficient water use as key indicator of sustainability. This paper explores options for substituting mains drinking water with an alternative, non-potable water source on a fit for purpose basis. The research findings are based on a monitoring study of a commercial building in Brisbane, Australia that is harvesting rainwater for meeting non-potable water demand. The results demonstrated that the system is only achieving moderate reliability in meeting demand due to operational problems. The case study analysis has highlighted the need to include validation and monitoring to ensure the system is operating as per design intent. The paper also investigates the potential of other local, non-potable water sources for high-rise commercial buildings, in particular air conditioning condensate and groundwater inflow to a basement wet well. The paper concludes by comparing the advantages and disadvantages of different local water sources which highlights the need to undertake a site specific investigation to identify a suitable alternative water source, which considers O&M complexity and the capacity of facilities management.

AB  - Wet sediments of a former water reservoir were discovered during an archaeological rescue excavation. Vegetation and environmental changes taking place in the mediaeval suburbs of Prague, Czech Republic, from the tenth to the middle of the fourteenth century were investigated. The origin and function of the water reservoir was revealed using a multi-proxy approach that combined the results of macrofossil, pollen, diatom, antracological, archaeo-zoological and sedimentological analyses. Gradual changes of the surrounding vegetation were documented. Field indicators increased in time, whereas proportions of broad-leaf trees and shrubs decreased; proportions of ruderal plants increased continually. A gradual decline of semi-natural hygrophilous vegetation was accompanied by an inverse tendency in trampled vegetation. All these trends indicate an intensification of human activity around the pool. A similar intensification of anthropogenic influence is clearly visible in the development of the aquatic environment. According to the diatom composition, the base of the profile is the result of sedimentation in considerably oligotrophic conditions. A successive deterioration of water quality was documented by various organisms (diatoms, green algae, water macrophyta, fishes and intestinal parasites). The high content of dissolved nutrients, probably connected with anoxia, could have caused the disappearance of both diatoms and fishes.

AB  - Changes in the Mondego estuary (Portugal) fish assemblage were documented with a long-term monitoring program between June 2003 and March 2010, during which several extreme environmental events occurred, including severe droughts and heavy precipitation. The structure and composition of the fish assemblage was analyzed based on a set of indicators: dominance, diversity, evenness, and composition in functional groups (ecological and feeding guilds). Higher species number, diversity, and evenness were observed in the dry periods. Variations in the relative abundance of the ecological guilds were also observed: in dry years, estuarine residents were the most abundant group, while in typical and rainy years, the marine estuarine-dependent species increased in abundance. Among the feeding guilds, the most abundant group was the invertebrate and fish feeders. Planktivorous and invertebrate feeders occurred in higher abundance in dry years, while the opposite was verified for omnivorous species. The mean trophic level of the fish assemblage increased during the drought period, constantly decreasing afterward, which could be attributed to an increase in predators in dry years. The cumulative responses of estuarine fish assemblages to ongoing climate changes and discrete extreme weather events confirm their importance as indicators of environmental changes.

AB  - The degree and spatial distribution of boreal forest ecosystem degradation in Russia are not well known. The objective of this study is to develop an interpretation basis for analysis of satellite remote sensing data using a set of indicators characterizing the ecological situation and the degree of industrial pollution. European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Landsat Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS) data are used in combination for this purpose, along with an exceptionally extensive in situ data set of ground measurements of spectral radiance of pine biocenose components, and the results of moss chemistry and bio-indicator studies from the ecologically stressed St Petersburg region. It is shown that ERS SAR images provide an assessment of forested area distribution and forest type classification. The main factors of variability in parameters such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) that are most strongly related to in situ indicators reflecting the state of the forest are identified. A supervised classification of forest degradation was performed on the basis of the NDVI values from the Landsat images. The results obtained make it possible to specify the areas at a local level and perform regional assessments. The potential for multi-temporal ERS SAR and multi-spectral sensor observations to trace the dynamics of changes in forest ecosystems is evaluated.

AB  - Soil nematodes were used as bioindicators to compare possible differences in soil ecological conditions in Douglas-fir forests harvested by clearcutting and by two partial-harvesting systems, namely shelterwood and extended rotation. An unlogged forest block was used as a control treatment. The pre- and post-harvest comparisons were based on total abundance of the nematodes, their trophic structure, and relative abundance of the nematode taxa found in the four blocks. Tbe nematode and soil data were obtained bimonthly over a year. Pre-harvest nematode abundance and taxonomic composition were similar at the four blocks. Post-harvest data were obtained 6-7 months after the harvesting treatments were Instituted. The post-harvest abundance at the three logged blocks was reduced to varying levels as compared to the control block, and analysis of variance showed that the severity of impact of the harvesting treatments on nematode abundance ranked as: clearcut congruent to shelterwood > extended rotation congruent to unlogged control. However, the taxonomic and trophic structures of the nematode community, which consisted of 48 taxa in these forests, were only slightly altered by any of the harvesting treatments as shown by maturity and diversity indices and by multivariate analysis.

AB  - Diatom assemblage structure on natural and artificial substrata was related to lotic physical habitat characteristics in an agricultural basin in Minnesota. We found 59 species across the basin, but species richness at individual sites ranged from 4 to 25 (median 16) on natural substrata and 9 to 23 (median 15) on artificial substrata. Most species were rare, with nearly half appearing at fewer than 3 sites. The most abundant taxa were biraphid diatoms (relative abundance >28% in most cases). Rank correlations of guild relative abundance from the artificial substrata (Achnanthes, biraphid, silt-tolerant) were strongest with % bank erosion and the Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index riparian subscore, both of which were negatively correlated. Diatom assemblages from natural substrata showed strong rank correlations between % canopy coverage and the Achnanthes, biraphid, rheophilic, and silt tolerant guilds. Relative abundance of stalked diatoms and the width of the streams at flood were also strongly correlated. TWINSPAN, and subsequent Kruskal-Wallis testing of differences in habitat condition between the site groupings, provided similar results. Relative abundance of Molloy's Achnanthes, biraphid, and stalked guilds, and the relative abundance of silt tolerant taxa (Bahls's siltation index) appear to have potential for bioassessment of physical habitat in streams of agricultural drainages.

AB  - This study has developed and verified clam transplantation for marine pollution monitoring in Kuwait and has assessed its reliability for monitoring pollution by heavy metals through laboratory and field transplantation experiments. In field experiments, live specimens of the clam Circenita callipyga were transplanted, either suspended in seawater or buried in sand, to 11 coastal sites in Kuwait; subsamples of transplanted clams were recovered at intervals over a 6-month period. In laboratory experiments, heavy metal accumulation for 36 days and depuration (body's release of pollutants) for 60 days in small and big clams were investigated. Clams subsampled in laboratory and field experiments were analyzed for Hg, Cu, V, Cd and Pb. Results showed the ability of clams to survive under the transplantation conditions. Accumulation of biofouling materials was a problem at only two transplantation sites and was overcome by periodic cleaning. Statistical analysis of laboratory experimental data showed significant accumulation of all test metals and significant depuration of Hg, Cu, V and Cd. Rates of metal accumulation and depuration differed in relation to clam size class. Field experiments indicated statistically significant increases in Hg and Cu concentrations in the transplanted clams at most stations, no change in Cd concentrations and an increase or, occasionally, a decrease in V and Pb concentrations.

AB  - High ambient temperature negatively affects gas turbine performance, especially in a tropical climate. Cogeneration improves fuel utilization by taking advantage of the energy discharged as waste heat in the exhaust gases. This case study assesses the effects of high ambient temperature on the performance of a natural gas-based cogeneration plant in Barranquilla, Colombia, a location with a hot and humid tropical climate throughout the year with an annual average temperature of 27.4 degrees C. The cogeneration plant encompasses gas and vapor turbine generation, supplementary fire, waste heat recovery, and process heat exchange. Validated ASPENHYSYS (R) simulation allows comparing gas-turbine-alone indicators with those at ISO conditions, i.e., 15 degrees C and 101.3 kPa. Ambient temperature reduces gas turbine power output by up to 22% and decreases thermal efficiency by around 0.06% for every degrees C rise above ISO conditions. Cogeneration with and without supplementary fire increases power output by 17% and 5% compared to gasturbine-alone operation. The energy utilization factor increases by 27-37% without supplementary fire and above 37% with supplementary fire. Results give insight into the challenges of cogeneration plants in a tropical climate. Further studies should include the effects of high humidity on power plant performance and the potential benefits of cooling inlet air.

AB  - Proper treatment and careful management of sewage sludge are essential because its disposal can lead to adverse environmental impacts such as public health hazards, as well as air, soil, and water pollution. Several efforts are being made currently not only to safely dispose of sewage sludge but also to utilize it as an energy source. Therefore, in this study, initiatives were taken to valorize sewage sludge cake by reducing the moisture content and increasing the calorific value by applying a hydrothermal treatment technique for efficient energy recovery. The sludge cake treated at 200 degrees C for 1 h was found to be the optimum condition for hydrothermal carbonization, as, in this condition, the caloric value of the treated sludge increased by 10% and the moisture content removed was 20 wt.%. To recover energy from the hydrothermally treated sludge, a gasification technology was applied at 900 degrees C. The results showed that the product gas from hydrothermally treated sludge cake had a higher lower heating value (0.98 MJ/Nm(3)) and higher cold gas efficiency (5.8%). Furthermore, compared with raw sludge cake, less tar was generated during the gasification of hydrothermally treated sludge cake. The removal efficiency was 28.2%. Overall results depict that hydrothermally treated sewage sludge cake could be a good source of energy recovery via the gasification process.

AB  - Cyclocarya paliurus, an economically valuable tree species, has traditionally been used as a nutraceutical food or medicine in China. However, limited information is available on its genotype selection and cultivation under a wide range of environmental conditions for growth and targeted health-promoting substances. We studied the effects of genotype and environment, and their interaction on leaf triterpenoid content and tree growth for 12 genotypes of C. paliurus grown at four sites. We quantified the correlation between leaf triterpenoid accumulation and tree growth. The contents of cyclocaric acid B, cyclocarioside I, and arjunolic acid ranged from 0.06 to 3.89, 0 to 3.71, and 0.65 to 8.86mgg(-1), respectively. Three individual triterpenoids were primarily influenced by genotype (variation ranged from 53.7 to 68.0%), while environment accounted for most of the variation in total triterpenoid content and tree growth (71.3-89.5%). Most tested environmental parameters were significantly correlated to total triterpenoid content, but not to the contents of the individual triterpenoids measured. Growth in tree height and diameter at breast height were significantly negatively correlated with total triterpenoid content but were non-significantly correlated with individual triterpenoid contents. We conclude that genotypic selection, manipulation of environmental conditions, and implementation of appropriate silvicultural operations would be important strategies for increasing the accumulation of health-promoting phytochemicals.

AB  - 1. Ecologists have recognised several factors that may explain the distribution of species in a metacommunity. These factors may be related to the dispersal of individuals among the patches and environmental conditions.
   2. Here, we attempted to determine which of the four different metacommunity frameworks (patch dynamics, mass effect, neutral processes, and species sorting) explain the distribution of Arctiinae moths in Brazilian savanna areas with different tree species richness.
   3. The Arctiinae moths were categorised as habitat specialists or generalists, common or rare, and belonging to the tribes Arctiini and Lithosiini. We hypothesized that environmental variables best explain the abundance and occurrence of habitat specialist species, common species, and members of Lithosiini; whereas spatial processes are more closely related to habitat generalists, rare species, and members of Arctiini.
   4. Contrary to our expectations, we found that the species sorting (mainly dictated by the species richness of trees) best explained the variation in abundance and occurrence of the majority of species groups. Spatial processes (more related to patch dynamics, mass effect, and neutral), although they were significantly related to some species groups, were not strong enough to explain the distribution of these species in the study area.
   5. The plant species richness was the most important environmental condition, related to moth species niches. Therefore, species sorting best explained the distribution of the species of Arctiinae in the Brazilian savanna.

AB  - Multiple Sclerosis is a demyelinating disease of the CNS and the primary cause of neurological disability in young adults. Loss of myelinating oligodendrocytes leads to neuronal dysfunction and death and is an important contributing factor to this disease. Endogenous oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), which on differentiation are responsible for replacing myelin, are present in the adult CNS. As such, therapeutic agents that can stimulate OPCs to differentiate and remyelinate demyelinated axons under pathologic conditions may improve neuronal function and clinical outcome. We describe the details of an automated, cell-based, morphometric-based, high-content screen that is used to identify small molecules eliciting the differentiation of OPCs after 3 days. Primary screening was performed using rat CG-4 cells maintained in culture conditions that normally support a progenitor cell-like state. From a library of 73,000 diverse small molecules within the Sanofi collection, 342 compounds were identified that increased OPC morphological complexity as an indicator of oligodendrocyte maturation. Subsequent to the primary high-content screen, a suite of cellular assays was established that identified 22 nontoxic compounds that selectively stimulated primary rat OPCs but not C2C12 muscle cell differentiation. This rigorous triaging yielded several chemical series for further expansion and bio- or cheminformatics studies, and their compelling biological activity merits further investigation.

AB  - The first finds of the REE-bearing silicates in the Kamchatka island-arc system were reported from K-Na alkaline trachytes from a large volcanic body of Bolshoi volcano in the back-arc zone of the Sredinny Ridge volcanic belt (56A degrees 24'10aEuro(3) N and 157A degrees 56'45aEuro(3) E) of Kamchatka. Chevkinite microlites are found in a trachytic groundmass in association with microlites of ferropigeonite, ferroaugite, anorthoclase, Na-sanidine, richterite, apatite, Nb-bearing ilmenite, zirkelite, baddeleyite, and zircon. The chevkinites from the Bolshoi volcano trachytes have higher Nb and Zr and similar REE contents compared to the chevkinite-group minerals from igneous rocks formed in different geodynamic settings. The crystallization conditions for chevkinites from Bolshoi volcano were determined by comparing the compositions of trachytes and their mineral assemblages with those of trachytes from Belogolovskii volcano of Sredinny Ridge, Kamchatka. The results show that chevkinites were formed during prolonged crystallization of a trachytic magma under reducing conditions at ranging from -1.36 to -1.55 NNO, relatively low temperatures of 794-741A degrees C, and moderate HF concentrations of magmatic fluids (0.003-0.0029 mol/dm(3)). These results, combined with the other data, are of crucial interest for studies of the REE budget during the evolution of high-alkaline magmas and can be used as indicators for determining the nature and role of different magma sources in the active continental margin setting of Kamchatka.

AB  - The model that chronic arsenic (As) exposure causes many teratogenic consequences is tested. Ancient northern Chilean populations appear to be optimal to undertake such a study as these populations are believed to have been largely stationary and ingested significant As levels over time. The Camarones River water, along the Atacama Desert, has extreme As values, 100 times above the norm. We tested the hypothesis that ancient populations, starting with the Chinchorro culture, 5000 years B.C., were significantly affected by this heavy metal and massive arsenic contamination played a role in the origin of Chinchorro artificial mummification practices. We examined 199 skeletons, housed at the Museo Arqueologico San Miguel de Azapa, Universidad de Tarapaca, Arica, Chile, searching for seven teratogenic related pathological conditions: cleft palate, polydactyly, syndactyly, spina bifida, club foot, eye malformations, and hip joint dislocation. Of the seven pathological conditions under assessment, only spina bifida was clearly found in the surveyed sample. Thus, the As teratogenic hypothesis cannot be fully demonstrated. However, the Presence of spina bifida in the three valleys suggests a genetic-environmental interplay within the populations. The endemic presence of As in both the Chinchorro mummies and their material culture do strongly support the As hypothesis as a valid explanation for why the Chinchorro first began to anthropogenically mummify their dead.

AB  - Fossil and Recent specimens of the Mediterranean bryozoan Myriapora truncata show considerable intra- and intercolonial differences in branch diameter and zooid size. Statistically significant variability occurs within colonies, between colonies within sites, and between sampled sites, while the presence of intracolonial variability clearly shows that branch diameter is largely controlled by environmental parameters. The three structural traits measured ( branch diameter, zooid size and zooid depth) do not correlate, thus indicating a disconnection between the controls on overall zooid size and branch diameter. Possible environmental parameters that may have an influence on morphology are temperature, food supply or current energy. Whereas current energy has an effect on the colony branching pattern ( branch spacing), there are indications that temperature may be the main, but not the only, parameter controlling zooid size, and it is suggested that food supply largely determines the branch diameter in M. truncata. However, the identification of the decisive factors and quantification of the relationships between environmental and morphological change is beyond the scope of this study. The results nevertheless show that, if the control factors of morphological variability can be ascertained in Recent M. truncata, this species may prove to be an indicator of environmental conditions and their change at different spatial and temporal scales in Cenozoic to Recent Mediterranean habitats.

AB  - Objective:The fresh solid manure from veterinary medical teaching hospitals contains, as a result of therapeutical treatments of the patients many drugs and their residues which are excreted by faeces and urine. Antibiotical and antiparasitical compounds reach millimolar concentrations. Analyses of their decomposition within the solid manure are not available.
   Material and methods:The calculation of drug decomposition is presented following their stability against degradation by light, air, hydrolysis, heat and alkaline pH as listed in reviews. Furthermore, experimental data from decomposition in excret-soil and substance-soil mixtures, liquid manure and surface water sediments were used. Besides the punctual general evaluation of solid manure of large animals of the clinics of Veterinary Faculty of the University of Giessen, where no animal urine was mixed with the manure.
   Results:The drug decomposition is increased on the basis of combination of destructive conditions. Following, the composition of solid manure, optimated conditions of storage and regrouping are important for destruction of therapeutics.
   Conclusions and clinical relevance: The manure should be deposited for one year before application to fields. The use of several groups of drugs should be restricted to essential situations: The aminoglycosides dihydrostreptomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin and neomycin have high chemical and physical stability. Tetracyclines are adsorbed to cationic structures of soil.

AB  - Over the last 5 decades, the fulfillment of maternity wishes in solid organ transplanted women has become a reality. Despite pregnancy contraindication in transplanted women during the early post-transplant period, such a condition can be overcome after 12 months if patients show a good clinical evolution and do not present other general pre-conceptional findings. This article presents the case report of a young female liver transplanted patient that used symptothermal method as a reliable family planning method. After her gestational contraindication was lifted, observation of biological fertility indicators and fertility-guided sexual intercourse helped her fulfill her maternity wish and conceive and carry out a healthy offspring. Based on this case and on the available bibliographic evidence, this paper reviews the potential implications of the use of this kind of approach as a safe and effective alternative to assisted reproduction technology in the management of potential infertility problems in the young female transplanted population, a population which according to literature has higher rates of unsuccessful parenthood and might also be more vulnerable to iatrogenicity of ovarian hyperstimulation process and to multiple pregnancy.

AB  - Background Stress is a dynamic construct that predicts a range of health behaviors and conditions, including binge eating and excess weight. Thus far, there have been limited and inconsistent findings regarding stress responses in binge-eating disorder (BED) and insufficient consideration of temporal patterns of stress responses across the weight spectrum.
   Purpose The present study used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to examine stress reactivity (i.e., the magnitude of the initial stress response), recovery (i.e., how long the stress response lasts before returning to baseline), and pileup (i.e., accumulation of repeated experiences of stressors and responses over time) as predictors of binge-eating symptoms (BES) and food craving in BED.
   Methods Adults with BED (N = 115) completed a 7 day EMA protocol assessing stressful events, perceived stress, binge eating, and food craving prior to being randomized to a behavioral intervention.
   Results Generalized estimating equations indicated that moments of greater stress pileup predicted greater subsequent BES (within-person effect). Participants with higher perceived stress and pileup reported greater overall BES and craving, and those with better recovery reported higher overall craving (between-person effects).
   Conclusions Findings highlight the importance of considering the dynamic nature of stress responses and, particularly, that the accumulation of stress over the day is an important trigger for BES.

AB  - The constant entry of microplastics in several environmental matrices has been of great concern to the scientific community and to society in general, mainly due to the mysteries that surround the implications of this pollutant in the environment. Freshwater ecosystems are resources especially susceptible to variations in environmental quality, and the lack of data on the impacts caused by plastic fragments exacerbates the vulnerability of this environment. Considering the results of other studies, which demonstrate the increasing entry of polymeric fragments in the aquatic environment can lead to algae growth inhibition, an investigation was carried out to determine the current state of research on the interaction between microplastics and freshwater microalgae. In total, 20 scientific articles were analyzed. Different species were subjected to toxicological tests under controlled conditions in the laboratory with small microplastics (size range between 0.1 and 1000 mu m), primary and secondary microplastics of different types of polymer. Four toxicity class of indicators were chosen to assess the microalgae response to exposure to microplastic in the selected studies: growth inhibition; photosynthetic activity; pigment analysis; and enzymatic activity and oxidative stress. In this review, a critical analysis is made on the effects of the shape, size, concentration, and duration of exposure to microplastics and research gaps are identified to guide future research priorities in this area of study.

AB  - Soils provide the structural support, water and nutrients for plants in nature and are considered to be the foundation of agriculture production. Improving soil quality and soil health has been advocated as the goal of soil management toward sustainable agricultural intensification. There have been renewed efforts to define and quantify soil quality and soil health but establishing a consensus on the key indicators remains difficult. It is argued that such difficulties are due to the former ways of thinking in soil management which largely focus on soil properties alone. A systems approach that treats soils as a key component of agricultural production systems is promoted. It is argued that soil quality must be quantified in terms of crop productivity and impacts on ecosystems services that are also strongly driven by climate and management interventions. A systems modeling approach captures the interactions among climate, soil, crops and management, and their impacts on system performance, thus helping to quantify the value and quality of soils. Here, three examples are presented to demonstrate this. In this systems context, soil management must be an integral part of systems management practices that also include managing the crops and cropping systems under specific climatic conditions, with cognizance of future climate change.

AB  - Introduction: Water is a convenient environment for the spread of pathogenic bacteria. Their presence may result from contact with water through soil, air, and animal and human activity. The identification of microorganisms allows us to determine the biological properties, the possible epidemiological risk, and the sanitary condition of the surface water.
   Aim of the research: To analyse the presence of microbiological indicators in selected water samples collected in autumn, winter, and spring.
   Material and methods: The research sites included three rivers and two water reservoirs located in Swietokrzyskie voivodeship. The water samples were tested based on the presence of coliform, mesophilic, and psychrophilic bacteria.
   Results: The presence of E. coli was confirmed in all water reservoirs, but values above the standard limit were confirmed in just three cases (Wisla, Bernatka, and Emerald Lake). The results show that the changing microbiological parameters of the analysed water samples can result from different factors. The large number of bacteria in water can come from other local streams and groundwater, human and animal activity, and especially from influx of domestic wastewater. The sanitary state of surface water in Swietokrzyskie is consistent with data from other Polish voivodeships published in the literature.
   Conclusions: Microbiological pollution of surface water in Poland is a constant and underestimated problem. It can be a serious epidemiological threat, especially in mild winters and warmer summers.

AB  - There has been increasing interest in understanding real-world outcomes for individuals with serious mental illnesses (SMI). This study examined domain-specific skill knowledge, functional capacity, and neurocognition as predictors of naturalistic grocery shopping skill performance in forty-eight individuals with SMI. Participants completed measures of skill knowledge and general functional capacity (UCSD Performance-Based Skill Assessment - brief) as well as measures of neurocognition and symptoms. The Test of Grocery-Shopping Skills (TOGSS) assessed naturalistic shopping. TOGSS was significantly correlated with functional capacity, shopping skill knowledge, and neurocognition, but not symptoms. Multiple regression analysis was conducted with variables entered in 2 blocks. Skill knowledge and functional capacity were entered in block 1. Neurocognitive measures were entered in block 2 using forward entry. Skill knowledge was not a significant predictor of TOGSS when accounting for functional capacity and neurocognition. Functional capacity predicted TOGSS over and above skill knowledge and remained significant after accounting for the effects of neurocognition. Our findings indicate that functional capacity was associated with skill assessment under naturalistic conditions. Further, there was some, but not complete, overlap between neurocognitive and functional capacity predictors of naturalistic skill performance. Further development of naturalistic assessments may hold promise for interventions targeting real-world function.

AB  - Globally, marine species' distributions are being modified due to rising ocean temperatures. Increasing evidence suggests a circum-global pattern of poleward extensions in the distributions of many tropical herbivorous species, including the ecologically important rabbitfish Siganus fuscescens. Adaptability of a species to such new environments may be heavily influenced by the composition of their gastrointestinal microbe fauna, which is fundamentally important to animal health. Siganus fuscescens thus provides an opportunity to assess the stability of gastrointestinal microbes under varying environmental conditions. The gastrointestinal microbial communities of S. fuscescens were characterized over 2,000 km of Australia's western coast, from tropical to temperate waters, including near its current southern distributional limit. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene demonstrated that each population had a distinct hindgut microbial community, and yet, 20 OTUs occurred consistently in all samples. These OTUs were considered the 'core microbiome' and were highly abundant, composing between 31 and 54% of each population. Furthermore, levels of short chain fatty acids, an indicator of microbial fermentation activity, were similar among tropical and temperate locations. These data suggest that flexibility in the hindgut microbiome may play a role in enabling such herbivores to colonize new environments beyond their existing range.

AB  - Major sections of today's rivers are man made and do not provide the essential requirements for riverine fish. A nature-like fish by-pass system in Vienna-Freudenau was assessed for its function as a fish habitat. The study was conducted continuously over 3 years; 15 years after construction of the by-pass. The chosen nature-like construction of the by-pass system functions like natural tributaries. More than 17 000 fish and 43 species, including several protected and endangered species, in all life stages, including eggs, larvae, juveniles and adults, were captured. Furthermore, the indicator species of the free-flowing Danube, nase (Chondrostoma nasus) and barbel (Barbus barbus), migrated into the fish by-pass and successfully spawned before returning. Therefore, our results suggest that by-pass systems can function as an important habitat for the conservation of native fish fauna. The heterogenic habitat configuration provides conditions for all ecological guilds and, consequently, increases biodiversity. Finally, approved management tools are discussed. We suggest that fish by-pass channels may be suitable at other sites in the Danube catchment.

AB  - The objective of this work was to characterize the edaphic macrofauna in agricultural grain production systems under no-tillage and conventional tillage, in the Shoutheastern state of Piaui, in the Matopiba region, Brazil. Soil samples were taken from the 0.0-0.1, 0.1-0.2, and 0.2-0.3-m layers, with litter, in areas predominantly cropped with corn and soybean, under conventional and no-tillage systems, in soils with different textures. Fragments of native vegetation in adjacent areas were used as a reference. The edaphic macrofauna in the different land uses was identified down to family level, and the families were grouped according to their ecological functions. The most abundant groups in the sampled areas were Isoptera, Hymenoptera, and Coleoptera, the latter with the highest number of families. Principal component analysis revealed that the functional groups geophages/bioturbators, phytophages/pests, and predators/parasites were associated with clayey-silty soils, and detritivores/decomposers with sandy soils. Soil management systems change the community structure of edaphic macroinvertebrates in comparison with the natural Cerrado condition. No-tillage system promotes greater abundance and species richness than conventional tillage, and minimizes the impact of agricultural systems on edaphic macrofauna biodiversity.

AB  - Catchment urbanization perturbs the water and sediment budgets of streams, degrades stream health and function, and causes a constellation of flow, water quality, and ecological symptoms collectively known as the urban stream syndrome. Low-impact development (LID) technologies address the hydrologic symptoms of the urban stream syndrome by mimicking natural flow paths and restoring a natural water balance. Over annual time scales, the volumes of stormwater that should be infiltrated and harvested can be estimated from a catchment-scale water-balance given local climate conditions and preurban land cover. For all but the wettest regions of the world, a much larger volume of stormwater runoff should be harvested than infiltrated to maintain stream hydrology in a preurban state. Efforts to prevent or reverse hydrologic symptoms associated with the urban stream syndrome will therefore require: (1) selecting the right mix of LID technologies that provide regionally tailored ratios of stormwater harvesting and infiltration; (2) integrating these LID technologies into next-generation drainage systems; (3) maximizing potential cobenefits including water supply augmentation, flood protection, improved water quality, and urban amenities; and (4) long-term hydrologic monitoring to evaluate the efficacy of LID interventions.

AB  - Brazil's planned Sao Luiz do Tapajos dam is a key part of a massive plan for hydropower and navigable waterways in the Tapajos basin and on other Amazon River tributaries. The dam's Environmental Impact Study (EIA) illustrates the fragility of protections. EIAs are supposed to provide input to decisions on development projects, but in practice these studies tend to become formalities in legalizing prior decisions made in the absence of information on or consideration of project impacts. The EIA has a tendency to minimize or ignore significant impacts. Loss of fisheries resources is likely to be critical for Munduruku indigenous people and for traditional riverside dwellers (ribeirinhos), but the EIA claims that there is "low expectation that natural conditions of aquatic environments will be significantly altered". The destruction of Munduruku sacred sites is simply ignored. The Brazilian government's priority for the dam has resulted in blocking creation of the Munduruku's Sawre Muybu indigenous land and other indigenous lands throughout Brazilian Amazonia. With the exception of one legally recognized community (Montanha e Mangabal), non-indigenous ribeirinhos are considered as not 'traditional people'. Even the one recognized community is not considered to require free, prior and informed consent. The Sao Luiz do Tapajos case illustrates problems in decision making in Brazil and in many other countries.

AB  - A study of benthic foraminifera was carried out in sediment samples collected from the central Adriatic coast of Italy, near the Ancona harbour and the Falconara Marittima oil refinery, in order to validate and support their use as bioindicators of ecosystem quality. On the basis of a principal component analysis (PCA), three biotopes (following the bathymetric gradient) have been documented, showing that the distribution pattern of benthic foraminifera is principally related to riverine inputs, organic matter contents at the seafloor, and sediment grain size. We observed higher abundances of opportunistic, low-oxygen tolerant taxa along the coastline, thus being representative of polluted environmental conditions. Near the Falconara Marittima oil refinery, the microfaunal assemblages is characterized by the absence of living specimens and by a low diversity associated with the dominance of opportunistic species. At this site, aberrant tests were also found. The data point out that Ammonia parkinsoniana and Quinqueloculina seem to be the most sensitive taxa and can be considered as good bioindicators of environmental stress in this area. This study confirms that faunal composition and morphology of benthic foraminifera respond to human-induced environmental perturbations, making their study potentially useful for biomonitoring in coastal-marine areas.

AB  - We reconstructed oxygenation changes in the up-welling ecosystem off Concepcion (36 degrees S), Chile, using inorganic and organic proxies in a sediment core covering the last ca. 110 years of sedimentation in this area. Authigenic enrichments of Mo, U and Cd were observed between ca. 1935 and 1971 CE, implying a prolonged period with predominantly more reduced conditions in bottom waters and surface sediments. Significant positive correlations between redox-sensitive metals, algal sterols, biomarkers of micro-aerophilic and anaerobic microorganisms, and archaeal glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers point to a tight coupling among bottom water O-2 depletion and increased primary and export production. The time interval with low O-2 of ca. 35 years seems to follow low-frequency inter-decadal variation of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and it may have resulted in O-2 depletion over the entire continental shelf off Concepcion. Taking this together with the concurrent increase in sedimentary molecular indicators of micro-aerophilic and anaerobic microbes, we can suggest that changes in oxygenation of the water column are reflected by changes in microbial community. This study can inform our understanding of ecological consequences to projected trends in ocean deoxygenation.

AB  - This paper provides an overview of possibilities for determining tractor's engine load, fuel consumption and exhaust emissions in real operating conditions. The use of accumulated database in tractor's electronic control modules for the analysis of engine load, fuel consumption and exhaust emissions is analysed. The methodology for analysis of engine power, speed and exhaust emissions' dependencies, also for analysis of engine exhaust emissions is presented. This paper presents testing results of the unit combined of tractor "Massey Ferguson MF 6499" and drilling machine "Vaderstad Rapid" by engine load, fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. Drilling process time, engine load, fuel consumption and exhaust emission components' distribution are presented in different engine speed and cyclic fuel injection modes. Test results are analysed separately for technological drilling and work processes at the headland. In the technological process of drilling, if the tractor engine speed and, correspondingly, the transmission gear ratio were reduced to get the set working speed, fuel consumption decreased, CO and CO2 emissions varied slightly, but the NOx increased significantly. Significant part of exhaust emissions occurred at headlands. The conclusion is that the fuel consumption and exhaust emissions, including harmful components, can be reduced only by complex optimization of technological processes and tractor operating modes.

AB  - This modern distribution study from the southwest arm of Lake Malawi quantitatively relates variables of the lake environment to surficial assemblages of ostracodes and other paleoenvironmental indicators (molluscs, Botryococcus, fish, and charcoal) from 102 sites, across a gradient of littoral to shallow profundal conditions. The goal of this research is to use the resultant relationships to help quantify paleoecological interpretations of the fossil record from sediment cores. Site locations varied by depth (1-60 m) and adjacent shoreline environment. Thirty-three ostracode species are identified from 54 sites including four new, undescribed species of Cypridopsinae (2) and Limnocythere (2). Ostracodes are extremely abundant between 1 and 25 m water depth, but are rare to absent between 30 and 60 m. This disappearance is probably taphonomically controlled, with carbonate dissolution in the death assemblage since abundant live ostracodes have been found in the lake at greater than 30 m depth, where bottom sediments lack calcium carbonate. Constrained correspondence analysis (CCA) of ostracode species abundance suggests depth and dissolved oxygen (DO) content to be the primary environmental variables affecting their distribution. Additional CCA models using all biological indicators suggest limnologic variables correlated with depth (e.g., bottom water temperature and DO) and adjacent shoreline environment were most significant.

AB  - Forest environmental conditions are affected by climate change, but investments in forest environmental quality can be used as part of the climate change mitigation strategy. A key question involving the potential use of forests to store more carbon as part of climate change mitigation is the impact of forest investments on the timing and quantity of forest volumes that affect carbon storage. Using an economic optimization model, we project levels of U.S. forest volumes as indicators of carbon storage for a wide range of private forest investment scenarios. Results show that economic opportunities exist to further intensify timber management on some hectares and reduce the average timber rotation length such that the national volume of standing timber stocks could be reduced relative to projections reflecting historical trends. The national amount of timber volume is projected to increase over the next 50 yr, but then is projected to decline if private owners follow an economic optimization path, such as with more forest type conversions and shorter timber rotations. With perfect foresight, future forest investments can affect current timber harvest levels, with intertemporal linkages based on adjustments through markets. Forest investments that boost regenerated timber yields per hectare would act to enhance ecosystem services (e.g., forest carbon storage) if they are related to the rate of growth and extent of growing stock inventory.

AB  - The striking diversity of sexual dimorphisms in nature begs the question: Why are there so many signal types? One possibility is that ornamental traits convey different sets of information about the quality of the sender to the receiver. The colourful, pigmented feathers of male birds seem to meet the predictions of this hypothesis. Evidence suggests that carotenoid pigmentation reflects the nutritional condition of males during moult, whereas in many instances melanin pigmentation is a reliable indicator of social status. However, as of yet there have been no experimental tests to determine how these two ornament types respond to the same form of environmental stress. In this study we tested the effect of endoparasitic infection by intestinal coccidians (Isospora sp.) on tho expression of both carotenoid- and melanin-based ornamental coloration in captive male American goldfinches (Carduelis tristis). We found that the carotenoid-based plumage and bill coloration of parasitized males was less saturated than that developed by unparasitized males, but that the brightness and size of melanin-based black caps did not differ between the groups. These findings provide the most robust empirical support to date for the notion that carotenoid and melanin ornaments reveal different information to conspecifics.

AB  - Nowadays air quality is the main issue in urban areas that have been affecting human health, the environment, and the ecosystem. So, governmental authorities, environmental and health agencies usually need the prediction of daily air pollutants. This prediction is often based on statistical relations between various conditions and air pollution. This study aims to compare the performance of Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for predicting SO2 concentration in the air of the Tehran. Different parameters namely meteorological parameters, urban traffic data, urban green space information, and time parameters were chosen for the prediction of SO2 daily concentration. Considering result, the correlation coefficient (R-2), and root means square error (RMSE) of the MLR model are 0.708, and 6.025, respectively while these values for the MLP equal 0.9 and 0.42. According to the result of sensitivity analysis, the value of the one-day time delay, park indicator, season/year, and the total area parks were the main factors influencing SO2 concentration. MLP model suggested in this research could be applied to support, analysis, and improve predicting air pollution and air quality management. This study shows the importance of modeling and application of ANN in presenting management strategies to reduce urban pollution.

AB  - The thirteen springs of Cracow-Czestochowa Upland were analized in respected of their geological structure, hydrogeology, physical and chemical water conditions, and groundwater pollution. The study of the causes and consequences of land-use and other human induced changes was examined by the estimation of biodiversity and environmental requirements of individual species. The studied biotic variables in spring habitats referred to diatoms (algae), mosses, vascular flora and benthic fauna. The species presence was controlled by both natural and anthropogenic factors. The results showed that the heterogeneity of diatoms, mosses and vascular flora of springs are mainly constrained by physical and chemical water parameters. Among other factors reflecting species requirements (including benthic fauna) in the springs were the mineralogical diversification of bottom sediment, discharge and flow velocity, physical and chemical water parameters and anthropopressure. The most natural springs were large outflows Centuria and Blekitne Zrodla. The springs Proro and Laczki Kobylafiskie are among the most anthropogenically modified springs. Various taxa such as postglacial relict Crenobia alpina were found in selected springs (Pilica-Piaski and Centuria). Tracking changes in springs using hydrogeological monitoring and analysis of related bioindicators is the only valuable method for testing long-term trends in our environment.

AB  - Green supplier selection problem (GSSP) is viewed as multiple attributes group decision-making (MAGDM) issue that includes the green growth and influential factors within subjective and objective natures. Because of the expanding uncertain conditions of social and economic environments, some assessment factors are not sufficiently described by numerical appraisals and classic fuzzy sets. Moreover, supply chain decision makers (DMs) may not provide complete rationality under numerous viable choice circumstances. In this research, a new MAGDM model is proposed by interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (IT2TrFNs) via some matrices of possibilistic mean and standard deviation statistical concepts. A new weighting method of experts within the group decision-making process is developed based on possibilistic statistical information. Also, a new ranking process based on relative-closeness coefficients is presented to rank all green supplier candidates under IT2TrF uncertainty. Finally, this research offers an illustrative example in supply chain networks to appraise green supplier candidates in terms of some factors by the proposed model along with the comparison to a recent decision method.

AB  - Endocrine data from wild populations provide important insight into social systems. However, obtaining samples for traditional methods involves capture and restraint of animals, and/or pain, which can influence the animal's stress level, and thereby undesirable release of hormones. Here, we measured corticosterone, testosterone and progesterone in the hair of 482 wild-derived house mice that experienced sexual competition while living under semi-natural conditions. We tested whether sex, age, weight and indicators of sexual maturity, reproduction and social conflicts predict hormone concentrations measured in hair (sampling at endpoint). We show that body weight, sex and age significantly predict cumulative testosterone and progesterone levels, allowing the differentiation between subadults and adults in both sexes. Corticosterone was only slightly elevated in older males compared to older females and increased with the level of visible injuries or scars. Testosterone in males positively correlated with body weight, age, testes size, and sperm number. Progesterone in females significantly increased with age, body weight, and the number of embryos implanted throughout life, but not with the number of litters when controlled for age and weight. Our results highlight the biological validity of hair steroid measurements and provide important insight into reproductive competition in wild house mice.

AB  - Forest health is an important aspect of sustainable forest management. The practical significance of health assessments of forest ecosystems is becoming more and more prominent because good knowledge about the health level of forests and the causes of unhealthy forests enables the identification of proper actions for enhancing sustainable development of forest ecosystems. This paper evaluated the health status of the forest ecosystem of Mount Taishan using the spatial analysis technique of GIS (Geographic Information System) and local forest inventory data. A comprehensive indicator system that reflects the health status of forestsin the study areawas established. Based on this indicator system, the health level of each sub-compartment of the forests in the study area was assessed. The results show that the high-quality grade forest (80.4 ha) and healthy grade forest (2671 ha) accounted for only 23.5% of the total forest area of Mount Taishan. About 60.5% of Mount Taishan forest was in a sub-health status. The area of unhealthy forests was 1865 ha (accounting for 16% of the total forest area), of which about 98 ha was inextremely unhealthy conditions.Asmore than two-thirds of the forests in Mount Taishan are in a sub-health or unhealthy state, effective measures for improving forest health are in urgent need in the study area.

AB  - An efficient and sustainable animal production requires fine-tuning and control of all the parameters involved, But this is not a simple task. Animal farming is a complex biological system in which environmental parameters and management practices interact in a dynamic way. In addition, the typical non-linear response of biological processes implies that relationships across parameters that are critical to assure animal welfare and performance are difficult to determine. In this paper a novel decision support system based on environmental indicators and on weights, leg problems and mortality rates is proposed to address this issue. The data-driven modeling process is performed by a quantile regression forests approach that allows estimating growth, welfare and mortality parameters on the basis of environmental deviations from optimal farm conditions. Resulting models also provide confidence intervals able to deal with uncertainty. They are deployed in farm, offering an accessible tool for farmers, veterinarians and technical personnel. Experimental results involving 20 flocks of broiler meat chickens from different farms show the validity of the system, obtaining robust prediction intervals and high accuracy, namely over 81% for every model. The in-field use of the proposed approach will facilitate an efficient and animal welfare-friendly production management.

AB  - Wetlands are influenced by direct disturbances due to agricultural practices, as well as by indirect effects from the surrounding landscapes. Management and restoration require condition assessments, which are usually based on properties of the vegetation and soils near the surface. Less knowledge exists about the effects of disturbance deeper down the soil profile. In this study, multi-element analysis along soil profiles was used to assess changes due to past disturbances. Soil cores were obtained from undisturbed and disturbed Prairie Pothole wetlands in North Dakota, USA. The objectives were to: 1) assess the vertical variation in multi-element composition of wetlands soils, 2) interpret the differences between undisturbed and disturbed wetlands, and 3) determine the relationships between the environmental variables and multi-element concentrations. We expected that data on concentrations of elements, in addition to classical' assessments (organic matter, particle size distributions, profile descriptions), would provide more detailed information about the depth to which past disturbance could be detected. Classical methods of assessment of disturbance identified impacts down to 60cm depth, but the concentrations of Ca, Ba, Sr, Nb, La, Pr, Tb, Bi, Tl and Th showed that differences due to past disturbances persist to a depth of at least one meter.

AB  - This article presents a discussion about the issue of soil resource management in the context of sustainable development. These resources are one of the basic resources on Earth, conditioning the sustainable development of present and future generations by providing the capacity for food production. The study contains an indicator-based assessment of changes in available soil resources as a result of progressive urbanization processes in the suburban area of a big city. The case study was the Wroclaw Larger Urban Zone in Poland. The applied methodology allowed for the valorization of urban sprawl processes on agricultural land. As a result, municipalities were divided into groups that characterize different suburbanization processes and their impact on the available soil resources. By using the proposed approach, it is possible to support the spatial development management process in order to protect the valuable components of the environment. The results of the research show that 29 rural precincts located around Wroclaw have a high soil transition index (W >= 50), which proves their inefficient agricultural management system on a regional scale. The study is an attempt to answer a question on the practical implementation of sustainable development goals that were included in Agenda 2030.

AB  - Diatoms (Division Bacillariophyta) commonly dominate benthic algal communities in upland streams and are the major primary producers that sit at the base of food webs. Given their ecological importance, the aim of the present study was to investigate the spatial patterns of freshwater biofilm biomass and diatom assemblage composition in response to differences in physical and chemical variables in the Bremer, Logan and Albert catchments in south-east Queensland. Patterns in benthic diatom assemblage structure were examined during base flow conditions and the focus was on relating the spatial hierarchical interrelationships among ultimate (i.e. catchments and geology) and proximate (i.e. flow, nutrients, light, conductivity, pH and turbidity) environmental drivers. The spatial difference observed in the benthic diatom assemblages was predominantly driven by proximate environmental drivers, which, in turn, were affected by ultimate drivers. Flow played a critical role in controlling both biofilm biomass and affecting the occurrence of diatom taxa. Nutrients and light also played roles as limiting resources structuring biofilm biomass and the relative abundance of diatoms. Diatom growth form, cell size and attachment mode can be used to create a more quantitative and predictive approach to establishing relationships between diatoms and environmental gradients.

AB  - The change in environmental conditions and the level of anthropogenic disturbance affect the communities of floral visitors. Therefore, the community of floral visitors of Bursera copallifera in Jolalpan, Puebla, Mexico was identified and characterized, considering changes in some environmental variables (temperature, humidity and altitude) and the factors associated with a disturbance gradient. A multivariate quantitative index was used in order to calculate the disturbance in 13 zones of the locality. Three sites with different levels of disturbance were selected, and in each one, the floral visitors were collected. A total of 66 species were collected, belonging to 25 families, distributed in 5 insect orders. Hymenoptera and Coleoptera were the most abundant orders. Temperature and humidity were significantly different among hours and sites, and together with the disturbance factors, affected the community floral visitors structure and dynamics. The high-disturbance site had the lowest diversity, but the highest insect abundance. Apis mellifera was the most abundant species at the most disturbed site, but the disturbance effect was not clearly established due to the altitude variations among sites. The high diversity of insects found showed the importance of Bursera copallifera for this kind of ecosystems.

AB  - Volcanic areas are hostile environments where the release of toxic gases is added to the low pH and high temperature, subjecting living organisms to extreme conditions. High-temperature environments, particularly those associated with volcanic activity have been evolving on earth throughout time. The aim of this study is to contribute to increasing knowledge of these high-temperature events and describe their associated diatom assemblages. The fumarolic fields of SAo Miguel Island in the Azores Archipelago were selected as a case study due to its particular characteristics and were studied seasonally during 2007. Temperature, pH and conductivity variables were measured in situ. Other environmental data were available in the literature. Diatom diversity, assessed using the Shannon-Wiener Index (H), ranged between 0.02 and 4. Statistical analyses revealed that temperature is a significant driver for the distribution of diatom species. Achnanthidium exiguum Grunow, Nitzschia cf. thermalis var. minor (Hilse) Grunow, Pinnularia joculata (Manguin) Krammer, P. trivialiformis Lange-Bertalot & Metzeltin and P. subcapitata Gregory were prominent with relative abundance above 40% of diatom assemblages. Some diatom taxa with high relative abundance, such as N. cf. thermalis and P. joculata may be considered representative of thermal springs and may be considered important biological indicators of geochemical changes induced by volcanic activity.

AB  - We developed diatom-based prediction models of hydrology and periphyton abundance to inform assessment tools for a hydrologically managed wetland. Because hydrology is an important driver of ecosystem change, hydrologic alterations by restoration efforts could modify biological responses, such as periphyton characteristics. In karstic wetlands, diatoms are particularly important components of mat-forming calcareous periphyton assemblages that both respond and contribute to the structural organization and function of the periphyton matrix. We examined the distribution of diatoms across the Florida Everglades landscape and found hydroperiod and periphyton biovolume were strongly correlated with assemblage composition. We present species optima and tolerances for hydroperiod and periphyton biovolume, for use in interpreting the directionality of change in these important variables. Predictions of these variables were mapped to visualize landscape-scale spatial patterns in a dominant driver of change in this ecosystem (hydroperiod) and an ecosystem-level response metric of hydrologic change (periphyton biovolume). Specific diatom assemblages inhabiting periphyton mats of differing abundance can be used to infer past conditions and inform management decisions based on how assemblages are changing. This study captures diatom responses to wide gradients of hydrology and periphyton characteristics to inform ecosystem-scale bioassessment efforts in a large wetland.

AB  - Under scenarios of increasing climate aridity and human pressure, Ecosystem Sensitivity to Desertification (ESD) is one of the most important targets for sustainable land management. This process is particularly complex in the Mediterranean region since it involves multifaceted, interacting factors that depend on endogenous conditions and exogenous pressures. Environmental indicators quantifying the ESD level at local scale should reflect the interaction among biophysical and socioeconomic factors that are (directly or indirect) associated to soil and land degradation. This paper illustrates a Geographical Information System (GIS) investigating the main factors determining ESD at land unit scale. This tool incorporates a Decision Support System (DSS) capable to simulate the effect of short-term environmental changes on the ESD (hereafter 'DSS-ESI'). The final output of the DSS-ESI is a composite index of land sensitivity to desertification (ESI) calculated separately for representative land cover types. The illustrated system was supplemented by a web-based interface which estimates the overall level of land sensitivity under different climate, population, and policy scenarios. The paper illustrates the main results produced by the DSS-ESI in a study site application (Basilicata, Italy) and comments about its applicability to other Mediterranean areas. Monitoring systems like the one illustrated here may support local-scale responses to mitigate land degradation in the Mediterranean basin.

AB  - Environmental information obtained through Life Cycle Analysis techniques has been incorporated into a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). The solution of the model provides the optimal configuration and operation of an energy supply system to be installed, minimizing the environmental burden associated with production of equipment and consumption of resources. Starting from a superstructure of cogeneration system with additional components highly interconnected, the energy supply system was optimized considering specific demands of a hospital located in Zaragoza, Spain. The objective functions took into account the kilograms of CO2 released and Eco-indicator 99 Single Score. Also considered were price of energy resources, price and amortization possibilities of the equipment and options for selling surplus electricity to the electric grid. The effect of electricity generation conditions on the optimal configuration was examined by varying the source of electricity production in Spain and considering natural gas/electricity mixes from alternate countries. The ratio between local electricity emissions and natural gas emissions (alpha factor) was found to have the highest impact on the configuration of the system. Therefore the alpha factor could be considered the strongest influencing factor when deciding the optimal configuration of a system that minimizes environmental loads. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The evaluation of the environmental quality assumes great importance in recovery programs of degraded areas, which makes necessary the development of quantitative systems based on combinations of indicators that best represent the degradation or the ongoing recovery conditions. This work uses soil biological parameters, such as microbian biomass and dehydrogenase activity, in addition to the analysis of the plant material to verify the influence of the successive planting of legumes in a mined soil undergoing recovery. The microbian activity was determined through the quantification of the microbian biomass' carbon and nitrogen (BMC e BMN), the dehydrogenase activity and FDA hydrolysis, evaluated in a mine pit area after one, two and three years of consecutive planting of legumes, and in a tailing area after one year of planting a mixture of legumes (pigeon peas, velvet beans and sunn hemp). Those areas were compared to forest soil and areas with no planting. The use of biological indicators (microbian biomass and dehydrogenase activity) and the analysis of plant material in the evaluation of the adopted techniques and strategies revealed that the planting of legumes and its further incorporation promoted positive and gradual modifications in the degraded soil, mainly in the BMC in areas after the consecutive planting of legumes over the course of three years.

AB  - Estrogen plays an important role in skeletal physiology by maintaining a remodeling balance between the activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. In an attempt to decipher the mechanism through which estrogen elicits its action on osteoblasts, experimentation necessitated the development of a culturing environment reduced in estrogenic compounds. The selected medium (OPTI-MEM) is enriched to sustain cultures under reduced fetal bovine serum (FBS) conditions and is devoid of the pH indicator phenol red, a suspected estrogenic agent. This protocol reduced the concentration of FBS supplementation to 0% through successive 24 h incubations with diminishing amounts of total FBS (1%, 0.1%, and 0%). The protocol does not appear to alter the viability, cell morphology, or osteoblast-like phenotype of 7F2 and UMR-106 cell lines when compared with control cells grown in various concentrations of FBS. Although the rate of mitotic divisions declined, the 7F2 and UMR-106 cultures continued to express osteoblast-specific markers and exhibited estrogen responsiveness. These experimental findings demonstrate that the culture protocol developed did not alter the osteoblast nature of the cell lines and provides a model system to study estrogen's antiresorptive role on skeletal turnover.

AB  - The soft tissue of Mytilus californianus has the capacity to decrease its Cd concentration in the order of' clays. However, for medium-term (months) Pollution surveys it is necessary to find alternative structures capable of integrating Cd concentrations during longer periods of time. The recently deposited nacreous layer of the shell of M. californianus is proposed as Such a structure. Daily variability of Cd concentration in the Soft tissue and in the recently deposited nacreous layer of a natural population Of mussels was compared during a period of 26 days in organisms collected from an upwelling zone of British Columbia. Statistical analysis of the Cd concentrations indicated that the nacreous layer presented less significant differences between days than the associated soft tissue. Only one shell sample showed significant differences in Cd concentrations, probably related to environmental conditions and stress arising from Mussel population density. Experimental results carried out in the laboratory confirmed that the recently deposited nacreous layer of M. californianus is a better medium-term indicator of Cd in seawater, especially at low concentration exposures of this element, those similar to the ones encountered in natural environments.

AB  - Our objective was to investigate the potential utility of polychlorillated biphenyl (PCB) residues in fish tissue as an indicator of the relative motility of fish Species in Lake Logan Martin, a 6,179-ha reservoir located in east-central Alabama. Choccolocco Creek. a midlake tributary, was the site of deposition of PCBs and this embayment had the highest concentrations of PCBs. The relationship between PCB concentrations in fish muscle tissue and the distance of the fish, at capture, from the Choccolocco Creek embayment was used to infer the relative motility of 12 species of warmwater sport and commercial fishes. Regression analyses of PCB concentration versus distance suggested that species ranged from low motility (highly significant regression and relatively high R-2) to high motility (insignificant regression or relatively low R-2). Centrarchids were relatively immotile, moronids were relatively motile. and flathead catfish Pylodictis olivaris exhibited the most motility. Our results reflect long-term (perhaps lifetime) movements of fishes in one reservoir and provide motility information on spotted bass Micropterus punctulatus. blue catfish letalurus furcatus freshwater drum Aplodinotus grunniens and white bass Morone chrysops, for which little such information has been reported, Where PCBs Occur in relatively discrete areas of aquatic ecosystems, this method can provide a long-term perspective oil the movements of numerous fish species under similar environmental conditions.

AB  - Advances in technology and decreases in cost are making remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) practical and attractive for use in coastal resource management. They are also allowing researchers and managers to take a broader view of ecological patterns and processes. Landscape-level environmental indicators that can be detected by Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and other remote sensors are available to provide quantitative estimates of coastal and estuarine habitat conditions and trends. Such indicators include watershed land cover, riparian buffers, shoreline and wetland changes, among others. With the launch of Landsat 7, the cost of TM imagery has dropped by nearly a factor of 10, decreasing the cost of monitoring large coastal areas and estuaries. New satellites, carrying sensors with much finer spatial (1-5 m) and spectral (200 narrow bands) resolutions are being launched, providing a capability to more accurately detect changes in coastal habitat and wetland health. Advances in the application of GIS help incorporate ancillary data layers to improve the accuracy of satellite land-cover classification. When these techniques for generating, organizing, storing, and analyzing spatial information are combined with mathematical models, coastal planners and managers have a means for assessing the impacts of alternative management practices.

TI  - The formation of the business environment, its problems and outlooks
T2  - EKONOMICKY CASOPIS
LA  - Slovak
AB  - One defines business environment as economic conditions and prerequisites of activities, which depend on economic and political measures of the state. These to a various extent and intensity affect the firms from the outside environment. Such conditions include phases of economic cycle, GDP growth rate, inflation rate, balance of payments level, the results of state budget management, interest rate, and unemployment level. These indicators reflect individual types of the economic policy of the state.
   The first prerequisite of the ample business environment is the stabilisation of economic conditions, which is reflected by the relative growth of GDP at the retention of inflation rate within one digit range.
   The second prerequisite of suitable business environment is the functional system of supporting institutions. The decision-making sphere together with specialised organisations forms this system.
   Global situation of the business environment in Slovakia is a standard one and comparable with advanced countries. The Constitution of the Slovak Republic and the following legislation safeguard the freedom of property, privacy rights implementation, liberty of a contract, respecting of a priority will of participants in business relations, standard norms of public law, tax laws, law on banks, law on economic competition, law on bankruptcy and compensation, contracts on the support and protection of investments etc.
   The scope of legislation changes is, however, enormous and is characterised by a non-conceptual approach. Large quantity of new laws, direct and indirect amendments, decrees and governmental regulations represent non-transparent system, where even professional lawyers hardly orient themselves. The changes are hardly predictable and thus strategic and scheduling decisions by individual subjects are difficult to be made.
   Financial burden of the entrepreneurs in the Slovak Republic compared to that in advanced countries is unfairly high. According to the analysis prepared by the Institute of Slovak and World Economics (1999), total burden amounted in Slovakia 58%, in the EU countries (average) 39.5%.
   In a medium-term horizon it is inevitable to stimulate by legislation the business environment for small and medium entrepreneurs and for tradesmen. As a starting point to do this there should be a definition of possible changes in business environment in a medium-term horizon. Significant contribution to that could be the preparation of the medium-term financial outlook, definition of some priorities of the economic policy and preparation of the medium-term currency and budgetary policy.
   Economic potential of Slovakia continues its orientation mostly at big enterprises.
   The decision-making sphere does not pay an adequate attention to the small and medium enterprises in spite of some verbal manifestos. Business environment in Slovakia is more favourable for big enterprises. This has been motivated by the aim to retain employment and solvency.
   One of the tasks of the policy of the government is to create business environment. The result of co-ordinated activities of the government and its specialised organisations are such social and economic conditions that enable permanent stimulation and revitalisation, formation and expiration of small, medium and big subjects. The function and responsibility of the decision-making sphere at optimising the business environment is motivated by the following demands:
   fast innovative adaptation of individual subjects,
   efficiency and competitiveness of individual subjects,
   retention and gradual employment increase.

AB  - Harmful algal blooms (HABs) can be mitigated by employing physical, chemical, and biological control techniques to prevent eutrophication from pollution sources and restore environmental conditions. In this study, polymerized mesoporous zeolites (pMZ) were prepared by simple acid treatment and polymerization of ethylenediamine, then evaluated as adsorbents for the removal of key HAB indicators (chlorophyll-a and microcystin-LR) from aqueous solutions. The effects of treatment time on the pore structure of the pMZ were analyzed, as well as the effects of different chemical treatments during synthesis. The pMZ samples were characterized using nitrogen isotherms, X-ray fluorescence analysis, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy image analysis, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. In order to improve the removal efficiency, amine functional groups were grafted onto mesoporous zeolite. The pMZ prepared using ammonium hexafluorosilicate had a higher mesopore volume and surface area; therefore, this method is preferred for graft polymerization. The pMZ adsorption ability was evaluated for chlorophyll-a and microcystin-LR using Langmuir, Freundlich, and Sips adsorption isotherms. The results showed that pMZ was able to remove both algae bloom indicators from an aqueous solution. Specifically, pMZ exhibited a chlorophyll-a adsorption capacity of 26.76 mg/g and removed 80% of microcystin-LR in 25 min.

TI  - Soil mite communities (Acari: Mesostigmata) as indicators of urban ecosystems in Bucharest, Romania
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - The aim of the present study was to establish the effect of management type and of environmental variables on the structure, abundance and species richness of soil mites (Acari: Mesostigmata) in twelve urban green areas in Bucharest-Romania. Three categories of ecosystem based upon management type were investigated: protected area, managed (metropolitan, municipal and district parks) and unmanaged urban areas. The environmental variables which were analysed were: soil and air temperature, soil moisture and atmospheric humidity, soil pH and soil penetration resistance. In June 2017, 480 soil samples were taken, using MacFadyen soil core. The same number of measures was made for quantification of environmental variables. Considering these, we observed that soil temperature, air temperature, air humidity and soil penetration resistance differed significantly between all three types of managed urban green area. All investigated environmental variables, especially soil pH, were significantly related to community assemblage. Analysing the entire Mesostigmata community, 68 species were identified, with 790 individuals and 49 immatures. In order to highlight the response of the soil mite communities to the urban conditions, Shannon, dominance, equitability and soil maturity indices were quantified. With one exception (numerical abundance), these indices recorded higher values in unmanaged green areas compared to managed ecosystems. The same trend was observed between different types of managed green areas, with metropolitan parks having a richer acarological fauna than the municipal or district parks.

AB  - Microplastics have become an emerging concerned global environmental pollution problem. Their strong adsorption towards the coexisting organic pollutants can cause additional environmental risks. Therefore, the adsorption capacity and mechanisms are necessary information for the comprehensive environmental assessments of both microplastics and organic pollutants. To overcome the lack of adsorption information, five quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models were developed for predicting the microplastic/water partition coefficients (log K-d) of organics between polyethylene/seawater, polyethylene/freshwater, polyethylene/pure water, polypropylene/seawater, and polystyrene/seawater. All the QSPR models show good fitting ability (R-2=0.811-0.939), predictive ability (Q(ext)(2)=0.835-0.910, RMSEext=0.369-0.752), and robustness (Q(cv)(2)=0.882-0.957). They can be used to predict the K-d values of organic pollutants (such as polychlorinated biphenyls, chlorobenzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, antibiotics perfluorinated compounds, etc.) under different pH conditions. The hydrophobic interaction has been indicated as an important mechanism for the adsorption of organic pollutants to microplastics. In sea waters, the role of hydrogen bond interaction in adsorption is considerable. For polystyrene, pi-pi interaction contributes to the partitioning. The developed models can be used to quickly estimate the adsorption capacity of organic pollutants on microplastics in different types of water, providing necessary information for ecological risk studies of microplastics.

AB  - Ecosystem accounts, as formalized by the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting Experimental Ecosystem Accounts (SEEA EEA), have been compiled in a number of countries, yet there have been few attempts to develop them for the U.S. We explore the potential for U.S. ecosystem accounting by compiling ecosystem extent, condition, and ecosystem services supply and use accounts for a 10-state region in the Southeast. The pilot accounts address air quality, water quality, biodiversity, carbon storage, recreation, and pollination for selected years from 2001 to 2015. Results illustrate how information from ecosystem accounts can contribute to policy and decision making. Using an example from Atlanta, we also show how ecosystem accounts can be considered alongside other SEEA accounts to give a more complete picture of a local area's environmental-economic trends. The process by which we determined where to place metrics within the accounting framework, which was strongly informed by the National Ecosystem Services Classification System (NESCS), can provide guidance for future ecosystem accounts in the U.S. and other countries. Finally, we identify knowledge gaps that limit the inclusion of certain ecosystem services in the accounts and suggest future research that can close these gaps and improve future U.S. ecosystem accounts.

AB  - The purpose of the paper is to summarize the principles of harmonization of economic relations between participants of the agrofood market of Ukraine, in particular, the livestock products market, and to create a system of criteria for socio-ecological and economic assessment of the level of harmony of these relations with adherence to the principle of inclusivity. The results of a systematic review convincingly show that the basic principles of harmonization of economic relations between the livestock market participants shall be as follows: the principle of inclusivity, maximizing the mutual benefit of all parties to relationship, the consistency of their economic interests (or the principle of consensus), the principle of systematization, controllability, social fairness, openness and scientific validity. With the help of three indicator systems, namely: (1) criteria for assessing the socio-economic conditions of the livestock market entities, (2) criteria for assessing the development effectiveness and efficiency of the specified market entities, (3) criteria for assessing the harmonious relations of agricultural producers with other participants in relations on the product market animal husbandry, it is possible to systematically explore the economic environment in which modern economic relations between the livestock production market participants are formed, developed and transformed, and to find mechanisms for harmonizing such relations.

AB  - The Murray-Darling Basin in south-eastern Australia contains over 70,000 km(2) of wetlands and floodplains, many of which are in poor condition. In response, Australian governments have committed to a major restoration program, the Murray-Darling Basin Plan that includes management of 2,750 Gl of environmental water to protect and restore aquatic ecosystems. The restoration is being undertaken within an adaptive management framework that includes monitoring the outcomes of environmental flows in seven river valleys. This paper provides an overview of the 5-year monitoring project and some preliminary results. Monitoring design considered the Basin Plan's environmental objectives, conceptual models of ecosystem responses to flow, and an outcomes framework linking flow responses to the environmental objectives. Monitoring indicators includes ecosystem type, vegetation, river metabolism, and fish. Responses are evaluated to identify the contribution of environmental flows to Basin Plan environmental objectives and continual improvements in management. The program is unique in that it seeks to monitor long-term outcomes of environmental flows at the river basin scale. Despite many challenges, the monitoring has become a key part of the adaptive management of environmental flows in the Murray-Darling Basin.

AB  - In recent years, extreme climate conditions have resulted in uneven precipitations in Taiwan. The development of traditional water resources frequently suffers from protests of environmental groups, potential dam sites being hard-to-find, and other factors. The development of new water sources has been increasingly difficult. Sea water desalination has the advantages of a short construction time and easy expansion flexibility, making it an important alternative as a new water resource. In this study, the current proposal of Tainan's desalination plant was used as an example. Qualitative interviews and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) were used to explore the environmental impact assessment (EIA) commissioner's perceptions of the impact from the development of the desalination project. The results of the qualitative interview indicate that the main concerns of the EIA commissioners are whether the development could damage the marine ecological environment and its fishery resources, which may have adverse socioeconomic consequences. The AHP results show that the commissioners' priority of environmental impact is ecological environmental impact 36.9%, social impact 29.7%, economic impact 23.7%, and physical and chemical environmental impact 9.7%. The main concerns in each impact category are, respectively, marine ecological environment, land and ocean utilisation, fisheries, and air quality.

AB  - Moss crusts play important roles in biological soil crusts biomass and soil surface stabilization. However, because of increasingly intensive human activities, especially grazing, the growth and survival of shrubs are seriously threatened. This study aimed to test whether the presence of shrubs affects the physiological state of the bryophyte Syntrichia caninervis Mitt. in this desert ecosystem. We simulated animal-grazed shrubs at three levels in the Gurbantunggut Desert and compared these simulations to exposed areas, measuring the indicators of growth and stress tolerance exhibited by bryophytes. The results showed that the removal of shrubs significantly decreased chlorophyll fluorescence activity and soluble protein content in S. caninervis, especially under the total shrub removal treatment. The ratio between the total removal of shrubs and other treatments in antioxidative enzymes and in osmotic adjustment substances of S. caninervis exhibited two types of responses. With the exception of malonyldialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), the variables examined fitted as downward parabolic then upward parabolic temporal dynamics. The removal of shrubs is harmful to the survival of S. caninervis. In resource-constrained conditions, SOD is an important antioxidant enzyme that of peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT) and osmotic adjustment substances, for S. caninervis survival.

AB  - This study used the pearl cichlid Geophagus brasiliensis as a bioindicator to survey the health of the aquatic environment on four sites (P1, P2, P3 and P4) of the Mumbuca stream located at Monte Carmelo/MG, Brazil. The selection of different sites was made with reference to the gradient of urban activity and via physicochemical and biological evaluation of water quality and genotoxicity. The water quality index was classified as 'good' for P1 and P4, regular in P2 and 'poor' for P3. The micronuclei (MN) frequency obtained from blood analysis was in agreement with the water quality, such that the higher values of MN were detected in sites evaluated as poor. Water degradation conditions worsen according to the flow of the stream over the sites P1, P2 and P3, but for site P4, located after the Monte Carmelo Sewage Treatment Plant, improvements in the micronuclei frequency are detected. Our results showed high levels of potentially toxic metals (chromium, lead, aluminum and nickel) in specific stream sites (P2 and P3). We suggest that the micronuclei induction in G. brasiliensis could be due to the presence of these compounds. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The occurrence of emerging biological contaminants including antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and Faecal Indicator Bacteria (FIB) is still little investigated in developing countries under tropical conditions. In this study, the total bacterial load, the abundance of FIB (E. coli and Enterococcus spp. (ENT)), Pseudomonas spp. and ARGs (bla(TEM), bla(CTX-M), bla(SHV), bla(NDM) and aadA) were quantified using quantitative PCR in the total DNA extracted from the sediments recovered from hospital outlet pipes (HOP) and the Cauvery River Basin (CRB), Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India. The abundance of bacterial marker genes were 120, 104 and 89 fold higher for the E. coli, Enterococcus spp. and Pseudomonas spp., respectively at HOP when compared with CRB. The ARGs aadA and blaTEM were most frequently detected in higher concentration than other ARGs at all the sampling sites. The ARGs blaSHV and blaNDM were identified in CRB sediments contaminated by hospital and urban wastewaters. The ARGs abundance strongly correlated (r >= 0.36, p < 0.05, n = 45) with total bacterial load and E. coli in the sediments, indicating a common origin and extant source of contamination. Tropical aquatic ecosystems receiving wastewaters can act as reservoir of ARGs, which could potentially be transferred to susceptible bacterial pathogens at these sites.

AB  - This paper summarises the NPP studies developed so far in a wide range of environments from Venezuelan lowlands, midlands and highlands, as an example of a growing discipline in a Neotropical area. The studies discussed include both modern analogues from surface sediments and late Quaternary sequences combining pollen and spores with NPP analyses. Emphasis is placed on the utility of NPP as palaeoecological indicators both individually and collectively (NPP assemblages), as well as in combination with other proxies. The main advantages of using NPP instead of only pollen and spores are highlighted using case studies as examples. Among them, the occurrence of NPP in samples barren for pollen and spores, the independent indicator nature of NPP, and their capacity to reveal previously unnoticed environmental shifts (notably those related to local conditions), are emphasised. The main results obtained in all these analyses are discussed in the frame of several areas of the NPP study that are considered crucial (methods, taxonomy, indicator value and statistical treatment). Some ideas for future developments are proposed in each of these areas, and the need for closer collaboration among NPP specialists is strengthened, in a way towards unification and standardisation.

AB  - Wetland assessment has been a popular field of research worldwide. However, various indicators have been used in wetland assessment for different purposes and backgrounds and also because of the research limitations. Therefore, a more comprehensive, sound, and efficient indicator system is needed for researchers' referencing to evaluate wetlands. After an extensive review of wetland assessment literatures, the reported indicators were evaluated using the developed assessment system, based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) with three main goals: nature protection, function utilization, and sustainable development. Each indicator was evaluated using two methods. The first method was to study the percentage of the indicator application, and the second was to assess the weighted ratios assigned to the indicators according to principles of comparability, typicality, sensibility, and availability. The results of these two methods were compared to study the commonalities and specialties of the indicators. They also showed that some indicators were widely used, including biodiversity, weather and climate, hydrological change, and the output of wetland. On the other hand, other sustainable indicators were easily ignored, such as environmental carrying capacity and wetland planning. Furthermore, an indicator system for wetland assessment was structured and strategized to discuss how to choose indicators for wetland assessment under different conditions. The proposed approach can be used to guide the process of wetland assessments in the future.

AB  - Ground water drawn for various purposes, such as irrigation, drinking and industrial, is constantly on the rise in areas where surface water are sources nowadays scarce due to erratic rainfall and climatic conditions. Chloride and sulphate in ground water increase due to municipal and industrial waste dumped on the ground surface. Elevated concentration of chloride (Cl-) and sulphate (SO4-) in surface and ground water are common in all countries, and can serve as indicators of ground water pollution. We have to characterize the most prevalent natural and anthropogenic sources of chloride and sulphate in ground water and explore techniques that could be used to identify their source. There is an urgent need for additional solid-waste management capacity sites in many parts of developing countries. Current design, operation, closure, and post-closure activities for sanitary landfills do not guarantee sufficient public health and environmental protection of the groundwater resources near a landfill. While in the past, sanitary landfills have almost without exception contaminated ground waters in the vicinity of a landfill. Due to scarcity of hand, to many urban localities, people never mind having residents nearby a landfill site. Significant changes must be made in the approach used for landfill of metropolitan solid wastes. Chloride and sulphate may be taken as critical parameters in assessment of ground water quality.

AB  - Tuna farming is based on fishing bluefin tuna in their natural habit of the western Mediterranean and fattening them in floating cages. Although this type of aquaculture is expanding rapidly in the Mediterranean Sea, very little information is available for an environmental impact assessment and environmental monitoring of tuna ranching. Spatial and temporal scales of impact need to be established before the norms and regulations affecting this new branch of aquaculture can be properly implemented. The biotic indices measured pointed to detectable impact only under the cages, although multivariate techniques defined an environmental gradient of stressed macrofaunal assemblages. The benthic surveys carried out indicated that high impact was restricted to a radius of roughly 5 m from the cages with a transitional radius at 35 m. This zone was characterized by high densities of opportunistic species. There was a further zone of moderately stressed benthic environment extending to about 180-220 m from the cages. This moderately stressed zone exhibited slight changes in community structure, because the densities of some species were stimulated. At distances greater than 220 m from the tuna farm, the system apparently returned to normal conditions. The fallow period produced partial remediation of the area affected, except in the sediment underneath the cages where even a 6-month fallow period was not sufficient for the community to totally recover.

AB  - Recent empirical studies have tested the hypothesis of an Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) focusing primarily on the relationship between per capita income and certain types of pollutant emissions. Given the stock-nature of many pollution problems. emissions only partially account for the environmental impacts. Moreover, almost all of the studies have given consideration to little more than income levels as explanatory variables. This paper empirically tests the hypothesis of the EKC existence for a stock-sensitive indicator, that is, the percentage of protected area (PA) within national territory. It does theorize that economic growth is a necessary condition in order to better address environmental issues. But it also stresses that other variables (income distribution, education, information accessibility) may play a fundamental role in determining environmental quality. Contrary to other studies that mainly focus on the calculation of the income level corresponding to the transition point, this paper is more concerned with the calculation of environmental quality corresponding to that transition point, that is, the minimum level of environmental quality that a country is willing to accept. This paper highlights the idea that if the transition point is determined primarily by income level, social policies determine the level of environmental quality corresponding to that point, (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Enzyme activity plays an important role in the functioning of aquatic ecosystems. It is sensitive to changes in environmental conditions such as pH, temperature, and nutrient concentration. The objective of this work was to determine the acid phosphatase activity (AcPA) in the Almendares and San Juan rivers (western Cuba) and its relationship with physicochemical and microbiological indicators. For this purpose, AcPA, temperature, pH, total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, concentration of nitrates, nitrites, ammonium, phosphates, total heterotrophs, enterococci, Escherichia coli, thermotolerant coliforms, chlorophyll a, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were determined at three sampling stations on the Almendares River and at three sampling stations on the San Juan River. In addition, the nutrient pollution index (NPI) and the N:P ratio were calculated. In both ecosystems, spatiotemporal variability was observed in the enzymatic activity. In the Almendares River (polluted ecosystem), AcPA was positively correlated with nitrate concentration and COD, while in the San Juan River (slightly contaminated ecosystem), the AcPA correlated negatively with the pH and NPI and positively with the concentrations of total heterotrophs, Escherichia coli, chlorophyll a, and the N:P ratio. These results show the impact of anthropogenic pollution on AcPA in freshwater ecosystems with a tropical climate.

AB  - Vegetation recovery in severely disturbed alpine ecosystems can be accelerated through active restoration measures. This study evaluated the short-term effects of two restoration treatments, planting of propagated native Salix (willow) shrubs in three different densities (1, 2.5, and 4 plants/m(2)) and seeding of the native grass Festuca ovina (sheep fescue), in a disturbed alpine heathland. We evaluated natural vegetation recovery (i.e. vegetation cover, vascular plant species richness, and Salix recruitment) in permanent plots, 5 years after the implementation of restoration measures. The results showed that both treatments had positive but different effects on vegetation recovery; Salix plantings (with densities >= 2.5 plants/m(2)) increased vascular plant species richness and recruitment of Salix seedlings, whereas seeding of F. ovina increased bottom and field layer cover. Our results also show the importance of soil conditions for vegetation recovery, as moister plots with a higher percentage of fine soil substrate had a higher vegetation cover and vascular plant species richness. This study shows that different restoration treatments can work complementary and also highlights the importance of considering different indicators of vegetation recovery when evaluating the effectiveness of restoration measures.

AB  - Report cards are increasingly popular tools communicating the condition of coastal and riverine environments to environmental managers, stakeholders and the public, and synthesising complex data drawn from a range of indicators. Mud crabs have not previously been included in ecosystem health report cards in Australia or elsewhere but have been suggested as environmental indicators for tropical coastal marine environments in Australia. Mud crabs support commercial, recreational and Indigenous fisheries and their biology is relatively well known. For these reasons and due to their local relevance, mud crabs (Scylla serrata) were selected for long-term monitoring and inclusion in a report card for Gladstone Harbour, Australia. Three mud crab measures were identified to reflect the variety of pressures across Gladstone Harbour: abundance, prevalence of rust lesions and sex ratio. A standardised field monitoring program was developed to allow for ongoing scoring and reporting of the multi-metric indicator. An indicator scoring (distance from benchmark) and grading methodology was applied to the indicator and refined over the two years of monitoring. This article provides a novel framework for monitoring and scoring mud crabs for management purposes or for use in report cards, and outlines the process of developing an indicator for an iconic crustacean species.

AB  - Nutrient breakpoints are the concentration at which there is a fundamental change in phytoplankton responses to further increases in nutrient loading. The ecological implication is that nutrient breakpoints signal a community transition from a relatively stable state to an alternate or transition state with marked changes in structure and, by extension, function. Nutrient breakpoints for the total phytoplankton community and individual phytoplankton groups in response to increases in dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations were determined for two contrasting estuarine systems. Phytoplankton were exposed to increasing N addition scenarios (0-100 mu mol DIN L-1) under high and low irradiance conditions. Responses of total algal biomass, group diversity, and individual algal groups were determined after 72-h incubations in experimental bioassays. Phytoplankton from the low-salinity estuary exhibited higher DIN breakpoints (>double) than the high-salinity estuary while irradiance (20% vs. 40% of ambient) did not affect breakpoints. DIN additions changed algal group diversity, but community similarities were > 80%. Our results suggest that ambient DIN concentrations should not exceed breakpoint concentrations to prevent possible shifts from a stable to a transitional or alternate state. DIN thresholds should be 25 and 50 mu mol L(-1)for the high- and low-salinity estuaries, respectively. These levels should mitigate the risk of major alterations in phytoplankton community structure and function in these two estuarine systems.

AB  - Arthropods are the major part of the species on earth, theyparticipate significantly in sustaining agricultural ecological systems. Their participation makes them functional bioindicators for determining agro-ecosystem stability. Yet, their abundance and diversity in some terrestrial ecosystems are still undisclosed. This work was done to determine the diversity of arthropod fauna in agro-ecosystem of District Faisalabad, Pakistan to compare and analyze the diversity, abundance, and richness of species in different ecological conditions. A total of 245 species belonging to 10 orders,70 families and 2741 specimens were collected from agro-ecosystem. The diversity parameters used to analyze the diversity of arthropods are Shannon index, Evenness Margalef index, Simpson index and Sorenson similarity index. More distantly it was observed that the most abundantly found orders were Orthoptera, Diptera, and Hemiptera.

AB  - In the present study, the possibility of recovering both thermal energy and water for agricultural purposes from sewage is evaluated. A treatment plant, based on a sequencing batch biofilter granular reactor (SBBGR) followed by sand filtration and coupled with a solar wastewater source heat pump, was operated from September to November 2018 at a set-point temperature of 14 degrees C to verify the stability of heat recovery efficiency and the suitability of plant effluent to be reused for irrigation. Heat recovery did not influence the SBBGR treatment and disinfection efficiency, which removed about 90% of suspended solids, chemical and biochemical oxygen demand and ammonia, as well as 70% of total nitrogen, 3 log(10) units of Escherichia coli and more than 1 log(10) unit of Clostridium perfringens. Furthermore, after sand filtration, water quality complied with the standards for agricultural reuse currently in force in several countries. Energy extracted from SBBGR was mainly influenced by environmental conditions, affecting wastewater temperature, and also by wastewater composition, affecting the energy release due to bacterial metabolic activity for carbon and nitrogen removal. Notably, no evident deterioration of energy extraction efficiency from the SBBGR was observed, suggesting negligible fouling phenomena on the submerged thermal exchanger.

AB  - Chronic stress leads to poor well-being, and it has effects on life quality and health. Society may have significant benefits from an automatic daily life stress detection system using unobtrusive wearable devices using physiological signals. However, the performance of these systems is not sufficiently accurate when they are used in unrestricted daily life compared to the systems tested in controlled real-life and laboratory conditions. To test our stress level detection system that preprocesses noisy physiological signals, extracts features, and applies machine learning classification techniques, we used a laboratory experiment and ecological momentary assessment based data collection with smartwatches in daily life. We investigated the effect of different labeling techniques and different training and test environments. In the laboratory environments, we had more controlled situations, and we could validate the perceived stress from self-reports. When machine learning models were trained in the laboratory instead of training them with the data coming from daily life, the accuracy of the system when tested in daily life improved significantly. The subjectivity effect coming from the self-reports in daily life could be eliminated. Our system obtained higher stress level detection accuracy results compared to most of the previous daily life studies.

AB  - We studied patterns of phylogenetic and compositional diversity of fleas parasitic on small mammals and asked whether these patterns are affected by environmental variation or evolutionary/historical processes. We considered environmental variation via both off-host (air temperature, precipitation, the amount of green vegetation, latitude) and host-associated (phylogenetic and species composition) environments. The indicators of evolutionary/historical processes were phylogenetic and compositional uniqueness estimated via phylogenetic or compositional, respectively, beta-diversity of either fleas or hosts. We found that phylogenetic uniqueness of flea assemblages was the main predictor of their phylogenetic diversity in all realms. In addition, host phylogenetic diversity and uniqueness played also some role in the Palearctic, whereas the effect of the off-host environment was either extremely weak or absent. Compositional diversity of fleas was consistently affected by compositional diversity of hosts in all realms except the Neotropics. The effect of the off-host environment on compositional flea diversity was substantial in all realms except the Palearctic. No effect of latitude on either metric of flea diversity was found. We conclude that phylogenetic diversity of fleas is driven mainly by evolutionary/historical processes, whereas drivers of their compositional diversity are associated with current ecological conditions.

AB  - Ecosystem carbon use efficiency (CUEe), one of the most important ecological indicators of ecosystem, represents the capacity of transferring carbon from atmosphere to potential carbon sink. Understanding the variation of CUEe and its controlling factors is paramount for regional carbon budget evaluation. In this study, we conducted a synthesis of 50 field measurements on CUEe to examine the variations of CUEe across China's terrestrial ecosystems. The results showed that the CUEe values of China's ecosystems varied from - 0.44 to 0.53 with the mean value of 0.19. Grassland had a lower CUEe than forest, cropland and wetland. However, the apparent effects of vegetation types on CUEe were eliminated by accounting for the covariates of climate. Variations of CUEe were correlated with temperature (MAT), precipitation (MAP) and nitrogen deposition (Ndep) in different relationships depend on climate and Ndep condition. CUEe was increased with the augment in MAT only for wet and low Ndep ecosystems. Ndep facilitated the increase of CUEe for wet ecosystems while oppositely restrained the CUEe for dry ecosystems. The results clarify the integrated roles of climate and nitrogen deposition on variations of CUEe that would be valuable for regional ecosystem function evaluation.

AB  - Detailed measurements of physical, chemical and biological dynamics in groundwater are key to understanding the important processes in place and their influence on water quality - particularly when used for drinking water. Measuring temporal bacterial dynamics at high frequency is challenging due to the limitations in automation of sampling and detection of the conventional, cultivation-based microbial methods. In this study, fully automated online flow cytometry was applied in a groundwater system for the first time in order to monitor microbial dynamics in a groundwater extraction well. Measurements of bacterial concentrations every 15 minutes during 14 days revealed both aperiodic and periodic dynamics that could not be detected previously, resulting in total cell concentration (TCC) fluctuations between 120 and 280 cells mu L-1. The aperiodic dynamic was linked to river water contamination following precipitation events, while the (diurnal) periodic dynamic was attributed to changes in hydrological conditions as a consequence of intermittent groundwater extraction. Based on the high number of measurements, the two patterns could be disentangled and quantified separately. This study i) increases the understanding of system performance, ii) helps to optimize monitoring strategies, and iii) opens the possibility for more sophisticated (quantitative) microbial risk assessment of drinking water treatment systems.

AB  - Background: Liverwort heath is considered in Scotland to be one of the vegetation types most vulnerable to environmental change, yet detailed insights into its dynamics are lacking.Aims: To assess the nature and extent of plant compositional changes in liverwort heath over 50 years and relate this to environmental change drivers.Methods: Vegetation plots previously recorded 20 and 50 years ago were re-surveyed to assess changes in species composition, plot-level species richness and between-plot variability, using several -diversity indices and partitioning. The environmental indicator values of the species that showed most change were used to identify the environmental drivers of change.Results: Liverwort heath in north-west Scotland has undergone compositional changes over 50 years, becoming more heterogeneous, and losing some of its distinct character. Dwarf shrubs and specialist liverworts have decreased, while graminoids have increased. Partitioning of change in diversity indicated that mainly changes in species richness, rather than species turnover, have driven the taxonomic differentiation over time. Grazing, eutrophication and warmer and drier conditions were found to be potentially important drivers of the observed vegetation change.Conclusions: Our results highlight the vulnerability of liverwort heath to environmental change.

AB  - Diatoms are present in all types of water bodies and their species diversity is influenced greatly by environmental conditions. This means that diatom occurrence and abundances are suitable indicators of water quality. Furthermore, continuous screening of algal biodiversity can provide information about diversity changes in ecosystems. Thus, diatoms represent a desirable group for which to develop an easy to use, quick, efficient, and standardised organism identification tool to serve routine water quality assessments. Because conventional morphological identification of diatoms demands specialised in-depth knowledge, we have established standard laboratory procedures for DNA barcoding in diatoms. We (1) identified a short segment (about 400 bp) of the SSU (18S) rRNA gene which is applicable for the identification of diatom taxa, and (2) elaborated a routine protocol including standard primers for this group of microalgae. To test the universality of the primer binding sites and the discriminatory power of the proposed barcode region, 123 taxa, representing limnic diatom diversity, were included in the study and identified at species level. The effectiveness of the barcode was also scrutinised within a closely related species group, namely the Sellaphora pupula taxon complex and relatives.

AB  - In the semi-arid steppe rangelands of Central Turkey, Festuca valesiaca and Thymus sipyleus ssp rosulans have become the dominant species on degraded pastures. We hypothesized that decreases in species richness and abundance are correlated with increasing prevalence of these two species. Therefore, our objectives were to determine whether there are patterns in examined vegetation; how dominant species contribute to these patterns; and how patterns differ between grazed and ungrazed vegetation. We determined that protection from grazing increased species richness. Grazing significantly changed composition through decreasing total plant, forb, grass and E valesiaca covers, while substantially increasing T sipyleus cover. Topography, soil and grazing appear to impact the dominance of plant communities where F valesiaca and T sipyleus prevail. These two dominant species had a significant effect in shaping vegetation patterns. Based on regression analysis, alterations in species richness with changes in cover of forbs and shrubs were evident, and spatial heterogeneity of F. valesiaca and T sipyleus indicated unstable vegetative patterns in heavily grazed pastures and successional changes in protected pastures. Our study results identify E valesiaca and T sipyleus as indicator species of vegetation suppression in condition assessments of degraded steppe rangelands. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - It was evaluated, by indicators, the sustainability of the Ranch Temascaltepec Universitary Center, that belongs to the Autonomous University of the Mexican State. Starting from the characterization and diagnosis, it was designed a proposal of sustainable management of the natural resources. For the installation, operation and evaluation of some components of this proposal, experiments were made for three years. These included the comparative evaluation of plots for forage production in monoculture and association, the islands of multipurpose trees and the lots of contention of erosion with vegetative techniques. The forage yields improved gradually during the period of evaluation, with higher quality for the forages associated. The different tree species showed divergent degrees of adaptation and development, due to the adverse conditions of the soil and climate. The vegetative techniques were efficacious to stop the accelerated erosive processes. The comparison of the final state of the system with the initial state shows significant improvements for the majority of the environmental and social indicators, although the profitability was negative due to the high cost of the installation of the components. It was proved that there is utility in the methodology, both for the design and operation of the proposal as well as for the evaluation of sustainability.

AB  - The Baltic Sea is exposed to severe human impacts. Besides eutrophication and overfishing, a variety of chemical contaminants threaten the health of fish. During a cruise in December 2001, Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) were collected in the western and southern Baltic Sea, somatic condition factors were estimated, and different biomarkers of contaminant exposure were analysed. Additionally, various polychlorinated biphenyl congeners and organochlorine pesticides were measured in cod liver as more general indicators of pollution, not necessarily as the causative agents for biomarker signals. In most specimens, hepatic ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity and bile 1-OH pyrene, a common polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolite, were detectable. Both features indicate an induction of the CYP1A biotransformation system in response to toxic substances. The increased occurrence of DNA adducts in some of the specimens also indicates the presence of genotoxic substances. Acetylcholinesterase was inhibited, an indication of exposure to organophosphates, carbamates, or certain heavy metals, particularly in specimens taken at Wismar Bay and off the Lithuanian coast. In general, spatial differences in the biomarker responses as well as in contaminant loads were found, suggesting differences in physiologically active concentrations and mixtures of organic contaminants in this ecosystem.

AB  - Development of awareness and capacity is a central component to the delivery of ICM and spans from local communities to national-level politicians. Education and training activities associated with ICM must be extremely varied to match both the existing capacity and role that the stakeholders play within the process of ICM. Consequently, there cannot be considered any effective "generic" ICM training; training must be tailored to match the requirements of target groups. The transfer and uptake of good-practice thus becomes an important aspect of quality enhancement in ICM capacity development. Six case studies from the Asia-Pacific region are presented that show diverse and innovative examples of good practice. A comparative analysis of these case studies is carried out in terms of institutional level of impact. In addition a generic systems-based evaluation framework is used to determine the extent to which the training impacts upon ICM implementation indicators. It is concluded that the exchange, transfer, and translation to local conditions of appropriate good practice in ICM capacity development can be an important element in enhancing the impact Of ICM programs on the coastal environments and societies. Furthermore, there appears to be a positive link between the involvement of national/state/regional stakeholders in capacity-building initiatives and impacting a wider variety of indicators of ICM delivery.

AB  - A fundamental goal of ecology is to understand what controls the distribution and abundance of species. Both environmental niches and trade-offs among species in dispersal and competitive ability have traditionally been cited as determinants of plant community composition. More recently, neutral models have shown that communities of species with identical life-history characteristics and no adaptation to environmental niches can form spatial distribution patterns similar to those found in nature, so long as the species have a limited dispersal distance. if there is a strong correlation between geographic distance and change in environmental conditions, however, such spatial patterns can arise through either neutral or niche-based processes. To test these competing theories, we developed a sampling design that decoupled distance and environment in the understory plant communities of an old-growth, temperate forest. We found strong evidence of niche-structuring but almost no support for neutral predictions. Dispersal limitation acted in conjunction with environmental gradients to determine species' distributions, and both functional and phylogenetic constraints appear to contribute to the niche differentiation that structures community assembly. Our results indicate that testing a neutral hypothesis without accounting for environmental gradients will at best cause unexplained variation in plant distributions and may well provide misleading support for neutrality because of a correlation between geographic distance and environment.

AB  - The salt-water intrusion into a lagoon system of the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve was assessed during 1 year and related to the marine component of the larval fish assemblage. This system is environmentally complex because of the penetration of marine water, and the discharge of surface and subterranean water. Biological samples were collected during four field expeditions from October 1996 to August 1997. Surface circular tows with 500-mum-mesh conical plankton nets with a flowmeter were made during the day. Position, depth, temperature and salinity were recorded at each sampling station. All fish larvae were removed from the samples and identified to the lowest possible taxon. Ichthyoplankton abundance was normalized to 100 m(3) of water. The distribution patterns of the carangiid Oligoplites saurus, the herring Opisthonema oglinum, the dragonet Diplogrammus pauciradiatus and members of the Tetraodontidae were related to the wind-driven circulation pattern of the lagoons obtained using a numerical model. The analysis of the distribution of ichthyoplankton showed that these species are good indicators of the spatial salinity variations controlled by the hydrodynamic characteristics of the system. The spatial use of these estuaries as a habitat for fish larvae is therefore strongly influenced by salinity distribution, itself modulated by annual variation of wind stress.

AB  - Soil quality is an increasingly useful and necessary concept in the design of sustainable farming systems, at paddock, farm and catchment levels. This paper reviews the concept of soil quality, and discusses its importance to the sustainability of agroecosystems. It is generally accepted that "soil quality" be measured by an appropriate suite of characteristics that includes chemical, physical and biological indicators that focus on the functions of soil in the ecosystem. Although there may be some merit in defining soil quality with the same rigour as is used to define water quality, and applying soil quality criteria in the same way as water quality criteria, it is likely that site and purpose specific criteria will be more useful at the farm level. Research continues to determine the optimum set of soil quality indicators that are sensitive to soil quality dynamics relevant to grazing systems in the Central Tablelands of N.S.W., and can be adopted and interpreted by farmers. One such project has commenced at Orange Agricultural College - The University of Sydney, and is described in detail. It is expected that this research will help provide farm managers with additional tools to assess the condition and trend of soil quality on their farms, and the impact of their decisions regarding farm design and management.

AB  - The heterogeneous nature of pyrogenic carbon, also known as black carbon (BC), still stands in the way of comprehensive determination of the total proportion of combustion derived carbon in environmental mixtures. Char and charcoal occur mostly in the low temperature region of the BC continuum and as such are characterized using specific chemical and physical properties that set them apart from the more condensed forms of high temperature BC species (i.e., soot). This study aimed to assess the feasibility of using the molecular marker levoglucosan, exclusively produced from hemicellulose/cellulose combustion, to characterize and quantify char BC in the environment. A second objective was to compare the results from the molecular analysis with those from acid dichromate oxidation in terms of char BC characterization.
   First, we examined levoglucosan levels in a suite of BC materials derived from biomass burning and fossil fuel combustion, as well as non-BC materials (coal and melanoidin). The results confirm that levoglucosan is exclusively in the char BC materials, derived from biomass combustion. However, a large variability in levoglucosan yield was observed among the different char BC materials.
   To understand the causes of such variability, we analyzed levoglucosan in three series of laboratory-produced char samples (n = 23) made from honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa Torr.), cordgrass (Spartina spartinae) and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) under controlled combustion conditions (150-1050 degrees C, 0.5-5 h). The results show that temperature is the most influential factor affecting levoglucosan yield in char. Combustion duration, on the other hand, had no influence on yield. Notably, levoglucosan was only detectable in low temperature char samples (150-350 degrees C), with maximum yield obtained from samples produced at 250 degrees C, regardless of plant species. Large differences in levoglucosan yield were also observed across species. This taxonomic difference could not be corrected simply on the basis of hemicellulose and cellulose content, indicating that the relationship between combustion and levoglucosan formation is a complex function of many factors. Our observations also demonstrate that levoglucosan can hardly be used quantitatively for the determination of char BC in environmental samples since such samples often represent mixtures of different chars characterized by variable levoglucosan yield. Acid dichromate oxidation, as opposed to the levoglucosan method, detected mid- to high temperature char BC ( >= 350 degrees C) but not low temperature char (<= 250 degrees C). Our results indicate that the overlap in the analytical windows of the two methods is limited to the upper limit of the latter.
   The study demonstrates that levoglucosan can serve as a good qualitative indicator for the presence of char produced under low temperature conditions in soil, sediments, and ultrafine aerosols. Although levoglucosan is not a proper quantitative proxy for char BC content in the environment, this molecular marker has a unique role in the current BC methods continuum because it traces combustion material often missed with most oxidation-based methods.

AB  - Functional diversity metrics have been suggested as important indicators of ecosystem functioning. We investigated the effects of land use mediated by local environmental variables on the fish assemblages' functional structure in 18 headwater streams distributed in the Upper Parana and Iguacu ecoregions. The species were characterized according to habitat use, food resource use, life history, and hypoxia tolerance. We calculated functional diversity indices [richness (FRic), evenness (FEve), divergence (FDiv), dispersion (FDis), diversity (RaoQ)] and functional rarity indices [distinctiveness (Disti), uniqueness (Uni)], and evaluated the effects of regional and local variables on these indices using generalized linear models. The results highlighted the occurrence of the most functionally distinct and unique species in the forested streams. Moreover, we observed higher FRic in streams sampled in argisol, with a high ammonia load and low habitat diversity. Forested and agricultural covers positively affected FDis and RaoQ. Urban cover had a negative effect on FDis and RaoQ, mainly due to the increase in generalist functional groups in urban streams. Our findings emphasize the importance of forested cover in maintaining specialized species in fish assemblages of streams and preserving functional diversity and ecosystem functioning. Furthermore, these results contribute to direct conservation and recovery measures in freshwater environments.

AB  - Nowadays, gait assessment in the real life environment is gaining more attention. Therefore, it is desirable to know how some factors, such as surfaces (natural, artificial) or dual-tasking, influence real life gait pattern. The aim of this study was to assess gait variability and gait complexity during single and dual-task walking on different surfaces in an outdoor environment. Twenty-nine healthy young adults aged 23.31 +/- 2.26 years (18 females, 11 males) walked at their preferred walking speed on three different surfaces (asphalt, cobbles, grass) in single-task and in two dual-task conditions (manual task-carrying a cup filled with water, cognitive task-subtracting the number 7). A triaxial inertial sensor attached to the lower trunk was used to record trunk acceleration during gait. From 15 strides, sample entropy (SampEn) as an indicator of gait complexity and root mean square (RMS) as an indicator of gait variability were computed. The findings demonstrate that in an outdoor environment, the surfaces significantly impacted only gait variability, not complexity, and that the tasks affected both gait variability and complexity in young healthy adults.

AB  - This study explored and applied the concepts of Fire Regulation Capacity (FRC) and Fire Protection Ecosystem Service (FPES) in the assessment of the effects of landscape change in a mountain fire-prone landscape in Portugal. We adopted a modeling and simulation approach using BFOLDS-FRM with landscape data for years 1990 and 2006 (observed) and with three landscape scenarios for 2020. Proxy indicators for FRC (burned area and fire intensity) and for economic damage by fire (loss of provisioning ES) were used to establish trends in the supply and value of FPES. We found decreased FRC to restrain simulated fires burning over 100 ha from 1990 on and to regulate Very High and Extreme fire intensity levels, particularly under our 2020 scenario of Forest expansion. FPES is also expected to decrease, as indicated by higher fire-related damages, particularly if fuel hazard increases in the landscape. However, there were differences among scenarios, suggesting potential trade-offs between FPES and the supply of provisioning ES. Planning and management in this and similar areas experiencing farmland abandonment must consider fire trends and patterns, since landscape change is a major driver affecting FRC and FPES, which may further be decreased by future climatic conditions.

AB  - Percentage Canopy Cover(PCC) has an important role in forest inventories and, as an ecological indicator, can also determine light conditions, habitats or microclimates. Canopy gaps, which are the result of natural causes or anthropogenic activities, have an important influence on the incoming light that controls how regeneration and the understory biota evolve. Unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) remote-sensing has become an efficient, increasingly used alternative method, with the advantage of spatially-explicit mapping of the smallest canopy gaps. Following endeavors for 'near-natural' silviculture vertical analyses of tree crowns could provide substantial information for a consecutive management. In this paper, UAV-based measurements of canopy cover, tree crowns and canopy gaps are made in a pure-beech pristine forest and a managed old mixed beech with oak stand. Very high resolution images (3-4 cm/pixel) were acquired and assembled into orthomosaics. The canopy gaps and the upper tree crowns were delineated and the PCC, area(A), perimeter(P) and position of each tree crown were determined. For canopy gaps, calculations of: area(A), perimeter(P), perimeter/area(P/A), circularity(C) and gap shape complexity index(GSCI) were made. The results represent the mentioned structural determinations and the spatial distribution of trees and gaps in both study plots, results which are further compared and discussed.

AB  - Due to the problem of identification, Chironomidae larvae, although very abundant, are often avoided or not properly used in bioassessment programs. The aim of this work was to test how different aggregation processes-taxonomic resolution and the random aggregation approach (best practicable aggregation of species-BestAgg) affect the analysis of chironomid communities regarding any information loss. The self-organizing map method, together with classification strength analysis and Spearman's rank correlation, revealed that the genus-level and BestAgg-abundance matrix most accurately approximated the species-level community pattern. The subfamily-level dataset was ineffective at presenting the chironomid community structure, with a substantially lower concordance with the species-level dataset. The biologic environmental gradients analyses presented the same set of important environmental variables for the species-level, genus-level, and BestAgg-abundance matrix. The indicator values analysis showed that indicator genera provide information very close to that gained from species indicators. According to our results, the numeric relationship between species and higher taxa influences taxonomic scaling, limiting Chironomidae family aggregation, with acceptable information loss only up to genus level. In addition, the BestAgg approach, with the maximum level of aggregation, properly assesses the community structure and consequently describes environmental conditions.

AB  - Lake Taihu provides vital ecological services for humans in China; it receives a great deal of attention regarding its ecological and environmental conditions. In this study, the ecological risks of eight individual polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in water were assessed using probabilistic distributions of the hazard quotient based on Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that the 95th percentile of the hazard quotients ranged from 0.00074 to 2.831, and the ecological risk of Flua was highest, followed by, in descending order of risk, B[a]P > Pyr > Ant > Phe > Flu > Ace > Chr. The probabilities of hazard quotients exceeding a decision criteria of 0.3 were 18.09%, 6.51%, 3.76%, and 2.85% for Flua, B[a]P, Pyr, and Ant, respectively, indicating their potential ecological risks to aquatic organisms. The spatial distribution of hazard quotients for these four individual PAHs with potential ecological risk were obtained using Geographic Information System (GIS), and similar spatial distribution patterns were also observed in the lake. The highest ecological risks of these four individual PAHs to aquatic organisms were found in Meiliang Bay, followed by Gonghu Bay and Xukou Bay. The uncertainty within the ecological risk assessment was also discussed.

AB  - Landscape is important in determining the composition of aquatic assemblage, and benthic invertebrates, particularly Chironomidae, are often used as bioindicators of environmental quality because their occurrence and distribution are influenced by different land uses. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of different land uses, considering three landscape scales (drainage basins, riparian buffer and streams), on chironomid assemblage. We sampled streams located in an agricultural matrix by collecting chironomid larvae and water samples and performed a landscape analysis using Geographical Information System techniques. The drainage basins had a high percentage of agricultural land use; in all of the drainage basins studied, 79% of the riparian buffer was not in accordance with Brazilian law. Cricotopus proved to be a good indicator of the agricultural conditions, whereas Thienemanniella and Rheotanytarsus proved to be indicators of exposed soil. Lopescladius was more sensitive to disturbance and was positively correlated with the presence of riparian vegetation. Although the variables at the local scale (stream) were responsible for a major change in the assemblage, the landscape attributes at large scales (drainage basin and riparian buffer) generated significant effects on Chironomidae fauna. Our results suggest the importance of the conservation of two larger landscape scales to support the equilibrium and maintenance of aquatic assemblage.

AB  - Perhaps no subject is more intriguing and complex than climate change and its effects on ecosystems and their biological communities. Changes in precipitation and snowmelt patterns, sea level rise, increased intensity of storms and wet-weather events, thawing permafrost, changes in vegetation and wildlife composition and distribution, and other effects present significant policy and land management challenges. Scientific modeling and analyses demonstrate that the effects of a changing climate are complex, with high variability over time, space, and species, including effects on benthic organisms. The variable effects of a changing climate complicate decision making, rendering scenario planning, adaptive management, and other management learning tools increasingly important. The very complexity of effects presents particularly difficult challenges for policy makers and resource managers because the available science often is highly uncertain. Thus, other decision support tools are needed to help managers anticipate and respond to local and regional conditions. Effective policy and management require relevant science to inform decision making. Key needs include more assessments of ecosystem and species trends and their possible linkage to climate change and a better understanding of the interplay of multiple variables, how different management regimes might affect ecosystems and species survival, and how to apply risk management tools and adaptive management to resource issues.

AB  - Vulnerability assessment is an important step in developing adaptation strategies. For biogeographically vital and extremely heterogeneous regions like Himalaya, assessing vulnerability as an inherent characteristic becomes crucial. The present study assesses the inherent vulnerability (IV) for farming communities of Himachal Pradesh as a function of sensitivity and adaptive capacity using social and ecological indicators, group-decision methods, and Geographical Information System (GIS) tools. Data for 13,877 villages in three different biogeographical zones (Lower Himalaya (LH), Middle Himalaya (MH), Trans-Himalaya Tibetan Plateau (THTP)) was collected from secondary sources. Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) was applied to weigh the social and ecological indicators. Weighted indicators were finally aggregated to generate the final inherent vulnerability index (IVI). The IVI values for different biogeographical zones (LH 0.35 + 0.13, MH 0.42 + 0.14 and THTP 0.30 + 0.17) reveal that geographical location of zones played a decisive role in distribution of IV. MH showed the highest vulnerability due to fragile inherent biophysical and socio-economic conditions. The findings of this study will aid in better resource management for farming communities to enhance the agriculture capabilities of vulnerable zones. The findings of this study also have inference for developing adaptation strategies for present stressors in the region.

AB  - The relative sea-level highstands in Thailand from the Mid-Holocene to the present day have been studied in horizontal tidal erosion notches and inside a sea cave in limestone and marble coastal cliffs through C-14 dating of rock oysters. Rock oyster ages progressively increase with elevation up from a similar to 1 m wide living oyster band at the present day sea level and up into the roof of the notch. The oldest age obtained is 6513-6390 cal yr B.P. (Mid Holocene) for a shell at an elevation of 2.5 +/- 0.1 m above present day MSL. However, comparison of the results from different sites shows that oysters of the same age occur at different elevations due to different environmental conditions: similar to 6000 cal yr B.P. old oysters can be found from between 3.8 +/- 0.1 m to 2.5 +/- 0.1 m above present day mean sea level. A conservative view of these results from Thailand is that relative sea levels were 2.5 +/- 0.5 m above the present sea level during the temperature maximum of the Holocene Climactic Optimum between 7000 and 6000 cal yr B.P. Since then, relative sea levels fell until the onset of the Industrial Revolution.

AB  - Native saproxylic (deadwood dependent) beetle species living in exotic forest plantations may provide environmental services for forestry companies, but their sensitivity to forest management makes them difficult to conserve. Here, we used Structural Equation Models (SEM) to assess the role of the endemic beetle Acanthinodera cumingii in native forest and exotic pine plantations as an ecosystem engineer that improves the quality of deadwood for saproxylic beetles. Deadwood quality in native forest and pine plantations was accounted for by A. cumingii density and deadwood decay stage. In native forest, diversity of predators and fungivores responded positively to deadwood quality, while in the pine plantations the diversity of all functional groups, with exception of detritivores, was positively affected by deadwood quality. In addition, all saproxylic functional groups were less diverse in stumps than in logs. These findings suggest that A. cumingii larvae contribute to make more diverse the assemblages of saproxylic beetles in deadwood. We suggest that sustainable management of pine plantations based on the role of A. cumingii as an ecosystem engineer and biodiversity indicator must necessarily consider forest practices intended to mimic the native forest conditions that regulate the deadwood decay dynamics.

AB  - Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is a widely used flame retardant that has increasingly been found as contaminant in aquatic environments. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the pollution level of TBBPA at six locations around Qingdao and assess its biotoxicity through a two-generation toxicity study looking at a copepod species. In the chemical monitoring, the concentration of TBBPA in seawater samples ranged from nd to 1.8 mu g/L. Next, the biological indicator monitoring used 1.8 a as the middle exposure concentration to perform quantitative evaluations of the influence of TBBPA on the demographic traits of Pseudodiaptomus inopinus. The results showed that copepods became more sensitive to TBBPA exposure even in environmental concentration (1.8 mu g/L) as the generations developed. The detrimental effects of TBBPA further increased naupliar mortality and impaired copepodite development to adulthood. This study demonstrated that the water pollution condition of TBBPA was measured at all 6 sampling locations of Qingdao. Therefore, the present results call for a decreased discharge of TBBPA into the marine environment to avoid impairing copepod reproduction and development. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study was the investigation of the antimicrobial activity expressed by Lactobacillus plantarum strains isolated from different fermented matrices (wines, cheese, fermented sausages, and sourdoughs). A total of 106 strains of Lb. plantarum (producers) were tested against 33 undesirable microorganisms (indicators), including both moulds and bacteria. The antimicrobial activity exerted by growing cells (GC) was evaluated by the spot-on-the-lawn, while the activity of cell free supernatants (CFS), neutralised CFS (nCFS) and CFS treated with proteases (pCFS) was assessed by the agar well diffusion assay. The antagonistic effect produced by GC of Lb. plantarum isolated from wines was higher than that exibited by cells isolated from other fermented matrices. Moreover, 5 CFS - all from wine strains - as well as the corresponding nCFS and pCFS were able to inhibit different bacteria and moulds. The results suggested a relationship between the origin of Lb. plantarum strains and their antimicrobial properties, while no relation was found between the intensity of inhibition and the origin of indicator strains. This fact highlights that the knowledge of conditions characterising different ecosystems can be helpful in the detection and isolation of Lb. plantarum strains to be used as protective agents.

AB  - Recent environmental legislation, worldwide, aims to restore and protect the quality of the marine environment. Within this context, in order to maintain the good functioning of marine ecosystems, sediment pollution monitoring is becoming increasingly important. Hence, for this contribution, the spatial distribution of Cd, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni and Pb accumulation areas were determined, for the sediments of the Basque continental shelf. Statistically-assisted Geographical Information System (GIS)-mapping techniques were used, in order to infer the processes responsible for such accumulations. Differences in contaminant entrance pathways were observed between sectors. However, hydrodynamic conditions favored the rapid dispersal of contaminants and their stable distribution. The methodology used resulted in a suitable approach for identifying contaminant distribution patterns, which could be used in environmental assessment processes. Nevertheless, an important knowledge gap on the distribution of contaminants in offshore sediments was identified. Extensions of actual monitoring programs are suggested, in order to improve the information available for identifying the behavior and process-drivers for contaminants in offshore systems. This would permit the achievement of a more complete approach, to understand the effects of land-derived contaminants, on offshore systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The behavior of fluoroquinolone antibacterial agents (FQs) during mechanical-biological wastewater treatment was studied by mass flow analysis. In addition, the fate of FQs in agricultural soils after sludge application was investigated. Concentrations of FQs in filtered wastewater (raw sewage, primary, secondary, and tertiary effluents) were determined using solid-phase extraction with mixed phase cation exchange disk cartridges and reversed-phase liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. FQs in suspended solids, sewage sludge (raw, excess, and anaerobically digested sludge), and sludge-treated soils were determined as described for the aqueous samples but preceded by accelerated solvent extraction. Wastewater treatment resulted in a reduction of the FQ mass flow of 88-92%, mainly due to sorption on sewage sludge. A sludge-wastewater partition coefficient (log K-d similar to 4) was calculated in the activated sludge reactors with a hydraulic residence time of about 8 h. No significant removal of FQs occurred under methanogenic conditions of the sludge digesters. These results suggest sewage sludge as the main reservoir of FQ residues and outline the importance of sludge management strategies to determine whether most of the human-excreted FQs enter the environment. Field experiments of sludge-application to agricultural land confirmed the long-term persistence of trace amounts of FQs in sludge-treated soils and indicated a limited mobility of FQs into the subsoil.

AB  - Liver, kidney and diaphragm samples of 57 roe deer and 58 chamois collected during the hunting season 1995 were examined for their heavy metal (Pb, Cd, Hg) concentrations. The possible influence of the parameters - sex, age, body weight, condition of heath, season, region, altitude, and habitat exposure were rested. Due to the suitability of wildlife as biological indicators, the measured concentrations provide information on the environmental pollution of their habitats.
   Lead concentrations (median content: ppm) were higher in chamois (kidney: 0.143; liver: 0.120; diaphragm: 0.112) than in roe deer (kidney: 0.100; liver: 0.082; diaphragm:0.050). The highest levels measured in diaphragm can be accounted for by a secondary contamination originating from the lethal projectile. Higher concentrations have been detected in the liver of male animals than female. The higher cadmium concentrations (median content: ppm) in roe deer (kidney: 1.333; liver: 0.120; diaphragm: 0.006) have been attributed to the different: grazing habits. A highly significant age dependency of the Cd concentration could be observed for both species of animals. The median mercury content (ppm) in roe deer (kidney: 0.026; liver: 0.012; diaphragm: 0.000) and chamois (kidney: 0.016; liver: 0.006; diaphragm: 0.006) was low. An influence of the season was seen in both species.

AB  - Path loss prediction is an essential technique in wireless radio network designing and development, it supports in perceiving the nature of electromagnetic radio signals in a particularized transmission medium. Varieties of empirical path loss prediction models are available for path loss calculations, but these models are complex and require information regarding environmental conditions for accurate prediction. In this paper, an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is explored for the prediction of path loss for multi-transmitter radio wave propagation. A drive test has been conducted for field measurement at Uttarakhand collecting RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) from an individual transmitter. The frequency of transmission of each transmitter is 1800 MHz respectively. An elementary four-layer ANFIS architecture has been optimally trained using RSSI data to accurately map the input values to the equivalent path loss values. The membership function is selected to provide an enhanced and stable mapping of the input to the corresponding output at the lowest number of epochs. The ANFIS model predicts the minimum value of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as compared to other path loss models. The obtained ANFIS model also validated a good generalization capability when deployed at a similar terrain. Developed path loss model exhibits desirable qualities for radio network planning i.e. simplicity, accuracy, and better generalization ability which is important for radio coverage prediction.

AB  - Aircraft engines are the main emission source of the aviation industry and this is a result of the entropy formation that occurs due to the combustion performance of engines. Entropy generation resulting from the irreversibility of engines increases environmental pollution due to inefficient fuel consumption. It is important to develop understandable and applicable criteria other than emission factors to examine the environmental sustainability of these processes and make impact assessments. In this study, first, the energy performance of a jet engine was investigated depending on the second law of thermodynamics. Then, different from the literature, an environmental impact assessment was made based on two criteria developed in this study. In addition, efficiency and environmental indicators were examined considering the improvement potential, and evaluated according to the criteria. According to the analysis, it was seen that the entropy production of the engine produces a very high pollution potential, according to the defined Carnot efficiency, but this effect can be significantly reduced with the improvement potential. It was also found that this potential effect of the jet engine, depending on the defined factor, has a higher effect of 128% when ideal conditions are taken into account. At the end of the study, possible effects of the improvement potential were evaluated and some suggestions were made in terms of environmental impact. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The work is devoted to solving the current scientific and practical problem of increasing the level of environmental safety of yeast production through the use of an alternating magnetic field (AMF) for wastewater treatment and disinfection. The list of industrial effluents' main treatment methods from organic, mineral, and biological pollution is determined. The advantages and disadvantages of these cleaning methods are established. The application of physicochemical technologies of wastewater treatment of yeast production in Ukraine and abroad is considered in detail; the characteristics of their application's physicochemical methods, industry, and conditions are determined. The prospects of using an AMF as a method of purification and disinfection of yeast production wastewater are noted. The physicochemical and microbiological composition of wastewater was studied with the help of physicochemical and microbiological analysis. After exposure to a magnetic field with a magnetic induction intensity of 75 mTl for 10 minutes, there was a decrease in the physicochemical index of chemical oxygen demand by 72 %. The degree of purification by other indicators is in the range of 30 - 50 %, and the degree of disinfection of microorganisms is 87 %. Further development of knowledge on the influence of AMF on the process of wastewater treatment of yeast production depending on its parameters and duration of action. The results of the study can be used to select treatment equipment at yeast plants.

AB  - Robust environmental assessments and contaminant monitoring in Antarctic near-shore marine environments need new techniques to overcome challenges presented by a highly dynamic environment. This study outlines an approach for contaminant monitoring and risk assessment in Antarctic marine conditions using diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) coupled to regionally specific ecotoxicology data and environmental quality standards. This is demonstrated in a field study where DGT samplers were deployed in the near-shore marine environment of East Antarctica around the operational Casey station and the abandoned Wilkes station to measure the time-averaged biologically available fraction of metal contaminants. The incorporation of DGT-labile concentrations to reference toxicity mixture models for three Antarctic organisms predicted low toxic effects (<5% effect to the growth or development of each organism). The comparison of metal concentrations to the Australian and New Zealand default water quality guideline values (WQGVs) showed no marine site exceeding the WQGVs for 95% species protection. However, all sites exceeded the 99% WQGVs due to copper concentrations that are likely of geogenic origin (i.e., not from anthropogenic sources). This study provides evidence supporting the use of the DGT technique to monitor contaminants and assess their environmental risk in the near-shore marine environment of Antarctica.

AB  - The paper presents pilot research data that is part of the research project "The Impact of Early Deprivation on the Bio-Behavioral Indicators of Child Development" from the Government's megagrant programs No. 14.Z50.31.0027. The purpose of the paper is the study of mental, social and emotional well-being indicators of adults raised in orphanages in comparison with a control group of adults who grew up in biological families. The comparison was carried out using scales of the WHO Questionnaire for assessing quality of life and Adult Self-Report (ASR) from The Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA) for assessing psychological and emotional well-being. Results revealed no significant differences between the groups studied. However, using the classification procedures, we found that an important feature is the living conditions that enable classification of membership in a group of graduates of an orphanage or in a group of adults from biological families: a separate apartment or a "public" space (a communal apartment or a dorm). A hypothesis has been put forward about the impact of the current living environment on the diagnosed indicators of the mental, social and emotional well-being of orphanage graduates.

AB  - In this study, an arid dune vulnerability index (ADVI) is developed using a system of indicators to evaluate the geomorphological vulnerability of beach-dune systems of arid regions. The indicators are comprised of three analytical dimensions (susceptibility, exposure and resilience) and their corresponding sub-indices and variables and were assessed for eleven sites located in four aeolian sedimentary systems of the Canary archipelago (Spain). The selected sites have varying geomorphological characteristics, vegetation types, marine and wind conditions and human pressure degrees, and have seen different trends in their geomorphological evolution since 1960. The eleven sites were separated into three groups according to their different conservation status and different management needs, and the results of the ADVI dimensions and variables were compared and analyzed for these three groups. In general, the results obtained in the analyzed sites reveal that susceptibility and exposure dimensions are related to low-moderate values, while resilience was high. Only one site presented a state of critical vulnerability, due to the loss of its capacity to maintain its geomorphological function in recent decades. Given the lack of knowledge about geomorphological vulnerability processes in foredunes of arid regions, ADVI is the first approximation to geomorphological diagnostic in these environments and can be useful for managers.

AB  - Study of the extensive scope of desert is closely related to rural communities; therefore, recognition of social structure of villagers is an important point in relevant projects and studies. International project of MENARID is the first multi-dimensional project designing to deploy organizational coherence and participation of people, governmental organizations, and private institutions regarding sustainable management of land with emphasis on sustainable natural resources management. Since it is required to be aware of yield and adoption of project with regional conditions to evaluate performance of project and its environmental implications besides attitude of people living in region toward consequences of this project, the extant study was undertaken to examine environmental effects of international project of MENARID on demographic and social variables from the viewpoint of villagers living in Pilot Village, Hamoon Site in Sisitan Province, Iran. 4 villages of Pilot were selected as statistical sample and sample size obtained to 147 households (150 households were selected for more accuracy) using simple random sampling method through Best Survey Software. Methodology of study was descriptive-inferential and data were collected through survey, cases study, observations, and opinions of experts. The obtained data were analyzed through SPSS Software. Results of study showed that there were positive and significant environmental effects of studied project considering all parameters except for housing through mean difference tests of T and ANOVA at level of 5%.

AB  - As a result of increasing population, industrialization, and effluent quality, sludge production has increased worldwide. Organic micropollutants in sludge have become a more critical environmental health concern compared to heavy metals. New sludge disposal regulations limit persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in addition to conventional organic indicators like total and dissolved organic carbon. This study aims at providing a brief review on POP concentration in the sludge in different regions of the world, sludge regulations, assessment of conventional biological sludge stabilization methods according to their ability to remove POPs, and discussions on alternative sludge treatment methods. The impact of sludge treatment unit operations including conditioning, thickening, mechanical and thermal dewatering, and biological and thermal stabilization on sludge management is also discussed in the context of organics. The occurrence and removal of micropollutants such as absorbable organic halogen compounds (AOX), nonylphenol and nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPE), di-2-(ethyl-hexyl)-phthalate (DEHP), dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD/F), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are also evaluated specifically for sludge treatment unit operations. A concise discussion is also included on different drying technologies suitable for drying of sludge.

AB  - Currently, it is presumed that Escherichia coli is not a normal inhabitant of the soil. Soilborne E. coli strains were isolated from broad range of 7 geoclimatic zones of India, indicating that E. coli can survive and thrive under different extreme soil conditions. Diversity among E. coli strains from widely separated geographic regions using enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR did not reveal any relationships between the genotypes and the source of isolation. Inoculation of maize (Zea mays cv. Arkil) seeds with E. coli NBRIAR3 (NBRIAR3) significantly enhanced (P < 0.05) plant growth and nutrient uptake, when compared with uninoculated control. Presence or absence of NBRIAR3 did not affect significantly (P < 0.05) diversity indexes, using substrate utilization patterns on the Biolog Eco plates. Clone libraries based on 16S rRNA gene from rhizosphere of maize plants demonstrated rather similar phylotype diversity from the uninoculated control and NBRIAR3-treated rhizosphere soil, which further indicated that NBRIAR3 did not exert a major influence on the overall bacterial diversity. The methodological approach described in this study supports the idea that E. coli should be treated as native soil bacterium instead of as an "indicator" of the possible presence of other fecal coliform bacteria.

AB  - In this work we propose the use of soil quality indicators with the aim of assessing the environmental impact of soil bioengineering works. This study was carried out in central Italy where soil bioengineering slope stabilization works were established using chestnut wood. In particular the goal of this study was to determine the occurrence of a wood-effect, that is changes of soil properties due to the presence of decomposing logs in two sites characterized by different time span since works setting up. The presence of the logs did not affect soil physico-chemical properties. Conversely, soil biochemical properties such as soil microbial biomass, basal and cumulative respiration activities as well as microbial indexes, were influenced by the presence of the logs confirming the role of these bioindicators as early predictors of changes occurring in soil. Although a general positive trend was observed for the biochemical properties at both sites with respect to the control soils, significant differences were recorded mainly at the site where works were established six years before soil sampling. Soil bioengineering slope stabilization works establish a positive feed-back which ultimately can benefit plants; in fact the increase in microbial mineralization activity can enhance nutrient cycling and thus promote adequate growth conditions for the plant cuttings used in the wooden-work.

AB  - The discharge of nutrient and ion-enriched agricultural and urban runoff into perimeter canals surrounding the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge and subsequent intrusion into a natural soft-water marsh is causing ecosystem alterations. Because this habitat is among the last remaining rainfall-driven areas of the Florida Everglades, understanding the dynamics of canal water intrusion is important for marsh protection and restoration. Using conductivity sondes, we examined canal water movement in and out of the marsh along four transects based on 350 and 500 mu S cm(-1) conductivity isopleths. Canal water intruded into the marsh to different extents, with the greatest intrusion observed on the west side of the refuge. Canal water was always evident in the marsh, and the maximum measured intrusion was 3.9 kin from November 2004 through January 2006. Stage differences between the canal and marsh influenced the movement of water into and out of the marsh, with high inflow rates in the canal increasing intrusion into the marsh. Marsh areas with sediment elevations < 4.9 in were most sensitive to canal water movement. Our analyses will contribute to the understanding of hydrologic conditions that lead to pollutant intrusion into floodplain wetlands.

AB  - Sixteen isolates of the red alga, Bostrychia tenuissima King et Puttock, from New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia were cultured in the laboratory and analysed for low molecular weight carbohydrates using C-13-NMR and HPLC techniques. All populations south of 34 degrees S contain D-sorbitol in combination with the heteroside digeneaside. The isolates north of 34 degrees S lack digeneaside, but contain D-sorbitol and, in addition, an isomeric form D-dulcitol. Moreover, the C-13-NMR spectra showed an unknown metabolite which was only measured in combination with digeneaside. While in the strains south of 34 degrees S digeneaside and the unknown compound occur in small quantities and remained unchanged with increasing salinities (5-60 ppt), the relatively high D-sorbitol contents strongly increased under hypersaline conditions. In the populations north of 34 degrees S both the concentrations of D-sorbitol and D-dulcitol increased with increasing salinity. These data demonstrate the important role of polyols in the osmotic acclimation of B. tenuissima. The ecological and/or biological factors controlling this geographical pattern of metabolite content are not known. However, the different carbohydrate patterns within B. tenuissima are considered as indicators of the development of physiological ecotypes.

AB  - In order to investigate the nature of complex problem solving (CPS) within the nomological network of cognitive abilities, few studies have simultantiously considered working memory and intelligence, and results are inconsistent. The Brunswik symmetry principle was recently discussed as a possible explanation for the inconsistent findings because the operationalizations differed greatly between the studies. Following this assumption, 16 different combinations of operationalizations of working memory and fluid reasoning were examined in the present study (N = 152). Based on structural equation modeling with single-indicator latent variables (i.e., corrected for measurement error), it was found that working memory incrementally explained CPS variance above and beyond fluid reasoning in only 2 of 16 conditions. However, according to the Brunswik symmetry principle, both conditions can be interpreted as an asymmetrical (unfair) comparison, in which working memory was artificially favored over fluid reasoning. We conclude that there is little evidence that working memory plays a unique role in solving complex problems independent of fluid reasoning. Furthermore, the impact of the Brunswik symmetry principle was clearly demonstrated as the explained variance in CPS varied between 4 and 31%, depending on which operationalizations of working memory and fluid reasoning were considered. We argue that future studies investigating the interplay of cognitive abilities will benefit if the Brunswik principle is taken into account.

AB  - Introduction:
   Colombian population is getting old in an accelerated manner, causing economic, social and health services effects. The Ministry of Health and Social Protection in the National System of Population Studies and Surveys for Health implemented the first health, well-being and aging survey-SABE-2015 Colombia-to know the living conditions of people 60 years of age or older.
   Objective:
   Describe the design of the method, statistical sampling and quality control of information from the SABE-2015 survey.
   Methods:
   A cross-sectional study, with quantitative and qualitative approaches, representative for the population in urban and rural areas aged 60 or over. Information was collected on socioeconomic variables, physical and social environment, behavior, cognition and affection, functionality, mental well-being, health conditions, and the use and access to health services.
   Results:
   23,694 surveys were conducted, 17,189 in urban population (72.5%) and 6,505 in rural population. The percentage of effective national response was 66% in 244 municipalities. Supervision was made in 40% of the surveys and telephone re-contact in 25%. The consistency of 100% surveys was reviewed and double entry was developed in 5% of them. National estimates have a 5% margin error.
   Conclusion:
   The SABE Colombia 2015 survey is representative of the main indicators of health, well-being and aging in Colombia. The design allows regional comparisons, between large cities and urban and rural population.

AB  - Promoting the weed seed predation service by carabids requires an understanding of the spatio-temporal distribution of carabid species during the cropping season. In the present study, we analyzed the spatio-temporal dynamics of three abundant seed-eating carabid species in oilseed rape (OSR) and its adjacent habitat (cereal crop or grassy field margin) with four indicators: activity density, nutritional state, the use of the interface with the adjacent habitat, and the proportion of carabids leaving OSR. The activity density and nutritional state of Poecilus cupreus decreased after harvest, comprising a period related to a decrease of resource availability and the end of life cycle. We detected a tendency of movement from OSR to the adjacent habitat after harvest for Amara similata, although this was not as strong as expected. The presence of grassy field margins influenced the spatio-temporal dynamics of Pseudoophonus rufipes and A. similata, suggesting that spillover processes exist for these two species but not for P. cupreus. Monitoring four complementary indicators gave a more thorough understanding of the perception of local and adjacent habitats by carabids, which is a prerequisite for the identification of landscape configurations that enhance the activity density of these natural enemies within crops.

AB  - Condition assessment of naturally aged composite insulators, aiming to better understand the ageing processes involved, is essential for maintaining high reliability in power networks. In this study field-ageing effects on insulating materials (EPDM and VMQ/HCR) of two 150 kV composite suspension insulators are evaluated. The insulators had been in service for 17 years on a coastal transmission network, exposed to seaborne salt spray, windborne soil deposits and intense UV solar radiation. Several diagnostic techniques, including visual inspection, wettability classification, FTIR spectroscopy, SEM and EDX analysis were employed to assess the condition of the insulators. Field-ageing effects were not assessed as critical to dictate insulator replacement. For both insulators morphological and material degradation due to field-ageing was restricted to the upper surface layer of the polymeric housing. The resistance of housing material against tracking and erosion remained unaffected by field-ageing. Surface deterioration of EPDM was more intense than that of VMQ/HCR, despite the fact that the EPDM insulator had been in operation at a site with a lower pollution severity. The EPDM housing was classified as hydrophilic; however, after removing pollutant deposits its hydrophobicity was improved. The hydrophobic properties of the VMQ/HCR housing were only slightly reduced. Field-ageing effects on insulator housing are discussed based on material structural changes caused by ageing stresses.

AB  - MILD oxyfuel combustion has been attracting increasing attention as a promising clean combustion technology. How to design a pathway to reach MILD oxyfuel combustion regime and what can provide a theoretical guide to design such a pathway are two critical questions that need to be answered. So far there has been no open literature on these issues. A type of combustion regime classification map proposed in our previous work, based on the so-called "Hot Diluted Diffusion Ignition" (HDDI) configuration, is adopted here as a simple but useful tool to solve these problems. Firstly, we analyze comprehensively the influences of various dilution atmosphere and fuel type on combustion regimes. The combustion regime classification maps are made out according to the analyses. In succession, we conduct a comparison between the map in air-firing condition and its oxyfuel counterpart. With the aid of the second thermodynamic-law analysis on the maps, it is easy to identify the major contributors to entropy generation in various combustion regimes in advance, which is crucial for combustion system optimization. Moreover, we find that, for the first time, a combustion regime classification map also may be used as a safety indicator. With the aid of these maps, some conclusions in previous publications can be explained more straightforwardly. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and Aims: Social, environmental and regulatory evolution encourages grapegrowers to reduce chemical use. Organic production is one possible answer, but controlling pests and diseases by products allowed in organic production is less easy than with chemicals. We integrated disease severity levels ( Botrytis bunch rot, powdery and downy mildews) and pest incidence ( grape berry moths) to develop an indicator of pests and disease damage in grape bunches, named assessment indicator of damage in grape bunches ( AIDB), which can be used to assess pest incidence in networks of grower vineyards.
   Methods and Results: In 2011 and 2012, we tested AIDB by monitoring damage at key phenological stages in 20 vineyards in the Bordeaux and Languedoc regions in the south of France, under three modes of production: conventional production, organic production and in conversion to organic production. The indicator proved accurate in describing the total damage on grape bunches under all conditions tested.
   Conclusions: Irrespective of the mode of production, the AIDB value was negatively correlated with yield parameters and the technical expertise of the grower. This indicator proved to be an innovative tool to estimate the multipest damage on grapevines over a range of conditions.
   Significance of the Study: The AIDB enables grapegrowers and advisors to assess the integrated impact of their treatment strategies on grape production, which is necessary when reducing pesticide use.

AB  - Analysis of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and NO3 (-) contents in the water at six springs in the province of Malaga (Southern Spain), sampled under different hydrologic conditions, revealed two different hydrochemical behaviour patterns for these natural tracers of infiltration. TOC content increased during every recharge period, following the rapid arrival of water infiltrating through the soil. On the other hand, NO3 (-) content only rose during the first flood episodes (normally in autumn), and fell during the winter and spring ones. This difference is consequence of the distinctive biogeochemical kinetics of nitrogen with respect to organic carbon, both in the soil and within the aquifer. Unlike the mineralisation undergone by TOC from the surface to the spring, the NO3 (-) ion remains in the aquifer almost unaffected, due to the oxidizing conditions prevailing within the karst medium, which do not allow its denitrification and favour its preservation within the saturated zone. In non-polluted aquifers, TOC and NO3 (-) have a common origin in the soil and can be used to determine infiltration processes and the hydrogeological functioning of karst aquifers. Their different hydrochemical evolution provides information about mineralization and degradation processes of organic matter within karst aquifers, which can be used to validate the vulnerability to contamination in this type of medium.

AB  - Bryophyte species composition, richness and life-form distributions were studied in a succession after termination of land-use as meadows and pasture in the Moricsala Strict Nature Reserve. Detailed lists of bryophyte species in various vegetation types, which were produced in the early 1900s by Karl Reinhold Kupffer, were compared with those prepared from 2006 to 2010 to determine changes in species composition. Colonisations and extinctions of bryophyte species and life forms could be explained by increases in available substrates (living trees, dead wood, ground layer disturbance patches), and increasingly shaded conditions. In each forest type, the species diversity (alpha diversity) increased, but the differences (beta diversity) between the types decreased. The total number of bryophyte species recorded in the studied forest area increased from 110 to 134 and that of rare (including Woodland Key Habitat indicator species) and protected species from 14 to 21 species. Twenty species were lost during the forest succession, but most of these species still occur within the reserve in open habitats. Life forms such as small compact cushions and short turfs tended to be lost during the forest succession, while smooth and rough mat life forms were better adapted to the new conditions and increased in richness.

AB  - Extensive experience demonstrates that the durability of concrete structures is related not only to design and material but also to construction issues. Upon completion of new concrete structures, the achieved construction quality always shows a high scatter and variability, and in severe environments, any weaknesses in the concrete structures will soon be revealed whatever specifications and constituent materials have been applied. In order to better take all this variability into account, a probability-based durability design should be applied. Since many durability problems also can be related to poor quality control as well as special problems during concrete construction, the issue of construction quality and variability must also be firmly grasped before any rational approach to a more controlled durability can be achieved. Therefore, a performance-based concrete quality control during concrete construction with documentation of achieved construction quality and compliance with the specified durability should also be carried out. When the concrete structure is completed, the owner should further be provided with a proper service manual for the future operation of the structure. Only such a service manual for condition assessment and preventive maintenance can provide the ultimate basis for achieving a more controlled durability and service life of concrete structures in severe environments. In the present paper, current experience with probability-based durability design and performance-based concrete quality control is briefly outlined and discussed.

AB  - To examine the effects of soil warming on carbon-accumulation and -release processes in the wetland ecosystem, a field-warming experiment was conducted under flooded and unflooded water conditions in the typical meadow Calamagrostis angustifolia (C. angustifolia) (TMC) wetland in the Sanjiang Plain, northeast China. Warming cables were used to simulate soil warming. Warming caused significant increases in aboveground biomass compared with belowground biomass during the growing season, and the enhancement of aboveground biomass increased with plant growth while belowground biomass showed an opposite effect. Significant positive correlation was found between aboveground biomass and 10-20-cm soil [image omitted] content whereas belowground biomass was more significantly correlated with 0-10-cm soil [image omitted] content. Positive linear correlations were found between CO2 and CH4 fluxes and warming-induced changes in liable carbon (LBC) and carbohydrate carbon (CHC) contents. Flooded water conditions tended to increase the accumulation of belowground biomass, [image omitted] content and CH4 fluxes under warming treatment. Soil warming could not only stimulate the carbon-accumulation and -release processes in the TMC wetland ecosystem directly, but also indirectly through the enhancement of nitrogen availability and active carbon contents. The contents of [image omitted] and active carbon could be sensitive indicators for the carbon-process changes in wetland ecosystems under soil warming.

AB  - In the event of an influenza pandemic, anti-viral medications such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu (R)) are expected to be used in high amounts over a duration of several weeks. Oseltamivir has been predicted to reach high concentrations in surface waters and sewage works. New oseltamivir environmental fate and toxicity studies permit an environmental risk assessment (ERA) under seasonal- and pandemic-use scenarios. The environmental fate data for sewage works (no removal), surface waters (no significant degradation), and water/sediment systems ( >50% primary degradation in 100 days) were used for the derivation of new predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) for western Europe and the River Lee catchment in the UK. Existing worst-case PECs for western Europe, the River Lee catchment in the UK and the Lower Colorado basin in the USA under pandemic conditions (<= 98.1 mu g/L for surface waters, <= 348 mu g/L for sewage works) were also considered for the ERA. PECs were compared with predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) based on new chronic ecotoxicity data (no observed effect concentration for algae, daphnia, and fish >= 1 mg/L). Based on all PEC/PNEC risk ratios, no significant risk is evident to surface waters or sewage works during both regular seasonal-use and high pandemic-use of oseltamivir. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - With the ready availability of georeferenced environmental data, regional and global chemical fate models have become increasingly spatially explicit. However, the description of how chemical fate properties such as degradation rate constants and partition coefficients depend on environmental conditions has not kept up with these developments. Consequently, model results are often subject to large uncertainty stemming from inherent variability in these properties. Here, we present an extensive meta-analysis of soil degradation of one exemplary compound, the herbicide atrazine. In the first part of the paper, we present the results of an in-depth statistical analysis of the dependence of atrazine degradation rate constants on various environmental factors. In the second part,the resulting estimation equation for atrazine degradation rate constants is implemented in CliMoChem, a model for the prediction of global chemical fate, which we supplemented. with spatial information on various soil descriptors, such as temperature, sand and clay content, organic carbon content, and pH. Estimates of polar accumulation, an important indicator of global chemical fate, were then compared between this model setup and estimates obtained when the degradation rate constant is represented by a single value or as being dependent on temperature only. Results for the three rate estimation methods demonstrate that a spatially explicit description of the soil degradation process results in 4-fold higher estimates of polar accumulation, while reducing uncertainty in the prediction of this endpoint by more than 40%.

AB  - We tested the hypothesis that modest increases in discharge and nutrients, like those occurring during spates, could have a positive effect on benthic algae in streams. Patterns in orthophosphate (PO4-P), total phosphate (TP), nitrate (NO3-N), and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) concentrations in stream waters showed that nutrient concentrations could increase during and after spates. In-stream nutrient concentrations were correlated to indicators of spates in an agricultural basin more than in a forested catchment. Nutrient and current concentrations were manipulated in experimental stream channels to simulate a subscouring spate, i.e., a spate during which organisms are not removed from substrates. Increasing PO4-P and NO3-N concentrations in the water for 12 h had little immediate effect on algal biomass but did increase phosphorus concentrations in periphyton. This increase in periphyton-P did not stimulate algal growth. Doubling current from 10 to 20 cm/s for 24 h had no effect on benthic algal biomass during the 24-h manipulation. Increasing current increased periphyton-N in high nutrient conditions but decreased periphyton-N concentrations and algal growth rates in low nutrient conditions. Changes in periphyton chemistry provided valuable information for development of hypotheses to explain responses of algae to environmental manipulations. Our results suggest that subscouring spates will probably inhibit algal growth in nutrient-poor streams, but could stimulate algal growth in nutrient-rich streams.

AB  - The subject of this game analysis was the throwing behavior of the world class players under competition match conditions during the final "World Cup Water Polo" tournament 2018 in Berlin. Specifically, we analyzed (a) the situational dependence of concrete environmental conditions ("constraints") of successful throwing actions as well as (b) the goal throw biomechanics concerning throwing speed. Therefore, player's and ball positions were recorded by video cameras as well as high-speed cameras. Based on the positions and trajectories parameters such as goal throw speed, Voronoi-cells as well as team centroids were calculated. The area of the Voronoi-cells differs concerning defending and attacking teams as well as between successful and non-successful teams and can be used as an indicator for goal or no goal. Under semi-collective tactical aspects, the comparison of the offensively and defensively controlled field areas (collective space control) between successful and unsuccessful goal throws shows that in the case of successful attacking completions, the attacking team (in the sum of its six players) each controlled significantly more field area in front of the opponent's goal than the six defensive players together with their goalkeeper. In the case of unsuccessful attacking attempts, this area ratio was exactly reversed, i.e., the defensive team dominated the space.

AB  - Plasma metabolites such as triglyceride (TRIG) can be useful indicators of when birds are in a state of fattening or fasting, although the challenges of processing, storing, and analyzing field-collected plasma samples may limit its use by field ornithologists. We evaluated the use of a field-usable point-of-care (POC) analyzer (CardioChek PA analyzer) for measuring TRIG concentrations in the plasma of male American Woodcock (Scolopax minor) captured during their spring courtship period and compared those measures to those from standard laboratory analyses of the same plasma samples. Plasma TRIG measured in the field with the POC analyzer was highly repeatable and precise, but not accurate compared to lab-measured values. The inaccuracy of the POC analyzer may be due to the effects of environmental conditions on the analyzer's function or to specific problems associated with analyzing woodcock blood. We conclude that the field-usable POC analyzer does not provide an accurate alternative method for measuring circulating TRIG in woodcock during cold springs in northern breeding areas. Given the analyzer has proven accurate for estimating circulating TRIG in some other bird species, we outline a two-phase pilot study that field ornithologists can use to understand the operating limits of this analyzer for their target species prior to field use.

AB  - Tourism is a key sector in the sustainable development of rural environments. Its ability to create stable employment and an acceptable level of profits is conditioned by the stability of tourist activity throughout the year. This paper compares the level of seasonality of a group of rural destinations to that of coastal and urban destinations. By doing so, we intend to determine whether seasonality-related problems exist in the rural environment or not. The second aim is related to the first one: the proposal of a new, more comprehensive and objective methodology that can measure the intensity of seasonality based on a DP2 synthetic indicator. The DP2 indicator groups information about different representative variables of seasonality. The study takes the main tourist spots in Spain as a reference. The analysis concludes that the annual level of stability of rural tourism is not far from the stability of urban tourism, which is the most stable, as seasonality is much higher in coastal destinations. The methodology that provides the framework to build the DP2 indicator has allowed us to identify which variables explain the differences in the level of seasonality of each destination to a large extent. The results showed that the variables that do so are related to the internalization of the destination and changes in the availability of bed places.

AB  - Marine aquaculture is a major industry that supports the economy in many countries, including the Philippines. However, excess feeds and fish waste generated by mariculture activities contribute an immense nutrient load to the environment that can affect the underlying sediment. To better understand these impacts, we compared the physicochemical characteristics and microbial community composition of sediments taken at a fish cage and an off cage site in Bolinao, Philippines. Sediments and pore water at the fish cage site showed evidence of greater organic enrichment relative to the off cage site. Under these conditions, we found lower relative abundance of dissimilatory sulfate reductase and nitrite reductase genes, suggesting shifts in prevalent nutrient cycling processes. This is further supported by 16S rRNA gene sequencing that revealed differences in the community composition between sites. Fish cage sediments favored the growth of taxa that thrive in anaerobic, organic carbon-enriched environments, such as members of class Anaerolineae, which can potentially serve as bioindicators of eutrophication in sediments. This study demonstrates that intensive mariculture activity can cause eutrophic sediment conditions that influence microbial community structure and function.
   Excess nutrients in the sediment of a mariculture site favor the growth of bacteria that thrive in high amounts of organic matter.

AB  - One of the most frequently encountered, especially at the adolescents and students, respiratory disease is chronic tonsillitis. It emerges under the influence of infectious agents, such as bacteria, viruses and fungi. The main causes leading to the spread of this disease are changing climate conditions (more often in fall and winter) with increased humidity and cold, when the resistance of body to infection decreases. However, tonsillitis may occur during the summer. In summer, the main causes for the spread of tonsillitis are air recirculating conditioning systems, ice cream, cold drinks, humid and dirty air. 14 students aged 19-23 years old were enrolled into the experiment. divided into two groups by seven students each (with tonsillitis as test and healthy as control). Biologically active points (BAP) symmetrically located to the right and left sides of the human body served as object of the study and were studied by their temperature indicators. Temperature measurements were recorded with "Biotemp-2". The results were statistically calculated. There were no significant differences in the temperature data of points located on the right and left sides of the body in control group; seven points from five meridians were statistically reliant when considering the temperature indices (p<0.05). According to the seven BAP, for which statistical validity was calculated, physiological changes from chronic tonsillitis of these biologically points indicate that they might be used as diagnostic markers.

AB  - One goal of the first decade of the Russian-American Long-term Census of the Arctic (RUSALCA) program was to characterize benthic composition in the Chukchi and East Siberian Seas in order to understand the geological history of productivity and paleoclimatological changes in this region. To this end, our team analyzed total chemical composition; content of biogenic elements including organic carbon, opal, and chlorin; and the distribution and species composition of the diatom thanatocoenosis in surface sediment samples. Increased calcium content (Ca/Al > 0.22) and dominance of the diatoms Paralia sulcata and Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii indicate transport pathways of warm Pacific water within the Chukchi Sea. Areas of greatest ice cover are characterized by sediments with low calcium content (Ca/Al < 0.15) and the presence of strontium, and dominance of the diatom Thalassiosira antarctica. Distributions of elements produced by phytoplankton such as opal, chlorin, and organic carbon are less informative as indicators of water masses, bioproductivity, and ice conditions because the phytoplankton are transported by currents and they accumulate in seafloor depressions. On the Chukchi Sea shelf, these depressions usually coincide with neotectonic structures. Specific sedimentation environments within the grabenrift system of the Chukchi Sea may be created by hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, where hydrochemical conditions promote preservation of biogenic remains in the sediment and anomalous accumulation of many metals (Fe, Mn, Mo, V, Zn, Ni, Ag, Hg).

AB  - Chlorophyll fluorescence transient from initial to maximum fluorescence ("P" step) throughout two intermediate steps ("J" and "I") (JIP-test) is considered a reliable early quantitative indicator of stress in plants. The JIP-test is particularly useful for crop plants when applied in variable field environments. The aim of the present study was to conduct a quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis for nine JIP-test parameters in maize during flowering in four field environments differing in weather conditions. QTL analysis and identification of putative candidate genes might help to explain the genetic relationship between photosynthesis and different field scenarios in maize plants. The JIP-test parameters were analyzed in the intermated B73 x Mo17 (IBM) maize population of 205 recombinant inbred lines. A set of 2,178 molecular markers across the whole maize genome was used for QTL analysis revealing 10 significant QTLs for seven JIP-test parameters, of which five were co-localized when combined over the four environments indicating polygenic inheritance and pleiotropy. Our results demonstrate that QTL analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters was capable of detecting one pleiotropic locus on chromosome 7, coinciding with the gene gst23 that may be associated with efficient photosynthesis under different field scenarios.

AB  - Aims: To show that in anaerobic fermentation with limiting lipid nutrients, cell preparation impacts the viability assessment of yeast cells, and to identify the factors involved.
   Methods and Results: Saccharomyces cerevisiae viability was determined using propidium iodide staining and the flow cytometry. Analyses identified intact cells, dead cells and, under certain conditions, the presence of a third subpopulation of apparently damaged cells. This intermediate population could account for up to 40% of the entire cell population. We describe, analyse and discuss the effects of different solutions for cell resuspension on the respective proportion of these three populations, in particular that of the intermediate population. We show that this intermediate cell population forms in the absence of Ca2+/Mg2+.
   Conclusions: Cell preparation significantly impacts population viability assessment by FCM. The intermediate population, revealed under certain conditions, could be renamed as 'fragile cells'. For these cells, Ca2+ and Mg2+ reduce cell membrane permeability to PI.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study that analyses and discusses the factors influencing the formation of an intermediate population when studying viability in yeast alcoholic fermentation. With a wider application in biological research, this study provides important support to the relatively new questioning of propidium iodide staining as a universal cell death indicator.

AB  - DNA barcoding, as it is currently employed, enhances use of marine benthic macrofauna as environmental condition indicators by improving the speed and accuracy of the underlying taxonomic identifications. The next generation of barcoding applications, processing bulk environmental samples, will likely only provide presence information. However, macrofauna indices presently used to interpret these data are based on species abundances. To assess the importance of this difference, we evaluated the performance of the Southern California Benthic Response Index (BRI) and the AZTI Marine Biotic Index (AMBI) when species abundance data were removed from their calculation. Presence only versions of these two indices were created by eliminating abundance weighting while preserving species identity. Associations between the presence and abundance BRI, and the presence and abundance AMBI were highly significant, with correlation coefficients of 0.99 and 0.81, respectively. The presence versions validated almost equally to the abundance-based indices when applied to the spatial and the temporal monitoring data used to validate the original indices. Simulations in which taxa were systematically removed from calculation of the indices were also conducted to assess how large the barcode library must be for the indices to be effective. Correlation between the BRI-P and BRI remained above 0.9 with only 370 species in the library and reducing the number of species to 450 had almost no effect on correlation between the presence and abundance versions of the AMBI.

AB  - Over a one-year period, the concentrations of ten polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and two of their hydroxy derivatives (OH-PAHs) were monitored in a suburb of Madrid (Spain). The levels of other chemical indicators of urban pollution (nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, etc.), as well as a series of meteorological variables (temperature, atmospheric pressure, etc.) were determined simultaneously. PAH concentrations varied according to the environmental conditions such that depending on the wind direction and speed, levels exceeded those expected for outside the central city area. Concentrations of 2-hydroxyphenanthrene ranged from 12 to 200 pg m(-3) and those of 1-hydroxypyrene from 3 to 60 pg m(-3). Their variations were directly related to levels of phenanthrene and pyrene and also found to depend on the weather conditions, especially temperature and atmospheric pressure. Through multivariate analysis (factor and cluster analyses) a clear link was detected between the concentrations of PAHs or hydroxy-PAHs and those of other chemical pollutants (nitrogen and sulphur oxides). We also observed an inverse relationship with temperature, ozone concentration, solar radiation and UV radiation intensity. Changes in both PAHs and OH-PAHs were clearly seasonal, increasing in the colder months and undergoing a reduction in the warmer months of the year. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Micro wind turbine performance under real weather conditions in urban environment
T2  - BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY

AB  - The aim of this article is to evaluate the performance of micro wind turbines in a built-up environment. For this purpose, five independent micro wind turbine systems, consisting of two distinctly different models, were tested and evaluated under real life conditions over a period of 12 months. This article provides an overview of the experimental set-up used to test the two different micro wind turbines and then goes on to present the basic background theory for horizontal axis micro wind turbines and the variation of coefficient of performance with wind speed. The wind potentials at the test site were assessed to determine the theoretical outputs of the turbines which were compared with the measured outputs over a year. The measured outputs were disappointingly low. One reason for this is turbulence, for which directional turbulence (lateral turbulence) has been shown to be a key indicator, better than the standard wind speed (longitudinal) turbulence. Another factor is the inverter efficiency and power consumption, which is not negligible. Finally the theoretical paybacks under the 2010 Feed-in Tariffs were calculated along with estimated carbon savings.
   Practical application: Renewables such as wind turbines are increasingly being designed and installed to help achieve lower carbon buildings. The output of micro turbines, however, can be disappointing due to lateral turbulence and inverter consumptions. These factors are explained so that designers can be aware and assess the likely outputs more accurately.

AB  - Variability of total free amino acid (TFAA) pool in Mytilus galloprovincialis was analysed following raft culture of growing mussels. With the aim to ensure the actual effect of animal's size, a mussel population was sampled in laboratory covering the field size (15-to 60-mm shell length). TFAA showed a constant profile regardless size increase of individuals in both field and laboratory experiments. Environmental salinity and temperature varied within a relatively narrow range in the field (34-35 g L(-1) and 14-19 degrees C, respectively). Despite the narrow variability of TFAA, significant differences were reported for the most representative amino acids. Specifically, taurine content significantly dropped with soft tissues increase in both field and laboratory experiments. Up to 40% of taurine drop in growing individuals was counterbalanced by the increase in alanine as main protein free amino acid (PFAA), whereas glycine showed high variability and inconsistency. PFAA increased linearly with the endogenous condition of individuals and were inversely correlated with protein content. In summary, TFAA pool of M. galloprovincialis remained unchanged with animal's size, which might ensure optimal protein turnover rates during growth and establish a significant link between energetic status (condition) and PFAA, values that are equilibrated by a significant drop of the most abundant taurine.

AB  - Background: To understand how forests and woodland respond to global climate change, phenological observations are being made at a number of sites worldwide. Recently, digital cameras have been deployed as part of the existing network of ecosystem CO2 flux towers to provide a time-series of canopy images, and various numerical indices have so far been used by different authors. Aims: To identify which are the most effective colour indices to calculate from the signals extracted from digital cameras, in order to provide recommendations to the scientific community. Methods: Sample images of a Japanese beech (Fagus crenata) forest on Mt. Tsukuba (Japan) were used to define and calculate 12 colour signals and vegetation indices. Results: Although the strength of green signal and green excess index were reliable indicators for estimating foliage growth period, the indices were susceptible to low-visibility weather conditions and distance from the camera. Hue provided a robust metric, showing much less scatter during the vegetative period and a good indication of spring bud break. The bud break dates derived from the indices were slightly earlier than those assessed by visual observation, while the abscission dates were later. Conclusions: We propose that of all the candidate colour indices, hue is the most promising for the detection of bud break as it was least affected by atmospheric conditions.

AB  - We investigated relationships between adolescents' perceptions of their neighbourhood, their mental health and independently assessed indicators of conditions in their residential neighbourhood. The Research with East London Adolescents Community Health Survey (RELACHS) provided information for 2370 adolescents on area perceptions (specifically alienation from/attachment to the area and satisfaction/dissatisfaction with local amenities and services), and on individual and family attributes including mental distress (measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire). These were combined for this study with independently assessed small area geographical indicators proposed by government to measure local deprivation in England. A Bayesian regression analysis using Gibbs sampling investigated associations between the predictor variables and neighbourhood perception. Alienation from neighbourhood and dissatisfaction with local amenities was greater for girls than for boys and for the older adolescents sampled. Those of 'Asian' or 'Black' ethnicity, from relatively harmonious families, or with higher levels of social support were less likely to express negative area perceptions. While previously published research found no significant direct association between mental health and small area indicators, this analysis suggests that those with relatively high levels of distress did have worse area perceptions. Also, certain independently assessed area indicators were associated with adolescents' views of their neighbourhood. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Restoration outcomes are notoriously unpredictable and this challenges the capacity to reliably meet goals. To harness ecological restoration's full potential, significant advances to predictive capacity must be made in restoration ecology. We outline a process for predicting restoration outcomes, based on the model of iterative forecasting. We then describe six challenges that impede predictive capabilities in restoration and, for each, an agenda for overcoming the challenge. Key challenges include the lack of clear goals, insufficient knowledge of why restoration outcomes vary, difficulty quantifying known drivers of variation prior to initiation of restoration projects, model uncertainty, the need to scale up local understanding to guide large-scale restoration efforts, and temporally variable conditions that hinder long-term forecast accuracy. Meeting these challenges will require research to resolve key drivers of variation in restoration outcomes; however, there is also a critical need to begin forecasting efforts in restoration ecology immediately. Although early efforts may be of limited practical utility, iterating between model development and evaluation will resolve data needs, minimize uncertainty, and lead to predictions that practitioners can confidently embrace. In turn, a robust predictive capacity will help to reliably meet goals, enhance cost-effectiveness, and guide policy decisions to help see out the promise of the Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.

AB  - Narrabeen Lagoon is recognized as an Intermittently Closed and Open Lake or Lagoon (ICOLL) and is the largest coastal lagoon (2.2 km(2)) in the Sydney metropolitan region. The catchment (53 km(2)) supports five major river systems, and land use comprises of 56% residential, 42% parkland and 2% light industry, commercial, hospital and education. An initial screening environmental assessment was undertaken using sedimentary metals to determine the magnitude of anthropogenic change and level of ecological risk posed by these contaminants. Results illustrated an unusual example of an estuary significantly influenced by human-induced change, but exhibiting minimal ecological risk. This anomaly was due to high anthropogenic metal concentrations in the fine fraction of surficial sediment, which was considerably diluted by abundant metal-poor coarse material resulting in reduced adverse ecological impact for total sediment. Predictive modelling to 2020 suggested that Pb concentrations will decline and Cu and Zn levels will increase slightly. Modelling of river discharge and analyses of fluvial sedimentary metals suggested stormwater derived from the most urbanized catchments and a major roadway combined with poor flushing explained surficial sediment metal distributions in the lagoon.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate if the presence of pollutants promotes changes in feeding habits of fish species from different trophic guilds: the detritivorous species, Hypostomus francisci, and the piscivorous, Hoplias intermedius. Both species were sampled at 12 sites (with different degrees of pollution) in the Rio das Velhas basin, which is heavily polluted by domestic and industrial sewage from the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte (MRBH). Stable isotope analyses of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) of fish tissue and the main food resources were performed. Fishes from both trophic guilds altered their diets in degraded environments, but the detritivorous species showed greater trophic plasticity. The isotopic niche of both trophic guilds was broadest in unpolluted sites and more delta N-15 enriched in polluted regions. The detritivorous species presented high niche-breadth in unpolluted sites, probably due to the greater variety of resources consumed. In addition, the delta N-15 of the detritivorous was more enriched than the piscivorous species in polluted sites. In conclusion, fishes from both trophic guilds presented similar isotopic responses to environmental pollution. However, the detritivorous species was more sensitive to these alterations and therefore, is likely a better indicator of environmental condition than the piscivorous.

AB  - Understanding diversity patterns and community structure of bryophytes will help integrate nature conservation at multiple biotic-group levels. We conducted a survey of ground bryophytes in a subtropical forest along an edge-to-interior gradient in South China. We recorded 11 liverwort species from 10 genera of seven families, and 26 moss species from 23 genera of 16 families in three transects. A two-way cluster analysis detected the environmental gradient between the forest edge and forest interior for bryophytes with habitat specificity. Functional diversity of bryophytes differed significantly across an edge-to-interior gradient. The range and median in both structural and functional diversity decreased remarkably from the forest edge to the interior. Multi-response permutation procedures showed significant differences in species composition between the forest-edge and forest-interior, and between the intermediate and forest-interior transects. Seven species were detected with a significant indicator value for indicating environmental conditions in the forest edge, while only one such species was found indicative of the intermediate transect. Our results demonstrate that remarkable edge effects exist for species composition and functional diversity patterns, and the forest edge is a marginal habitat with high biotic heterogeneity. Furthermore, functional diversity metrics are more sensitive to the edge effect than species diversity.

AB  - Pancreatic beta-cells respond to increasing blood glucose concentrations by secreting the hormone insulin. The dysfunction of beta-cells leads to hyperglycemia and severe, life-threatening consequences. Understanding how the beta-cells operate under physiological conditions and what genetic and environmental factors might cause their dysfunction could lead to better treatment options for diabetic patients. The ability to measure calcium levels in beta-cells serves as an important indicator of beta-cell function, as the influx of calcium ions triggers insulin release. Here we describe a protocol for monitoring the glucose-stimulated calcium influx in zebrafish beta-cells by using GCaMP6s, a genetically encoded sensor of calcium. The method allows monitoring the intracellular calcium dynamics with single-cell resolution in ex vivo mounted islets. The glucose-responsiveness of beta-cells within the same islet can be captured simultaneously under different glucose concentrations, which suggests the presence of functional heterogeneity among zebrafish beta-cells. Furthermore, the technique provides high temporal and spatial resolution, which reveals the oscillatory nature of the calcium influx upon glucose stimulation. Our approach opens the doors to use the zebrafish as a model to investigate the contribution of genetic and environmental factors to beta-cell function and dysfunction.

AB  - Irrigation salinity is a common environmental threat for sustainable development in the Keriya Oasis, arid Northwest China. It is mainly caused by unreasonable land management and excessive irrigation. The aim of this study was to assess and map the salinity risk distribution by developing a composite risk index (CRI) for seventeen risk parameters from traditional and scientific fields, based on maximizing deviation method and analytic hierarchy process, the grey relational analysis and the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) sustainability framework. The results demonstrated that the northern part of the Shewol and Yeghebagh village has a very high salinity risk, which might be caused by flat and low terrain, high subsoil total soluble salt, high groundwater salinity and shallow groundwater depth. In contrast, the southern part of the Oasis has a low risk of salinity because of high elevation, proper drainage conditions and a suitable groundwater table. This achievement has shown that southern parts of the Oasis are suitable for irrigation agriculture; for the northern area, there is no economically feasible solution but other areas at higher risk can be restored by artificial measures. Therefore, this study provides policy makers with baseline data for restoring the soil salinity within the Oasis.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the toxicological potential of binary drug mixtures and individual drugs under different pH conditions with different inorganic ion additions on the germination of Sorghum bicolor (sorgo) seeds. To assess whether the given drug mixtures were more phytotoxic than the individual compounds, concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) approaches were applied to estimate the predicted phytotoxicity values, followed by calculations of the MDR (model deviation factor) to determine the deviation from the predicted values. Binary mixtures of chloramphenicol with ketoprofen, diclofenac sodium, and oxytetracycline hydrochloride proved to be synergistic. The pH changes had the largest impact on the phytotoxicity of the diclofenac sodium and ketoprofen solutions, elevating their toxicity toward S. bicolor, and the co-presence of inorganic ions was shown to have an impact on ketoprofen, chloramphenicol, and oxytetracycline hydrochloride. Most of the interactions between sorgo plants and pharmaceuticals with added ions were antagonistic in nature, particularly those calculated using the IA model, with a few cases (one case for ketoprofen and chloramphenicol, two cases for oxytetracycline hydrochloride, and four cases for diclofenac sodium) of overestimation.

AB  - By 2100, it is predicted that streams in the Kakadu region in Northern Australia will be transforming in their coastal floodplains to saline environments because of sea-level rise. Potential impacts need to be assessed, together with existing threats, to manage future change. The fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages of the streams in the region are well researched and were used as indicators to assess centennial-scale changes to freshwaters. Spatial and temporal patterns in assemblage dynamics were described using data from different habitat types, and used as a framework to review current knowledge and assemblage vulnerability for likely conditions 100 years from present-day. Twenty threats within three broad classes were identified (climate change, invasive species, decommissioning and rehabilitation of Ranger uranium mine). Seven threatening processes were ranked as high risk to catchment-scale distributions of fish and macroinvertebrate taxa, with six being associated with climate change and one with mine-site rehabilitation. Habitat connectivities and dependencies were identified as key ecological processes for both groups, with saltwater intrusion to coastal floodplains being identified as the major process that will alter assemblage dynamics and system energy flow. Risks posed by climate change highlighted priority research and monitoring needs for management and protection of upland freshwater-refuge habitats.

AB  - Habitat homogenization, nutrient enrichment and loss of biodiversity are broadly recognized as the consequences of human activity in aquatic systems. Diatoms (Bacillariophyceae) are frequently used in aquatic environmental assessment and impact monitoring, but in unique habitats dominated by endemic taxa, traditional approaches may not be appropriate. We examined the impacts of long term anthropogenic impacts upon the littoral episammic diatom community around the town of Soroako, located on Lake Matano, an ancient tropical lake. Lake Matano is located on central Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, and socio-economic conditions are typical of developing nations. Although differences in nutrient concentrations were undetectable with field-based spectroscopy approaches, mean Shannon diversity was decreased in association with proximity the town-site. However, mean -diversity was maintained despite several decades of shoreline modification at Soroako. Elevated abundances of early-successional diatom taxa in the disturbed area drove differences between areas immediately offshore of Soroako and those farther away. These findings suggest that increased physical disturbance and TSS loads around Soroako, rather than increased nutrient loading, influenced shifts in the diatom community. These results suggest that microscopy-based biomonitoring approaches are sensitive indicators of environmental modification that could be useful in areas where access to cutting-edge analytical equipment is limited.

AB  - Parasite assemblages of Dules auriga are described for the first time from samples caught during research cruises in two localities of the Argentine-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone (AUCFZ) and are compared with four additional samples collected by commercial catches from the same region. A total of 178 fish were examined and 13 parasite species were found. This showed low species richness, a condition observed in some other small benthic species at a low trophic level. The composition of the parasite fauna was similar to those found on other host species in the region, sharing the same set of dominant species with other sympatric fishes, which have been identified as both typical and as indicators of this ecoregion: Grillotia carvajalregorum, Corynosoma australe and Hysterothylacium sp. Multivariate similarity analyses at the infracommunity and the component community levels indicated that the two samples caught at different latitudes in the AUCFZ display almost identical parasite assemblages. This repeatability in assemblage structure was also observed across samples from commercial catches. The homogeneity of the parasite assemblages is considered to be an intrinsic property of fish inhabiting the AUCFZ, independent of their ecology and trophic level.

AB  - Ocean acidification, resulting from rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, is a pervasive stressor that can affect many marine organisms and their symbionts. Studies which examine the host physiology and microbial communities have shown a variety of responses to the ocean acidification process. Recently, several studies were conducted based on field experiments, which take place in natural CO2 vents, exposing the host to natural environmental conditions of varying pH. This study examines the sea anemone Anemonia viridis which is found naturally along the pH gradient in Ischia, Italy, with an aim to characterize whether exposure to pH impacts the holobiont. The physiological parameters of A. viridis (Symbiodinium density, protein, and chlorophyll a+c concentration) and its microbial community were monitored. Although reduction in pH was seen to have had an impact on composition and diversity of associated microbial communities, no significant changes were observed in A. viridis physiology, and no microbial stress indicators (i.e., pathogens, antibacterial activity, etc.) were detected. In light of these results, it appears that elevated CO2 does not have a negative influence on A. viridis that live naturally in the site. This suggests that natural long-term exposure and dynamic diverse microbial communities may contribute to the acclimation process of the host in a changing pH environment.

AB  - The objectives of soil remediation processes are usually based on threshold levels of soil contaminants. However, during remediation processes, changes in bioavailability and metabolite production can occur, making it necessary to incorporate an ecotoxicity assessment to estimate the risk to ecological receptors. The evolution of contaminants and soil ecotoxicity of artificially phenanthrene-contaminated soil (1000 mg/kg soil) during soil treatment through bioventing was studied in this work. Bioventing was performed in glass columns containing 5.5 kg of phenanthrene-contaminated soil and uncontaminated natural soil over a period of 7 months. Optimum conditions of mineralisation (humidity= 60% WHC; C/N/P= 100:20:1) were determined in a previous work. The evolution of oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, phenanthrene concentration and soil toxicity were studied on sacrificed columns at periods of 0, 3 and 7 months. Toxicity to soil and aquatic organisms was determined using a multispecies system in the soil columns (MS-3). In the optimal bioventing treatability test, we obtained a reduction rate in phenanthrene concentration higher that 93% after 7 months of treatment. The residual toxicity obtained at the end of the treatment was not attributed to the low phenanthrene concentration, but to the ammonia used to restore the optimal C/N ratio. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In order to obtain information on the hydrological signature of rivers during and after heavy rain events, small catchment areas are selected as experimental sites. Hydrograph separations based on environmental tracers are performed. Natural isotopic tracers such as O-18, H-2 and particularly Rn-222 may help to distinguish the components dominating the outflow, particularly of 'pre-event waters', 'event waters' and 'post-event waters'. Even with moderate concentrations in groundwater, radon can be a very sensitive indicator of groundwater input into rivers. The selected microbasin under investigation is situated in the western part of Luxembourg and belongs to the Attert River catchment. At chosen points at the basin's outflow radon detectors continuously measure radon activity in water. The radon monitors are installed together with high precision thermometers, conductivity meters, flow meters and automatic water samplers for chemical analysis. Besides the continuous measurements, grab water samples are taken at different locations along the stream, most of them during periods of heavy rain events. Presented are the results of a one year measurement campaign. During the dry season i.e. during more or less continuous discharge conditions, the observed mean values do not show substantial variations and can be used as reference values. Fluctuations of the measured data during rain events are discussed and the interplay between the different parameters analysed.

AB  - The Lacandon Maya of Chiapas, Mexico practice a system of agroforestry that mimics the surrounding ecosystem and its successional stages. Their fields rotate through grass (milpa), and shrub (acahual) and forest fallow stages that regenerate soil, nutrients, and seed banks. Each successional. stage, including the fallow stages, produces over 25 types of crops, raw materials, and medicines. Lacandon traditionally do not use fertilizers, pesticides, or herbicides. Nematodes were chosen to analyze soil ecology in the Lacandon system because they have been shown to be dynamic indicators of environmental conditions. Nematodes were classified by trophic level. as plant parasite, fungivore, bacterivore, and omnivore-predator, and were found to be a function of management practice. In milpas where weeds were removed and applied to the field, plant parasites were reduced by 44% and fungivorous nematode concentrations were reduced by 50%. In these same fields, percentage of bacterivorous nematodes was positively related to soil organic matter concentration (R-2 = 0.61, P < 0.001). These results indicate that management practices reduced concentrations of plant parasites and delayed the nematode successional pathway from bacterivorous to fungivorous. This study demonstrates the potential. for Lacandon Maya techniques to sustainably manage pests and maintain soil fertility in other tropical agroecosystems. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - We provide an update to our knowledge of the centric diatoms in the Tonle Sap Lake (Cambodia) by providing a new and highly detailed iconography of all observed taxa based on light and scanning electron microscopy. We highlight a distinctive flora, including a new genus Praecyclostephanos gen. nov. and five taxa new to science: Aulacoseira micropunctata sp. nov., A. spiralorimoportula sp. nov., Praecyclostephanos boengchhmariensis sp. nov., Stephanodiscus tonlesapensis sp. nov. and Urosolenia anlongreangensis sp. nov. The flora is mainly dominated by several species of the genus Aulacoseira. Within the Aulacoseira populations forming the background of the diatom community, taxa that reveal the change in environmental conditions appear sporadically, often as blooms. The wide range of life-forms related to their ability to float is another remarkable aspect of the centric diatom flora. This variability appears at several taxonomic scales. At the genus level, colonial and solitary life-forms are very well represented in their diversity. At the sub-genus level, mainly among the Aulacoseira species, communities present a wide range of buoyancy metrics. Accordingly, in addition to the taxonomic review, we provide additional information related to their potential as bioindicators to monitor the hydrodynamic aspects of the lake in both space and time.

AB  - Biopharmaceuticals are associated with the revolutionary treatment of various diseases, and according to the European Medicines Agency, biopharmaceuticals derived from biological sources are perceived to not cause significant environmental risk. However, there is currently no broadly recognized definition or categorization of biopharmaceuticals despite the fact that improved technology has made it possible to modify them to obtain more efficient medicines, thereby raising questions about their biological origins and risks. The aim of this paper, based on a literature review, is to derive a clear definition of biopharmaceuticals and evaluate the European Union's regulation and environmental risk assessment (ERA) procedures for them. Nine different definitions were identified, and it is evident that the term "biopharmaceuticals" is used ambiguously. We therefore recommend that biopharmaceuticals are defined as complex molecules derived from a biological source, with the purpose to diagnose, prevent, treat, or cure diseases or conditions of human beings. Furthermore, we recommend that biopharmaceuticals should be categorized according to their biological structure: 1) amino acids, 2) nucleic acids, and 3) vaccines. Only 11 studies were identified as being relevant to ERA, and we lack useful data for hazard identification. More research is needed to examine the ecotoxicity, fate, and stability of most biopharmaceuticals -and categorical regulatory exclusion seems unfavorable in this regard. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Theories, models, and studies of ecosystem services (ESs) are expected to be applicable to conservation practices. However, applying the ES concept becomes challenging, especially in terms of implementing theory into the local-level activities. We analyzed ten participatory mapping workshops involving conservation experts and local stakeholders to investigate theoretical challenges emergent in the ES concept implementation. Based on our results, we argue that local stakeholders are able to address practical problems in mapping ESs that are debated in the literature as major theoretical challenges to the concept. In particular, it considers the theoretical challenges of distinguishing ESs from the other levels of the ESs cascade; challenges in monetary valuation of the ESs, operationalization of service-providing units, service-benefiting areas, and ESs that are co-produced with humans, and the consequences of including the stakeholders' subjective perspectives in mapping ESs.
   We claim that these challenges can be addressed to a certain extent by defining realistic objectives for the ES mapping, followed by clear rules adjusted for local conditions. The ES concept may serve as an effective tool for engaging local stakeholders in constructive discussions about nature and spatial planning. However, participatory mapping has limitations in relation to providing a comprehensive assessments of ESs.

AB  - The increasing numbers of kept horses create problems with processing horse manure as important local waste. This work was focused on horse manure vermicomposting in a real-field continuous-feeding system under controlled conditions, and on the complex study of the maturity and stability of the produced vermicompost. Commonly used simple indicators such as the C/N ratio, N-NH4+/N-NO3- ratio, DOC or ion exchange capacity, and also more advanced spectroscopic and thermoanalytic techniques were used and applied on the humic substances isolated from the vermicompost during its maturation (12 months in total). When compared with the original horse manure, vermicomposting decreased the aliphatic, protein-like, and polysaccharide humic components, whereas vermicomposting increased the aromaticity and contents of oxygen-containing functional groups. The typical tryptophan-like fluorophores in the manure, corresponding to the freshly produced organic matter of biological or microbial origin, were progressively transformed to humic-like fluorophores during vermicomposting. The most thermally labile humic fraction disappeared quickly during the very early vermicomposting stages. The results of spectroscopic and thermogravimetric analyses suggest that stable and mature vermicompost was produced after 6-9 months of vermicomposting, which was also supported by biologically-based maturity indicators.

AB  - We assessed potential ecotoxicity of lake sediments affected by biomining effluents in northeastern Finland. Growth, reproduction and behavior of the sediment-dwelling oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus (Muller 1774) were used as ecotoxicity endpoints. Standardized chronic bioassays were used for growth and reproduction, and acute and chronic tests with Multispecies Freshwater Biomonitor (MFB) for behavior assessments. Sequential extractions were used to characterize metal bioavailability and exposure conditions in the sediments, which indicated mining-induced contamination gradients of S, Cu, Ni and U and also bioavailability gradients of S and Ni. Among the ecotoxicity endpoints, growth and reproduction responses of the standard bioassays appeared more sensitive than the behavioral responses at 21 d. In the two most mining-affected test sediments, mean number of worms and dry biomass decreased 35-42% and 46-51% in comparison to the reference sediment, respectively. The behavioral changes of worms, i.e. peristaltic and overall locomotory activity, decreased on average 20-70% and 2-61% at 21 d in the same sediments. However, these behavioral changes were observed at the onset of exposure indicating MFB technique is a suitable and rapid screening level ecotoxicity assessment tool. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article examines the current practice of assessing a project's cumulative effects to health and well-being in a region characterized by a legacy of resource development and Indigenous land use. The context is hydroelectric development in northern Manitoba, Canada. Based on a review of environmental assessment (EA) regulatory applications and panel reports, results indicate that the consideration of health in EA has improved over time, with proponents adopting a holistic definition of health, but impact analyses remained restricted to physical health conditions with social and cultural health impacts to Indigenous communities receiving only limited attention. Multiple common indicators were identified across recent EA applications that relate to health and well-being, but they were not mapped to health determinants, supported by only limited analysis of causal mechanisms, and rarely used to assess the significance of project actions in combination with past projects and the enduring impacts of a 55-year legacy of hydroelectric development. The article concludes with a discussion of the state of practice and offers suggestions for improved coordination of EA for assessing cumulative effects to health and well-being, including adoption of Indigenous health determinants, and the roles of governments and proponents regarding the consideration of legacy effects in project reviews.

AB  - Aquatic hyphomycetes are important components of water courses from the ecological and biotechnological points of view, due to their enzymatic battery and thus are considered as indicators of water quality. They are a group of microscopic anamorphic fungi that, in the aquatic ecosystem, degrade and alter the plant material that falls into the water, thereby enabling it to be used as a food resource by other organisms. In Venezuela, studies have been made that increase the records of these fungi species in different streams. The aim of this study was to elaborate an inventory of hyphomycetes species in 'La Estacion' stream, located at the Ecological Station 'La Guaquira', Yaracuy State, and relate it to local physicochemical and microbiological factors. Weekly samples were collected during a year, under sterile conditions, from stream water and foam, in order to analyze the water quality and identify the fungi species. A total of 40 species were identified, of which Dicranidion gracile and Isthmotricladia laeensis are new reports for the country. Significant relationships were only found between the richness/abundance of conidia and the precipitation regime: Campylospora parvula, Clavastospora tentacula and Diplocladiella sp. were present only during the dry season, while Campylospora filicladia and Campylospora chaetocladia were present only during the rainy season.

AB  - Mechanistic effect models (MEMs) consider the mechanisms of how chemicals affect individuals and ecological systems such as populations and communities. There is an increasing awareness that MEMs have high potential to make risk assessment of chemicals more ecologically relevant than current standard practice. Here we discuss what kinds of MEMs are needed to improve scientific and regulatory aspects of risk assessment. To make valid predictions for a wide range of environmental conditions, MEMs need to include a sufficient amount of emergence, for example, population dynamics emerging from what individual organisms do. We present 1 example where the life cycle of individuals is described using Dynamic Energy Budget theory. The resulting individual-based population model is thus parameterized at the individual level but correctly predicts multiple patterns at the population level. This is the case for both control and treated populations. We conclude that the state-of-the-art in mechanistic effect modeling has reached a level where MEMs are robust and predictive enough to be used in regulatory risk assessment. Mechanistic effect models will thus be used to advance the scientific basis of current standard practice and will, if their development follows Good Modeling Practice, be included in a standardized way in future regulatory risk assessments.

AB  - In this work we investigate the development of a salt marsh environment during the Holocene marine transgression in the North Adriatic coast (North Italy) near the pre-Roman and Roman towns of Cittanova and Concordia Sagittaria. Pollen, plant macrofossils, non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs) and foraminifers are analysed in cores and archaeological excavations to indicate the development of salt marsh plant communities. Other independent proxies (foraminifers, plant macrofossils, molluscs) confirm the ecological interpretation based on pollen records. The relevance of NPPs as indicators of salt marsh environment is evaluated. Linings of foraminifers are the most frequent NPP type, recorded in 85% of the brackish sediments. They may tentatively be referred to the genus Ammonia, a very common benthonic genus in the present lagoons of the North Adriatic Sea. Radiocarbon dates available from previous work allow the salt marsh development to be dated in the sector from the east of the Lagoon of Venice to the Lagoon of Caorle. Near Cittanova, salt marshes developed before 6700 yrs cal. b.p. At Concordia Sagittaria, the first evidence dates from ca. 6700 yrs cal. b.p. and a phase of freshwater conditions is recorded in the sediments of ca. 4500 yrs cal. b.p.

AB  - Throughout the Phanerozoic eon (similar to 542 Myr ago to the present), the diversity of marine organisms has varied. These changes are fairly well resolved(1), but the controls on origination and diversification are less well understood. Changes in origination rates are thought to arise from a complex interplay between biological forces such as competition and predation(2), phytoplankton stoichiometry(3) and bioturbation(3) and abiotic controls such as environmental setting(4), temperature(5,6), sea level(7) and nutrient availability(8). Here we statistically assess relationships between records of environmental conditions(9-14) and global marine origination rates(2) during the Phanerozoic. We find significant positive correlations between changes in origination rates and variations in indicators of continental weathering (Sr-87/Sr-86) and phosphorus recycling (delta S-34), as well as a significant negative correlation between variability in origination rates and eustatic sea level. We suggest that continental weathering, phosphorus recycling and sea level-through the exposure of the continental shelf area to erosion-are all controls on the availability of marine nutrients. We therefore propose that over secular timescales, nutrient availability, as controlled by continental weathering and phosphorus recycling, is an important regulator of genus-level origination in the marine realm, with periods of increased nutrient availability associated with higher origination rates.

AB  - The microfossils in eight short sediment cores in Mahurangi Harbour, northern New Zealand, record major ecological changes since colonisation by Europeans. During the period of catchment deforestation (1850s-1900) these changes include increased sedimentation rates, decline of soft-shore molluscs, increased diatoms and seaward migration of brackish, agglutinate-dominated, foraminiferal associations, inferred to be due to increased freshwater runoff and decreased pH. The interval of most rapid change (1950s-1980s) occurred before and during the establishment of oyster farms, which therefore are not implicated. Comparison of the microfossil content of surface sediment samples taken inside and outside of four oyster farms indicates variable effects dependent on farm location. In less saline sites, the presence of oyster-shell debris in sediment beneath oyster farms appears to have buffered the foraminiferal faunas from some of the impacts of lowered salinity and pH. At more tidally flushed, saline sites, the oyster farms influence a wider surrounding area that has lower relative abundance of three species of Elphidium and other calcareous Foraminifera, attributed to slightly muddier sediment, higher nutrients and consequently lower oxygen. A newly arrived exotic foraminifer, Elphidium vellai, appears to be an indicator species for the enhanced nutrient, carbonate-rich conditions beneath oyster farms.

AB  - Atrazine is a herbicide used most frequently in North America, but it usually is encountered in mixtures of agrochernicals. Few atrazine exposure studies have been conducted using mixed pesticides; therefore, little data are available to suggest reliable means of discerning effects attributable to atrazine. The common freshwater macrophyte, Juncus effusus L., was exposed in 66 mesocosms to atrazine at two nominal concentrations (96 and 192 mu g/L) with varying concentrations of chlorpyrifos, monosodium methanearsonate, and monomethylmercury. Exposure levels represented typical levels that might follow runoff or direct-spray application in enclosed waterbodies. Using shoot density and number of shoots shorter than 25 cm per unit area as response measurements, the growth effects of atrazine, even in varying pesticide mixes, could be detected as early as 16 d after initial exposure. Further growth effects specifically caused by atrazine also could be detected following a second exposure to the same toxicant mixture. Mesocosm tests offer greater control of natural variability than would be found in the natural environment and offer more realistic conditions than traditional laboratory/greenhouse studies. Therefore, in field testing, growth measurements should be accompanied by other confirmatory tests, such as pesticide concentrations in tissue and, possibly, chlorophyll concentrations, for measuring specific toxic effects of atrazine and other pesticides.

AB  - Three microbiological criteria (European Economic Community, World Health Organization/United Nations Environment Program and European Union) for water quality have been comparatively evaluated in a resort zone of southern Portugal, located at the Ria Formosa (Algarve). The results obtained in this study suggest that the three compared directives adequately classified the bathing zones according to their fecal pollution level. However, none of the directives establish a sanitary classification of the recreational use of the bathing zones. By the use of the Cumulative Contamination Index applied in this study, classification based on both the level of fecal pollution and on the sanitary condition of the bathing zones has been achieved. The application of this new approach to the monitoring of bathing waters allows us to propose a new criterion of water quality based on the coliphage levels (Ph-80 = 300 pfu 100 mL(-1) and Ph-95 = 2000 pfu 100 mL(-1)) for inclusion in the new water quality regulations. Coliphages have been shown to have a close correlation with the presence of pathogenic microorganisms, and with the fecal pollution levels of recreational seawaters. However, none of the microbial indicators tested ensured detection of pathogen presence.

AB  - Laminitis is a painful condition that causes lameness in horses. However, monitoring this condition in feral horses is logistically difficult. Laminitis can be detected postmortem, as inflammation of the sensitive laminae of the hoof changes the relative location of the bony structures within the hoof capsule. Thus, evaluation of cadavers may be used to estimate laminitis prevalence in feral populations of horses. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of laminitis in feral horses inhabiting the Sable Island National Park Reserve, Canada, using radiographic imagery on the hooves of naturally deceased horses. Radiographic indicators evaluated included coronary band extensor process distance (CE), capsular rotation (CR), palmar angle (PA), ratio of the dorsal hoof wall thickness to the length of the distal phalanx (DHWT:P3) and sole depth (SLD). Each value measured indicated the following prevalence of laminitis: CE 0% (97.5% Confidence Interval (CI) 0-4.51%), 8.75% CR (95%CI 3.59-17.2%), PA 25% (95% CI 15.99-35.94%), DHWT:P3 6.25% (95%CI 2.06-14.0%) and 65% SLD (95% CI 53.52-75.33%). The majority of indices measured for laminitis were low. These findings suggest that laminitis is fairly infrequent in the Sable Island horses evaluated in this study.

AB  - Biodiversity is under pressure worldwide, with amphibians being particularly threatened. Stressors related to human activity, such as chemicals, are contributing to this decline. It remains, however, unclear whether chemicals exhibiting a fungicidal activity could indirectly affect tadpoles that depend on microbially conditioned leaf litter as food source. The indirect effect of fungicides (sum concentration of a fungicide mixture composed of azoxystrobin, carbendazim, cyprodinil, quinoxyfen, and tebuconazole: 100 mu g/L) on tadpoles was assessed relative to leaf litter colonized by microbes in absence of fungicides (control) and a worst-case scenario, that is leached leaf litter without microbial colonization. The quality of leaf litter as food for tadpoles of the European common frog (Rana temporaria) was characterized through neutral lipid fatty acid profiles and microbial sum parameters and verified by sublethal responses in tadpoles (i.e., feeding rate, feces production, growth, and fatty acid composition). Fungicides changed the nutritious quality of leaf litter likely through alterations in leaves' neutral lipid fatty acid profiles (i.e., changes in some physiologically important highly unsaturated fatty acids reached more than 200%) in combination with a potential adsorption onto leaves during conditioning. These changes were reflected by differences in the development of tadpoles ultimately resulting in an earlier start of metamorphosis. Our data provide a first indication that fungicides potentially affect tadpole development indirectly through bottom-up effects. This pathway is so far not addressed in fungicide environmental risk assessment and merits further attention.

AB  - Inflammation is a complex biological response of the human body to external or internal stimuli, such as invading pathogens, defective cells, or irritating substances. One important indicator of inflammatory conditions or the progress of various diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurological diseases, connective tissue diseases, sepsis, or Alzheimer's disease, is the concentration level of inflammatory biomarkers, including immunoglobulins, cytokines, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Since inflammatory biomarkers are highly correlated with each other, it is important to measure them simultaneously. To enable continuous and dynamic inflammatory biomarker detection, we utilized localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) to perform label-free molecule sensing. Since the LSPR sensing mechanism requires only a small sensing area with simplified optical setup, it can be easily integrated with a microfluidic device. To simplify reagent operation complexity, we developed an automated microfluidic control system to control reagent guiding and switching in the immunoassay with less manual processes and potential operation errors. Our results successfully demonstrated multiplex IgG, TNF-alpha, and CRP measurement with only 60 mu L assay volume and 3.5 h assay time. In each test, 20 sensing spot measurements under four different reagent conditions can be performed. Overall, we envision that the LSPR sensor integrated automated microfluidic control system could perform rapid, multiplex, and multiparallel continuous inflammatory biomarker detection, which would be beneficial for various applications, such as immune status monitoring, diagnosis and prognosis of inflammatory diseases.

AB  - Element concentrations of calcite precipitated by foraminifera reflect chemical and physical properties of seawater and can therefore be used to reconstruct (paleo-)environmental conditions. Foraminiferal carbonate associated manganese incorporation (expressed here as Mn/Ca) is a potential proxy for seawater oxygenation, although the impacts of other environmental parameters need to be quantified before Mn/Ca can be robustly applied. Here we report the isolated impact of seawater carbonate chemistry on manganese incorporation in the shells of two large symbiont-bearing benthic foraminiferal species. Moreover, we investigated the role of biomineralization on manganese incorporation by using species with contrasting calcification pathways: the hyaline speciesAmphistegina gibbosaand the porcelaneous speciesSorites marginalis. Furthermore, analyzing shells from a wide range of species grown under identical conditions allowed assessment of species-specific Mn incorporation in other foraminiferal species. Our observations show that species specific differences in biomineralization strategies are the dominant factor determining Mn content. Shells from porcelaneous species, with relatively high Mg contents, are generally also enriched in Mn compared to low-Mg/Ca foraminifera. Superimposed on the effect of biomineralization, chemical speciation of elements in seawater as a function ofpCO(2)also affects their incorporation. Whereas the impact of the carbonate system is limited, the inter-specific differences call for species specific calibrations in order to use Mn uptake as a (paleo-)oxygenation proxy.

AB  - The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 14 million people worldwide so far. Brazil is currently the second leading country in number of cases of COVID-19, while Sao Paulo state accounts for 20% of total confirmed cases in Brazil. The aim of this study was to assess environmental and social factors influencing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the expanded metropolitan area of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Firstly, a spatial analysis was conducted to provide insights into the spread of COVID-19 within the expanded metropolitan area. Moreover, Spearman correlation test and sensitivity analysis were performed to assess social indicators and environmental conditions which possibly influence the incidence of COVID-19. Our results reveal that the spread of COVID-19 from the capital city Sao Paulo-its epicenter in Brazil-is directly associated with the availability of highways within the expanded metropolitan area of Sao Paulo. As for social aspects, COVID-19 infection rate was found to be both positively correlated with population density, and negatively correlated with social isolation rate, hence indicating that social distancing has been effective in reducing the COVID-19 transmission. Finally, COVID-19 infection rate was found to be inversely correlated with both temperature and UV radiation. Together with recent literature our study suggests that the UV radiation provided by sunlight might contribute to depletion of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.

AB  - Cuckoos Cuculus canorus produce calls that consist of a repeated but variable number of syllables that has given name to the species and the family. Here we tested the hypothesis that cuckoo calls are reliable indicators of environmental and individual quality by determining the number of repeated 'cuckoo' syllables in calls in relation to habitat and soil, ionizing radiation, presence of a female cuckoo and local density of male cuckoos at Chernobyl, Ukraine. Males were consistent in their production of syllables, producing more syllables per call when a female or another male arrived. This increase in the number of syllables was larger in males that already produced many syllables in the absence of conspecifics, implying that males of superior quality were still able to increase the number of syllables. Males produced more syllables per call in habitats with black soil and in forests. Furthermore, they produced fewer and more aberrant syllables in radioactively contaminated areas of Chernobyl providing evidence of an effect of environmental perturbation on the number of syllables. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the number of syllables is a condition-dependent signal used for attracting mates, repelling competitors, providing information about local environmental conditions for other cuckoos, but also for humans and thus can be used by humans to infer habitat quality.

AB  - Structural health monitoring with actively excited Lamb waves is a promising technology for health monitoring of aerospace carbon fiber-reinforced plastic structures with reasonable effort, as it has the potential to cover large areas with few sensors and a high sensitivity to damage. The high signal complexity inherent to wave propagation in complex, finite, and anisotropic structures, especially in combination with the sensitivity toward environmental and operational loads, presents the main challenge on the road toward the utilization of this potential. In this study, the effects that real structural features and damage, in combination with environmental conditioning, have on Lamb wave propagation and measurement are investigated. For this, the composite-specific behavior is discussed. Based on the local temporal coherence method, changes of sensor responses containing reflections and interaction with stiffness discontinuities, both unrelated and related to damage, are identified in anisotropic composite materials. The amount of signal changes unrelated to damage, as well as their high dependency on the specific conditions of the measurements, is an indicator for the complex issues faced by compensation. While damage of a sufficient size will be detectable even in the most complex, finite, and anisotropic structures, the establishment of a sufficiently reliable damage detection with an acceptable low detection threshold will require even more careful consideration of the monitored structure and its environmental and operational loads than for metallic structures.

AB  - Robust relationships among soil, water, atmosphere and plants are needed to reliably forecast the plant species composition. In this paper, we show the need for, and the application of, a process-based relationship between soil moisture conditions and vegetation characteristics. We considered 366 groundwater-dependent sites, where oxygen stress, caused by a surplus of soil moisture, codetermines plant performance. We compared two existing indirect proxies for the soil oxygen status namely mean spring groundwater level (MSL) and sum exceedence value (SEV) with our newly developed process-based proxy, viz. root respiration stress (RS). The two indirect proxies and the process-based proxy for oxygen stress performed equally well in describing vegetation characteristics for the Netherlands under the current climate. However, relationships based on MSL and SEV appeared to produce systematic prediction errors when applied outside their calibration range, in contrast to the relationship based on RS. Hence, the two indirect proxies cannot be used in projections, such as in predicting effects of climate change on vegetation composition, all the more because they unlike RS do not account for essential parameters that determine oxygen stress (e.g. temperature and extreme rainfall events in the growing season). We advocate using RS for estimating vegetation impacts in climate projections to increase the reliability and effectiveness of adaptive strategies. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Enterococcus species composition was determined each hour for 72 h at a polluted marine beach in Avalon, Santa Catalina Island, CA. Species composition during the day was significantly different from that at night, based on an analysis of similarity. Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis were more prevalent at night than during the day, while E. hirae and other Enterococcus species were more prevalent during the day than the night. Enterococcus spp. containing a yellow pigment were more common during the day than the night, suggesting that the pigmented phenotype may offer a competitive advantage under sunlit conditions. A laboratory microcosm experiment established that the pigmented E. casseliflavus isolate and a pigmented E. faecalis isolate recovered from the field site decay slower than a nonpigmented E. faecalis isolate in a solar simulator in simulated, clear seawater. This further supports the idea that the yellow carotenoid pigment in Enterococcus provides protection under sunlit conditions. The findings are in accordance with previous work with other carotenoid-containing nonphotosynthetic and photosynthetic bacteria that suggests that the carotenoid is able to quench reactive oxygen species capable of causing photoinactivation and photostress. The results suggest that using enterococcal species composition as a microbial source tracking tool may be hindered by the differential environmental persistence of pigmented and nonpigmented enterococci.

AB  - The seasonal variability of the intracellular free amino acid (FAA) concentration was studied in 5 Macoma balthica populations and 7 Mytilus spp. populations along their European distribution. Because of the well known physiological role of FAA as organic osmolytes for salinity induced cell volume regulation in marine osmoconformers, FAA variations were compared in bivalve populations that were exposed to high vs. low intraannual salinity fluctuations. In general, seasonal FAA variations were more pronounced in M. balthica than in Mytilus spp. In both bivalve taxa from different locations in the Baltic Sea, highest FAA concentrations were found in autumn and winter and low FAA concentrations were measured in summer. Seasonal patterns were less pronounced in both taxa at locations with constant salinity conditions. In contrast to Baltic Sea populations, Atlantic and Mediterranean bivalves showed high FAA concentrations in summer and low values in winter, regardless of seasonal salinity fluctuations. Significant seasonal FAA variations at locations with constant salinity conditions showed that salinity appeared not to be the main factor in determining FAA concentrations. The seasonal patterns of the main FAA pool components, i.e. alanine, glycine and taurine, are discussed in the context of seasonal variations in environmental factors (salinity, temperature) and physiological state (glycogen content, reproductive stage).

AB  - Slash-and-burn agriculture is a sequence of interactions between farmers and ecosystems, which includes forest, cropping, fallow, and cropping after fallow. In sampling across this sequence in Pucallpa, Peru, 235 plant species were recorded in the forest, of which 143 were not found in any successive land use. However, plants not occurring in the forest colonized fields and fallow. In total, 595 species were identified across treatments. Changes in communities generally reflected the replacement of shade-tolerant plants, with seed dispersed by bats, other mammals, ants, and larger birds, and by pioneer plants adapted to open conditions and producing larger numbers of small seed, dispersed by smaller birds and the wind. Each form of land use hosted 7-25% of the original forest species, plus 13-66 plant species adapted to that land use. As field conditions changed over time, different sets of more competitive weeds emerged. As a response, farmers changed crops, fallowed fields, and cleared more forest. Farmers were most concerned about Rottboellia cochinchinensis (Lour.) Clayton in fields after fallow, and Imperata brasilinesis Trin., an indicator of land degradation. Older fallow was similar to forest in many respects, although species composition differed. Farmers named useful species across treatments, but counts of these were very low, suggesting high human intervention in the forest and heavy pressure on such species in all land uses.

AB  - The forest vegetation of Istria is considered one of the most interesting vegetation types in the Republic of Croatia. This is confirmed by the presence of a large number of highly diverse forest communities occurring on the border between two completely different plant-geographical regions: the Mediterranean region and the Euro-Siberian North - American region. As climazonal vegetation, forests of holm oak in the Eu-Mediterranean represent special value and a particular asset. Owing to systematic research during the past fifty or more years, the general distribution of holm oak in Istria is well known; however, data on forest communities of holm oak and their phytocoenologcal characteristics are much less known. This means that until the present research, only about forty phytocoenological releves of the forest stands of holm oak in Istria had been released, which clearly demonstrates that these stands have been insufficiently studied and that,further detailed research is required. Synecological-vegetation research was undertaken in 12 localities in the coastal part of Istria, starting with the surroundings of Pore in the north-west, across the western and southern parts, to the surroundings of Pula (Fig. 1). Phytocoenological research of forest vegetation was based on the principles of the Zurich-Montpellier School (Braun-Blanquet 1964). Our own phytocoenological releves were entered into the Turboveg database (Hennekens and Schaminee 2001), together with 30 published phytocoenological releves of forests of holm oak and manna ash, taken in a broader research area and described as the subassociations typicum and cotinetosum. A total of 42 phytocoenological releves were statistically processed. In addition to classical analysis, numerical analysis by means of SYN-TAX 2000 (Podani 2001) software was also conducted. Eco-indicator values according to Pignatti (2005) were applied to describe the ecological conditions using the floral composition, while the mean values for particular releves and forest communities were calculated by means of the JUICE 6.3 programme (Tischy 2002).
   The applied cluster methods showed very similar results and the same general patterns. Accordingly, the majority of the releves are clearly divided into three groups, while only three releves make up a separate group (Fig. 2). Further detailed analysis of the floral composition showed that the studied forest stands of holm oak belong to the first group of releves, typical stands of holm oak and manna ash to the second group, while stands of holm oak and manna ash with smoke tree (Table 1) belong to the third group, and so do the three separate releves. The analysis also showed that all the analyzed phytocoenological releves belong to the same association Fraxino orni-Quercetum ilicis (Horvatic (1956) 1958, with all the floristic and ecological differences that indicate the affiliation to the three subassociations. Thus, the first group of releves is represented by stands of holm oak and manna ash with a significant amount of deciduous elements, the second group is represented by typical stands of holm oak and manna ash, and the third includes stands in the form of maquis and less well developed forests, containing, apart from the species Cotinus coggygria, species of more open sites. This is presented in more detail in Table 1.
   Based on the comparisons of the floral composition in our own releves with the stands of holm oak and manna ash in the Republic of Croatia described earlier, it can be concluded that our stands, in addition to the characteristic and differentiating species of the association Fraxino orni-Quercetum ilicis and the appertaining alliance, order and class, are strongly characterized by the elements from the neighbouring forests of pubescent oak with oriental hornbeam (Querco-Carpinetum orientalis Horvatic 1939). In the tree and shrub layers, these include the deciduous Quercus pubescens, Carpinus orientalis, Quercus cerris, Acer monspessulanum, Coronilla emerus ssp. emeroides, Ligustrum vulgare, Cornus mas, Ulmus minor, Sorbus domestica, Euonymus europaea and others, and in the ground layer the grasses Sesleria autumnalis, Carex halleriana, Brachypodium sylvaticum and Carex flacca.
   Such a large participation of these species, as well as the affiliation of our releves to the association Fraxino orni-Quercetum ilicis, indicate the different nature and specific features that place it into a separate subassociation. Differences in the floral composition in relation to the subassociations typicum and cotinetosum can primarily be attributed to different synecological growth conditions, as seen from the analysis of ecoindicator values according to Pignatti (2005) (Table 2). The studied holm oak forests are characterized by the best synecological conditions and by species that indicate more sciophylic, colder, more continental, more humid and richer sites than those of typical holm oak forests. It should be pointed out that, in relation to the previously described subassociation typicum, our phytocoenological releves differ statistically in all ecological indicators, whereas in relation to the releves of the subassociation cotinetosum, they differ in most of the ecological indicators. These results confirm the earlier understanding on the need to form a special, new subassociation within the forest of holm oak with manna ash.
   In order to make the final decision on the accurate nomination and systematic affiliation of the analyzed stands of holm oak, in addition to the conducted analyses, we should also take into account past descriptions of holm oak forests both from the area of Istria and from the entire distribution range of this species. As evident from all these works, only the subassociations typicum and cotinetosum are accompanied by phytocoenological releves, whereas the others are only furnished with textual descriptions without any concrete phytocoenological releves or a list of differentiating species. This prevented us from making a more accurate and better comparison and clear determination.
   However, taking into consideration the floral composition, the synecological conditions of its occurrence and past descriptions of the subassociations, variants and facies of the association Fraxino orni-Quercetum ilicis, it may be claimed that the studied stands belong to the subassociation carpinetosum orientalis subass. nova hoc loco. This is in accordance with the valid Code of Phytocoenological Nomenclature (see article 7). Hence, releve 4 in Table 1 is taken as the nomenclatural type. Species Carpinus orientalis, Quercus pubescens, Acer monspessulanum, Ligustrum vulgare, Cornus mas, Celtis australis, Carex flacca i Carex halleriana have been determined as differentiating species. In order to reach the final solution to the problem of forests of holm oak with manna ash, both in Istria and in the overall distribution range of this community, we should conduct our own research over a broader area. By doing so we would obtain more comparable data and more specific conclusions on the systematic classification of this association into lower systematic units. Moreover, the newly studied sites provide an excellent basis for further monitoring of syndynamic processes in holm oak forests in Istria.

AB  - Increased pollution in the coastal areas may cause changes in the biodiversity of marine organisms depending upon their physiological capacity and resilience to thrive under stressing environmental conditions. The present research evaluates the heavy metals pollution degree of coastal waters using the macroalgae Ericaria selaginoides as bioindicator along the Atlantic coast of Morocco. Eight stations were chosen: two located near Eljadida city, three nearby Safi city and three around the city of Essaouira. Results showed that the heavy metal content in the thalli of E. selaginoides, in seawater and sediment varied seasonally. At the same time, it was negatively correlated with algal biodiversity onsite. However, the Chemical Oxygen Demand was significantly higher at the polluted station S5 than at other stations, while Dissolved Oxygen and Biological Oxygen Demand were lower. E. selaginoides accumulated metals in the following order Fe > Zn > Mn > Cu > Ni > Pb > Cr > Cd. In conclusion, E. selaginoides is overall more resilient to heavy metal pollution than other marine organisms in the Atlantic coast of Morocco, as indicated by substantially elevated concentrations of heavy metals in some sites. Our results support that E. selaginoides would be a suitable bioindicator for monitoring of heavy metals in polluted coastal areas.

AB  - Distinctive characteristics of land reclamation have formed strong attractions, which inspired people's curiosity and tourist motives. As a unique and essential resource of tourism activities, land reclamation with its highly patriotic spirit and eclectic heritages presents tremendous value in the Chinese tourism industry. However, there is no comprehensive evaluation system of land reclamation tourism (LRT). To solve this research problem, in this study, we delimit the connotation of land reclamation and propose the classification and resources evaluation system of LRT based on the combination of resource characteristics and tourism mode. The classification, balancing the concerns of unit tourist resources, and comprehensively integrated resources while highlighting the principles of universality and practicality, can be classified into two main types, 10 sub-types, and 46 base types. On this basis, the tourism resource evaluation indicator system of land reclamation resources has been built from the aspects of the value of land reclamation culture and tourism resources, natural and social environment, regional development conditions by the methods of Delphi, and analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The empirical research results of Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC) provide us with a specific weight distribution prospect of the classification and evaluation system. The conclusions proposed a new way and method to evaluate LRT resources and provided a necessary reference basis for LRT development.

AB  - This study aimed to present the influence of bio-based and anthraquinone dyes and their combinations on the optical properties of ethylene-propylene (EPM) composites after thermo-oxidative and climatic aging. Therefore, the chosen polymer was filled with a natural, plant-origin flavonoid-quercetin, and with two commercial anthraquinone dyes (C.I. Solvent Yellow 163 and C.I. Solvent Red 207). The manufactured polymer composites were subjected to accelerated aging tests: weathering and thermo-oxidation, respectively. Examination of the materials' properties indicated that the combination of synthetic and natural dyes can result in better resistance to oxidizing agents and higher thermal stability of ethylene-propylene products. Moreover, color change of quercetin-containing samples due to exposure to simulated atmospheric conditions could be a promising solution for use as aging indicators in intelligent packaging materials that will inform about the ongoing degradation process. Another interesting finding is that these samples exhibited good fungistatic activity against Candida albicans yeast and Aspergillus niger mold. Overall, this novel solution based on hybrid polymer composites containing natural and commercial dyes is a more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional materials used in the plastic packaging industry with better and more desirable properties.

AB  - The Izu Ridge off the southern coast of Japan is composed of many seamounts and knolls and is an important fishery ground and hatchery for commercially important fish. As pelagic copepods link lower and higher trophic levels, we investigated the epipelagic copepods in the Izu Ridge using 28S DNA/RNA metabarcoding and microscopic approaches. In comparison with off-ridge regions, a low water temperature and high chlorophyll a concentration were observed in the Izu Ridge, possibly attributed to high levels of nutrients supplied by strong turbulences around the complex topography. We observed unique copepod communities with a large total biomass in the Izu Ridge, owing to the increased dominance of large copepod species. rRNA:rDNA (28S ratio) of these large species mainly showed positive correlations with the chlorophyll a concentration, suggesting a rapid response to the food supply. Migrating copepods were less dominant around the Izu Ridge with a shallow water depth. Higher species diversity and more rare species were detected in the Izu Ridge, which might be maintained by complex environment conditions including temporal and spatial variations in the concentration of chlorophyll a. Thus, the combined approach characterized copepod community structure and diversity supporting the rich pelagic ecosystems in the Izu Ridge.

AB  - We studied assemblages of carabids in eight similar habitats, five in Slovakia and three in Serbia. The ground beetles were caught by pitfall traps from February 2015 until November 2016. We compared the incidence of Carabidae in floodplain forests and ecotones alongside the River Danube in Slovakia and the Rivers Tisza and Begej in Serbia. We determined their association with anthropogenic effects,diversity of plants in the different vegetation layers, cover of vegetation layers (herbaceous plants, shrubs and trees), area of forest stands, circumference of forest stands, distance to forest edge, age of forest stands, depth of leaf litter and physico-chemical properties of soil and leaf litter (conductivity, pH, relative content of H, C, P and N). In total, 2,495 adult individuals of 110 species of carabids were collected. The total epigeic activity of the carabids was significantly and positively associated with the number of species of plants in E-3 vegetation layer and the relative content of N, and negatively with the cover of the E-1 layer. Species richness was significantly positively associated with the number of species of plants in the E-3 layer and the pH of leaf litter, but an opposite trend in evenness.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of non-financial factors in the structure of a financial audit on its quality in energy companies. To assess the impact of the audit on performance indicators of companies under study, it is proposed to use the authors' method by determining the length of the integrated audit vector as well as analysis of variance. The study was carried out on the basis of materials from five large energy (oil and gas) companies from different countries. Santos' conversion of oil well pumps to solar power has clear environmental benefits. Gazprom's social responsibility has, although stable, the lowest results. When conducting a financial audit, this component of performance does not have a significant impact. This explains the company's focus on financial performance. The most effective corporate social responsibility is characteristic of Pioneer Natural Resources (PNR). In Gazprom and E.ON, despite the annual increase in financial indicators according to the classical audit option, the integrated audit vector has lesser value. Changes in the conditions for the formation of efficient activities of energy companies in the context of not only the financial component, but also sustainable development and social responsibility require the transformation of a financial audit in the context of its integration.

AB  - Aquatic plants have long been used as indicators for nutrient enrichment in lakes. In the Mediterranean, however. the process of developing and intercalibrating macrophyte assessment methods for lakes has lagged behind Northern and Central Europe, likely due to the relatively small number and high variability of natural lakes in the Mediterranean but also because of the different monitoring traditions in different parts of Europe. We here present a macrophyte index for assessment of lake eutrophication. tailored to Balkan lakes (Balkan Macrophyte Index, BMI). We analysed submerged aquatic vegetation, water chemistry and sediment total phosphorus content at several sites in lakes Prespa, Ohrid, Lura, Biogradsko, Crno and Sava. located in Albania, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia. Despite the restricted number of lakes in our dataset, the BMI was loosely related to water phosphorus, rather than nitrogen. concentrations. Our results show that macrophyte indices may not be applicable in lakes experiencing annual water level fluctuations of several meters, because the macrophyte vegetation in such lakes may be absent, or alternatively dominated by "oligotrophic" or "eutrophic" species. Once a larger number of lakes has been analysed using the same methods, reference conditions and status class boundaries may be derived from the phosphorus - BMI regression.

AB  - Environmental perceptions are inherently based on an individual's existing knowledge, experiences, and future expectations. Methods for measuring environmental perception, therefore, must capture a range of experiences while also being flexible enough to integrate these experiences into a coherent unit for analysis. Many research topics require cross-cultural comparisons in order to corroborate findings; however, assessments of environmental perception are often place- and context-specific. We propose here post-survey Likert constructions (PSLCs), using semi-structured interviews to construct a five-point scale system from multiple household responses after the completion of interviews. This method is able to capture the natural variability in the population using the respondents' own language and characterizations of phenomena. We applied this method to measure the perceived environmental variability of residents living in a dynamic flooding landscape in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. The PSLC method captures the differences in environmental perception in a location with different settlement and cultural histories, multiple language groups, and different environmental conditions. The method easily transfers to other environments and populations, allowing for potential cross-cultural comparisons of perceived environmental variability. This publication responds to calls for increased transparency in reporting the development, execution, advantages, and disadvantages of methods related to environmental change.

AB  - An increased wind capacity penetration reduces loading on conventional thermal units causing higher fuel requirements due to the off-design operation. Regarding the environmental analysis, such an adverse effect should be allocated to the operational phase of wind turbines. In the present work, we apply Thermo-ecological Cost (TEC) to evaluate the environmental performance of wind power systems operating in Poland and Italy. The analysis focuses on the quantitative assessment of the effect of additional chemical energy consumption due to part-load operation of the conventional power units in both analyzed electricity systems. We present the results for two different dispatch strategies. The results confirm high environmental effectiveness of wind power systems. However, the TEC resulting from the compensation for wind generation variations has a significant contribution to the overall LC-TEC index. In particular, without considering the effect of compensation, the TEC for wind turbines are from 47 to 65 times lower than for coal-fired power plants and 35 to 48 times lower than for NGCC plants. Concerning the real load conditions, and considering the effects resulting from the compensation for wind generation variations, the TEC index for this phase contributes between 36% and 75% to the total TEC value.

AB  - A composite of magnetized natural zeolite and polypyrrole (MZ-PPY) was synthesized and used to explore Cr(VI) removal from aqueous solution and environmental water. A column dynamic set up was employed to analyse adsorption breakthrough performance under different process conditions. Material characterization was done to assess morphology and functional groups and to elucidate Cr(VI) removal mechanism. Results indicate that Cr (VI) removal is a function of bed mass, flowrate and initial Cr(VI) concentration. Sharp breakthrough curves were obtained which are fingerprints of reaction kinetics controlled adsorption process. Consequently, three simple kinetic models; Yoon-Nelson, Thomas and Bohart-Adams were applied to the experimental data to predict the breakthrough curves and to determine the characteristic parameters of the column that are useful for process design. The Yoon-Nelson and Thomas models were found to appropriately describe the breakthrough curves. From material characterization, Cr(VI) removal proceeded mainly by adsorption and reduction. Meanwhile using adsorbent exhaustion rate (AER) as performance indicator, a low value of 0.25 was obtained for environmental water from a chrome mine suggesting that MZ-PPY is a highly efficient adsorption media.

AB  - Morphological features are often the only characteristics suitable for identification of taxa in testate amoebae, especially in ecological and palaeoecological studies. However, whereas the morphology of some species is rather stable it may vary considerably in others. Within the order Arcellinida the genus Trigonopyxis with the type species Trigonopyxis arcula is morphologically highly variable. To identify reliable characteristics for morphology-based taxon delineation we investigated variations in shell size, pseudostome diameter and pseudostome form in T. arcula from three different sites of the Ecuadorian Andes, where these characteristics vary even more than previously described. Further, we investigated if morphological characteristics in Trigonopyxis varied with changes in environmental factors. We studied 951 shells of Trigonopyxis collected along an altitudinal gradient with varying abiotic factors. We established a method for characterization of the pseudostome form, which lead to five different morphotypes. Our results suggest that shell size alone is not an appropriate character for taxon delineation but can be used as an indicator for changes in environmental conditions. In contrast, the pseudostome form might be used for taxon delineation, but likely also varies considerably within taxa. Overall, the study provides an overview of the morphological variability of the genus Trigonopyxis. (C) 2018 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Latin America is one of the most urbanized region in the world, where patterns of urbanization are disorganized and disjoint from urban planning, with unknown effects for ecosystem services (ES). We evaluated the ES in Bogota and Santiago for a 30-year period. Using remote sensing data, models and census data we quantified carbon regulation, climate mitigation and recreation potential. We assessed ES provision changes and their spatio-temporal patterns using landscape metrics. Urban vegetation patterns differ between the two cities because of climate variability and greening policies. Bogota stored more carbon than Santiago given to climate effects, differences within city were the result of different policies and management. Climate mitigation showed similar behavior for both cities, influenced by global climate, densification and urban sprawling. Recreation potential increased in the inner-city and decrease at the outskirts, reflecting unplanned urban sprawling and increase population. Areas of high ecosystem services connected for Bogota and fragmented for Santiago. Bogota improved its environmental condition, as evaluated by ES provision, while Santiago worsens, even there was an increased in vegetation cover. Vegetation cover was not a sufficient indicator for ecosystem services and the distribution of it becomes highly relevant for informing mismatches between services and vegetation.

AB  - The heterogeneous nature and widespread anthropogenic impacts on industrial water biotopes in the Trzuskawica S.A., pose challenges to biomonitoring of this habitat. Generally, the concentration of trace elements in the industrial water biotopes reflects the anthropogenic impacts. With X-ray fluorescence method (TXRF) in waters 17 elements: P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Br, Rb, Sr, Ba, Pb were revealed. High amounts of Ca, from 300 ppm to 198 ppm in May and from 999 ppm to 231 ppm in September 2015, was determined. A total of 36 diatoms were found in two reservoirs and drainage ditch, but only three taxa: Cymatopleura radiosa, Navicula upsaliensis and Nitzschia angustata were present in all 7 sampling sites. These species are known to be tolerant to organic pollution, eutrophication, and also characteristic for limestone waters. The results of CVA showed that diatoms in the water reservoir stocked with fish were distinguished by highest species richness. The relationships between diatoms and environmental variables confirm the positive correlation with the currently functioning industrial plant (despite the increased water temperature and large content of trace elements). Our results suggest that, though heterogeneity in both diatoms and selected elements in industrial waters, diatoms can be useful indicators of habitat conditions.

AB  - The identification of fecal pollution in aquatic ecosystems is one of the requirements to assess the possible risks to human health. In this report, physicochemical parameters, Escherichia coli enumeration and Methanobrevibacter smithii nifH gene quantification were conducted at 13 marine waters in the coastal beaches of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and conductivity, carried out by mobile equipment, revealed varied levels due to specific conditions of the beaches. The bioindicators' enumerations were done by defined substrate method, conventional, and real-time PCR. Six marine beach sites (46 %) presenting E. coli levels in compliance with Brazilian water quality guidelines (< 2500 MPN/100 mL) showed nifH gene between 5.7 x 10(9) to 9.5 x 10(11) copies. L-1 revealing poor correlation between the two approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first inquiry in qPCR using nifH gene as a biomarker of human-specific sources of sewage pollution in marine waters in Brazil. In addition, our data suggests that alternative indicator nifH gene could be used, in combination with other markers, for source tracking studies to measure the quality of marine ecosystems thereby contributing to improved microbial risk assessment.

AB  - The aim of this article consists of developing an ecosystemic approach to collect information about groundwater pollution in order to determine its origin and infer the health risks in Mingoa's watershed through the study of 12 spontaneous settlements. From an environmental point of view, family interviews and direct observations allowed us to inventory springs, wells and latrines, and to collect information. So, we have selected, on the basis of predefined criteria, 21 wells and springs for physico-chemical and bacteriological laboratory analyses. Two hundred children aged less than 5 years were subjected to KOAP examination. A number of 1224 latrines were inventoried, for an average use of 15 people per latrine, producing 913.3 kg/year of excreta. Most of 91% of people use these latrines. The superficial aquifers, connected to the wells and springs, present high values of nitrogen, phosphorous pollutant and fecal contamination indicators (coliforms and fecal streptococcus), which make water inappropriate to human consumption. PCA analysis establishes that water pollution comes mainly from traditional pit latrines. The overall prevalence of diarrhea and parasite infestation was important (= 40%). The presence of cysts of Entamoeba histolytica, Ascaris limbricoides, and Entamoeba coli confirms this high prevalence and testify to very approximate hygiene and environment conditions.

AB  - In this research, indicator properties of the three recently described diatom ecological guilds (low profile, high profile and motile) and their responses to different stressors and disturbances were tested along a temporal gradient. Experiments were run at a standard sampling site in the Torna-stream (Hungary) between 2008 and 2010 using standardized substrata. The low profile guild was dominant during periods with low nutrient (SRP and TN) availability. In contrast, the high profile guild was dominant in resource rich (SRP and SRSi) periods. The motile ecological guild was the most sensitive to the nutrients (TN and SRSi) and some other factors (e.g. temperature, Cl-). Increasing irradiance in spring and summer favored the growth of the high and the low profile guild. Higher resistance to floods favored the adhesion type of the low profile guild enabling their summer peak in terms of relative abundance. During high flood periods, incident light availability apparently sufficed the needs of this guild. Seasonal changes of the diatom ecological guilds and guild diversity were robust and predictable. This study supported that the ecological responses of diatom ecological guilds, despite the apparent simplicity of the grouping method, is strong enough to indicate the temporally changing environmental conditions.

AB  - The aim of the present study is to demonstrate the value of some nitrophilous plants as bioindicators related to global warming. As a case study, the space-time dynamics of the populations of some nitrophilous and ruderal species have been investigated along the southern-central Adriatic side of the Italian Peninsula. These have been examined according to the range of their distribution areas, to their ecological needs, and to the availability of past data, which have then been related to the data on global warming across the same territories. The choice for this investigation was for nitrophilous species with a Mediterranean distribution - of the Stenomediterranean type - and for some recent entries into the local flora as alien species. The spread of these species occurs in areas with intense human activity, where they have exploited the conditions of the warmer niche, such that their presence and their spatial spread observed over time are clearly linked to global warming. For all of the species in question, rapid increases in the population numbers have been observed, along with a northward shift of their distribution areas. These changes correspond to the increase in average annual temperature as revealed by the thermometric measurements.

AB  - In many animals, individual differences in behavior show remarkable consistency across situations and contexts (i.e., animal personality and behavioral syndromes). Studies on the association between personality traits and fitness-related measures in nature are, however, important to clarify the causes and consequences of this phenomenon. Here, we tested for correlations between 3 behavioral axes in brown trout ( Salmo trutta) parr: exploration tendency, behavioral flexibility, and aggressiveness. Next, we tested how these individual behaviors relate to social dominance and performance under natural conditions ( growth, survival, and movement). We found support for behavioral syndromes in brown trout with less explorative individuals being less aggressive and showing more flexible behavior. In addition, these low-explorative personality types grew faster than bolder conspecifics in the wild. Standardized aggression in the laboratory was a poor indicator of social dominance, and neither of these 2 traits affected performance in the wild. These results challenge the view that personality traits can be predicted by constant associations with life-history trade-offs (e.g., boldness is linked with rapid growth). Moreover, our findings suggest that fitness predictions from laboratory measures of behavior should be made with caution and ideally tested in nature.

AB  - Saproxylic beetles response to cork-oak forests heterogeneity in the Massif des Maures (France). - Cork-oak stands are a major component of the "Massif des Maures" forests (France, Var). Depending on fire frequency, soil conditions and human uses, these forests present different forms. Even if Mediterranean landscapes have been shaped for a long time by fire, such recurrent perturbation may affect several functional groups of organisms associated with old forests, such as saproxylics insects. Our aims were (i) to investigate species richness and composition of saproxylic beetle assemblages in different cork-oak stands, (ii) to estimate between stand complementarity and (iii) identify indicator species of each habitat. Three different types of cork-oak stands common in the "Massif des Maures", representing an increasing gradient of canopy closing and ecosystem maturing, were investigated : a senescent stand associated with mature maquis, an adult stand with high maquis and an open adult stand with low maquis. Beetles were sampled from April to August in 2003 and 2004 using baited window traps. Our results showed that : (i) the three studied cork-oak stands can be considered as three different habitats regarding saproxylic beetle assemblages, (ii) the closed cork-oak stands support the highest cumulative species richness, (iii) abundances of ecological groups show significant between-stands differences, (iv) each habitat Supports remarkable species from a patrimonial point of view.

AB  - Concentrations of fecal bacteria, somatic and F-specific coliphages, and phages infecting Bacteroides fragilis in naturally occurring black mussels (Mytilus edulis) were determined. Mussels were collected over a 7-month period at four sampling sites with different levels Of fecal pollution. Concentrations of both fecal bacteria and bacteriophages in mussel meat paralleled the concentration of fecal bacteria in the overlying waters. Mussels bioaccumulated efficiently, although with different efficiencies, all of the microorganisms studied. Ratios comparing the levels of microorganisms in mussels were determined. These ratios changed in mussels collected at the different sites. They suggest that bacteriophages infecting B. fragilis and somatic coliphages have the lowest decay rates among the microorganisms studied, with the exception of Clostridium perfringens. On the contrary, concentrations of F-specific coliphages showed a greater rate of decay than the other bacteriophages at sites more distant from the focus of contamination. Additionally, levels of enteroviruses were studied in a number of samples, and in these samples, the B. fragilis bacteriophages clearly outnumbered the enteroviruses. The results of this study indicate that, under the environmental conditions studied, the fate of phages infecting B. fragilis released into the marine environment resembles that of human viruses more than any other microorganism examined.

AB  - An upgraded flue-gas cooling-reheating system called an organic gas-gas heater, which builds a heat-pump cycle downstream of the wet desulfurisation process, is proposed for coal-fired power plants. Compared with the existing system, it can improve the particulate matter 2.5 emissions and alleviate sulfuric-acid corrosion.
   Adjustability of operating parameters is restricted by the standards in power industry and the automatic control habit of users. In view of this, multi-objective optimisation was conducted for the organic gas-gas heater system, on the premise of unalterable heat-source and heat-sink parameters and fixed working-fluid evaporating and condensing temperatures. According to comparison results for 31 selected working fluids under six operating conditions, it is feasible to realise a trade-off among thermodynamic, economic, and environmental objectives, even though the sole alterable parameter is the type of working fluid.
   The rank sum ratio method was applied to the field of working-fluid selection for the first time. As a comprehensive assessment method, it was confirmed in this study to be simple and effective. Moreover, R245ca is the optimum working fluid in this study, but the results indicate that the priority of the working fluid must be reconsidered if the operating conditions or assessment criteria change.

AB  - Coral bacteria are highly dynamic and acutely affected by host health and environmental conditions. However, there is limited knowledge of how the dynamics of coral-associated bacterial communities and interactions among bacterial members change in response to dissolved inorganic nutrient stressors. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to examine dynamic changes in coral-associated bacterial communities under elevated ammonium stress. Short-term exposure to high levels of ammonium does not significantly harm coral holobiont. Physiological parameters such as carbohydrate, chlorophyll a, and lipid content of coral holobiont were not affected. After three weeks of elevated ammonium stress, however, the coral-associated bacterial community changed significantly. The abundance of certain bacterial populations increased significantly, with enrichment of pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria and a decrease in defensive and core bacteria. Keystone bacterial species in the co-occurrence network changed considerably. Under elevated ammonium stress, the abundance of keystone species associated with corals was lower and the complexity of keystone bacterial relationships decreased significantly. Our results indicate that bacteria respond to elevated ammonium stress through changes in abundance and co-occurrence among bacterial members. This precedes visual symptoms of changes in coral physiological conditions and could be used as an early warning indicator of elevated ammonium stress in coastal coral reef management.

AB  - For sustainable production and consumption, emerging green technologies must be optimized in order to achieve a minimal environmental impact, a maximal economic impact, and dynamic behavior. The need for environmentally sustainable production and consumption is now one of the main developmental goals. To enable a more sustainable production in the chemical sector, new green chemical technologies from renewable feedstock such as furfural (a chemical compound produced from biomass used as a building block in the production of biofuels) are currently being developed. Furfural, a versatile chemical, is also employed as a solvent, an extractant base for fungicides, and a platform for other compounds. In this work, the simultaneous optimization of design parameters and control properties, which are highly relevant targets according to the principles of green chemistry, is performed within the reaction zone in the production process of furfural from biomass. The Differential Evolution with Taboo List algorithm (DETL) is used to carry out the multiobjective optimization. The total annual cost (TAC), eco-indicator 99 (EI99), and condition number, which represent the objective functions for a sustainable process, are combined as economic, environmental, and controllability criteria, respectively. Based on the results, the operating conditions found allow for an acceptable furfural production of 2014.4 kg/h, which reduce costs by 39% and its environmental impact by 42% in a system with satisfactory control properties compared to a case base.

AB  - Stable isotope geochemistry is a well-known tool for the investigation of palaeoclimate. The application of this methodology to molluscan carbonate materials has increasingly receiving more attention in recent decades, stimulating the development of numerous environmental reconstructions. Among the different habitats and shell species investigated so far, the freshwater are the ones that have received least attention. The scarcity of systematic studies on lacustrine and riverine molluscan species considerably limits the use of these remains to reconstruct the environmental conditions of inland palaeontological and archaeological sequences. The present study focuses on Bithynia tentaculata, a freshwater species abundant in the European Quaternary fossil record. The aim of the research is to validate the use of oxygen (delta O-18) and carbon stable isotopes (delta C-13) of this species as palaeoenvironmental proxies. For this purpose, shells and opercula from stratigraphic sequences of three palaeolakes in eastern Poland, formed during the Holsteinian Interglacial (MIS 11), are analysed. The inter correlation between B. tentaculata and two other molluscan species, together with good agreement with the pollen record, reveal that delta O-18 and delta C-13 are suitable indicators of water temperature and humidity levels for lacustrine environments. These results pave the way for using B. tentaculata in further palaeoclimatic reconstructions.

AB  - Many drought indices have been developed for drought analysis, one of which is the Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI) that is widely used all over the world due to its inherent capability of sensitivity and resilience. Since the RDI takes into account both the cumulative precipitation and the potential evapotranspiration that is marked as the main advantage. In this study, a modified version of RDI (mRDI) is proposed to evaluate RDI time series by reliability-resilience-vulnerability-max extent metrics. The use of these performance indices incorporates the frequency, recovery period, probable severity and extremity of droughts. As in many sustainability indexes, the high (low) values of mRDI indicate being in a good (bad) status of the region with respect to drought conditions. The application of mRDI is illustrated for four different provinces of Turkey with different precipitation and temperature regimes. The long-term (between 1970-1971 and 2015-2016 water years) monthly precipitation and mean temperature data were used in the study. The 12 months-RDI time series, which used for calculations of mRDI, were obtained by the use of DrinC software. The study revealed that the mRDI is a valuable index, and it allows evaluating not only the recent conditions, but also the historical droughts in a single metric. It provides additional insights for the studies dealing with socioeconomic droughts, ecologic droughts, moreover, mRDI can be used as an efficient indicator in water resources management and agriculture insurance issues.

AB  - This work aimed to study the biodegradation of marine fuel MF-380 by selected microbial consortium and to determine the most favorable conditions for this process. Initially, strains isolated from seawater of the port of Suape - PE were subjected to a test to assess the occurrence of microbial interactions and then microbial consortia were mounted and the most promising consortium was selected by redox indicators. The strains of the selected consortium were acclimated to increasing levels of marine fuel MF-380 (1%, 2% and 3%, v v(-1)) and NaCI (1%, 2% and 3%, w v(-1)). Subsequently, it was applied a full factorial 2(3) experimental design to investigate the influence of variables (temperature, pH, C: N ratio) in the biodegradation process and finally an experiment in a bioreactor employing the best conditions found in the experimental design. Consortium named C5 was the most promising and reached as best result a total hydrocarbon biodegradation of 93.5% in the experimental design and reached levels of degradation optimized on trial in the bioreactor for the constituents of the marine fuel MF-380. Therefore, the consortium C5 is capable of degrading marine fuel MF-380 and can be used as a bioremediation agent of environments polluted by this fuel. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficiency of personal body microclimate cooling systems based on a phase change materials and its effects on physiological strain in soldiers during exertional heat stress in hot environment. The results are obtained in the experiment conducted in the climatic chamber in the Institute of Hygiene, Military Medical Academy in Belgrade. Ten male soldiers were voluntarily subjected to exertional heat stress tests consisted of walking on treadmill (5.5 km/h) in hot conditions (40 degrees C) in climatic chamber. The subjects performed first test while wearing afield camouflage uniform without any cooling system (CONTROL group) and in second test they used additional microclimate cooling system with paraffin wax consist of n-hexadecane (C16H34), in a form of cooling packs (COOL group). As indicators of thermal strain, mean skin (T-sk) and tympanic (T-ty) temperature were determined. Simultaneously, thermal effects of phase change materials were measured by thermal imaging camera. The exercise in hot conditions induced a physiological response to heat stress, manifested through increased body core and skin temperatures. The results confirmed that the cooling vest worn over the field uniform was able to attenuate the physiological strain during exercise, compared to the identical exposure in the "control" group. The results of thermal imaging also indicate that heat generated inside the body is the main factor that will affect the phase change material melting time.

AB  - This paper demonstrates the results of our research activities in which we validated state-of-the-art theory of technology acceptance (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology-UTAUT) in the context of a specific e-learning system-Moodle. This research was performed because there is little research reported in the area of e-learning acceptance and there are only a few validations of UTAUT in the context of e-learning. Research objectives were achieved with an online survey in which we included Likert-based statements related to UTAUT concepts and concepts specific to e-learning systems. The survey was performed on a random sample of undergraduate students, who were asked about their level of agreement or disagreement related to their acceptance of Moodle. The answers from 235 students were primarily analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) which demonstrated the validity of concepts and the level of causal relationships between concepts. We found that performance expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions have a direct effect on students' attitudes towards using Moodle, where performance expectancy was the strongest determinant of student attitudes. Students' intention for using Moodle is caused by social influence and facilitating conditions. Behavioural intentions were shown to be a strong indicator for the actual use of Moodle. The implications and limitations of the present study are also discussed.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the statistical and geographical links between the prevalence of obesity and a range of socio-economic indicators in a major UK city
   Design/methodology/approach - The geographical pattern of fresh fruit and vegetable retailing was mapped across Birmingham (UK), and this data was combined with UK census data from Neighbourhood Statistics to investigate possible correlations between obesity and the social geography of this city. To further elicit the varying underlying links between obesity and social conditions, a methodology of partial correlations was used to create "social transects" across Birmingham so the operational effects of social conditions upon poor diet could be investigated across a range of Birmingham neighbourhood types.
   Findings - Across Birmingham as a whole, people whose ethnic or social make-up did not fit the dominant group in their neighbourhood were more likely to be obese than those of the majority socio-ethnic group for that area. The level of qualifications was the dominant influencer on obesity and diet. Particularly, less wealthy people in the more affluent areas of Birmingham were likely to suffer financial difficulties in eating healthily. However, in less affluent areas, being in (low-paid) work actually increased the chances of being obese, as compared to being unemployed in these districts.
   Research limitations/implications - Changes in the pattern of retailing or changes in individual's social status over the period of this research may confound the results; however the research may be regarded as a snapshot of conditions in Birmingham in ca.2006. The areal analysis may be confounded by the MAUP problem, although as distance to shops does not emerge as a major predictor of obesity, the results are still valid. The research applies to only one city (Birmingham), although a wide range of neighbourhood types typical of other British cities are covered.
   Practical implications - Time limitations emerge as a significant factor in diet, especially in the less-affluent areas of Birmingham. The significance of a range of social indicators upon diet is greatly affected by the range of neighbourhood types sampled. Factors barring access to a healthy diet can vary upon very small scales, even down to the individual household. Distance to shops has an effect upon diet, but only as a "moderating factor" acting in conjunction with a wider range of economic and social factors.
   Social implications - The effects of poverty, and especially unemployment, have very different effects upon diet and obesity in poor as compared to affluent areas; and in poorer areas, time limitations upon households operate so as to worsen the diet of those in low-paid work. This implies that dietary improvement initiatives aimed at the less well off should aim for a compromise between health and convenience; otherwise such initiatives will merely widen health inequalities. Minority groups in all areas, whether a minority by ethnicity, age, or wealth, need special attention by dietary investigators.
   Originality/value - The use of partial correlations to elicit the different responses to socio-economic conditions as regards diet has not been applied before to a major UK city. The distance to shops for all residential areas for a major UK city has not been previously mapped.

AB  - Background: The darkling beetle, Alphitobius diaperinus is the most commonly beetle found in poultry sheds and causes economic and sanitary impact in the poultry industry. The life cycle of the mealworm can vary from one to three months depending on environmental conditions, and adults can survive for up to one year. The insect lives in the poultry litter where it eats feed and organic waste. The temperature in the poultry house and the accumulation of feed and organic matter promote ideal conditions for beetle infestation. The consumption of beetles affects feed conversion in poultry, especially in the first days of life and it is often cited as a vector of viral, bacterial and parasitic pathogens. The control of its populations is generally achieved by insecticide application on the walls and floor, but resistant populations of beetles are often reported. Phosphine gas is used as a fumigant to control insects in stored grain. In this study the efficacy of phosphine gas against this beetle was evaluated.
   Materials, Methods & Results: Two experiments were conducted: one in vitro trial, and a trial simulating field conditions. The in vitro trial aimed to evaluate the exposure time required (ETR) to obtain 100% insect mortality, in the presence and absence of wood shavings. Adults and larvae were tested separately. In treatment T1, 100 adult beetles were placed in a petri dish without poultry litter; treatment T2, had 100 adult beetles per plate and filled with sterilized poultry litter. Treatments T3 and T4 had 100 A. diaperinus larvae per plate, in absence and presence of poultry litter, respectively. Three repetitions were performed for each treatment. Insect mortality in plates was monitored at 5 min intervals. The absence of beetle movements after shaking the plate was considered an indicator of insect mortality. The field evaluation was carried out in a poultry house with litter infested with A. diaperinus. The evaluation was made in areas of 1 m(2) where 2 gm(-3) of aluminum phosphide was applied, according to manufactures recommendation. The area of product application was covered with a plastic cover to seal the litter. Under in vitro conditions the ETR for total mortality of insects in plates with presence of litter was 15 min for larvae and 20 min for adults. In plates without poultry litter the ETR for A. diaperinus mortality was 25 and 35 min, for larvae and adults, respectively. It was observed that the presence of poultry litter in the plates reduced the volume and so increased the phosphine gas concentration, causing more rapid inset death. The mortality of adults and larvae insects occurred approximately 30 s after the exposure to the product. All the insects exposed to the phosphine gas died, resistant insects were not observed. In the field test the ETR to obtain 100% of mortality was 90 min for larvae and adults.
   Discussion: The phosphine gas showed good potential to be used in strategic control of A. diaperinus. The product was effective in the killing adults and larvae beetles on in vitro and in field trials. However, more studies are needed to establish the issues related to safe use of PH3 in poultry facilities.

AB  - In the continuous search for the improvement of processes, recently, alternative schemes have been proposed to separate and purify levulinic acid produced from the acid hydrolysis of biomass. These alternatives offer both energy and economic savings, and reduction of environmental impact; however, their control properties have not been considered for possible industrial implementation. In this work, a controllability analysis was carried out of previously optimized designs using the relative gain array (RGA), the total condition number (TCN) and a sensitivity index for performance assessment in open-loop. Finally, the dynamic performance in closed-loop is evaluated using PI controllers having as criteria the integral absolute error (IAE). Through analysis, the best scheme obtained presented a low total condition number, however, its sensitivity index is below the average of all the designs analyzed. Additionally, the RGA analysis shows a stable structure in the frequencies studied keeping low values of eco-indicators 99 and total annual cost. The general topology consists of a liquid-liquid extraction column, a conventional distillation column and a dividing wall column with a decanter. On the other hand, by means of this robust analysis of the control properties was proposed some guidelines between the structure for improving control properties in intensified distillation schemes.

AB  - Thefailure of pipelines in water distribution networks results in a significant volume of pristine quality water being lost. Failing infrastructure is often identified through different condition monitoring methods and then maintained. Increasing pressures on a rapidly growing water supply network call for more efficient leak detection techniques. Infrared (IR) thermography has received little attention in the literature, with little effort spent on understanding and assessing its feasibility, pertaining to the detection of buried pipe leaks. The present study develops and tests a passive leak detection methodology using IR thermography (informed by scientific literature) for small diameter buried reticulation pipes. The method was assessed in the field at 27 sites comprising water leaks beneath soil and grass nature strips. Results showed that the passive leak detection method by means of IR thermography was able to clearly identify 59% of leaks, with an additional 22% of sites having notable, yet inconclusive, thermal signatures. Based on image interpretation of field data, the authors propose a set of four types of surface thermal signatures likely to be detected from leaking water reticulation pipes, and a conceptual representation of subsurface processes that would produce these signatures. The study creates opportunities for improving the practicality of IR thermography as a leak detection tool and its combination with other techniques for better automation and data fusion.

AB  - This study has examined bulk and compound specific organic carbon isotopes (delta C-13(org)) and lipid n-alkanes of modem plants and a wetland sediment sequence from the central Tibetan Plateau and explores the usefulness of these two methods for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions. Results show that a combination of delta C-13(org) values and n-alkane indices can help differentiate organic matter from C3 terrestrial plant, C4 terrestrial plant and submerged macrophytes, the three main sources of organic matter in the study area. The analyses of total organic carbon, delta C-13(org) values and n-alkane indices for the sediment sequence imply that a wetland habitat was established about 8000 years ago, and the wetland conditions were largely stable with dominantly 0 wetland herbs covering the wetland. However, small fluctuations in the dominant organic matter supply between vascular and aquatic plants are revealed, suggesting short duration changes in the extent of open water area within the wetland or variations in the productivity of submerged macrophytes and aquatic plants within the wetland ecosystem, which reflects variations in the strength of precipitation and evaporation.

AB  - The paper provides essentially a summary of PD measurements applying the UHF range in order to increase the detection threshold, to improve the localization accuracy and to perform on-line measurements of Partial Discharge (PD) in noisy environments. The electromagnetic URF technique offers good signal to noise ratios, because external PD signals and disturbances can be shielded effectively. A new developed method allows the localization of PD in gas-insulated substations (GIS) by frequency domain measurements. The basic idea is the displacement law of Fourier transformation. The interference phenomena of superposed signals from two sensors give information about the time delay of the sensor signals. On-site PD measurements are made at cable connectors by means of monopole antennas housed in a barrel sleave, while the cable is in service. Thus a sensitive PD measurement even in noisy environment is possible. PD-measurements on several 72 kV cable connectors were performed in an unshielded laboratory. On-site measurements during operation showed the great potential for condition assessment. For decoupling sensitive UHF PD signals from the inner of a power transformer tank UHF sensors applied through drain/oil valves are used. Experimental studies indicate that all relevant types of PD possibly occurring within a transformer emit high frequency spectra to be detected with UHF sensors. Furthermore in laboratory experiments and on-site measurements very moderate UHF signal attenuations have been observed.

AB  - Nearcritical (NC) and supercritical (SC) ethanol may offer novel media for both chemical reactions and separations as a replacement for environmentally undesirable organic solvents. We investigated the dipolarity/polarizability, hydrogen-bond donating acidity and accepting basicity in terms of Kamlet-Taft solvatochromism parameters pi*. a and beta in saturated liquid ethanol from 25 to 225 degreesC and in gaseous and SC ethanol at 250 degreesC as a function of pressure. Reichardt's E-T(30) scale was determined for ethanol under the same conditions. NC and SC ethanol has a wide range of solvent strength. which can be readily and continuously tuned by temperature and pressure. Liquid ethanol becomes nearly nonpolar as the temperature increases towards its critical point. The dipolarity/polarizability for SC ethanol ranges from gas-like to nonpolar liquid-like with increasing pressure. On the other hand. ethanol maintains significant hydrogen-bond donating acidity even under the supercritical conditions at 250 degreesC and at pressures up to 18.7 MPa. The hydrogen-bond accepting basicity, however. is considerably weakened at elevated temperatures. These well-established solvent parameters greatly improve our understanding of hot compressible ethanol, and allow us to explore the feasibility of using it in a variety of benign processes.

AB  - Organic matter accumulation and preservation in lakes with different geomorphological and climatic regimes, is directly influenced not only by local but also by regional and more global climatic conditions. Thus, compositional variations in lacustrine organic matter can be used as good indicators of paleoenvironmental conditions of deposition.
   Relatively high average TOC (1.0-6.5 wt%) and good lamination characterize most of the Holocene sequence of Lake St. Moritz, an Alpine lake located in SE Switzerland. However, variations in the type and quality of the organic matter at discrete intervals have been distinguished using bulk parameters and biomarker distributions. The most prominent change occurs at the Late Glacial-Holocene boundary, where delta(13)C((OM)), Hydrogen Index and lipid concentrations indicate a substantial increase in primary productivity. Organic matter production and preservation appear to dominate from the early Holocene until approximately 3.8 Ka BP, although variations in sterol contents and fatty acid distributions indicate superimposed fluctuations, such as between 8.3 and 8.1 Ka BP and 5.1 4.8 Ka BP. These variations in the lake trophic-state can be correlated with other proglacial lakes in the region, as well as with similar lacustrine records on both sides of the Alps. The result of this comparison indicates a synchronous character of major to medium-amplitude climatic shifts on a European scale. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

KW  - EASTERN
AB  - The results of a 5 year study with 6 termiticides including: bifenthrin, chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, fenvalerate, permethrin, and isofenphos indicate significant differences in effectiveness among products applied to different soil types in Texas. Each of the 5 field test locations represent very different soil types and environmental conditions. Test locations within Texas included: Lubbock, Dallas, Overton, Corpus Christi and College Station. Termiticides were applied in 1990 with soil samples taken from the replicated treatment plots at 1 and 6 months, and then annually through 5 years. Soil residues of termiticides were measured with gas chromatography. The amount of pesticide remaining in each sampling period indicates a significant loss of termiticide by the fifth year of the test. The bioavailability of termiticide remaining In the soil was estimated through bioassays utilizing field collected subterranean termites (Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar)). Both tunneling distance and mortality were used as indicators of termiticide activity and availability. The results of the bioassays confirmed the findings of the residue analysis portion of the project. The most stable termiticides, through 5 years, were permethrin and fenvalerate. Isofenphos was the least stable with significant loss of activity within 24 months post-application. The most challenging conditions, in terms of effective termiticide residuals retained through time, were alkaline soils with high clay content and organic compositions greater than 1%. The most favorable soils were those that are acidic with low clay and organic content.

AB  - In order to correctly interpret field data related to bioindicators, laboratory experiments were carried out to study Ru-106 accumulation and release by mosses, as a function of experimental procedures and conditions, aimed to reproduce ecological realities. Mosses were exposed to Ru-106 during 5 to 7 days and then transferred to an inactive, daily-renewed medium. Results were expressed mathematically by a sum of two exponential functions for fixation, which was shown to be a two-phase rapid and intense phenomenon, and by a simple exponential function for elimination, which was slower and regular. Three rhythms of contaminant release were simulated, and they were found to have little effect on fixation extent as measured by concentration factor, while the speed of fixation was affected slightly. Accumulation was also studied under two opposite seasons, simulated by modifying temperature, illumination and daylight period. It occured with very different kinetics, suggesting an important intervention of adsorption processes, whose speed is conditioned by temperature. This hypothesis was supported by the considerable effect the size of the exchange surface had on extent and speed of fixation, shown by comparison of accumulation in two species. Nevertheless, reduced uptake in darkness indicated the probable role of physiological processes. As far as desorption is concerned, the studied factors had little effect. The most significant differences in retention were due to the previous average exposure time and to exchange surface size.

AB  - The California Current Ecosystem (CCE) has been in a primarily warm state since 2014, and this pattern largely continued into 2019. The CCE experienced a mild El Nino from late 2018 into 2019, and basin-scale indicators reflected this condition (elevated Oceanic Nitio Index and Pacific Decadal Oscillation; table 1). Despite the El Nino, spring upwelling was above average between southern California and Washington but below average in Baja California. Sea surface temperature (SST) was mostly near the long-term average between Washington and southern California, while surface chlorophyll a was above average in Oregon/Washington and slightly below average in most of California in spring/early summer 2019. SST changed dramatically by fall 2019, however, as a marine heat wave (MHW) that formed in May 2019 in the Gulf of Alaska impinged upon the West Coast of the United States. The expansion of the 2019 MHW followed a similar pattern to the 2014-15 MHW.
   Off Oregon, the zooplankton assemblage was in a mixed state as southern copepods were close to average while northern copepod abundances were positively anomalous in 2019. Off northern California, Euphausia pacifica body size was smaller than average. Euphausid abundances were well below average in both central and southern California in 2019.
   In the north, winter 2019 larval fish abundances were high and dominated by offshore taxa that are associated with warm conditions; spring larval and post-larval biomass were close to average; and spring surface trawls observed record-high market squid (Doryteuthis opalescens) abundances. The single most important finding in 2019 was that northern anchovy (Engraulis tnordax) adults and larvae were at record-high abundances in central and southern California. In central California, market squid and Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) were also abundant. In southern California warm-water mesopelagic fishes have been very abundant since 2014, and this trend continued into 2019.
   Indicators for future salmon returns were mixed in 2019. The abundance of northern copepods, which correlate positively with returns, was high. However, abundances of yearling Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and coho salmon (O. kisutch), which also correlate positively with returns, were slightly below average. Winter ichthyoplankton was comprised mostly of southern or offshore taxa, which bodes poorly for future salmon returns.
   Seabird (common murre [Urfa aalge]; Brandt's cormorant [Phalacrocorax penidllatus]; and pelagic cormorant [Phalacrocorax pelagicus]) productivity off Oregon was the highest in years in both 2018 and 2019. In 2018, common murre chicks in Oregon consumed large amounts of young-of-the-year flatfish, a prey item known to be conducive to chick survival. Despite the prevalence of northern anchovy in central California, common murre and Brand's cormorant production was low in Southeast Farallon Island as these birds were unable to feed optimally on northern anchovy, and there was a scarcity of more appropriate prey such as young-of-the-year flat-fishes or rockfishes.
   California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), by contrast, benefitted greatly from the large northern anchovy forage base. In 2018, live pup count, weight, and growth rate were anomalously high, and northern anchovy remains occurred in >85% of scat samples. Humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) sightings were also very high in 2019, likely because humpback whales congregated near shore to feed on northern anchovy.

AB  - The importance of oats as a healthy food for people is growing, and this draws attention to the production of environmentally friendly products, using environmentally friendly approaches and tools in agriculture. The study' was conducted at the Demonstration Center for Organic Agriculture at the AU, Bulgaria during the 2013-2015 period. The aim of the study is the influence of biofertilizer Amalgerol on germination, development, productivity and some quality indicators of the grain in naked oats. Applied by seed treatment and vegetation on plants, increases the percentage of sprouted and harvested plants by 10% at a dose of 5 l/ha and by 13.4% at a dose of 10 l/ha. Amalgerol increases the weight of the grain from one plant in the adverse weather conditions of 2014 by 0.25 g to 0.30 g at different fertilization doses, as well as the weight of 1000 grains by 3.70 to 4.19% compared to the control. The effect on grain yield was positive by 17.26% at a dose of 5 l/ha and by 35.69% at a dose of 10 l/ha above the control. Amalgerol (10 l/ha) increases the hectolitre weight of the grain. There is more crude protein and crude fat in the grain in the unfertilized variant, and starch in the variants treated with Amalgerol (5 l/ha) - 51.18% and (10 l/ha) - 49.43%.

AB  - Mercury is a ubiquitous environmental toxicant and a cause for global concern due to its persistence and bioaccumulation in the environment. Evaluating the effectiveness of mercury emission control has become a significant issue after the entry into force of the Minamata Convention on Mercury in 2017. Atmospheric mercury concentration is an important indicator for anthropogenic emission control. Although Eulerian models are generally applied to evaluate emission reduction and policy effectiveness, the uncertainty of mercury reaction mechanisms and the insufficient grid accuracy of simulations limit the applications of this method at particular sites. In this study, we applied a statistical approach (the Generalized Additive Model, GAM) to explain the decline of atmospheric mercury concentration in Beijing, China, which followed a trend (Sen's slope) of -0.37 m(-3)yr(-1) (-8.0% yr(-1)). The statistical model represented 56.5% of the variance in mercury concentration and the adjusted R-2 reached 0.547. Reduction of anthropogenic mercury emission, variation in meteorological condition, and change in global background level explained 51.5%, 47.1%, and 1.4% of the decrease of air mercury concentration, respectively. We validated the results using Hg emission inventories, seasonal Hg/CO value, and meteorological data. Considering the limitations of Eulerian models and the simplicity of statistical models, we suggest the application of GAM as an assessment method for long-term variation of atmospheric mercury.

AB  - The configuration of the reactor influences the digestion process and thus the product yields; other factors such as the rate of biogas production or biogas loss also affect the process specifically with high solid configuration. With these in mind, the ORganic WAste REsearch (ORWARE) anaerobic digestion sub-model was modified to be able to study solid-state anaerobic digestion (SS-AD) (using plug-flow reactor). The simulation results from the updated model agreed with the operational data with respect to methane yield, digestate yield and energy turnover. The model was found to be sensitive to changes in feedstock composition but to a lesser extent to changes in process temperature and retention time. By applying the model on several cases of liquid anaerobic digestion (L-AD), it was noticed that L-AD at mesophilic condition with 25 retention days seemed to be superior to other cases of L-AD with regard to energy turnover. However, even if similar methane production were observed for L-AD and SS-AD, the model suggested higher energy turnover for the case of SS-AD at thermophilic condition, being 10% more in average in comparison with cases of L-AD.

TI  - Indigenous knowledge for seasonal weather and climate forecasting across East Africa
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
LA  - English
AB  - Climate information and agro-advisory services are crucial in helping smallholder farmers and pastoralists in East Africa manage climate-related risks and adapt to climate change. However, significant gaps exist in provision of climate information that effectively addresses the needs of farmers and pastoralists. Most farmers and pastoralists, therefore, rely on indigenous knowledge (IK), where local indicators and experiences are used to observe and forecast weather conditions. While IK-based forecasting is inbuilt and established in many communities in East Africa, coordinated research and systematic documentation of IK for weather forecasting, including accuracy and reliability of IK is largely lacking. This paper documents and synthesizes existing IK for weather forecasting in East Africa using case studies from Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Uganda. The results show that farmers and pastoralists use a combination of meteorological, biological, and astrological indicators to forecast local weather conditions. IK weather forecasting is, therefore, crucial in supporting efforts to improve access to climate information in East Africa, especially in resource-poor and vulnerable communities. The paper draws valuable lessons on how farmers and pastoralists in East Africa use IK weather forecasts for making crop and livestock production decisions and demonstrates that the trust and willingness to apply scientific forecasts by farmers and pastoralists is likely to increase when integrated with IK. Therefore, a systematic documentation of IK, and a framework for integrating IK and scientific weather forecasting from national meteorological agencies can improve accuracy, uptake, and use of weather forecasts.

AB  - Small glaciers on the Balkan Peninsula are tiny masses of firn and ice (areas from 0.5 to 5 ha) which have been proved permanent at least since the coldest phases of the Little Ice Age, and are slowly moving under their own gravity. These are considered glacial, but also karstic features at the same time, because the topography that provides for their existence in the marginal conditions of the Mediterranean climate is result of the occurrence of Pleistocene glaciation together with the carbonate rocks and the karst processes related to them. Small glaciers on the Balkan Peninsula are among the most southerly situated in Europe. They are very sensitive to short-term variations of climate, and serve as natural indicators for climate change. The present study is dedicated to small glaciers in Pirin (Bulgaria) and Durmitor (Montenegro) as representative high mountain glacio-karstic features from the western and the eastern part of the Balkan Peninsula respectively. The similarities and differences in their inter-annual behaviour (changes of size) reflect the general and peculiar characteristics of high mountain climate, and the specific influence of topography. In the conditions of climatic warming a downward trend is registered in their development for the period on the focus of this study: 2005-2017. In the last several years this trend has a stronger expression in the western Balkans.

AB  - Low levels of allozyme heterozygosity in populations are often attributed to previous population bottlenecks; however, few experiments have examined the relationship between heterozygosity and bottlenecks under natural conditions. The composition and number of founders of 55 experimental populations of the eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), maintained under simulated field conditions, were manipulated to examine the effects of bottlenecks on three components of allozyme diversity. Correlations between observed and expected values of allozyme heterozygosity, proportions of polymorphic loci, and numbers of alleles per locus were 0.423, 0.602, and 0.772, respectively. The numbers of polymorphic loci and of alleles per locus were more sensitive indicators of differences in genetic diversity between the pre-bottleneck and post-bottleneck populations than was multiple-locus heterozygosity. In many populations, single- and multiple-locus heterozygosity actually increased as a result of the founder event. The weak relationship between a population's heterozygosity and the number and composition of its founders resulted from an increase in the variance of heterozygosity due to drift of allele frequencies. There was little evidence that selection influenced the loss of allozyme variation. When it is not possible to estimate heterozygosity at a large number of polymorphic loci, allozyme surveys attempting to detect founder events and other types of bottlenecks should focus on levels of locus polymorphism and allelic diversity rather than on heterozygosity.

AB  - Estuary management is limited by lack of consensus on operational tools for handling multiple conflicting management objectives. One critical step to this goal is a shift from individual problems to a focus on maintaining ecosystem functions that benefit humans. If function is maintained, then the ecosystem is said to be functionally equivalent to its unimpacted state, which is sufficient for management. We propose an adaptation of a functional equivalency (FE) assessment approach from marine fishery management and use a case study demonstration to address how this approach can be integrated into existing ecosystem assessment tools. The functional equivalency framework has three components for implementation: definition of target ecosystem functions, measurable metrics of ecosystem functions, and policy-based thresholds for each metric that indicate when functional equivalency is lost and must be restored. Each case study is an application of available data, models, and management policy to define these ecosystem function components. We intend to foster discussion and future work on integrating the FE approach into existing ecosystem assessment tools. Data requirements are high, as is the necessary integration between science and policy. The results can be a more integrated management approach focused on maintenance of ecosystem functions most beneficial to humans. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Predicting algal blooms is challenging due to rapid growth rates under suitable conditions and the complex physical, chemical, and biological processes involved. Physico-chemical parameters, monitored in this study by a high-resolution in-situ multi-sensor system and derived from lab-based water sample analyses, show the seasonal variation and have different degrees of vertical gradients across the water column. Through analyzing the changes and relations between multi-factors, we reveal pictures of water quality dynamics and algal kinetics. Nitrate has regular seasonal changes different to the seasonal patterns of total dissolved Phosphorus. Positive correlations are found between Chlorophyll a fluorescence and temperature, wind-induced resuspension and mixing promote the augment of Cyanobacteria fluorescence (Phycocyanin) signal. While the resuspension can also result in the increase of turbidity and affect the light environment for hydrophytes, the algal scums are the main reason for the high turbidity on the surface, which lower the illumination radiation in the water body.

AB  - The source of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in sediment from the Songhua River, which is located in a cold region, is not fully understood and has not been sufficiently assessed under bad conditions. The 16 priority PAHs in sediment from the Songhua River were analyzed and their potential source was diagnosed in the present study. The total concentrations of the PAHs ranged from 34 to 4456 ng/g dw, and fluoranthene (FlA), pyrene (Pyr), phenanthrene (Phe), and chrysene (Chr) were the dominant PAHs. The coefficient of divergence (CD) was used to compare the similarities of these PAHs in sediments from different sampling sites, and the results showed that their compositions were quite different. Importantly, a positive correlation was found between coal consumption and the total concentrations of PAHs in sediment (R = 0.999, p < 0.001), but no significant correlation was found between the amounts of crude oil/natural gas consumption and the total concentrations of PAHs. Emissions from coal consumption might be the main source of PAHs in sediment from the Songhua River because coal is the main fuel used for heat in this northern, cold region in China.

AB  - In this study, we demonstrated that the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor is a powerful tool that can provide periodic and system-wide information on the condition of drinking water reservoirs. The OLI is a multispectral radiometer (30m spatial resolution) that allows ecosystem observations at spatial and temporal scales that allow the environmental community and water managers another means to monitor changes in water quality not feasible with field-based monitoring. Using the provisional Land Surface Reflectance product and field-collected chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations from drinking water monitoring programs in North Carolina and Rhode Island, we compared five established approaches for estimating chl-a concentrations using spectral data. We found that using the three band reflectance approach with a combination of OLI spectral bands 1, 3, and 5 produced the most promising results for accurately estimating chl-a concentrations in lakes (R-2 value of 0.66; root mean square error value of 8.9 mu g l(-1)). Using this model, we forecast the spatial and temporal variability of chl-a for Jordan Lake, a recreational and drinking water source in piedmont North Carolina and several small ponds that supply drinking water in southeastern Rhode Island.

AB  - The marine environment is continually subjected to the action of stressors (including natural toxins), which represent a constant danger for benthic communities. In the present work using network analysis we identified ten genes on the basis of associated functions (FOXA, FoxG, GFI-1, nodal, JNK, OneCut/Hnf6, TAK1, tcf4, TCF7, VEGF) in the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, having key roles in different processes, such as embryonic development and asymmetry, cell fate specification, cell differentiation and morphogenesis, and skeletogenesis. These genes are correlated with three HUB genes, Foxo, Jun and 1-11F1A. Real Time qPCR revealed that during sea urchin embryonic development the expression levels of these genes were modulated by three diatom-derived polyunsaturated aldehydes (PUAs), decadienal, heptadienal and octadienal. Our findings show how changes in gene expression levels may be used as an early indicator of stressful conditions in the marine environment. The identification of key genes and the molecular pathways in which they are involved represents a fundamental tool in understanding how marine organisms try to afford protection against toxicants, to avoid deleterious consequences and irreversible damages. The genes identified in this work as targets for PUAs can be considered as possible biomarkers to detect exposure to different environmental pollutants.

AB  - The wide use of organophosphorous flame retardants (OPFR) and plasticizers causes a continuous release of large quantities into natural waters. One of the main contributors to micropollutants depletion in surface water is sunlight induced phototransformations. This study aims to elucidate whether alkyl, chloroalkyl and aryl organophosphorus flame retardants undergo phototransformations in river water. To perform the experiments, nine OPFR were subjected to natural sunlight, Xe lamp (simulated sunlight) and UV-C irradiations in ultra-pure Milli-Q water, Milli-Q water with humic acid and river water. Experiments demonstrated that OPFR achieve an important degree of photodegradation noticeable at long irradiation time, although direct photolysis did not account as the main photodegration mechanism. Results indicated that sunlight absorbing OPFR exhibited photosensitizing activity. The presence of azide in ultra-pure water inhibited some OPFR photodegration by singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) scavenging, and the absence of dissolved oxygen significantly depleted most of OPFR removal. In the conditions studied, humic acid inhibited OPFR phototransformations, while river water enhanced their removal. Results from this study point out the need to further investigate the role of some OPFR as photosensitizers, which are important for fate and ecological risk assessment of flame retardants and other micropollutants in water.

AB  - The objective of this study is to evaluate the characteristics of the forest in an urbanised mangrove using vegetation structure and abiotic conditions to distinguish habitat heterogeneity/quality. A total of 16 points in Vitoria Bay were selected in the fringe and basin forests. The variables evaluated were height and diameter of the individual trees, basal area, density, dominance, interstitial water, litter mass, grain size, organic matter and anthropogenic influences. The results indicated that the mangrove area, due to suffering intensely from various anthropogenic effects, forests with varying degrees of maturity. Areas more distant from direct human effects had a higher degree of development and environmental quality relative to points closer to urban pressures. Intermediate development levels were also observed, which indicated pulses of environmental change. Human interventions caused alterations in the development of the forest which increased the mortality rate and reduced the diameter and height of the trees. The environmental variables of salinity, organic matter, litter mass, grain size and anthropogenic stressors contributed to the structural patterns. Our data suggest that an analysis of the vegetation structure and the abiotic factors are useful indicators to evaluate habitat quality, thus providing a basis for future management.

AB  - Beta adrenergic receptor antagonist drugs (beta blockers) are widely used in treatment of hypertension and in other cardiovascular diseases and also used in treatment of childhood migraine. In U.K and France the annual consumption of Atenolol for a person is 0.63 and 0.3 g respectively. Atenolol can be found in surface waters, waste waters and even in ground waters up to mu g/1 levels. Physio-chemical measurements are not enough for the assessment of environmental impacts of chemicals or pollutants. Toxicity tests with the organisms can be useful tools in environmental studies. As the embryonic stage is more sensitive to pollutants and other stressors, experiments on the embryos are important for assessing the environmental effects of pollutants. The embryonic stage of organisms is important both for ecosystem health and for future of the population. In this study the effects of atenolol on sea urchin (Arbacia lixula) embryo development was evaluated. Sea urchin embryos were exposed to increasing concentration of Atenolol (1,25, 5, 20, 40, 80 and 100 ppm) under static conditions. Embryotoxicity was assessed on 72 h-old pluteus larvae under light microscope. According to obtained results, an increase in larval malformations as skeleton deformities at the pluteus stage were observed and the calculated EC50, for embryotoxicity was 66,46 mg/l.

AB  - The synergistic effect of a number of natural and anthropogenic stress factors is probably responsible for forest decline in Central Europe. The macroscopic indicators of Norway spruce crown status, as well as branch structure transformation, were proposed to reconstruct the retrospective stress response of a tree to stress conditions over a 30-year period. Based on crown defoliation and the proportion of secondary shoots, five categories of tree response to stress factors were introduced: resistant trees (crown defoliation <= 35%, secondary shoots <= 65%); resilient trees (crown defoliation <= 35%, secondary shoots <= 65%); susceptible moderately transformed trees (crown defoliation > 35%, secondary shoots <= 65%); susceptible strongly transformed trees (crown defoliation > 35%, 65% < secondary shoots <= 90%); and exhausted trees to the environment (crown defoliation > 35%, secondary shoots > 90%). These stress response categories are discussed assuming a sink/source relationship on carbohydrate allocation. The relationship between stress response categories and current regenerative processes in the crown, assessed by macroscopic markers on bud development and shoot growth, is outlined. The research has been carried out mainly in three permanent research plots of old autochthonous Norway spruce forest stands in the Krkonose Mts. (Czech Republic) under different historical stress loads.

AB  - Rapidly changing ocean conditions pose substantial challenges for coastal communities, fishermen, and managers. From 2014 to 2016, the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) experienced a marine heatwave and corollary decline in Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus). Here, we explore the 2020 closure of the directed Pacific cod federal fishery in the GOA as a case study of the needs and opportunities for managing fisheries in the context of environmental change. We build on climate-ready fishery research and conversations with experienced commercial fishermen, including Alutiiq fishers, and fishery managers to: (i) discuss ecosystem-based management in Alaska, (ii) explore early warning signs and management challenges preceding the decline of Pacific cod, (iii) recommend tools to enhance adaptive capacity in fishery management. We conclude that a strong foundation of science-based management that incorporates ecosystem information and multiple ways of knowing, increased monitoring and evaluation of indicators, and new tools for managers to respond and adapt will be essential to sustainable fishery management. New mechanisms highlighted in this essay include: a GOA Fishery Ecosystem Plan, climate risk and vulnerability analyses, habitat protections, and the development of original metrics, such as food web production or function targets to inform stock assessments and fishery management.

In view of the problem that the durability of fibre-reinforced concrete decreased due to sulfate attack, according to the natural environmental conditions in western China, the rapid corrosion test of fibre (layered hybrid) concrete was carried out using the test method of accelerated erosion in saturated solution immersion. The loss of strength, mass and relative dynamic elastic modulus was studied as the law of durability degradation. A reliability analysis method for the residual life of sulfate-resistant concrete based on Wiener distribution is proposed. The dynamic elastic modulus was selected as the key degradation indicator to establish the fibre concrete reliability model and for life prediction. The results show that the layered hybrid fibre-reinforced concrete has stronger erosion resistance. Among the reliability evaluation parameters, the relative dynamic elastic modulus is more sensitive than the mass loss. The Wiener distribution process can effectively describe the degradation law of fibre concrete performance. Based on the experimental data, the residual life reliability model established by this method can directly reflect the relationship between the reliability of the test piece and the corrosion time and can reflect the remaining life of the test piece.

AB  - The present study aims to assess the environmental quality of six estuaries in north-eastern Brazil, using biochemical composition and quantity of organic matter in tropical sediments. Samples were collected monthly during spring low tide from August 2011 to July 2012, in the mid-littoral. Concentrations of organic matter and its biochemical composition reflected the degree of anthropogenic pressure. Although total concentrations of proteins and carbohydrates were similar among estuaries with contrasting levels of anthropogenic pressure, the protein to carbohydrates (PRT : CHO) ratio effectively reflected the trophic state of these areas. PRT : CHO ratios >1 were observed in all studied areas suggesting eutrophic conditions or an initial stage of eutrophication in all of them. Low Chl-a/Phaeo ratios may be associated with the level of eutrophication of each area, however it may also reflect the natural productivity or the presence of mangrove debris. These results were compared with those obtained in previous environmental assessments of the same estuarine areas using the AZTI Marine Biotic Index and monitoring reports showing good agreement. The present study confirmed for the first time in tropical estuarine areas that the biochemical approach can be successfully used to assess the trophic state of the benthic compartment.

AB  - Grasslands throughout the world are responding in diverse ways to changing climate and environmental conditions. In this study we analyze indicators of phosphorus limitation including phosphorus concentrations, phosphorus to nitrogen, and carbon ratios, oxygen isotope ratios of phosphate in vegetation, and phosphatase enzyme activity in soil to shed light on potential effects of climate change on phosphorus availability to grassland vegetation. The study was conducted at the Jasper Ridge Global Change Experiment (JRGCE), California where manipulations mimicking increases in temperature, water, nitrogen and carbon-dioxide have been maintained for over 15 years. We compare our results to an earlier study conducted 3 years after the start of the experiment, in order to assess any change in the response of phosphorus over time. Our results suggest that a decade later the measured indicators show similar or only slightly stronger responses. Specifically, addition of nitrogen, the principle parameter controlling biomass growth, increased phosphorus demand but thresholds that suggest P limitation were not reached. A study documenting changes in net primary productivity (NPP) over time at the JRGCE also could not identify a progressive effect of the manipulations on NPP. Combined these results indicate that the vegetation in these grassland systems is not very sensitive to the range of climate parameters tested.

AB  - The present paper describes a methodological framework that combines ecosystem services (flood protection, education, art/culture, recreation and tourism) with economic analysis for selection of multifunctional measures for flood resilience. The framework includes active stakeholder participation and it consists of the four main components: (1) identification and valuation of ecosystem services pertinent to the project site under various mitigation scenarios, including baseline (pre-mitigation conditions); (2) evaluation of most effective flood mitigation measures through hydrodynamic simulations, and evaluation of economic viability using cost-benefit analysis; (3) selection of measures through consideration of ecosystem services, and solicitation of stakeholders' inputs; (4) development of the conceptual landscape design. Application of the framework was demonstrated in a case study of Ayutthaya Island, Thailand. Results of our research suggest that taking a holistic perspective of ecosystem services and economic assessments, marshalled through active stakeholder participation, has the potential to achieve more ecologically sustainable and socially acceptable solutions for flood protection in areas with cultural heritage. However, there is still a considerable challenge in taking this framework to a full-scale practical implementation, and this mainly relates to the selection of indicators that can enable proper application of ecosystem services.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii in turkeys and chickens on family farms in the semi-arid region of the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. In order to do so, 204 sera samples from turkeys were analyzed using the Modified Agglutination Test (MAT) and 322 sera samples from chickens were assessed using the Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA). Twenty-eight properties contained turkeys and 23 of these properties also contained chickens. The relative frequency of positive turkeys was 11% (21/204), with 46.6% (13/28) of the properties containing at least one positive turkey. The frequency of positive chickens was 25.8% (83/322), with 95.6% (22/23) of the properties containing at least one positive chicken. Based on the results of the present study, it was possible to conclude that turkeys can serve as an indicator of environmental contamination by oocysts of T. gondii. However, they are less effective than chickens bred in the same conditions. The increasing demand from consumers for naturally produced products should worry local sanitary authorities due to the high prevalence of antibodies against T. gondii found in this type of rearing system, particularly among chickens.

AB  - Microbial communities play a key role in wetland water purification and nitrogen cycling. The spatial distribution and diversity of total bacteria in large-scale constructed wetland were investigated by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The abundance of nitrogen related functional bacteria were measured by real-time PCR using specific primers. The results showed that the diversity of total bacterial community decreased from the inlet zone (Shannon-Wiener index, H' = 3.471) to the outlet zone (H' = 2.566), so did the species richness and evenness. The dominant bacteria of the wetland were Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria and Bacilli. The abundance of amoA gene was higher than those of another two functional genes. There was significant correlation between the abundance of amoA gene and pH (r = 0.852), DO (r = -0.595), NH4+ (r = 0.595) and NO3- (r = 0.726) concentrations. The abundance of nosZ gene correlated with the DOC concentration (r = -0.614). The ratio of amoA/Nitrospira showed significant correlation with NH4+ concentration (r = 0.641), while the ratios of amoA/nosZ (r = -0.801) and Nitrospia/nosZ (r = -0.610) could reflect the NO2- concentrations. Therefore, the three ratios of nitrogen related functional genes may serve as new biological indicators for wetland condition assessment.

AB  - Efficient use of natural resources is a global goal. A specific way of improving resource productivity in Estonia is utilisation of Maardu granite deposit as a joint goal for producing granite aggregates and construction in the caverns of the granite mine and a pumped hydroaccumulation plant. The environmental impact assessment in connection with construction of a Maardu deep granite mine was accepted by the Estonian Ministry of Environment in 2009. The most challenging engineering task, causing also the biggest environmental risks, is safe penetration of aquifers and aquitards during construction of vertical and/or inclined tunnels for granite mine and/or pumped hydroaccumulation plant. A major problem is also the high radiation level in the Maardu area and in the planned deep mine. High radon concentrations up to 10 000 Bq/m(3) have been recorded on the outcrops of alum shale in the mine area and they can be dangerous to human health. Based on the hydrogeological modelling it was found, that under normal circumstances the construction and operation of the Maardu deep granite mine is environmentally safe. The territory of the former Maardu phosphorite opencast is highly polluted and damaged and therefore the foundation of the granite mine with overground buildings is the best way for the environmental improving of the area.

AB  - Thecamoebian (testate amoeba) communities appear to respond to a variety of chemical parameters in aquatic ecosystems impacted by oil sands operations. A seasonal study, conducted over four seasons from May 2008 to March 2009 (spring, summer, fall and winter) in a constructed aquatic environment at the Mildred Lake site of Syncrude Canada Ltd. in northeastern Alberta, identified species and strain-level variation among living (i.e., Rose Bengal-stained) thecamoebians. The changes in this epibenthic community appeared to reflect seasonal and micro-environmental changes, as little change in the porewater chemistry, composition of sediments or bottom waters was observed over the study interval. The total (living + dead) thecamoebian test assemblage remained relatively constant over the course of the study, suggesting that the fossil assemblage reflects time-averaged conditions. Some variability was, however, observed among the species composing the difflugiid population. In addition, the speed at which they respond to environmental changes emphasizes their potential usefulness as environmental indicators. This has important implications for the use of thecamoebians as paleoenvironmental indicators. The difference between living and total assemblages reflects taphonomic skewing presumably resulting from variations in preservation potential and/or selective predation of species and strains.

AB  - Surficial sediment (about 5 mm) was scraped off in 15 stations selected in the Vie Estuary, a small estuary on the French Atlantic coast. The samples, prepared using the suitable methods, were used for comparing the behaviour of periphytic algae, sporopollinic and other palynologic material, ostracoda and foraminifera for proposing a synthetic evaluation of the information provided by each of them. Dinoflagellate cysts, which are found in an almost monospecific assemblage in low-salinity water, are dispersed by tidal currents, but the location of tintinnids in only the lower reaches shows a limited inward transport. Sporopollinic material is clearly related to the adjacent vegetation, indicating a local origin, and then little influence of transport on the microbenthos, even if fragments of freshwater crustaceans and of Pediastrum alga are found down to the mouth in the sporopollinic deposits. This limited transport of microbenthos allows the use of periphytic algae, benthic ostracoda and benthic foraminifera as indicators of local environmental conditions. It was then possible to determine the extent of marine influence in the estuary, to discriminate between the main channel and adjacent basins, and between different stages of evolution of the basins, from a recently dug basin to a eutrophicated one.

AB  - Increasingly, risk-based approaches are being used to guide decision making at sites such as service stations and petroleum product terminals, where petroleum products have been inadvertently released to the soil. For example, the API Decision Support System software, DSS, evaluates site human health risk along sir different routes of exposure. The American Society for Testing and Materials' Risk-Based Corrective Action (RBCA) standard, ASTM 1739, establishes a tiered framework for evaluating petroleum release sites on the basis of human health risk. Though much of the risk assessment focus has been on human health risk, regulatory agencies recognize that protection of human health may not fully protect the environment; and EPA has developed guidance on identifying ecological resources to be protected through risk-based decision making.
   Not every service station or petroleum product terminal site warrants a detailed ecological risk assessment. In some cases, a simple preliminary assessment will provide sufficient information for decision making. Accordingly, the American Petroleum Institute (API) is developing a primer for site managers, to assist them in conducting this preliminary assessment, and in deciding whether more detailed ecological risk assessments are warranted. The primer assists the site manager in identifying relevant ecological receptors and habitats, in identifying chemicals and exposure pathways of concern, in developing a conceptual model of the site to guide subsequent actions, and in identifying conditions that may warrant immediate response.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide high-spatial-resolution imagery and allow the collection of data in locations or periods of time where field-based data collection is challenging or impossible, such as in wetlands and floodplains. Computational deep learning techniques are transforming the way in which remotely sensed imagery and data can be used and are having an increasing role in remote sensing. Here, we describe a method using UAV and machine learning technique convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to estimate the cover of wetland features Phragmites australis reeds, leaf litter, water, bareground, and other vegetation in a large inland floodplain wetland in Western New South Wales (NSW), Australia. We firstly describe the process we took to train, validate, and test the model. We describe the model's performance by calculating a range of performance indicators and provide density maps and results from individual sites. The model had an overall accuracy of 0.947 and recognized and estimated Phragmites australis reeds to a very high accuracy (>98%). Here, we show an effective, accurate, and reproducible way to estimate the cover of Phragmites australis reeds and other wetland features using UAV and CNNs in a semi-arid wetland.

AB  - Heath forest ecosystems in Brunei are threatened as they are highly vulnerable to fire and converted for land development. On top of this, Acacia mangium, a non-native Australian tree species, has successfully invaded disturbed heath forest in Brunei. This species is now so common in disturbed heath forests that it shows potential as a disturbance indicator. To test this, we investigated how well Acacia dominance correlated with total basal area, canopy openness, species richness and stem density of heath forests. A total of 20 plots (400 m(2) each) were established in heath forests with three different disturbance types; old-growth, old-regenerating and recent regenerating plots. Regression analyses were performed on Acacia dominance against the four variables. High Acacia dominance correlated strongly and positively with greater canopy openness but negatively with basal area, species richness and stem density. Acacia dominance was also strongly correlated with species composition. Our study finds that 1) Acacia mangium dominance can be used to determine the disturbance stage of heath forest, and as such provides an easy to measure indicator of heath forest health, and 2) that the most cost efficient way to eradicate Acacia mangium is fire prevention so that natural succession will provide the shaded conditions that prevent Acacia mangium establishment and population maintenance.

AB  - Atoll islands are small, low-lying and highly vulnerable to sea level rise (SLR). Because these islands are fully composed of the skeletons from coral reef creatures, the healthy coral ecosystem plays a pivotal role in island resilience against SLR. The environmental deterioration of reefs caused by increases in the human population has been recently reported, but the timing and process are unknown. We investigated the annual black bands in a coral boring core from Fongafale Island, the capital of Tuvalu, which is a symbolic atoll country that is being submerged due to SLR. The iron redox state and microbial gene segments in the coral skeleton might be new environmental indicators that reveal the linkage between anthropogenic activity and coral reef ecosystems. Our findings provide the first demonstration that iron sulfide has formed concentrated black layers since 1991 under the seasonal anoxic conditions inside coral annual bands. Since the 1990s, increasing human activity and domestic waste-induced eutrophication has promoted sludge and/or turf algae proliferation with the subsequent seasonal destruction, resulting in sulfate reduction by anaerobic bacteria. With the recent climate variability, these anthropogenic effects have induced the mass mortality of branching corals, deteriorated the coral reef ecosystem and deprived the resilience of the island against SLR.

AB  - Crude oil released into the environment contains many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Alkylated PAHs are more abundant than unsubstituted PAHs and their toxicity is also of serious concern. Among the various physical, chemical, and biological weathering processes of crude oils, photodegradation is one of the most important for determining the environmental fate of oil residues. In this study, the photodegradation rate constants of naphthalene and alkylated naphthalenes were determined under simulated laboratory conditions at different temperature. Changes in the luminescence inhibition of Aliivibrio fischeri, as an indicator of the baseline toxicity, were observed in photodegradation mixtures. The major transformation products were also identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The photodegradation of naphthalene and the eight alkylated naphthalenes was described well by pseudofirst-order kinetics regardless of experimental temperature. The measured toxicity of the reaction mixtures obtained by photodegradative weathering slightly increased initially and then decreased with further weathering. In all cases, the observed toxicity was greater than accounted for by the parent compounds, indicating that the photodegradation products also contributed significantly to the overall toxicity of the mixtures. The identified photodegradation products were mostly oxygenated compounds such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and quinones, which warrant further investigation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Turbidity is an indicator of the quality of water and usually exhibits variability associated with changing hydrodynamic conditions, which can be reflected in the sediment dynamics in coastal regions. Darwin Harbour is a typical macro-tidal, well mixed, and complex environment influenced by industries, human activities, and natural factors-including winds, currents, river discharges, waves, and tides. As a case study, hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics in Darwin Harbour are investigated using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements. This study focuses on understanding the variability of turbidity, mechanisms that control the variations of turbidity and analyzing field data to determine the main factors that influence the sediment dynamics in Darwin Harbour. The results of this study illustrate the seasonal turbidity variation is mainly influenced by the wind waves. The dredging campaigns in 2013 and 2014 wet seasons contributed to the rise of turbidity in Darwin Harbour. The action of tidal currents appears to be the dominant factor controlling the turbidity pattern in a spring-neap cycle and the turbidity intra-tidal variation. In addition, the turbidity maximum zone (TMZ) near Charles Point is formed by the tidal current convergence based on the results of current modelling.

AB  - The biogeographical region known as the Pampa biome in southern Brazil, was originally mainly covered with open fields or grassland, with areas of riparian forest surrounding the water bodies. Today this landscape appears highly fragmented due to agricultural activities such as rice cultivation, extensive cattle farming, and forest plantations. Studies have shown that the Pampa biome has high levels of biodiversity and endemism, but with regard to invertebrates, this biome is still one of the least known in Brazil. We therefore designed a study comparing the dragonfly (Odonata) communities to environmental and landscape features in this area, measuring diversity by species richness, relative abundance and Shannon index. Our results showed that the Pampa is a biome very rich in odonates, and that the species communities are highly dependent on the environmental conditions of the area. Habitats such as Rivers/Streams, bordered by native grasslands and riparian forests, were shown to harbour communities that were ecologically more complex and sensitive than other habitat types. Man-made lakes and agricultural areas displayed lower levels of biodiversity and odonate communities dominated by generalist species. By combining data on the communities of Odonata and other taxa, our analyses may be instrumental in determining priority areas for future conservation measures within the area.

AB  - Culminating in the 1950's, bananas, the world's most extensive perennial monoculture, suffered one of the most devastating disease epidemics in history. In Latin America and the Caribbean, Fusarium wilt (FW) caused by the soil-borne fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (FOC), forced the abandonment of the Gros Michel-based export banana industry. Comparative microbiome analyses performed between healthy and diseased Gros Michel plants on FW-infested farms in Nicaragua and Costa Rica revealed significant shifts in the gammaproteobacterial microbiome. Although we found substantial differences in the banana microbiome between both countries and a higher impact of FOC on farms in Costa Rica than in Nicaragua, the composition especially in the endophytic microhabitats was similar and the general microbiome response to FW followed similar rules. Gammaproteobacterial diversity and community members were identified as potential health indicators. Healthy plants revealed an increase in potentially plant-beneficial Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas, while diseased plants showed a preferential occurrence of Enterobacteriaceae known for their plant-degrading capacity. Significantly higher microbial rhizosphere diversity found in healthy plants could be indicative of pathogen suppression events preventing or minimizing disease expression. This first study examining banana microbiome shifts caused by FW under natural field conditions opens new perspectives for its biological control.

AB  - The importance of assessing executive functions (EF) using ecologically valid assessments has been discussed extensively. Due to the difficulty of carrying out such assessments in real-world settings on a regular basis, virtual reality has been proposed as a technique to provide complex functional tasks under a variety of differing conditions while measuring various aspects of performance and controlling for stimuli. The main goal of this study was to examine the discriminant, construct-convergent and ecological validity of the Adapted Four-Item Shopping Task, an assessment of the Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL) of shopping. Nineteen people with stroke, aged 50-85 years, and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy participants performed the shopping task in both the SeeMe Virtual Interactive Shopping environment and a real shopping environment (the hospital cafeteria) in a counterbalanced order. The shopping task outcomes were compared to clinical measures of EF. The findings provided good initial support for the validity of the Adapted Four-Item Shopping Task as an IADL assessment that requires the use of EF for people with stroke. Further studies should examine this task with a larger sample of people with stroke as well as with other populations who have deficits in EF.

AB  - A multi-indicator paleolimnological study of sediments from Lake Kuzi (central Latvia) was used to obtain a comprehensive record of environmental changes in the Holocene. Periodicity in the changes and the main drivers (lake basin development, catchment properties, climate, human activities) of the sedimentary record was studied. In order to comprehend the whole-lake sedimentation during the Holocene, a detailed multi indicator record from the central part of the lake was integrated with records of sediment mass accumulation rates from four cores from different parts of the lake and a GPR (ground-penetrating radar) survey of the lake basin. The observed changes in the sedimentation regime that took place during the early Holocene are strongly linked with variations in climatic conditions, but the catchment and lake basin also played an important role. In the middle Holocene the water level was stable and the lake was influenced by climate mediated through changes in the catchment vegetation. Around 5 000 cal. BP sedimentation pattern changed, and three of the four main drivers made a comparably strong impact on the sedimentary signal. Since 2 000 cal. BP multiple indicators point to a major disturbance clearly related to human activity, which conceals the impact of the natural drivers.

AB  - Depending on environmental conditions, fullerenes (nC(60)) have the potential to settle to the bottom sediments. In this study the distribution of nC(60) was investigated in the labile zone between sediment and water. Three freshwater-sediment systems representing oligohumic, mesohumic, and polyhumic lakes with varying sediment composition and structure were used to investigate the target of fullerenes. The largest portion of water suspended fullerenes was found in the sediment, but a part re-suspended relatively quickly to water-stabile particles associated with natural particles. Rapid initial re-suspending was followed by a slower one offering a continuous pathway to the water phase. Re-suspending was highest from the sediment with a high amount of amorphous matter, small particles and a highly aliphatic character, amounting to 9 +/- 1% of the initial amount of fullerenes, whereas it was 4 +/- 1% in aromatic sediments with larger particles and less amorphous matter. These results indicate that bottom sediments can retain fullerenes but a portion may remain mobile depending on sediment character. Re-suspended fullerenes may again be available to aquatic species this knowledge should thus be taken into account in the environmental risk assessment of fullerenes.(C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the impacting profile of the technological innovation process on forestry harvesting. We analyzed the innovation process on the traditional subsystem change (chainsaw + forwarder) to the innovative (Feller Buncher + Clambunk Skidder). We used the consolidated method for environmental impact assessment of technological innovation on agro-livestock, which assesses the environmental performance of a certain methodology or technology in relation to that previously established. The method was adapted for the impacts evaluation on forestry harvesting. The impacts were analyzed for the physical media indicators (air, soil, water), biotic (flora and fauna), and anthropic indicators. Matrices were prepared for each indicator, which were weighted in relation to the occurrence scale and importance scale factor. Technicians on the forest harvesting field filled the matrices using changing coefficients previously defined. The impact coefficient resulted from the coefficient changing product by weighting factors, being evaluated on a scale of -15 to +15. The overall impact index has been determined for the same scale pattern. According to three evaluations average, two indicators showed a positive impact coefficient (health and management), six were negative coefficient (air, soil, flora, fauna, landscape, and employment), and one remained unchanged (water). The overall impact index was positive (1.29), indicating in the global context environmental conditions favorable to the innovative subsystem adoption.

AB  - The diversity below (ectomycorrhizae) and above (vascular flora) ground in brA >> l,s of black truffle production areas have been studied together for the first time, both in plantations and in natural areas, as possible indicators of the microecology of these zones. Studies on the ectomycorrhizal community of mature plantations are scarce. However, monitoring the dynamics of such systems is important to understand the conditions that promote truffle fructification. In the study described here the most frequent ectomycorrhizae are Tuber melanosporum and Quercirrhiza quadratum. In the plantations, Q. quadratum is the most abundant morphotype and in the natural area it is Cenococcum geophilum. The development of truffle ecosystems involves the appearance of competitor species with wide networks of hyphae and rhizomorphs. On the other hand, there are few studies concerning the special composition of the vascular flora growing in brA >> l,s. We identified 199 taxa, most of them Mediterranean or Eurosiberian xerophiles and therophytes. This is consistent with the ecology of truffle production areas (dry, sunny and stony). These plants are heavily influenced by the inhibiting substances produced by the truffle and, as a result, they suffer from inhibited growth and in some cases cannot complete their life cycle.

AB  - Zooplankton assemblages and water quality were examined bi-weekly from 17 April to 19 October 1998 in 11 northeastern Lake Michigan coastal lakes of similar origin but varied in trophic status and limnological condition. All lakes were within or adjacent to Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, Michigan. Zooplankton (principally microcrustaceans and rotifers) from triplicate Wisconsin net (80 mum) vertical tows taken at each lake's deepest location were analyzed. Oxygen-temperature-pH-specific conductivity profiles and surface water quality were concurrently measured. Bray-Curtis similarity analysis showed small variations among sample replicates but large temporal differences. The potential use of zooplankton communities for environmental lake comparisons was evaluated by means of BIOENV (Primer 5.1) and principal component analyses. Zooplankton analyzed at the lowest identified taxonomic level yielded greatest sensitivity to limnological variation. Taxonomic and ecological aggregations of zooplankton data performed comparably, but less well than the finest taxonomic analysis. Secchi depth, chlorophyll a, and sulfate concentrations combined to give the best correlation with patterns of variation in the zooplankton data set. Principal component analysis of these variables revealed trophic status as the most influential major limnological gradient among the study lakes. Overall, zooplankton abundance was an excellent indicator of variation in trophic status. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Critical to the economic viability of dry machining is justifying increased tool costs in terms of productivity and ecological savings achievable through the elimination of metal cutting fluids. The automotive industry is a large-scale commercial manufacturing sector in which emphasis is placed on reducing impact on the environment as well as seeking to reduce costs in manufacturing. This paper presents results for dry drilling fully pearlitic grey cast iron with uncoated and partially filtered are deposited TiN and TiAlN coated Co-HSS split point twist drills using two methods to distinguish drill failure, namely audible screech and measurement of outer corner wear lands. The latter method proved to be of most relevance in manufacturing because it is more closely related to the industrial practice of on-condition assessment prior to drill resharpening. Using the outer corner wear method, TiN coatings (3.0 mum thickness) achieved a modest increase in drill life of 1.4 times, compared with significant improvements of 2.6 times, achieved from a TiAlN top coating (0.8 mum thickness) on a base coating of TiN (1.2 mum thickness). This is a novel result in that a thin top coating of the expensive TiAlN coating over the much cheaper TiN coating can provide a very cost-effective tool coating combination.

AB  - Perishable products are highly susceptible to degradations in quality due to unstable environmental conditions. From an operations management perspective, retailers may be left with spoiled products with no salvage value. To mitigate these challenges, we develop a step-by-step analytical framework that enables managers to make dynamic tactical decisions for perishable products, to preserve their quality as they move through a supply chain network. First, by identifying key quality indicators and environmental factors, a data-driven quality degradation prediction model under a stochastic environment is established. The combined impact of volatile environmental factors on various quality indices are studied. Next, we utilize this degradation model as an input to a preliminary planning model, which determines a vehicle routing schedule and inventory quality targets throughout the network at least cost, subject to retailer service levels. Lastly, using the optimized supply chain network design, we dynamically optimize the environmental controls throughout the transportation process to ensure product quality. By applying this framework to a fresh apple supply chain case, we obtain valuable insights on product quality degradation along the supply chain, which aids practitioners in developing targeted solutions that enhance quality levels economically. With extended analyses, we observed the reaction of different quality indices to environmental variations, and the benefits brought by establishing initial environment conditions in delivery vehicles.

AB  - Although requiring laborious analytical treatment, tree-ring series of nitrogen isotopes (delta N-15) have gained popularity amongst researchers for their potential as environmental indicators as anthropogenic emissions increase globally with potential effects on forest N cycles. Previous studies suggested that tree-ring series correlate with climatic and air quality parameters. However, none discussed the level of replication required for expressing the population signals of specific species of trees. In this investigation, we studied 27 white spruce trees from two sites under distinct environmental conditions to evaluate the appropriate protocol for preparing consistent treering delta N-15 series.
   The produced series indicate that high frequency (short-term,< 7 years) delta N-15 changes at a replication as high as 10 trees cannot serve environmental purposes. Conversely, the low frequency (middle-, 7-15 years, to long-term, > 15 years) delta N-15 trends show coherence between arithmetic means of individual series at replication levels as low as three trees, whereas middle-term pooled trends do not perform as coherently. The low frequency mean trends of individual series obtained for the two sites suggest that local biogeochemical soil conditions modified by anthropogenic emissions modulate the delta N-15 responses in trees. Hence, we propose that long-term tree-ring delta N-15 series constitute reliable environmental indicators.

AB  - Nowadays, bidirectional power transfer is a necessity for Vehicle-to-Grid technology. Making accurate and fast SOC estimation more crucial than ever by battery management systems. Striving to establish the optimal strategy for real-time SOC estimation on-board of an electric vehicle for the newly established V2G technology, this paper presents a detailed and critical comparative study of the unscented Kalman filter and artificial neural network. Unlike most conventional comparative studies in literature, this paper presents a critical view of the design and implementation processes of each strategy. All the design aspects are addressed and critically compared including predesign and design requirements. Their accuracy and sensitivity to the erroneous initial SOC values, alongside their tolerance to unpredicted operational conditions, are investigated using different load scenarios typically encountered by the V2G environment. Furthermore, a hybrid nonlinear least square algorithm is presented for battery internal parameter identification, needed for UKF. The experimental results indicate that UKF presents the best overall performance and compromise between accuracy, robustness, computational power and required resources; 91% fewer data were required than the ANN, robustness against erroneous initial SOC for up to 100% deviation, and more accurate under fast changing current and unpredictable conditions; 1.5% compared to 3%.

AB  - A number of vehicle users pay attention to the impact of changes in the car body geometry during long-term use on the safety level. However; this issue has not been properly dealt with in research studies. The aim of this study was to identify changes in the floor panel, to develop a model to forecast the geometry during the car use and to identify the the points which undergo the maximum displacement. The paper presents the elect of the car mileage on the floor panel condition, taking into account variable environmental factors. In the course of the study, the position of points firing the front suspension, front bench and rear suspension was determined, as was the position of points situated on parts of the load bearing structure of the car body. The results wets used to develop a model for forecasting changes of the floor panel geometry during car use. The probability of changes in the floor panel geometry was found to increase with the mileage. The probability of teaching the maximum permissible geometric changes (3 mm) in a floor panel is accurately described by the probabilistic model in the form of the Rayleigh distribution. Diverse models of the floor panel geometry changes were obtained depending on the environmental conditions and type of the base points under analysis.

AB  - Theory and research on major depression have increasingly assumed a recurrent and chronic disease model. Yet not all people who become depressed suffer recurrences, suggesting that depression is also an acute, time-limited condition. However, few if any risk indicators are available to forecast which of the initially depressed will or will not recur. This prognostic impasse may be a result of problems in conceptualizing the nature of recurrence in depression. In the current paper we first provide a conceptual analysis of the assumptions and theoretical systems that presently structure thinking on recurrence. This analysis reveals key concerns that have distorted views about the long-term course of depression. Second, as a consequence of these theoretical problems we suggest that investigative attention has been biased toward recurrent forms of depression and away from acute, time-limited conditions. Third, an analysis of how these theoretical problems have influenced research practices reveals that an essential comparison group has been omitted from research on recurrence: people with a single lifetime episode of depression. We suggest that this startling omission may explain why so few predictors of recurrence have as yet been found. Finally, we examine the reasons for this oversight, document the validity of depression as an acute, time-limited disorder, and provide suggestions for future research with the goal of discovering early risk indicators for recurrent depression.

AB  - Stream inorganic chemistry was sampled under summer baseflow conditions from 2000 to 2002 at 60 sites as part of a large-scale, enhanced water-quality monitoring project (the Project) across New York City's drinking-water-supply watersheds. The 60 stream sites were evenly divided between regions east and west of the Hudson River (EOH and WOH, respectively). EOH sites had generally higher ionic concentrations than WOH sites, reflecting differences in land use and geology Within each region, variability in inorganic chemistry data between sites was far greater than annual variability within sites. Geology was an important factor controlling underlying baseflow chemistry differences within and between regions. However, after taking into account geological controls, anthropogenic land uses primarily defined ion and nutrient baseflow chemistry patterns at regional and watershed levels. In general, watershed-scale landscape attributes had either the strongest relationships with analytes or had relationships with analytes that did not differ fundamentally from relationships of riparian- or reach-scale landscape attributes. Individual analyses indicated no dominant watershed-scale landscape attribute that could be used to predict instream inorganic chemistry concentrations, and no single ion or nutrient was identified as the best indicator of a given anthropogenic land use. Our results provide a comprehensive baseline of information for future water-quality assessments in the region and will aid in examining other components of the Project.

AB  - The lubricating oil used in engines for vehicle and other applications is renewed according to a schedule specified by the manufacturer. This timetable is, naturally, very conservative, and makes no allowance for the way in which the engine is operated. Constant-speed operation (such as motorway use) is much less harmful to the lubricant than variable-speed operation, such as urban driving, during which the oil experiences extreme variations of temperature and engine speed. The net result of the conservative lubricant replacement schedule is that most engine oil is discarded well before it has reached the end of its useful life.
   This paper reports a study in which changes to the dielectric and magnetic properties of the oil are assessed as methods of measuring the degradation of lubricating oil. The relationship between oil use (measured by the distance a vehicle has travelled) and oil viscosity is also measured.
   The conclusions from this work are that simple distance travelled (miles/kilometres) is not a good indicator of the state of an oil, as estimated by measuring its viscosity.
   The magnetic characteristics of lubricating oil (i.e. its magnetic permeability) do change as the oil degrades, but the measurements were poorly correlated with viscosity and do not seem to offer much promise as the basis of an oil monitoring system.
   The dielectric properties of lubricating oil are reasonably well correlated with viscosity, and it is proposed that this could form the basis of a useful sensing technique.

AB  - Clay-size mineral assemblages from lithologically diverse Miocene shelf and upper-slope sediments of the North Carolina continental margin show strong environmental zonation. Three distinct clay-mineral suites are recognized in the Miocene sediments of the Pungo River Formation. (1) A detrital kaolinite suite was deposited proximal to siliciclastic point sources in muddy quartz sand lithofacies. This assemblage reflects intense chemical weathering on the adjacent Coastal Plain and Piedmont Provinces. (2) A detrital illite and smectite suite deposited in phosphatic lithofacies is distinguishable from the clay mineralogy of muddy (distal) terrigenous and biogenic-dominated lithofacies only because illite is more highly crystalline. (3) Lithofacies characterized by authigenic dolomite contain a clay-mineral suite with palygorskite and sepiolite. These Mg-clay minerals formed authigenically in the upper decimeters of sediment, penecontemporaneously with dolomitization, and in association with diatom dissolution, which provided the silica source for neoformation.
   Clay-mineral assemblages have not been significantly altered by burial or late-stage diagenesis and therefore appear to be ''original signal'' depositional indicators of changing environmental conditions through major Miocene fluctuations in sea level. The kaolinite suite is present in a fourth-order cycle immediately preceding the sea-level lowstand. Palygorskite and sepiolite are restricted to organic-rich dolomitic sediments, deposited under highly dysaerobic bottom conditions associated with the highstand and formation of the condensed section.

TI  - Shift in polar benthic community structure in a fast retreating glacial area of Marian Cove, West Antarctica
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - Glacier retreat is a major long-standing global issue; however, the ecological impacts of such retreats on marine organisms remain unanswered. Here, we examined changes to the polar benthic community structure of "diatoms" under current global warming in a recently retreated glacial area of Marian Cove, Antarctica. The environments and spatiotemporal assemblages of benthic diatoms surveyed in 2018-2019 significantly varied between the intertidal (tidal height of 2.5 m) and subtidal zone (10 and 30 m). A distinct floral distribution along the cove (similar to 4.5 km) was characterized by the adaptive strategy of species present, with chain-forming species predominating near the glacier. The predominant chain-forming diatoms, such as Fragilaria striatula and Paralia sp., are widely distributed in the innermost cove over years, indicating sensitive responses of benthic species to the fast-evolving polar environment. The site-specific and substrate-dependent distributions of certain indicator species (e.g., F.striatula, Navicula glaciei, Cocconeis cf. pinnata) generally reflected such shifts in the benthic community. Our review revealed that the inner glacier region reflected trophic association, featured with higher diversity, abundance, and biomass of benthic diatoms and macrofauna. Overall, the polar benthic community shift observed along the cove generally represented changing environmental conditions, (in)directly linked to ice-melting due to the recent glacier retreat.

AB  - The striped venus (Chamelea gallina) is an important economic resource in the Mediterranean Basin; this species has exhibited a strong quantitative decline in the Adriatic Sea. The aim of this work was to provide a comprehensive view of the biological status of C. gallina to elucidate the bioecological characteristics and genetic diversity of wild populations. To the best of our knowledge, this investigation is the first to perform a multidisciplinary study on C. gallina based on two omics approaches integrated with histological, ecotoxicological, and chemical analyses and with the assessment of environmental parameters. The results obtained through RNA sequencing indicated that the striped venus has a notable ability to adapt to different environmental conditions. Moreover, the stock reduction exhibited by this species in the last 2 decades seems not to have negatively affected its genetic diversity. Indeed, the high level of genetic diversity that emerged from our ddRAD dataset analyses is ascribable to the high larval dispersal rate, which might have played a "compensatory role" on local fluctuations, conferring to this species a good adaptive potential to face the environmental perturbations. These findings may facilitate the efforts of conservation biologists to adopt ad hoc management plans for this fishery resource.

AB  - Forest ecosystems are faced with a variety of threats, including increasingly prolonged droughts and other abiotic stresses such as extreme high temperatures, very strong wind, invasive insect outbreaks, and the rapid spread of pathogens. The aim of the study was to define crucial abiotic stressors affecting Central Europe forest ecosystems and, with regard to their possible simultaneous effect, develop a universal method of multi-hazard evaluation. The method was then applied to the particular area of interest represented by part of the Czech Republic with forest land cover (12-19 degrees E, 48-51 degrees N). Based on National Threat Analysis, the most significant threats of natural origin with a close relationship to forest stability were identified as drought, high temperature, and wind gusts. Using suitable indicators, a level of their risk based on occurrence and consequences was estimated. The resulting combined level of risk, divided into five categories, was then spatially expressed on a grid map. The novelty of our paper lies in: (i) all relevant climatic data were combined and evaluated simultaneously with respect to the different level of risk, (ii) the developed methodological road map enables an application of the method for various conditions, and (iii) multiple hazards were estimated for the case study area.

AB  - The fate of highly hazardous or persistent pesticides in soils and their potential for environmental and health risks depends on the physical and chemical properties of the pesticide, soil properties including biological health and climatic conditions. Assessing the fate and impact of pesticides in soil is complicated in the Caribbean due to the high diversity of soils and duality of climate. The FAO supported national competent authorities from 11 countries in the Caribbean in the assessment of obsolete stocks and potentially contaminated soil. The Environmental Management Tool Kit (EMKT) prioritised Fond Cole and Camden Base as the only critical sites. Preliminary site investigations that utilised the rapid environmental assessment (REA) methodology identified that contamination was restricted to an impervious layer at the Camden site. Pesticide properties varied across groups, with the organochlorides exhibiting greater sorptive capacity and lower leaching potential relative to the organophosphates. All tested soils were non-saline with alkaline pH and notably sandy in texture with low adsorptive capacity. Analysis of pesticide levels revealed low to undetected quantities across contaminated sites. Traces of Endrin and Dieldrin were found in Marienburg, Suriname. Overall, assessment of soil contamination from stored obsolete pesticides revealed minimal contamination, however, detailed assessment considering contamination gradients should be performed where pesticides were identified.

AB  - The length of record (LOR) method is an evaluation method that provides quantitative advice for the amount of computational data required for use of the indicators of hydrological alteration (IHA). The use of multi-index hydrological indicators to reflect river hydrological-ecological characteristics is the essence of the IHA method, while the LOR evaluation result using a single index does not have practical application value in the absence of IHA data volume. In this paper, we expand the LOR method from single index version into multi-index version, apply it to comprehensively analyze the credibility of hydrological alteration (HA) multi-indicators under different data volumes, and explore the relationship between multi-index LOR results and data requirements. Combined with the hydrological-ecological relationship, the practical application criteria of LOR dimension reduction under the condition of multiple HA indicators is given. The results show that the LOR results corresponding to each group of indicators in IHA have different data requirements, so an in-depth understanding of the hydrological-ecological relationship is the key to LOR's application of IHA data dimension reduction. In addition, we discuss the limitations of the LOR method of multi-index dimension reduction and its application value in IHA calculations.

AB  - Results of life cycle inventory (LCI) and life cycle assessment (LCA) for septic tanks collecting domestic sewage were presented. The study included the whole life cycle: construction, use and end-of-life stages of septic tanks. The analyses were conducted basing on actual data concerning performance of 793 septic tanks in Zory. Environmental impact assessment of the life cycle of septic tanks was conducted with TRACi and ReCiPe methods. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, eutrophication_ fossil fuel depletion and metal depletion indicators were calculated and determinants of LCA of septic tanks were analysed. The system boundary was from cradle to grave. It was concluded that at the construction stage, GHG emission and fossil fuel depletion indicators are determined by the amount of concrete, steel, polyester resin, polyethylene, cast iron and PCV. At the use stage. GHG emission is determined by the amount and type of electricity used to treat sewage in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Untreated wastewater, introduced into the environment (leaking tanks and users discharging sewage), is a determinant of influence on eutrophication. Life cycle inventory and environmental assessment of septic tanks with life cycle perspective are presented in the literature for the first time. The results highlight the importance of including each stage in the environmental assessment of elements of the urban wastewater system.

AB  - Phytoplankton are important primary producers in tropical coastal lagoons, with a critical role in sustaining food webs. However, most studies conducted in tropical systems with high anthropogenic influence have focused only on biomass. Water samples were collected, for phytoplankton (pigments and microscopy) and other environmental parameters, from two mangrove lagoons in Sao Tome Island. The highest nutrient concentrations were observed in the mangrove of Praia das Conchas, indicating stronger nutrient inputs in this catchment area. Bottom oxygen deficiency was observed in the mangrove of Malanza, which is likely to be associated with the existence of a bridge that constrains the water exchange with the sea. Pigment analyses showed that overall chlorophyll a concentrations were low, indicating low phytoplankton biomass. The highest values were found at Praia das Conchas. It is suggested that chlorophyll a can be used as an indicator of anthropogenic pressure in this tropical system. Microscopy reveales the presence of Dinophysis sp. and Ostreopsis sp. cells, which can be harmful even at low densities. Water quality could be improved by enhancing oxygen condition in Malanza and by monitoring the occurrence of algal blooms, with potential benefits for public health and tourism.

Four artificial reefs in the Mississippi (MS) Sound, USA, representing low-profile (underwater) and high-profile (periodically air-exposed) conditions were sampled every 3 months over a 23-month period to investigate changes in fungal diversity within reef biofilms. Fungal presence was assessed via PCR amplification of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of fungal ribosomal DNA, and by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of fungal ITS regions - the latter being used to track variation in fungal community structure with respect to season, location, and reef profile type. Fungal communities were also characterized taxonomically through both morphological identification and phylogenetic comparisons of ITS gene sequences, with 36 fungal genera cultured from reef biofilms. Using a multivariate statistical approach, significant temporal and spatial differences in fungal biofilm communities were detected. High-profile reefs differed significantly in biofilm fungal community composition across the 10 sampling periods. This assessment of marine fungal biofilm communities over time provides novel insights into the fungal diversity present on artificial reefs in an understudied region, the north-central Gulf of Mexico.

AB  - Cd and Pb concentrations were measured in water, sediment and plant organs collected from selective sites located along the Bogdanka river (Poznan, Poland) in the 2012 growing season. The aim of the investigations was to monitor changes in heavy metal (HM) concentrations in different media over the periods, as well as to evaluate potential of two littoral plants, Phragmites australis and Typha angustifolia, for phytoremediation under natural conditions. Investigations revealed differences in HM concentrations in water and sediments. Higher values were observed in sediments than in water. The decrease in concentrations of both HMs in sediments was noted in two of the three selected water reservoirs during growing seasons, which suggests the possibility of their adsorption and accumulation by aquatic plants. Both investigated plant species accumulated ample amount of Cd and Pb in underground and aboveground plant tissues, however T. angustifolia revealed higher Cd translocation potential than P. australis. The latter revealed higher Pb accumulation in two lakes. Moreover, the translocation ratio was usually higher in spring, especially for Pb, in both plant species. Increasing level of pollution load index in sediment along the Bogdanka watercourse indicates accumulation of measured HMs.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine whether there was variation in the intensity of gamogenesis (sexual reproduction) in communities of chydorid cladocerans during the autumnal sexual reproduction period. The proportions of gamogenetic individuals (i.e., intensity) in the chydorid communities of seven lakes in southern Finland were determined in weekly samples throughout the autumn of 2005. The period of gamogenetic reproduction began very synchronously in the lakes as a response to climatic forcing and proportions of gamogenetic individuals progressively increased towards winter. However, wide variation was found in intensity among the communities. The high intensity probably was a response to some environmental stressors (e.g., invertebrate predation, crowding, competition, or changes in water chemistry) to ensure genetic variability and future populations. One common species, Alonella nana showed exceptional, dualistic, gamogenetic behavior, since in some communities it reproduced with high and in others with extremely low gamogenetic intensity. It is possible that in the former it responded to environmental stressors by exhibiting high intensity of gamogenesis, thus renewing its genotypes, while in the latter it succeeded primarily by parthenogenetic (asexual) reproduction, and was possibly perennial. The high gamogenetic intensity in A. nana was related to dystrophic and mesotrophic conditions, but it correlated positively only with water conductivity.

AB  - Given the importance placed on protected areas, determining their effectiveness in representing and maintaining biodiversity is a core issue in conservation biology. Nonetheless, frameworks identifying the breadth of issues associated with this effectiveness, and case studies of how well these are understood in particular regions, remain lacking. In this paper, we provide such a framework and an overview of the current state of knowledge of the ecological effectiveness of protected areas in the United Kingdom. Arguably, better data are available to address such issues in this region than anywhere else in the world. Nonetheless, studies remain scarce and have focussed foremost on the, rather narrow, issue of the effectiveness of management actions on individual sites in order to deliver fixed conservation objectives and discharge statutory responsibilities. Some attention has also been paid to how well the regional collection or portfolio of protected areas performs, particularly in capturing biodiversity features. Work on the extent to which protected areas in the United Kingdom form effective functional networks is in its infancy, but initiatives are under development. We identify some of the questions about the effectiveness of protected areas to which answers need to be known at the site, portfolio and network levels, and how significant progress might be achieved in addressing these.

AB  - The results of an investigation into the relationship between surface sediment subfossil chironomid distribution and water quality are presented. Data from 30 lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River indicate that the nutrient gradient was the major factor affecting the distribution of chironomids across these sites. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that of 12 summer water environmental variables, total Phosphorus was most important, accounting for 20.1% of the variance in the chironomid data. This was significant enough to allow the development of quantitative inference models. A TP inference model was developed using weighted averaging (WA), partial least squares (PLS) and weighted averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS). An optimal two-component WA-PLS model provided a high jack-knifed coefficient of prediction for conductivity r(jack)(2) = 0.76, with a low root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEPjack = 0.13). Using this model it is possible to produce long-term quantitative records of past water quality for lacustrine sites across the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which has important implications for future lake management and ecological restoration.

AB  - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is developing ecological soil screening levels (Eco-SSLs) for the ecological risk assessment of contaminants at Superfund sites. The Eco-SSLs for several soil contaminants have been developed from toxicity benchmarks for soil invertebrates in the existing literature. Insufficient information to generate Eco-SSLs for Sb, Ba, and Be necessitated toxicity testing to fill the data gaps. We used standardized toxicity tests with the earthworm Eisenia fetida, enchytraeid Enchytraeus crypticus, and collembolan Folsomia candida in the present study. These tests were selected on the basis of their ability to measure chemical toxicity to ecologically relevant test species during chronic assays and their inclusion of at least one reproduction component among the measurement endpoints. Tests were conducted in Sassafras Sandy Loam soil, which supports relatively high bioavailability of metals. Weathering and aging procedures for metals in amended soil were incorporated into these studies to better reflect exposure conditions in the field. The relative toxicity of metals to the soil invertebrates tested was Be > Sb > Ba based on the median effective concentration values for reproduction. These studies produced toxicological data that can contribute to the development of Eco-SSLs for Sb, Ba, and Be for soil invertebrates.

AB  - A number of studies have reported a significant negative association between fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of bilateral morphological traits and individual fitness traits, but almost all of these are unreplicated and based on small sample sizes using single trait estimates of FA. We therefore tested if there was a relationship between the FA of five bilateral traits and fecundity and development time in Drosophila in a multiple replicated experimental design. Stressed treatments were included to increase the variability of traits and to test whether associations among traits were affected by changes in the environment. Significant positive relationships were found between the size of wing characters and mean fecundity for the 5-day period and this relationship tended to be stronger in the stress treatments. No association was found between FA and mean fecundity for any of the traits measured. Similarly, a significant positive relationship was detected between wing trait size and development time but no association was detected between trait FA and development time. There were no differences between mean fecundity or development time of extreme asymmetry phenotypes compared with modal phenotypes. These results are discussed with reference to suggestions in the literature that FA can be used to estimate individual fitness.

AB  - There is an astonishing diversity of ways in which people benefit from coral reefs. They provide recreation, resource extraction, inspirational, and educational opportunities, among many others as well as being valued just for their existence. As the condition of coral reef ecosystems decline, so do their ability to provide these benefits. Prudent management of coral reefs and the benefits they provide are important as some predict most coral reefs globally will be lost by the mid-21st century. Meanwhile, coral reef managers have limited tools and relevant data to design and implement effective environmental management practices that will enable coral reefs to provide benefits demanded by society. We demonstrate an approach to identify and measure environmental components of coral reefs that directly benefit human well-being. The approach views ecosystems through the lens of a specific set of beneficiaries and the biophysical features directly relevant to each. We call these biophysical features Final Ecosystem Goods and Services (FEGS). In our demonstration, we (1) identify a range of beneficiaries of coral reefs; (2) identify metrics of FEGS for those beneficiaries; and (3) describe how data quantifying those biophysical metrics might be used to facilitate greater economic and social understanding.

AB  - Heat stress in livestock is a function of macro - and microclimatic factors, their duration and intensity, the environments where they occur and the biological characteristics of the animal. Due to intense metabolic processes, high producing dairy cows are highly vulnerable to the effects of heat stress. Disturbances in their thermoregulatory capability are reflected by behavioural, physiological and production changes. Expression of thermoregulatory behaviour such as reduction of activity and feed intake, searching for cooler places or disturbances in reproductive behaviours may be very important indicators of animal welfare. Especially maintenance of standing or lying position in dairy cattle may be a valuable marker of the negative environmental impact. Highly mechanized farms with large numbers of animals have the informatic system that can detect al-terations automatically, while small family farms cannot afford this type of equipment. Therefore, observing and analysing behavioural changes to achieve a greater understanding of heat stress issue may be a key factor for developing the effective strategies to minimize the effects of heat stress in cattle. The aim of this review is to present the state of knowledge, over the last years, regarding behavioural changes in dairy cows (Bos taurus) exposed to heat stress conditions and discuss some herd management strategies providing mitigation of the overheat consequences.

AB  - Strategic tillage (ST) has been proposed to help control weeds that germinate during fallow-periods in continuous no till (NT) farming systems, but its effects on soil biological properties are unclear. ST is a type of reduced tillage (RT) that places particular emphasis during the decision-making process on agro-climatic conditions, and the frequency, timing and implements used to till. Here, we assessed the impacts of one-time ST following 44 years of continuous NT or conventional tillage (CT) on soil microbial diversity, biomass, enzymatic activity and substrate utilisation potential at two depths. The composition of bacterial and archaeal communities differed significantly between contrasting land management (CT vs NT); albeit albeit no differences were observed after ST. Meanwhile, fungal community composition was not affected by contrasting land management or ST. Biological indicators for catabolic diversity, microbial biomass and enzymatic activity showed no significant changes after ST operation. Our results suggest that, in the short-term (13 months), ST exerts only minor impacts on a range of biological properties, as well as, bacterial, archaeal and fungal diversity. Hence, ST has the potential to be used as a strategy to control weeds and diseases without compromising soil health.

AB  - Waste management historically focused on the protection of human health and the natural environment from the impacts of littering and dispersion of pollutants. An additional and more recent concern is the resource value of waste. Our analysis shows that the regulatory concept of waste in the European Union, which comprises environmental principles, the legal definition of waste, legal requirements, and policy implementation, is not fit for addressing this concern. The legal definition of waste overlooks the context of waste, fails to consider the interests of the waste user as opposed to the waste holder, and aims to control the impacts of careless discarding rather than stimulating careful discarding. To address these challenges, we suggest a legal requirement to recognise the potential of waste to be used, operationalised by formulating a waste use potential, which expresses how and how much waste can be used as a resource, given enabling conditions. Recognition of waste use potential highlights local opportunities for reuse and recovery, reduces the likelihood of careless discarding, and reveals the interests of possible waste users to the waste holder. The waste use potential may be employed in the formulation and evaluation of policies for industrial and municipal solid waste in a circular economy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Risk assessment and ecological effects are a concern of transgenic rice. In this study, the effects of three lines of Bt rice expressing single Cry1Ab protein (Kemingdao: cv. KMD) and fused Cry1Ab/Cry1Ac proteins (Huahui 1: cv. HH1; Bt Shanyou 63: cv. Bt-SY63) on soil mite community were investigated under field conditions. Transgenic treatment (cv. Bt-rice vs. non-Bt rice) significantly decreased the community index of Margalef's richness (SR) of soil mite in KMD, and significantly increased the abundance and the community indexes of Shannon diversity (H'), Pielou's evenness (J) and SR of soil mite in Bt-SY63 (p < 0.05). Transgene type (cv. KMD vs. HH1) did not significantly affect the composition, abundance and the community index (p > 0.05). Breeding type (cv. HH1 vs. Bt-SY63) significantly changed the composition and markedly improved the abundance and the J value in Bt-SY63 (p < 0.05). However, seasonal and inter-annual changes were apparent, and the Bt effects were not consistent at all for the different plant backgrounds over a 2-year period. These results suggested that the cultivation of Bt rice has a significant but transient effect on soil mite community.

AB  - Nonextractable residues (NER) are pollutants incorporated into the matrix of natural solid matter via different binding mechanisms. They can become bioavailable or remobilize during physical chemical changes of the surrounding conditions and should thus not be neglected in environmental risk assessment. Sediments, soils, and ground-water sludge contaminated with DDXs (DDT, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane; and its metabolites) were treated with solvent extraction, sequential chemical degradation, and thermochemolysis to study the fate of NER-DDX along different environmental aquatic-terrestrial pathways. The results showed that DDT and its first degradation products, DDD (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane) and DDE (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene), were dominant in the free extractable fraction, whereas DDM (dichlorodiphenylmethane), DBP (dichlorobenzophenone), and DDA (dichlorodiphenylacetic-acid) were observed primarily after chemical degradation. The detection of DDA, DDMUBr (bis(p-chlorophenyl)-bromoethylene), DDPU (bis(p-chloropheny1)-propene) and DDPS (bis(p-chlorophenyl)-propane) after chemical treatments evidenced the covalent bindings between these DDXs and the organic matrix. The identified NER-DDXs were categorized into three groups according to the three-step degradation process of DDT. Their distribution along the different pathways demonstrated significant specificity. Based on the obtained results, a conceptual model of the fate of NER-DDXs on their different environmental aquatic-terrestrial pathways is proposed. This model provides basic knowledge. for risk assessment and remediation of both extractable and nonextractable DDT-related contaminations.

AB  - Rhagium inquisitor (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), which contributes to the process of decay by digesting the cambium layers of old trees in ecosystem, is detrimental on timbers. The beetle is resistant to stress condition although sensitive to environmental changes. Morphological differences in size of R. inquisitor collected from East of Marmara Basin were investigated between female-male, humid subtropical climate (CFA)-hot summer Mediterranean climate (CSA) and industry-forest zones. Multivariate analysis of variance was carried out on 41 morphological traits. Discriminant analysis and principal component analysis were conducted then.
   It is found that between sexes, only one antennal segment and mesotibia have differences, between CSA-CFA zones interocular distance, pronotum, elytra, antenna, profemur, protibia, mesofemur, metatarsus, and industry-forest zones interocular distance, elytra, antenna, and femurs of foreleg, midleg and hindleg are showed differences. Discriminant analysis supported that original classifications are correct and principal component analysis showed relations between significant traits.
   The results indicated that despite R. inquisitor does not have sexual dimorphism in size of most traits, response to environmental stimuli by static allometry. The relative changes in morphological characters might affect survival performance of the insect, on the other hand might cause to be pointed out this insect as a candidate bioindicator.

AB  - Heavy metal pollution in urban cities is now an accepted fact. An understanding of the natural and anthropogenic contributions to heavy metal accumulation in these cities is necessary to develop strategies to mitigate their impacts, particularly on human health. Here, we used multiple records using geological and biological pollution indicators to assess the extent of pollution in the Colombo Metropolitan Region (CMR), Sri Lanka. Elemental concentrations of Cu, Zn, Ni and Pb were determined in four depositories: surface soil (90 samples), canal sediments and canal water (45 samples each) and vegetation (62 samples). These were mapped using GIS overlapping the road network to identify hotspots of heavy metals. While the surface soil, canal sediments and leaves of trees had higher and different amounts than background levels of heavy metals, canal water had low levels. Our results suggest that anthropogenic activities are the major source of heavy metals in an urban city, and unique natural factors, such as coastal conditions, terrain morphology and climate, combine and influence the distribution of these metals. We discuss the possible remediation of metal pollution and the necessity of a holistic multi-proxy approach to understand urban heavy metal contamination in a rapidly populating area.

AB  - Because of the unstable hydrodynamic conditions in the wild, the endangered aquatic plant should be cultivated first in constructed wetlands for the protection and expansion of germplasm resources. Ottelia acuminata (Gagnep.) Dandy has become extinct in Erhai Lake, Yunnan province, China. In order to optimize substrates for this species to artificial cultivation, the native substrate (sandy soils) and the other three representative ones (red paddy soils, alluvial paddy soils, and purple paddy soils) collected from Erhai lakeside were applied to cultivate O. acuminata for 50 days. Multi indicators, such as antioxidant enzymes activity, malondialdehyde and chlorophyll-alpha concentration, and relative growth rate of O. acuminata, were discussed and statistically analyzed to classify the substrates. The results suggested that even disregarding the physiology significance of these indicators, hierarchical clustering analysis had high efficiency on optimizing substrates. Although various single indexes suggested different optimal substrates for macrophyte growth, red paddy soil was never excluded out the optimal substrate classes. Further study is needed to assess the substrates optimization functionalities of these indicators. This study offers amounts of physiology data and an effective method to optimize substrates of O. acuminata. It is helpful for environmental scientists and ecological engineers to conduct the similar study on endangered species.

AB  - Chronic exposure to ocean acidification and elevated sea-surface temperatures pose significant stress to marine ecosystems. This in turn necessitates costly acclimation responses in corals in both the symbiont and host, with a reorganization of cell metabolism and structure. A large-scale untargeted metabolomics approach comprising gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) was applied to profile the metabolite composition of the soft coral Sarcophyton ehrenbergi and its dinoflagellate symbiont. Metabolite profiling compared ambient conditions with response to simulated climate change stressors and with the sister species, S. glaucum. Among similar to 300 monitored metabolites, 13 metabolites were modulated. Incubation experiments providing four selected upregulated metabolites (alanine, GABA, nicotinic acid, and proline) in the culturing water failed to subside the bleaching response at temperature-induced stress, despite their known ability to mitigate heat stress in plants or animals. Thus, the results hint to metabolite accumulation (marker) during heat stress. This study provides the first detailed map of metabolic pathways transition in corals in response to different environmental stresses, accounting for the superior thermal tolerance of S. ehrenbergi versus S. glaucum, which can ultimately help maintain a viable symbiosis and mitigate against coral bleaching.

AB  - In order to determine whether using indicators of zooplankton diversity and macrophyte parameters (density and biomass) could be a useful tool for diagnosing the water quality of ponds we hypothesised that in various trophic types of shallow water bodies parameters of a macrophyte habitat will reflect zooplankton diversity. Thus, 439 stations (open water, helophytes, elodeids) were studied among 274 pastoral ponds (mid-west Poland). In each trophic state of waters a key predictor of zooplankton diversity was biomass of macrophytes attributed to a variety of ecological types or various species of macrophytes. A shift from the high importance of elodeids (e.g. Myriophyllum, Ceratophyllum demersum) in structuring zooplankton diversity in mesotrophic waters to helophytes (Typha angustifolia, Phragmites australis, Schoenoplectus lacustris) in hypereutrophic ponds was recorded. Hypereutrophy proved to be extremely unfavourable for zooplankton, as reflected in its lowest diversity; rotifers reached their optimum in eutrophy and crustaceans in mesotrophy. Adverse environmental conditions in hypereutrophic waters caused the elimination of macrophyte-dominated refuges, thereby lowering the macrophyte-site share, which ranged from 47% in eutrophy, 40% in mesotrophy to only 20% in hypereutrophy. Therefore, we assume that zooplankton diversity and macrophyte occurrence can be used for quality assessment of small water bodies.

AB  - Social capital has become a highly successful concept in social science despite widely perceived shortcomings in conceptualization and operationalization. The latter is frequently performed as a principal component analysis of individual survey data with subsequent aggregation to regional or national levels. The central focus of this paper is the interpretation of the diverging correlations observed between the dimensions elaborated on an individual and an aggregate level. We illustrate that the correlations of regionally aggregated components are the result of an improper application of a single-level model to a multilevel structure. This mechanism is demonstrated empirically by adopting results from the European Social Survey and elaborating dimensions of social capital from both individual and aggregate survey data for European regions. The findings clearly indicate that the observed ecological correlations are not simply spurious or inconsistent due to an ecological fallacy condition, but rather reflect the influence of regional driving forces. Researchers need to be more careful in taking account of the multilevel nature of the data in order to produce valid results. In fact, the often applied procedure of individual factorization and subsequent aggregation of data provides a mixture of the two level effects with potentially misleading implications.

TI  - Applying a capitals framework to measuring coping and adaptive capacity in integrated assessment models
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE

KW  - CLIMATE-CHANGE
KW  - VULNERABILITY
AB  - In Integrated Assessment modelling of climate change impacts and adaptation, there are two main uses for measures of capacity to adapt to climate change. The first is to represent the capacity for proactive adaptation: this can be termed adaptive capacity. The second is to represent the capacity for reactive or instantaneous coping: this can be termed coping capacity. Adaptive capacity helps to determine which proactive adaptation options are feasible as inputs to the models under any given pair of climate and socio-economic scenarios. Coping capacity represents the residual ability to react to conditions, and influences vulnerability under any given set of model outputs. Using the example of the CLIMSAVE Integrated Assessment Platform, we explain how these capacities can be represented in integrated assessment. We demonstrate how an index of adaptive and coping capacity can be developed using a five-capitals (human, social, manufactured, natural, financial) model of societal wealth and incorporated in integrated assessment models. We find that for very aggregate applications, but not local or sectoral applications, the same indicators can be used to simulate adaptive and coping capacity. In addition, we argue that it is generally unnecessary to account for the depletion of capacity through adaptation itself, and that natural capital can generally be omitted from capacity measures if it is already directly represented in model outputs.

AB  - An important element to be taken into account when designing the afforestation of Tarnowo Podgorne municipality was to create a model of ecological corridors, taking into account existing and planned natural forest areas. Analysis of the concept of afforestation and conditions allowed to determine the existing network nodes and corridors through the use of quantitative and qualitative methods of organic interconnection network and determine the degree of functional chain structure and ecological stability in the community. For the evaluation of the network model used in the basic indicators used in the method of assessing the stability of part of the landscape in order of network connections. Designed structure of ecological corridors indicates that all test indicators are within the ranges set by the method, and their interpretation proves unequivocally that the designed network will fulfill their natural functions. The proposed concept is characterized by the attention to the behavior of spatial order with regard to the functionality of other forms of land use space. Although the community is not in any formal way affiliated with the Nature 2000 network the structure of ecological corridors is the result of the development of the concept shows a high degree of functionality and stability as part of the assessment of the stability of the landscape in order of network connections.

AB  - Periphytic communities are good indicators of river quality due to their general sensitivity to several pollutants. The primary objective of this study was to develop and optimize an ecotoxicological testing methodology using the freshwater benthic diatom Navicula libonensis. This species was selected due to its ubiquity and suitability for use under laboratory conditions. In the most suitable test medium (Chu10) the diatom demonstrated comparable sensitivity to potassium dichromate and 3,5-dichlorophenol using growth rate as the reference parameter, with median effect concentrations (ErC50) in the same order of magnitude (0.119 and 0.799 mg L-1) respectively. Yield-based estimates did not confirm this pattern and potassium dichromate was one order of magnitude more toxic than 3,5-dichlorophenol. The sensitivity of N. libonensis to the reference chemicals was higher than that published in the literature for several standard planktonic microalgae. This advantage, as well as the ability to grow the species in the laboratory, supports further efforts towards the standardisation of a toxicity testing protocol. In addition, the functional role of benthic diatoms in lotic ecosystems justifies their inclusion in risk assessment test batteries to better cover an environmental compartment that has so far been neglected.

AB  - As part of the ecological risk assessment associated with radionuclides in freshwater ecosystems, toxicity of waterborne uranium was recently investigated in the microcrustacean Daphnia magna over a three-generation exposure (F0, F1, and F2). Toxic effects on daphnid life history and physiology, increasing over generations, were demonstrated at the organism level under controlled laboratory conditions. These effects were modeled using an approach based on the dynamic energy budget (DEB). For each of the three successive generations, DEBtox (dynamic energy budget applied to toxicity data) models were fitted to experimental data. Lethal and sublethal DEBtox outcomes and their uncertainty were projected to the population level using population matrix techniques. To do so, we compared two modeling approaches in which experimental results from F0, F1, and F2 generations were either considered separately (F0-, F1-, and F2-based simulations) or together in the actual succession of F0, F1, and F2 generations (multi-F-based simulation). The first approach showed that considering results from F0 only (equivalent to a standard toxicity test) would lead to a severe underestimation of uranium toxicity at the population level. Results from the second approach showed that combining effects in successive generations cannot generally be simplified to the worst case among F0-, F1-, and F2-based population dynamics.

AB  - The coastal environment shows a wide range of bed patterns, for which sandwaves and sandbanks are among the most common. Less known in this context is the high benthic diversity in the coastal environment, which gives rise to the question to what extend the benthos interacts with the shape of the seabed. This paper reviews field and flume experiments on bio-geomorphological influences between benthos and sediment and tests the hypothesis that both the occurrence and the dimensions of sandwaves are dependent on the benthic diversity in the North Sea. Mathematical inclusions to account for biological activity in idealized models reveal that biota is able to influence the wavelength of sandwaves significantly, compared to the default case. More importantly, the models indicate that biota is able to induce bed patterns under conditions when the physical parameters suggest a stable flat bed and vice versa. Present model explorations indicate that future research should focus on the parameterization of subtidal biological activity on sediment dynamics and thereby on seabed patterns. Such knowledge will enable process-based modeling of the spatial and temporal variation in biological activity on seabed morphodynamics and validate the proposed modeling approach with field measurements.

AB  - An exceptional intensification of hydrothermal degassing activity occurred on November 3, 2002, to the east of Panarea, the smallest island of the Aeolian Archipelago (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy). This event represents a unique opportunity to study benthic foraminiferal assemblages under the ecological stress of hydrothermal emissions in shallow (10-15 m water depth) environments. Benthic foraminifera (> 63 mu m) were collected by a scuba diver from sediments and seagrass of a Posidonia oceanica meadow off the coast of Panarea. Assemblages were studied to assess mortality and monitor the composition of benthic communities following the sudden venting event, characterized by an intensification of the emission of gases with high temperatures (40-50 degrees C), low pH (similar to 5), and high concentrations of HCI, HF, SO2 and some H2S. Surface foraminiferal assemblages were monitored during surveys on November 13-14, 2002, and May 22-24, 2003. In November 2002 (10 days after the venting event) agglutinated forms dominated the assemblages in sediment samples, whereas hyaline forms dominated the assemblages collected from the leaves and roots of P. oceanica. Six months later, in May 2003, when environmental conditions had returned to normal, sediment samples were barren of foraminifera, whereas the assemblages associated with P. oceanica were composed of allogromiids, which can be considered opportunistic pioneer species able to colonize disturbed environments.

AB  - Even though paleoloess (loessite) deposits serve as important stratigraphic markers and can imply specific environmental and/or climatic conditions, few have been described in detail. The Mahogany Member of the Triassic Ankareh Formation of north-central Utah contains a well exposed example of an ancient loess, Although difficult to trace regionally, its distinguishing characteristics are uniform massiveness (lacking visible internal structure or bedding) over a 37 m thickness and a silt grain-size distribution. The upper 2.6 m of the loessite contains a distinct, vertical color zonation with lithologic changes indicating development of an immature paleosol, Whole-rock chemical analyses indicate trends in carbonate and clay (aluminum) that are consistent with a paleosol at the top of the loessite, A handheld gamma ray spectrometer yields natural gamma counts that may distinguish the paleoloess as a stratigraphic unit, correlatable to the subsurface.
   Both the loessite and the superimposed immature paleosol (at the top of the loessite) can serve as important proxies for paleoclimate and may further represent a Middle Triassic record that is generally missing throughout much of the Western Interior. Analogous sedimentary deposits that have routinely been grouped as floodplain deposits may, on closer examination, be found to have physical characteristics indicative of loess deposition. Recognition of large, regional-scale loessites could be useful indicators of global climate changes and monsoonal influence associated with varying plate configurations.

AB  - Three sets of oligonucleotide primers were used in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect Salmonella species. phoP primers specific to the phoP/phoQ loci of coliform pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella, Shigella, Escherichia coli, and Citrobacter species served as presumptive indicators of enteric bacteria. In addition to the phoP primers, the Hin and the H-1i primers, which targeted a 236-bp region of hin/H2 and a 173-bp region of the H-1i flagellin gene, respectively, were used. Both Hin and H-1i primers are specific to motile Salmonella species and are not present in Shigella, E. coli, or Citrobacter species. Thus, by multiplex PCR amplification, Salmonella species including Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella paratyphi A, and Salmonella enteritidis can be specifically detected. Optimal reaction conditions have been described to demonstrate this specific, sensitive detection of Salmonella species. By using agarose gel electrophoresis for detection of the PCR-amplified products, the sensitivity of detection was  10(2) CFU after 25 cycles of PCR and 1 (10(0)) CFU after a 50-cycle double PCR. The efficacy of these primers was demonstrated on environmental isolates which had previously been confirmed as Salmonella species by the use of conventional cultural techniques. In addition, positive amplifications resulted from Salmonella species in environmental samples including soil and water.

KW  - GRADIENT ANALYSIS
AB  - The investigation is based on phytosociological and ecological analyses of T. limbosperma-dominated stands from different parts of W Norway. The distribution and floristical composition of the stands are related to different environmental parameters, such as climate, soil and topography. The data are analysed by numerical methods, of which two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN), canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), and simple discriminant functions (DISCRIM) are the most useful. The broad-scale distribution of T. limbosperma stands is determined by climatic factors. Within its distribution area soil factors and human influence govern the TWINSPAN classification 9 different stand types are distinguished.
   The first major division of the TWINSPAN classification is mainly correlated with soil factors. Most of the stands growing on the richest soils are interpreted as representing regeneration stages after intensive human influence. Divisions at lower levels are well correlated with altitude and temperature conditions.
   The stands are all characterized by low pH and base saturation. Some types are concentrated to certain geographical regions, indicating that both altitudinal and west-east-gradients are important in influencing the floristic composition of the different types. The investigations indicate that T. limbosperma has a rather narrow realised phytosociological niche. It is mainly concentrated to stands that are floristically most related to the poorest part of Vaccinio-Piceion communities. Occasionally it is also dominant in Alno-Padion and Lactucion alpinae communities.

AB  - The detrimental environmental impacts of fossil fuels are increasing due to the growing global energy consumption. Thus, energy recovery from waste will inevitably become the dominant option in the future with population growth and the reduction in fossil resources. In this study; the synthesis gas composition obtained by gasification of biomass attained from a mixture of carbon black obtained from waste tires and sewage sludge originating from the yarn industry was modeled by the response surface method and optimized using Box-Behnken design. The R-2 values obtained for H-2, CO, CH4, and the heating value that make up the synthesis gas composition are 92.86%, 95.40%, 96.15%, and 96.80%, respectively. These are the indicators that the models were statistically significant. Optimum conditions obtained from the model were as follows; reaction time 31.14 min, gas flow rate 0.05 L/minute, and biomass amount 19.66 g. As a result of the validation experiments conducted under optimum conditions, the percentages of H-2, CH4, CO were found as 12.75%, 8.07%, and 7.87%, respectively, and the heating value was 1420.3 kcal/m(3). In conclusion, the gasification process is an appropriate treatment for obtaining high-quality syngas from waste materials with high carbon and low moisture content and the Box-Behnken design is applicable for the optimization of the gasification process.

AB  - Reduced glutathione (GSH) level inside the cell is a critical determinant for cell viability. The level of GSH varies across the cells, tissues and environmental conditions. However, our current understanding of physiological and pathological GSH changes at high spatial and temporal resolution is limited due to non-availability of practicable GSH-detection methods. In order to measure GSH at real-time, a ratiometric genetically encoded nanosensor was developed using fluorescent proteins and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) approach. The construction of the sensor involved the introduction of GSH binding protein (YliB) as a sensory domain between cyan fluorescent protein (CFP; FRET donor) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP; FRET acceptor). The developed sensor, named as FLIP-G (Fluorescence Indicator Protein for Glutathione) was able to measure the GSH level under in vitro and in vivo conditions. When the purified FLIP-G was titrated with different concentrations of GSH, the FRET ratio increased with increase in GSH-concentration. The sensor was found to be specific for GSH and also stable to changes in pH. Moreover, in live bacterial cells, the constructed sensor enabled the real-time quantification of cytosolic GSH that is controlled by the oxidative stress level. When expressed in yeast cells, FRET ratio increased with the external supply of GSH to living cells. Therefore, as a valuable tool, the developed FLIP-G can monitor GSH level in living cells and also help in gaining new insights into GSH metabolism.

AB  - Diatom teratologies have intrigued scientists since the XIXth century, with respect to their causes and origins. These deformities, mainly observed in long-term cultures or under high levels of pollution, were poorly considered, until they were recently found to be potential indicators of toxic impairment of freshwaters. However, very little is known about their ecology.
   In this study, the growth and fitness of morphologically distinct descendants of the same cell line of Gomphonema gracile (teratological vs. non teratological forms) were compared over a typical growth cycle. Contrary to expectations, teratological populations grew slightly faster, at a rate of 0.47 +/- 0.03 divisions.day(-1), versus 0.41 +/- 0.04 for the normal morphotype. They had similar physiological performances as non-teratological forms. They did not differ in their movement velocities, but the trajectory of teratological forms was more linear, likely as a consequence of their elongated outline. Under the same culture conditions, no competitive exclusion of one phenotype over the other was demonstrated on the time scale of an exponential growth cycle (9 days). Moreover, the deformities were faithfully reproduced over time, and no evidence of decreased viability in teratological forms was provided.
   These new insights call into question the common hypothesis that deformed diatoms are altered individuals produced by unfavorable conditions and thus highlight ecosystem dysfunction. They call for further investigations of their ecology.

AB  - It is widely acknowledged that waterbodies are becoming increasingly affected by a wide range of drivers of change arising from human activity. To illustrate how this can be quantified a linked modelling approach was applied in the Thames river basin in southern UK. Changes to river flows, water temperature, river and reservoir quality were predicted under three contrasting future "storylines"; one an extension of present day rates of economic development, the others representing more extreme and less sustainable visions. Modelling revealed that lower baseflow conditions will arise under all storylines. For the less extreme storyline river water quality is likely to deteriorate but reservoir quality will improve slightly. The two more extreme futures could not be supported by current management strategies to meet water demand. To satisfy these scenarios, transfer of river water from outside the Thames river basin would be necessary. Consequently, some improvement over present day water quality in the river may be seen, and for most indicators conditions would be better than in the less extreme storyline. However, because phosphorus concentrations will rise, the invoked changes in water demand management would not be of a form suitable to prevent a marked deterioration in reservoir water quality.

AB  - The Heat Field Deformation (HFD) technique is a thermodynamic method for measuring sap flow. Based on continuous heating the HFD method allows for high time resolution measurements which are highly important when studying plant responses to abrupt environmental changes. This work provides a succinct review of previously described features of the HFD methodology. Analyzing symmetrical and asymmetrical temperature differences around a measured linear heater (dT(sym) and dT(as)) relative to their ratio dT(sym)/dT(as) (so called a K-diagram) is at the heart of this methodology. This key concept, however, has to date only been generally described in previous works on the HFD technique. My objective here is to provide a comprehensive overview describing different types of K-diagrams, their interpretation and application for determining K-values or dT(as) for a zero flow condition. The K-value is a measured parameter which is particularly important for objectively characterizing heat conducting properties at the sensor insertion point under specific local measurement conditions. Correctly determining the K-value is critical for accurately calculating sap flow based on recorded temperature measurements. I have included in this review several examples demonstrating how the K-value is dependent upon changes to the environment and its important role in sap flow estimation.

AB  - Understanding the fate of enteric viruses in water is vital for protection of water quality. However, the decay of enteric viruses is not well characterized, and its uncertainty has not been examined yet. In this study, the decay of coliphages, an indicator for enteric viruses, was investigated in situ under both sunlit and shaded conditions as well as in summer and winter. The decay rates of coliphages and their uncertainties were analyzed using a Bayesian approach. The results from the summer experiments revealed that the decay rates of somatic coliphages were significantly higher in sunlight (1.29 +/- 0.06 day(1)) than in shade (0.96 +/- 0.04 day(1)), but the decay rates of male-specific (F+) coliphages were not significantly different between sunlight (1.09 +/- 0.09 day(1)) and shaded treatments (1.11 +/- 0.08 day(1)). The decay rates of both F+ coliphages (0.25 +/- 0.02 day(1)) and somatic coliphages (0.12 +/- 0.01 day(1)) in winter were considerably lower than those in summer. Temperature and chlorophyll a (chla) concentration varied significantly (p < 0.001) between the two seasons, suggesting that these parameters might be important contributors to the seasonal variation of coliphage decay. Additionally, the Bayesian approach provided full distributions of decay rates and reduced the uncertainty, offering useful information for comparing decay rates under different conditions.

AB  - With thousands of organic chemicals released every day into our environment, Europe and other continents are confronted with increased risk of health and environmental problems. Even if a strict regulation such as REgistration, Authorization and restriction of CHemicals (REACH) is imposed and followed by industry to ensure that they prove the harmlessness of their substances, not all testing procedures are designed to cope with the complexity of the environment. This is especially true for the evaluation of persistence through biodegradability assessment guidelines. Our new approach has been to adapt "in the lab" biodegradability assessment to the environmental conditions and model the probability for a biodegradation test to be positive in the form of a logistic function of both the temperature and the viable cell density. Here, a proof of this new concept is proposed with the establishment of tri-dimensional biodegradability profiles of six chemicals (sodium benzoate, 4-nitrophenol, diethylene glycol, 2,4,5-trichlorophenol, atrazine, and glyphosate) between 4 to 30 degrees C and 10(4) to 10(8) cells ml(-1) as can be found in environmental compartments in time and space. The results show a significant increase of the predictive power of existing screening lab-scale tests designed for soluble substances. This strategy can be complementary to those current testing strategies with the creation of new indicators to quantify environmental persistence using lab-scale tests.

AB  - A multidisciplinary approach was followed to study the pedogenic and palaeoclimatic information preserved in a buried palaeosol belonging to a Late Quaternary succession located along the bay of Alghero (north-western Sardinia). The bay is dominated by a 5-km long sandy beach-ridge system backing an N-S oriented lagoon system (Calich). The succession studied is characterized by basal shallow marine deposits, followed by clayey lagoon sediments and colluvial strata and capped by a relatively thick aeolianite. The research was based on pedological and sedimentological analyses, supported by optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating and by an in-depth micro-morphological study. Three main climatic pulses were highlighted during the Eemian. A wet period, with intense carbonate leaching occurred at the very beginning of the Eemian interglacial followed by very dry climatic conditions. This dry phase was long and arid enough to allow the formation of a thick calcrete hardpan, a typical feature of semi-arid environments. The hardpan is dated at about 120 ka (kilo annum) and this dry event is tentatively associated with the late Eemian arid pulse (LEAP). The last phase of the Eemian recorded the restoration of a wetter climate. Finally, the succession indicated that even in a cooler environment, the central Mediterranean most probably maintained temperate conditions at least until the end of the MIS 5c (about 95 ka; early Wurm).

AB  - An ordinary chernozem artificially contaminated with Zn and Pb salts and reclaimed by the addition of chalk and glauconite under pot experimental conditions has been analyzed. The fractional and group composition of the metal compounds in the soil extracts have been determined according to an original combined fractionation procedure. Coefficients characterizing the changes in the environmental status of the metals under the reclamation conditions have been proposed for describing the formation tendencies of the metal composition in the soils. These are the mobility coefficients (MCs) of the heavy metals (HMs) in the soils and the stability coefficients (SCs) of the soils for the HMs. They are calculated from the analysis of the fractional and group composition of the metal compounds. The MC characterizes the environmental vulnerability of soils to the impact of HMs; the SC characterizes the environmental sustainability of soils concerning the contamination with HMs. The obtained experimental data characterize the behavior features of Zn and Pb in the studied soils. An increase in the environmental hazard has been revealed at the contamination of soils with HMs, as well as its decrease at the application of the tested ameliorants. The participation of both strongly and loosely fixed HM fractions in the development of the HM mobility in the soils and the sustainability of the soils to their impact has been shown.

AB  - Gravity separation of metals from plastics in pulverized e-waste using flowing film concentration in a shaking table was investigated. Over 51% rejection of plastics in a single stage operation was achieved under optimum conditions. The shaking table was shown to be suitable for processing ground PCBs. Pulverized e-waste containing 22% metals was enriched to around 40% metals in a single pass. Statistical models for the mass yield of metal-rich stream and its grade were developed by design of experiments. Optimization was carried out to maximize the mass yield at a target product grade and preferred operating regimes were established. Experiments were designed to prevent metal loss and over 95% recovery values were obtained under all conditions. Settling distances of metals and plastics were computed and shown to be good indicators of separation performance. Particle morphology and stratification in the troughs in between the riffles were shown to influence the separation significantly. Water flow-assisted motion of the plastics was captured and its role in determining the effectiveness of separation was described. The efficacy of tabling was well established for treating ground PCBs. The wet process was shown to be environment friendly and sustainable. It is also relatively cheap and has good potential for industrial application. However, rigorous cost estimates will be required before commercial application. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Perennial microbial mats can be the dominant autotrophic community in Antarctic lakes. Their seasonal growth results in clearly discernible annual growth layering. We examined features of live microbial mats from a range of depths in Lake Hoare, Antarctica, that are likely to be preserved in these layers to determine their potential as proxies of past growth performance. Cyanobacteria dominated the mat for all but the deepest depth sampled. Changes in areal concentrations of phycobilin pigments, organic matter and extracellular polysaccharide and in species composition did not correspond to changes in various water column properties, but showed a linear relationship with irradiance. Carbonate accumulation in the mats correlated with biomass markers and may be inferred as an index of mat performance. We examined the carbonate content of annual layers laid down from 1958-1959 to 1994-1995 in sediment cores from 12 m depth. The carbonate content in the layer showed a significant correlation with the mean summer air temperature. These data suggest a link between air temperature and microbial mat growth performance, and suggest that it is mediated via irradiance. Laminated microbial mats in Antarctic lakes have the potential to act as fine-resolution records of environmental conditions in the recent past, although interpretation is complex.

AB  - Despite the importance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to ecosystem processes, few experimental tools are available to quantify AMF contributions to process rates. In this study we examine the efficacy of an experimental system consisting of wildtype (WT) and different non-mycorrhizal (Myc-) genotype pairs of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), specifically focusing on cv Micro-Tom. Two conditions necessary to make such a system useful were examined; (1) that the Myc- genotype(s) do not get colonized in a full soil AMF community background, while the WT does, and B) that there are no non-target effects of the Myc- phenotype on soil microbes. We assessed the second condition by growing Myc- genotypes and WT in non-mycorrhizal soil, monitoring plant growth (root, shoot biomass; root length; root diameter size distribution) and soil microbial community structure (PLFA analysis) as indicators of any changes in root tissue quality or rhizodeposition. All tested Myc- genotypes showed a drastically reduced colonization in mycorrhizal soil. However, in non-mycorrhizal soil, M161 had greater root biomass and M20 greater microbial biomass compared to WT. Only one of the Myc- mutants examined fully met the criteria. We conclude that the BC1/WT pair is a powerful experimental system and recommend caution when using Myc- mutants in mycorrhizal ecology.

AB  - A tool in the form of a habitat suitability index model (HSI) for the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, was adapted to evaluate and compare the effects of alternative restoration plans in southwest Florida. A component of a large forecasting model, this tool simulates system response by examining the impact of freshwater inputs into the system. The eastern oyster is a good indicator species for modeling because of its sedentary nature and its susceptibility to natural and artificial changes. In addition, oysters form a complex three-dimensional reef structure, which provides habitat and food for numerous species of fish and invertebrates. The model focuses on salinity, temperature, depth, substrate, and high flow frequency as the particular requirements to determine habitat suitability for the eastern oyster. A geographic information system (GIS) incorporates the oyster HSI model, which includes larval and adult components, to determine responses spatially and temporally to facilitate the decision making process. This paper evaluates four hydrologic and land use scenarios for the C-43 West Basin Reservoir Project. Model results indicate that the Preferred Flow scenario and the future conditions with the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan have higher HSI values then either the existing conditions or the future without the Comprehensive Everglades Plan.

AB  - In 1989 the Road and Hydraulic Engineering Division of the Dutch Ministry of Transport and Public Works undertook to develop a system for predicting the concentration of air pollutants emitted by road vehicles travelling on motorways and for assessing the impact alternative routes have on air quality. The first stage of the development programme has recently been completed and has resulted in a methodology being devised that allows users to determine the average annual emission levels and concentrations of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, total hydrocarbons, sulphur dioxide, aerosols, benzene, benzo[a]pyrene and lead. This system is now available in the form of a handbook, and development work is continuing on a software version. The calculation method used in the handbook version of the model assumes .hat a given stretch of road can be divided into individual sections, along which key traffic parameters, environmental factors and the condition of the road do not change significantly. Use of this version of the model allows calculations to be made of vehicle emissions and pollutant concentrations as a function of distance from the road under various weather and environmental conditions, as well as exposure levels at peripheral structures. Analyses can be performed both for individual road sections and complete stretches of motorway. The model also enables assessments to be made of the relative merits of a range of alternative routes.

AB  - We developed a simple, rapid, ecological RP-HPLC method for the estimation of Pitavastatin (PIT), Fenofibrate (FEN), and their impurities in a novel fixed dose combination. We achieved an efficient chromatographic separation in gradient elution mode using Hypersil BDS C18 (100 x 4.6 mm, 3.0 mu m) column. The mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% glacial acetic acid buffer and mobile phase B consisted of ethanol and the flow rate was 1.7 mL per minute. We monitored the chromatogram at 250 nm detection wavelength and the column thermostat at 35 degrees C. The observed resolution for PIT, FEN, and 12 impurities is more than 1.5 for any pair of compounds. The proposed method was validated as per the ICH guidelines for precision, specificity, accuracy, linearity, robustness, ruggedness and it is efficient in estimating PIT, FEN, and their impurities in the same run. The drug product was subjected to various stress degradation conditions and observed a significant amount of degradation in hydrolytic and thermal degradation study. We estimated the method greenness using different Green Analytical Chemistry (GAC) metrics such as Analytical Eco-scale, scoring of hazardous values, Analytical Method Volume Intensity (AMVI), Environmental Assessment Tool (EAT), solvent selection guide approach, and Eco-solvent approach.

AB  - An annual plant, Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera Royle) is globally widespread and one of Europe's top invaders. We focused on two questions: does this species indeed not invade the southern areas and does the environment affect some of its key invisibility traits. In an isolated model mountainous valley, we jointly analyzed the soil (21 parameters), the life history traits of the invader (height, stem diameter, aboveground dw), and the resident vegetation (species composition and abundances, Ellenberg indicator values), and supplemented it with local knowledge (semi-structured interviews). Uncontrolled discharge of fecal wastewaters directly into the local dense hydrological network fostered mass infestation of an atypical habitat. The phenotypic plasticity of the measured invasion-related traits was very high in the surveyed early invasion (30-50% invader cover) stages. Different microhabitat conditions consistently correlated with its growth performance. The largest individuals were restricted to the deforested riparian habitats, with extreme soil nutrient enrichment (primarily by P and K) and low-competitive, species-poor resident vegetation. We showed that ecological context can modify invasion-related traits and what could affect a further invasion process. Finally, this species is likely underreported in the wider region; public attitude and loss of traditional ecological knowledge are further management risks.

AB  - The future demands for smart-cities applications impose maximising the resources utilisation. This study achieves two main objectives to comply with fifth-generation networks goals. First one is to enhance the Narrowband-Internet of Things (NB-IoT) spectral-efficiency. The second is to alleviate the burden of two issues: The signalling during each transmission request for smart-meters (SM) and queuing burden. First, we model the uplink scheduler for the NB-IoT access network using state-machine modelling methodology on Simulink environment. The simulation result is verified and validated with trusted modelling technique. Second, we optimise the NB-IoT uplink scheduler which exploits the periodicity nature of SMs applications with putting envisage considering the emergency conditions. This is done by proposing integrated scheduling protocol which classifies the IoT traffic types and rearranges the transmission times of different SMs utilities and draws a map for the transmission schedule of them to better utilise the sparse time resources. The proposal comprises architecture, signalling, and algorithms. The optimisation is evaluated in term of numbers of SMs versus four spectral performance indicators; utilisation, efficiency, setup-success-percentage, and session-drop-rate according to a case study. The simulation results prove the ability of our proposal to increase the spectrum-utilisation to 17.47%. This enhancement reflects on spectral-efficiency that improved doubled.

AB  - The main purpose of this study was to explore the antibacterial activity and mechanism of lacidophilin from Lactobacillus pentosus against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The effects of temperature, enzyme, metal ions, and pH on the antibacterial activity of L. pentosus were evaluated. The result showed that lacidophilin had good thermal stability and could be decomposed by trypsin completely. The antibacterial ability was affected by high concentration of metal ions, and the best antibacterial ability was acquired under acidic conditions. The antibacterial mechanism of lacidophilin was explored through studying cytomembrane injury, phosphorus metabolism, protein changes, and oxidative stress response of the indicator bacteria. It was shown that lacidophilin destroyed the cytomembrane of the bacteria and increased the cytomembrane permeability, which resulted in the leak of proteins, nucleic acids, and electrolytes. In addition, it further restrained phosphorus metabolism, caused changes of some protein contents, and increased cytomembrane lipid peroxidation and cell oxidative damage. All these might inhibit the growth of bacteria and even cause their death. This study identified a natural biological preservative with strong antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative foodborne pathogens. The high antibacterial activity against the two types of bacteria reflected its potential in food preservation used as a natural food preservative.

AB  - Bioenergy has been globally recognized as one of the sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels. An assured supply of biomass feedstocks is a crucial bottleneck for the bioenergy industry emanating from uncertainties in land-use changes and future prices. Analytical approaches deriving from geographical information systems (GIS)-based analysis, mathematical modeling, optimization analyses, and empirical techniques have been widely used to evaluate the potential for bioenergy feedstock. In this study, we propose a three-phase methodology integrating fuzzy logic, network optimization, and ecosystem services assessment to estimate potential bioenergy supply. The fuzzy logic analysis uses multiple spatial criteria to identify suitable biomass cultivating regions. We extract spatial information based on favorable conditions and potential constraints, such as developed urban areas and croplands. Further, the network analysis uses the road network and existing biorefineries to evaluate feedstock production locations. Our analysis extends previous studies by incorporating biodiversity and ecologically sensitive areas into the analysis, as well as incorporating ecosystem service benefits as an additional driver for adoption, ensuring that biomass cultivation will minimize the negative consequences of large-scale land-use change. We apply the concept of assessing the potential for switchgrass-based bioenergy in Missouri to the proposed methodology.

AB  - The development of early warning indicators that identify ecosystem stress is a priority for improving ecosystem management. As microbial communities respond rapidly to environmental disturbance, monitoring their composition could prove one such early indicator of environmental stress. We combined 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the seagrass root microbiome of Halophila ovalis with seagrass health metrics (biomass, productivity and F-sulphide) to develop microbial indicators for seagrass condition across the Swan-Canning Estuary and the Leschenault Estuary (south-west Western Australia); the former had experienced an unseasonal rainfall event leading to declines in seagrass health. Microbial indicators detected sites of potential stress that other seagrass health metrics failed to detect. Genera that were more abundant in 'healthy' seagrasses included putative methylotrophic bacteria (e.g. Methylotenera and Methylophaga), iron cycling bacteria (e.g. Deferrisoma and Geothermobacter) and N-2 fixing bacteria (e.g. Rhizobium). Conversely, genera that were more abundant in 'stressed' seagrasses were dominated by putative sulphur-cycling bacteria, both sulphide-oxidising (e.g. Candidatus Thiodiazotropha and Candidatus Electrothrix) and sulphate-reducing (e.g. SEEP-SRB1, Desulfomonile and Desulfonema). The sensitivity of the microbial indicators developed here highlights their potential to be further developed for use in adaptive seagrass management, and emphasises their capacity to be effective early warning indicators of stress.

AB  - The use of urban green space is a determinant for urban inhabitant's well-being. However, increasing urbanisation lessened the opportunity for urban inhabitants to engage with green space. This situation requires landscape planners to design an urban green space with maximum benefits that fulfil inhabitants' needs for their well-being. Structural biodiversity is an essential element in generating the benefits and values interpreted through the activities at the urban green space. This paper aims to identify the cultural practices that influenced by structural biodiversity of two urban forests in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. Multiple Response Analysis was used to analyse the data from on-site questionnaire surveys completed by 253 visitors of both urban forests. The result shows that a high-density urban forest offers an opportunity for visitors to get attached to nature and attract visitors to involve in sedentary and moderate activities. In contrast, a moderate density urban forest offers a less natural value that attracts visitors to take part in moderate and vigorous activities with less engagement with nature. This study would contribute to a better understanding of the structural biodiversity that influenced visitors' cultural practices, where the present condition of the two urban forests has illustrated the current benefits that visitors obtained from the ecosystem.

AB  - The saltmarshes of Hyeres (Provence; France) are Mediterranean lagoons and wetlands deeply altered since Antiquity; they are an example of a socio-ecosystem characterized by industrial activities since 1848 for salt production and artisanal fishing. After the end of the industrial exploitation in 1995, saltmarshes of Hyeres became property of the Conservatoire du Littoral (Coastal Protection Agency) in 2001 and managed by the Toulon Provence Mediterranee metropolitan area. Since then, access to the sites is still restricted in order to preserve the historical heritage of the site and biodiversity of birds. The present work aims to localize and map Magnoliophyta aquatic meadow habitats in order to: (i) better understand the water management of the saltmarshes, inducing the presence or absence of Magnoliophyta and (ii) assess the health status of macrophytes community. The main observed Magnoliophyta was Ruppia spiralis, Linnaeus ex Dumortier, its presence in such brackish waters can be considered as an indicator of good conservation status. Our results show a relatively high abundance of R. spiralis, strongly related with environmental conditions and water management. This study is the first step of an ecosystem-based approach; R. spiralis, as a primary producer, belongs to a major functional compartment of the ecosystem, which constitutes the saltmarshes.

AB  - To understand the response of soil microbial communities in different types of wetlands to anthropogenic disturbances, this study focused on a freshwater wetland (Sanjiang Wetland) and a salt marsh (Momoge Wetland) and sampled cultivated, degraded, and natural soils in these wetlands. High-throughput sequencing was applied to characterize the soil microbial community composition, and physicochemical properties, including pH, total nitrogen, total carbon, and soil water content (SWC), were measured. The results revealed that the total nitrogen, total carbon, and SWC were significantly lower in disturbed soil in the freshwater wetland but higher in the salt marsh. Generally, under anthropogenic disturbances, microbial community diversity decreased in the freshwater wetland and increased in the salt marsh. The bacterial community structure in the salt marsh was more sensitive than that in the freshwater wetland, while the fungal community structure in the freshwater wetland was more susceptible than that in the salt marsh. The results of indicator value analyses revealed specific issues in two wetlands, such as methane generation and anoxic conditions. This study shows that soil microbiomes in two types of wetlands respond differently to human activities, which implies that the type of native wetlands should be considered in the exploitation of wetlands.

AB  - In this study, the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater as predicted by SimpleTreat 4.0 was evaluated. Field data obtained from literature of 43 pharmaceuticals, measured in 51 different activated sludge WWTPs were used. Based on reported influent concentrations, the effluent concentrations were calculated with SimpleTreat 4.0 and compared to measured effluent concentrations. The model predicts effluent concentrations mostly within a factor of 10, using the specific WWTP parameters as well as SimpleTreat default parameters, while it systematically underestimates concentrations in secondary sludge. This may be caused by unexpected sorption, resulting from variability in WWTP operating conditions, andlor QSAR applicability domain mismatch and background concentrations prior to measurements. Moreover, variability in detection techniques and sampling methods can cause uncertainty in measured concentration levels. To find possible structural improvements, we also evaluated SimpleTreat 4.0 using several specific datasets with different degrees of uncertainty and variability. This evaluation verified that the most influencing parameters for water effluent predictions were biodegradation and the hydraulic retention time. Results showed that model performance is highly dependent on the nature and quality, i.e. degree of uncertainty, of the data. The default values for reactor settings in SimpleTreat result in realistic predictions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Agriculture is considered to be one of the main drivers for worldwide biodiversity loss but the impacts of agricultural production on biodiversity have not been extensively considered in Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs). Recent realisation that biodiversity impact should be included in comprehensive LCAs has led to attempts to develop and implement methods for biodiversity impact assessment. In this review, twenty-two different biodiversity impact assessment methods have been analysed to identify their strengths and weaknesses in terms of their comprehensiveness in the evaluation of agricultural products. Different criteria, which had to meet the specific requirements of biodiversity research, life cycle assessment methodology, and the evaluation of agricultural products, were selected to investigate the identified methods. Very few of the methods were developed with the specific intention of being used for agricultural LCAs. Furthermore, none of the methods can be applied globally while at the same time being able to differentiate between various agricultural intensities. Global value chains and the increasing awareness of different biodiversity impacts of agricultural production systems demand the development of evaluation methods that are able to overcome these shortcomings. Despite the progress that has already been achieved, there are still unresolved difficulties which need further research and improvement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biofilm is an integral element of the ecosystem in each device of the technological process in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Until now, no comprehensive analysis of the occurrence of morphological groups in the biofilm of wastewater treatment devices has been performed. Wanting to fill this gap, the aim of the present article was to determine the structure of the biofilm in the technological system of a WWTP in Lublin (Poland). Abundance of individuals from the following morphological groups was assessed: fungi, flagellates, algae, testate amoebae, ciliates, rotifers, and nematodes. Additionally, values of three biocoenotic indices were determined, that is, the Shannon Diversity, McIntosh Evenness, and Berger-Parker (dominance). Results have demonstrated differences in the structure of the biofilm between the devices. Flagellates and fungi dominated in the mechanical part, whereas the biological elements were dominated by ciliates, amoebae, and rotifers and the treated wastewater by algae and ciliates. Indices indicated the simplest biofilm structure (the lowest biodiversity) at the mechanical stage and at site of discharge of treated wastewater to the receiver. Knowledge of the biofilm structure may be useful for assessment of conditions prevailing in wastewater treatment devices. Moreover, it can be a starting point to develop a quick and low-cost bioindication method applicable in all devices, which can be complementary to standard physicochemical methods.

AB  - A sediment core covering the past similar to 400 years from Lake Moaralmsee (central Austrian Alps), which has previously been judged to be ultra-sensitive to climate change due to its unusually cold water, was examined for its fossil invertebrates. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the faunal assemblages had experienced changes in their composition during periods of the Little Ice Age and recent climate warming. Although there was some general lag between the community changes of these animal groups, the faunal dynamics showed significant correlation between the principal component axes. A mutual break point in the assemblages occurred in the beginning of the 20th century corresponding to increased global and Alpine air temperatures. A gradual decrease in diversity was detected for chironomids, but the only major change in the diversity of Cladocera occurred between similar to 1900 and 1950AD when it was markedly lower. The results indicate that Lake Moaralmsee has gone through clear changes in its invertebrate fauna during the past centuries that were most likely related to climate warming, with the most dramatic changes occurring almost a century ago.

AB  - The use of biochemical and molecular indices of nutritional stress have recently been promoted for their potential ability to assess the in situ nutritional state of zooplankton. The development and application of these indicators should at least consider the cross-reactivity with other nutritional stressors. We examined the potential usefulness of body alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) as an indicator of dietary phosphorus (P) stress in Daphnia. We measured growth rate, body P-content, and body APA of two species of Daphnia (D. magna, D. pulex) grown for different periods under diverse dietary conditions. We found P-poor food reduced daphnid growth rates and body P-content, while body APA increased in both species. However, body APA increased in P-sufficient D. magna and D. pulex that were feeding on cyanobacterial compared to green algal food, despite no differences in animal body P content. Body APA increased in D. magna fed P-poor food whether cyanobacterial or algal. Body APA also varied with age and other nutritional stresses (low food quantity, nitrogen-poor algae) in both daphnid species. Our results demonstrate that whole body homogenate APA in Daphnia is not singularly responsive to P-poor food, which will complicate or limit its future usefulness and application as an indicator of dietary P-stress in metazoans.

AB  - Physical-chemical monitoring and characterization of ciliate communities from a full-scale rotating biological system (RBC) have been carried out for a year. RBC system operated efficiently in removing the organic matter, as the decrease of the BOD5 loading along the successive RBC units revealed. 55 species of ciliated protozoa were identified in the RBC biofilms. Differences in abundance, occurrence and type of species were found along the different units of the RBC system; the last RBC held a more stable and diverse ciliate community. The complexity of interspecific relationships among the ciliates has been outlined using multivariate methods (Cluster and Correspondence analysis). Correlation between ciliate species and physical-chemical conditions were obtained by regression analysis. Results show that 12 species of ciliates were related to an optimal efficiency in organic matter removal, Litonotus crystallinus being the most sensitive species. The presence and abundance of Litonotus crystallinus and Acineria uncinata was associated with a decrease in the organic factor. Metopus es was the only species related to a decrease in process efficiency due to its association with an increase in organic factor. The results provide statistical evidence of the use of certain ciliate species as reliable bioindicators in full-scale RBC wastewater treatment plants.

AB  - In the present study, soil biomass activity, organic carbon storage, and turnover times were compared in adjacent mediterranean biotopes with different forest vegetation, to analyze the effects of litter diversity and soil management protocols on microbial decomposition rates. Samples of forest soil from four vegetation types were collected at depths of 0-20 and 20-40 cm in the 'Tenuta Presidenziale di Castelporziano' Reserve on the Tyrrhenian coast, near Rome (Italy). The samples were incubated under standard laboratory conditions (-33 kPa water tension, and 30 degrees C), in order to compare the microbial activity independently of temperature and humidity. The CO2-C accumulation curves over a 28-d incubation period showed substantially different kinetics between the samples; in particular, soils with above-ground diversity were characterised by high mineralization activity when compared with those sampled under monospecific vegetation. For all the sites, statistically significant linear correlation was observed between nitrogen concentration and potentially mineralizable carbon (r = 0.97), and microbial biomass carbon (C-mic) to total organic carbon (C-org) ratio and the microbial metabolic quotient q(CO2) (r = -0.96). The q(CO2), indicator of the stability of ecosystems, was enhanced by plant diversity, while the C-mic:C-org ratio was reduced. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - With rapid economic development worldwide, large quantities of wastewaters are discharged into natural water. Ammonium (NH4+) and sulfate (SO42-) are the frequently encountered components and thus leads to serious contamination of the environment when not effectively treated. A remarkable breakthrough is in the discovery of the novel Sulfate. Anammox bacteria species are capable of treating both ammonium and sulfates including Anammoxoglobus sulfate and Bacillus benzoevorans. Sulfate-reducing anaerobic ammonium oxidation is a chemobiological reaction using NH4+ as electron donor and SO42- as electron acceptor that produces nitrogen and elemental sulfur as final products based on Fdz-Polanco 2001 investigation. As depicted in this review, the simultaneous anaerobic ammonium oxidation and sulfate reduction reactions are mediated by sludge and bacteria. Their Gibbs free energy change (Delta G theta)under tested conditions will change from positive to negative, which is an essential reaction indicator. The most influencing substrates are ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) and sodium sulfate (NaSO4) sources in the start-up of Sulfate Anammox reactors. However, due to the long time of biomass division and reactors operation, only very few articles on this topic have been carried out. This review provides an overview of Sulfate-reducing ammonium oxidation process researches (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The phenotypic plasticity of seagrasses enables them to adapt to changes in environmental conditions and withstand or recover from disturbance. This plasticity was demonstrated in the large variation recorded throughout a suite of bioindicators measured within Zostera marina meadows around Wales and SW England, United Kingdom. Short-term spatial data were analysed alongside long-term monitoring data to determine which bioindicators best described the status of eelgrass meadows subjected to a range of environmental and anthropogenic drivers. Shoot density, leaf length, leaf nutrients (C:N ratio, %N, %P) including stable isotope of delta C-13 and delta N-15 provided insight into the longer-term status of the meadows studied and a good indication of the causes of long-term decline. Meadows ranged from those in the Isles of Scilly with little evidence of impact to those in Littlewick in Milford Haven, Wales that showed the highest levels of impacts of all sites. Bioindicators at Littlewick showed clear warning signs of nutrient loading reflected in the long-term decline in shoot density, and prevalence of wasting disease. This study highlights the need for continuous consistent monitoring and the benefits of using extra tools in the form of shoot nutrient analysis to determine causes of decline.

AB  - The main aim of this research was to determine the magnitude of geomorphologic changes within a section of a forest road. The research was carried out in the Lejowa Valley in the Tatra Mountains. The measurements of the surface of the road were performed using a RIEGL VZ-4000 terrestrial laser scanner (TLS). TLS models for 2017, 2018, and 2019 served as the basis for the determination of quantitative and spatial relief transformations. The net annual change on the studied road within the first period equaled -884 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1), and for the second period -370 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1). Changes across the accumulation fan ranged from -265 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) to +36 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1). The average rate of erosion on the studied abandoned road is similar, and sometimes even greater than that on roads which are still in use. Our research shows that improper road location may lead to irreversible changes to the natural environment. The planning of a forest road must take into account natural conditions, otherwise progressive relief transformations may lead to significant surface changes and the road may be excluded from use.

AB  - This research investigates the influence of layout and design on the severity of trail degradation. Previous trail studies have been restricted by relatively small study areas which provide a limited range of environmental conditions and therefore produce findings with limited applicability; this research improves on this limitation by analyzing a representative sample of the Appalachian Trail with significant topographical, ecological, use-related, and managerial diversity. Many trail science studies have also focused on a singular form of trail degradation, whereas this study investigates all three core types of trail impact: trail soil loss, widening and muddiness. Relational analyses with all three indicators provide a more cohesive understanding of trail impact and reveal interrelationships between trail degradation processes. ANOVA testing of the mean values for these trail impact indicators across categories of influential independent factors confirms and refines the relevance of core trail design principles, specifically the sustainability advantages of trails with low grades and side-hill alignments. Findings also reveal and clarify the importance of landform grade in determining the susceptibility of trails to degradation and the influence of routing decisions; these relationships have received relatively little attention in the literature. The results also reveal several methodological considerations for trail alignment metrics and trail impact indicators.

AB  - Enhancing the natural and geological heritage means contributing to creating the conditions for sustainable development in the context of environmental tourism and encouraging the spread of geotourism. The large availability of rock outcrops present in Sardinia (Italy) and the recent increasing interest for outdoor tourism have led to the promotion of mountaineering activities and the creation of sports facilities aimed at the use of the rocky areas of the territory. Many of these are normally designed and built on a voluntary basis, usually without authorization, on rocky structures (such as geosites), or areas which are relevant from a naturalistic point of view or because they are part of the landscape. As highlighted by studies on birds by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) and by the same Italian Alpine Club, such sports facilities can damage the environment if they are not properly regulated. The present study develops a new method to tackle the planning of mountaineering sports facilities such as these and to evaluate their impact, with a particular attention on protected areas and officially recognized geosites. This study examines which conducts are compatible with the protection of geosites and their habitat when using these sport facilities, without neglecting the development and economic growth of the territory.

AB  - Oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) is an environmental factor of importance in several biological conversion processes. Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) catalyze oxidative disruption of the cellulose chain in the presence of oxygen or hydrogen peroxide and increase enzymatic hydrolysis yields. However, the enzymes are also sensitive to oxidative damage and the level of oxidative agent needs to be controlled to avoid inactivation of the LPMOs. In the current study, enzymatic hydrolysis of sulfite-pretreated softwood (12% DM loading) was carried out in lab scale reactors with gradual addition of hydrogen peroxide using an LPMO-containing commercial enzyme cocktail. The ORP was measured during enzymatic hydrolysis together with released glucose and the level of C4-oxidized dimer as a marker for LPMO activity. Arrests in LPMO activity coincided with a markedly changed ORP signal and this was utilized in subsequent experiments in which the feed rate of hydrogen peroxide was controlled by keeping the ORP at predetermined set-points of -40 mV, -80 mV and -120 mV. Under anaerobic conditions, the highest hydrolysis yield (78% after 72 h) was found for the ORP set-point of -80 mV. The results show that ORP can serve as an indicator of LPMO activity and may help optimizing overall process efficiency.

AB  - The United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide an excellent channel to demonstrate the significance of soils when considering e.g., food production, water availability, climate mitigation and biodiversity preservation. For environmental sciences, including soil science, the SDGs provide "a point at the horizon" for future research. Progress to achieve the SDGs by 2030 will bureaucratically be monitored by targets and indicators but questions as to how effective research should be organized remain unanswered so far. The soil security concept, based on the five Cs (capability, condition, capital, connectivity and codification) can provide a clear guideline for soil science research, defining soil functions contributing to interdisciplinary ecosystem services that, in turn, can define measures to reach SDGs. A "storyline" is proposed linking the five Cs, emphasizing connectivity that becomes increasingly important in our modern "fact-free" world. The traditional linear research model does not apply when characterizing SDGs because of many conflicting interests that don't allow definition of specific "solutions". But different action-perspectives can be defined as a basis for decision making, creating much needed transparency in the decision process. Soil contributions are most effective when framed in the context of soil-water-atmosphere-plant models. Proper codification, including clear and candid communication with stakeholders, is essential to link science with society, a link that needs improvement.

AB  - This viewpoint article examines Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) practices in developed and transitioning nations, identifies weaknesses, and proposes a new quantitative approach. The literature indicates that there exists little to no standardization in EIA practice, transitioning nations rely on weak scientific impact analyses, and the establishment of baseline conditions is generally missing. The more fundamental issue is that the "receptor"- based approach leads to a qualitative and subjective EIA, as it does not adequately integrate the full measure of the complexity of ecosystems, ongoing project risks, and cumulative impacts. We propose the application of a new framework that aims to ensure full life cycle assessment of impacts applicable to any EIA process, within any jurisdictional context. System-Based EIA (SBEIA) is based on modeling to predict changes and rests on data analysis with a statistically rigorous approach to assess impacts. This global approach uses technologies and methodologies that are typically applied to characterize ecosystem structure and functioning, including remote sensing, modeling, and in situ monitoring. The aim of this approach is to provide a method that can produce quantifiable reproducible values of impact and risk and move EIA towards its substantive goal of sustainable development. The adoption of this approach would provide a better evaluation of economic costs and benefits for all stakeholders.

AB  - The present study assesses the level of sensitivity to desertification of forest types in Italy between 2000 and 2010 on a fine resolution scale using the Environmental Sensitive Area (ESA) scheme. The proposed methodology identifies and ranks the level of sensitivity of fourteen forest types and quantifies the changes in their level of sensitivity over time as a contribution to understanding of complex landscape-forest interactions in Mediterranean ecosystems. Only few forest types showed a relatively high sensitivity level, suggesting that forests may positively contribute to the mitigation of land degradation processes in the Mediterranean region. Forest types showing the highest sensitivity are native types mostly adapted to dry Mediterranean landscapes, introduced vegetation types and highly-fragmented and heterogeneous forest types. Results suggest that: (i) high-quality and biodiversity-rich forest types (e.g., beech, mountain pine forests) may act as vegetation buffer mitigating the increase of land sensitivity to desertification at the landscape scale; and (ii) the remaining forest types (especially highly fragmented, low-quality or low-biodiversity classes in areas with severe soil and climate conditions) may undergo increases in land sensitivity to desertification and should be protected through specific management measures as also implemented in the framework of the National Action Plans to Combat Desertification.

   Although still in an early stage, offshore wind development is now characterized by a boom process. This leads to the necessity of applying an integral management model for the design of offshore wind facilities, being the purpose of the model to achieve technical, economical and environmental viability, all within a sustainable development framework. The foregoing led to the research project exposed in this paper, consisting of drawing up an offshore wind farms methodological proposal; this methodology has a global and/or general nature or point of view whilst searching for optimization of the overall process of operations leading to the design of this type of installations and establishing collated theoretical bases for the further development of management tools. This methodological proposal follows a classical engineering thought scheme: it begins with the alternatives study, and ends with the detailed design. With this in mind, the paper includes the following sections: introduction, methodology used for the research project, conditioning factors, methodological proposal for the design of offshore wind farms, checking the methodological proposal, and conclusions.

AB  - The response of the marine macroalga Gracilaria edulis (Gmelin) Silva to nutrient pulses of varying magnitude was investigated to test its applicability as a marine bioindicator at two oligotrophic locations. After exposure to nutrient pulses, algal amino acid, tissue nitrogen, and chlorophyll a content were assessed relative to algae incubated under control conditions (no nutrient enrichment), The smallest nutrient pulse involved a nutrient enrichment experiment conducted within a coral atoll, whereas two larger pulses resulted from sewage discharge to a tropical coastal bay. After exposure to the smallest nutrient pulse (10 x ambient), only changes in macroalgal amino acid concentration and composition were detected (mainly as increases in citrulline), At 100 x ambient concentrations, increases in tissue % nitrogen of the macroalgae were detected, in addition to responses in amino acids, Macroalgae exposed to the highest nutrient pulse (1000 x ambient) responded with increased chlorophyll a, tissue nitrogen, and amino acids within the three day incubation period, In contrast to these algal responses, analytical water sampling techniques failed to detect elevated nutrients when nutrient pulses were not occurring, The responses of this algal bioindicator to variable nutrient pulses may provide a useful tool for investigating the source and geographical extent of nutrients entering oligotrophic coastal waters.

KW  - STRENGTH
AB  - This paper deals with the effect of initial curing conditions on the hydration process of Portland pozzolan cements. Experiments were performed on pastes made with Canadian Standards Association (CSA) Type 10 (ASTM Type I) Portland cement (PC) and Portland pozzolan cement (PPC) containing 30% natural pozzolan by mass. PC pastes are more sensitive than PPC pastes to the period of initial water curing because the hydration of PC occurs more quickly than does the pozzolanic reaction in PPC pastes. The hydration of Portland cement and the pozzolanic reaction continue after specimens are removed to a dry environment (relative humidity almost-equal-to 20%). The presence of natural pozzolans retards the normal hydration of PC before an age of 1 day but accelerates it after 1 day. For the tests reponed here, an excellent correlation exists between strength and the quantity of ''hydrate'' water. The measurement of pore structure shows that die measurable total pore volume is significantly decreased for specimens that are water-cured and then dried, compared with those that are water-cured only. The period of initial water curing does not have a significant effect on total pore volume at 28 days (measured by Hg porosimetry), but does affect the pore size distribution. Examination of strength is not a good indicator of the effect of initial water curing.

AB  - In May 1992 the effects of changing nutrient conditions on the algal community structure and the nutritional state of phytoplankton populations were studied in three seawater enclosures installed at the Marine Biological Field Station near Bergen, Norway.  The enclosures were fertilized with nitrate and phosphate; they differed in the amount of phosphate administered.  Phytoplankton groups were identified on the basis of pigment concentrations measured by means of high performance liquid chromatography.  Multivariate statistical analysis of the data revealed that the algal communities in the three enclosures developed according to a comparable pattern.  In the first half of May phytoplankton composition changed from a dinoflagellate-rich community into a diatom bloom culminating around 10 May; in the second half of May haptophyte blooms developed in two enclosures.  Carotenoid/chlorophyll a ratio was used as a diagnostic tool to probe the nutritional state of the phytoplankton community.  Nutrient-stressed or senescent cells could not be detected.  The observed changes in the ratio were more likely the result of changes in species composition.  It is discussed that the carotenoid/chlorophyll a ratio is an invalid indicator of nutrient stress on the level of the whole algal community, due to the complex interactions in the pelagic ecosystem.

AB  - The article observes the relevance and substantiates the need to raise the problem of tourism development in the countries of the Black Sea region (Turkey, Ukraine, the Russian Federation, Georgia, Romania and Bulgaria) on the basis of sustainability. Systematization of approaches to the definition of "sustainable development of tourism", "sustainable tourism" and "tourism constancy" has conditioned the elaboration of a sustainable tourism development model, the elements of which are the needs of tourists, tourism resources, tourism services, types of tourism, tourism activities, subjects - tourist, tourist enterprise, destinations and the state (management). It was determined that the achievement of sustainable tourism development in the country should be evaluated from the standpoint of meeting the needs of tourists and considering the factors such as security, sustainable tourism services, economic and environmental sustainability, socio-cultural sustainability, the country's basic sustainaility and political and regulatory constancy. During the study, the needs of the tourist were identified (cognition, recognition and his acceptance of the cultural, historical, national heritage of the destination, the development of spiritual potential and self-development), which act as a driving force for the growth of demand for sustainable types of tourism. It was found that satisfying the physiological needs of a tourist, his staying in a safe environment, confirming his social, professional, family status is associated with mass tourism, and does not fully contribute to the achievement of sustainable development goals. It is determined that the development of tourism in the Black Sea countries is characterized by a high loading on tourist facilities and irregular tourist flows, the irrational use of natural resources, and the continuous expansion of infrastructure that allows only fragmentary observance of the principles of sustainable development. To assess the sustainability of tourism in the countries of the region, we used the author's methodology for ranking the factors of the tourism sustainability index. Calculations demonstrated that the most important factors for tourists in the Black Sea region are the factor of safety, tourism services and the basic state of stability of the country, which is based on the level of food technology usage; the presence of harmful industries in the country; unemployment rate in the country; the importance of tradition in everyday life; international openness safety factors, tourist services and the basic condition of stability of the country. Environmental sustainability and a sociocultural strategy have a moderate impact. In the ranking of the countries of the Black Sea region according to the calculated tourism sustainability index, Georgia took the first place, and Ukraine received the lowest indicator. By the method of cluster analysis, the countries of the Black Sea region were combined into three clusters. The first cluster was formed by Turkey - a country that has a developed system of mass tourism and actively contributes to its reorientation continuously. The second cluster includes Bulgaria, Romania and Georgia, which combine the processes of active development of traditional and sustainable tourism. In the third cluster, which includes Russia and Ukraine, the development of tourism on the principles of sustainability practically does not occur.

AB  - Chickens, especially if free-range, are frequently exposed to Toxoplasma gondii, and may represent an important reservoir for T. gondii. Poultry products may pose a risk to humans, when consumed undercooked. In addition, chickens are regarded as sensitive indicators for environmental contamination with T. gondii oocysts and have been used as sentinels. The aim of the present study was to determine the suitability of commonly used antibody detection methods, i.e. the modified agglutination test (MAT), IFAT and ELISA to detect T. gondii-infected chickens. Samples of experimentally and naturally infected chickens were used. The infection state of all chickens was determined by Magnetic-Capture (MC-) real-time PCR (RT PCR). Naturally exposed chickens were additionally examined by mouse bioassay and conventional RT PCR on acidic pepsin digests (PD-RT PCR). Blood serum and meat juice of various sources were tested for antibodies to T. gondii. In naturally infected chickens, there was substantial agreement between the mouse bioassay and MC-RT PCR or the mouse bioassay and conventional PD-RT PCR. PD-RT PCR was slightly more sensitive than MC-RT PCR, as all (26/26) bioassay-positive chickens also tested positive in at least one of the tissues tested (heart, drumstick). By MC-RT PCR, 92.3% (24/26) of the naturally infected bioassay-positive chickens were positive. The diagnostic sensitivity of MC-RT PCR was clearly related to the organ examined. Based on a quantitative assessment of the MC-RT PCR results in experimentally infected chickens, brain and heart tissues harbored an at least 100 times higher parasite concentration than breast, thigh or drumstick musculature. In naturally infected chickens, only three out of 24 birds, which were MC-RT PCR-positive in heart samples, also tested positive in drumstick musculature. Under experimental conditions, the agreement between MC-RT PCR and the serological techniques revealed 100% diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. Under field conditions, examinations of sera by ELISA, IFAT and MAT showed good performance in identifying chickens that were positive in either a mouse bioassay, MC-RT PCR, or PD-RT PCR as illustrated by diagnostic sensitivities of 87.5%, 87.5% and 65.2%, respectively, and diagnostic specificities of 86.2%, 82.8% and 100%, respectively. The examination of meat juice samples from breast, drumstick or heart musculature revealed similar or even better results in the ELISA. The results in the MAT with meat juice from breast musculature were less consistent than those of ELISA and IFAT because a number of negative chickens tested false-positive in the MAT. The MAT performed similar to ELISA and IFAT when applied to test meat juice samples collected from heart, thigh or drumstick musculature. (C) 2018 Australian Society for Parasitology.

AB  - The increase of swine production in the Pacific Islands has inevitably led to environmental pollution concerns from discharged wastewater derived from both washing and manure. The slurry accumulates in lagoons, where supernatant wastewater containing high levels of pathogens and nutrients becomes nonpoint source water pollution that deteriorates the quality of receiving water bodies. Soil filtration is a promising cost-effective technology for removing pollutants from swine wastewater; however, the excessive growth of bacteria in soil media often accompanies the filtration process. This study investigates soil filtration mediated by protozoa activities to remove Escherichia coli (E. coli) in synthetic swine wastewater. The experiment used plastic columns packed with Leilehua soil from Oahu Island, Hawaii. The soil physicochemical adsorption was seen to reduce 95.52-96.47% of E. coli. However, the average removal efficiencies were increased to 98.17% in a single stage, and 99.99% in two sequential columns, under predation conditions. The filtration media containing naturally established bacterivores with the prey, provided a bioactive means to remove E. coli from the influent. The proper design of Leilehua soil filters potentially removes E. coli from the influent to meet the standard level of recycled water.

AB  - Objective
   To analyze the association between the prevalence of overweight and obesity in children younger than six years of age cared for in the primary healthcare setting with socioeconomic level and environment of Chilean districts.
   Methods
   We conducted an ecological study to analyze the correlation between the prevalence of overweight and obesity and indicators of socioeconomic status (poverty by income and multidimensional poverty) and district environment and surroundings (green areas and crime reporting rate for crimes of significant social connotation). Furthermore, we performed four simple linear regression models with the correlated variables.
   Results
   At the district level, we found that the percentage of people living in poverty as defined by income, and the rate for reporting of crimes, are significantly correlated with the prevalence of overweight and obesity. The crime reporting rate correlated negatively with prevalence, and no correlation was found with communal green areas. Those districts with greater income poverty and a lower crime reporting rate have a higher prevalence of overweight and obesity in children under six years of age.
   Conclusions
   The characteristics of the district environment in which children are raised could augment the risk for overweight and obesity, mainly due to socioeconomic level. The crime reporting rate, on the contrary, shows an inverse relationship with these nutritional conditions.

AB  - Foodborne infection with Listeria causes potentially life-threatening disease listeriosis. Listeria monocytogenes is widely recognized as the only species of public health concern, and the closely related species Listeria innocua is commonly used by the food industry as an indicator to identify environmental conditions that allow for presence, growth, and persistence of Listeria spp. in general. In our study, we analyze the occurrence of Listeria spp. in a farm-to-fork approach in a poultry production chain in Egypt and identify bacterial entry gates and transmission systems. Prevalence of Listeria innocua at the three production stages (farm, slaughterhouse, food products) ranged from 11% to 28%. The pathogenic species Listeria monocytogenes was not detected, and Listeria innocua strains under study did not show genetic virulence determinants. However, the close genetic relatedness of Listeria innocua isolates (maximum 63 SNP differences) indicated cross-contamination between all stages from farm to final food product. Based on these results, chicken can be seen as a natural source of Listeria. Last but not least, sanitary measures during production should be reassessed to prevent bacterial contamination from entering the food chain and to consequently prevent human listeriosis infections. For this purpose, surveillance must not be restricted to pathogenic species.

AB  - Sediment samples from a marine cave in the Murcia region (eastern Spain) were analysed for grain size, total benthic foraminifers and dead brachiopoda to obtain environmental information through physical and ecological data in order to understand the benthic communities of cave environments and their ecological significance. A total of 100 foraminiferal and 7 brachiopod species were classified, highlighting the first occurrence in the western Mediterranean of Gwynia capstela (Jeffrey's, 1859). Statistical analysis applied to foraminiferal data allowed the identification of three assemblages characterised by decreasing species diversity along the cave. This corresponded to a similar separation recognisable through changes in brachiopod species abundance and well-correlated with cave morphology. The relative abundance of epifaunal clinging-attached foraminifera as well as the rate of cave and sciaphilic/coralligenous Brach iopoda, thought to be representative of the degree of separation from marine conditions, were found to be highly correlated, increasing towards the inner cave. Our hypothesis was that despite the different lifestyles of these two groups, the strict correlation of environmental factors (i.e. light, nutrients, sediment texture, water parameters) changing along the length of the cave determines a comprehensive environmental gradient, causing an increase in environmental stress that has similar effects on the different taxonomic groups.

AB  - Seagrass meadows are sites that help mitigate the effects of climate change. The protected area of the Laguna Madre of Tamaulipas is an important site for its biodiversity, which has undergone changes both in the structure and distribution of its seagrass meadows. Five seagrass species were found (Halodule wrightii, Syringodium filiforme, Thalassia testudinum, Ruppia maritima and Halophila engelmannii), forming multispecific meadows. The south zone presented the longest and broadest leaves, but the lowest biomass. Biomass was greatest in the center zone, whereas the highest density were observed in the north zone. The structure analysis showed that the longest and the densest seagrass meadows were S.filiforme. The greatest biomass was recorded for T.testudinum. The meadows with the greatest cover consisted of H.wrightii-S.filiforme. There is little fragmentation of the landscape, and a large succession of species. This indicates change processes, due to the variation in environmental conditions, caused by anthropic modifications, in the lagoon. Due to its importance as an environmental bioindicator, it is necessary to monitor changes in the patterns of structure, fragmentation and succession of species. The present research provides evidence of the change in the distribution of tropical seagrass cover, which may be related to the tropicalization of temperate ecosystems and the need to conserve these habitats.

KW  - ship heavy roll and capsize
KW  - environmental risk assessment
KW  - motion
KW  - wave
AB  - Within the last two decades more than one hundred large tankers, passengers, container or tanker ships have been lost in severe weather conditions or by meeting with a dangerous train of short number of steep waves causing large roll angles and, ultimately, capsizing. In addition to the loss of cargo and human lives, such an event also involves severe pollution of the sea and adjacent shores, especially if the ship is an oil tanker. The motion of a ship in long beam seas could be described by a second-order non-linear differential equation, having the roll angle as variable and depending on four parameters. With the direct forcing amplitude as bifurcation parameter, the dynamical system exhibits either periodic or chaotic behaviour, the route to chaos being realised by a period doubling sequence of periodic motions. Some accepted indicators, like bifurcation diagrams, phase planes and Poincare sections have been computed and they confirm the transition from order to chaos, and finally to unbounded solution (capsizing). A parametric analysis emphasises the role played by each of the system parameters on transient ship capsize. A sketch of an oil spill risk assessment process associated to a capsized ship event is suggested, as a first step in a general risk management plan involving an oil tanker failure/capsizing.

AB  - The success of managing the natural environment by involving the community is strongly influenced by the local social conditions. This paper analyzes social capital inherent in the Muara Baimbai Community in Sei Nagalawan Village to manage the mangrove forest as an area valued for tourism. The study was conducted in Muara Baimbai Mangrove Area, Sei Nagalawan Village, Perbaungan District, Serdang Bedagai Regency on June until December 2014. Data were collected by observation, interview using a structured questionnaire, and in-depth interviews. The Muara Baimbai Community has strong social capital in managing the mangrove ecotourism area. An indicator of a strong social capital is a community institution which is run properly. The success of the community to rehabilitate the mangrove area in Sei Nagalawan and to utilise its resources in a sustainable manner is the result of high levels of participation of the members and the role of active cadres as symbolic power that encourage, drive, and motivate the community in their struggle. Strong motivation, fair work allocation and benefits among the members, strong internal connection, and wide external network are very important to strengthen social capital. Furthermore, the increasing welfare gained by the coastal community through increasing economic income, job opportunities, and knowledge are the benefits derived from the sustainable forest management that can maintain the existence of the community and their natural resource.

AB  - Considering that phytoplankton assemblages are good bioindicators of environmental conditions, the sensitivity of the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) to climate change, and the importance of some areas of its islands as Antarctic Specially Managed Areas, this work assembles published datasets on phytoplankton biodiversity and ecology in confined coastal areas (embayments) of King George Island, WAP. Over 33 years (1980-2013), 415 species from 122 genera have been identified to species level, being mostly diatoms (371 species), with 10 new species described with local material (6 diatoms, 4 cyanobacteria). The importance of diatoms was indicated by the frequent occurrence of Corethron pennatum, Pseudogomphonema kamtshaticum, and abundant benthic genera in the plankton (e.g. Navicula, Cocconeis). The increased contribution of dinoflagellates after 2010 suggests marked changes in the water column. Early-summer blooms differ between the bays' eastern and western shores, with terrestrial melting and wind-driven upwelling inducing the dominance of benthic species at eastern shores, whereas planktonic diatoms (Thalassiosira, Pseudo-nizschia, and Chaetoceros) are most abundant along western shores and central areas. The importance of an accurate identification of organisms that are becoming key ecological components of the region is discussed, as recent changes in the microflora may affect the entire marine food web.

AB  - High levels of vanadium (V) have long-term, hazardous impacts on soil ecosystems and biological processes. In the present study, the effects of V on soil enzymatic activities, basal respiration (BR), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and the microbial community structure were investigated through 12-week greenhouse incubation experiments. The results showed that V content affected soil dehydrogenase activity (DHA), BR, and MBC, while urease activity (UA) was less sensitive to V stress. The average median effective concentration (EC50) thresholds of V were predicted using a log-logistic dose-response model, and they were 362 mg V/kg soil for BR and 417 mg V/kg soil for DHA. BR and DHA were more sensitive to V addition and could be used as biological indicators for soil V pollution. According to a polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis, the structural diversity of the microbial community decreased for soil V contents ranged between 254 and 1104 mg/kg after 1 week of incubation. As the incubation time increased, the diversity of the soil microbial community structure increased for V contents ranged between 354 and 1104 mg/kg, indicating that some new V-tolerant bacterial species might have replicated under these conditions.

AB  - Diazotrophs in the mangrove rhizosphere play a major role in providing new nitrogen to the mangrove ecosystem and their composition and activity are strongly influenced by anthropogenic activity and ecological conditions. In this study, the diversity of the diazotroph communities in the rhizosphere sediment of five tropical mangrove sites with different levels of pollution along the north and south coastline of Singapore were studied by pyrosequencing of the nifH gene. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that in all the studied locations, the diazotroph communities comprised mainly of members of the diazotrophic cluster I and cluster III. The detected cluster III diazotrophs, which were composed entirely of sulfate reducing bacteria, were more abundant in the less polluted locations. The metabolic capacities of these diazotrophs indicate the potential for bioremediation and resiliency of the ecosystem to anthropogenic impact. In heavily polluted locations, the diazotrophic community structures were markedly different and the diversity of species was significantly reduced when compared with those in a pristine location. This, together with the increased abundance of Marinobacterium, which is a bioindicator of pollution, suggests that anthropogenic activity has a negative impact on the genetic diversity of diazotrophs in the mangrove rhizosphere.

AB  - Increasing demand for conservation of water resources has stimulated greywater (GW) recycling. In rural areas of Jordan, low water consumption, GW quality, and user acceptance are the major obstacles. Low cost and easy to operate modified re-circulated vertical flow bioreactor was evaluated in the Jordan Valley under arid conditions. The treatment system efficiently removed BOD5, COD, PO4, and TSS by up to 97%, 94%, 100%, 90%, respectively. DO was significantly increased by up to 98%. Removal efficiency of NO3, Cl, and SO4 was satisfactory ranging from 19% to 66%, up to 45%, and 55%, respectively. EC and TDS fluctuated considerably with time and quality of untreated GW. TCC and Escherichia coli were considerably reduced by up to 2.5 and 2.3 log, respectively. According to WHO guidelines, treated GW is suitable for irrigation of ornamentals, fruit trees and fodder crops. Removal efficiencies of the treatment system were higher than those of other systems operated in Jordan. The reduction in indicator organisms, however, was not adequate to allow unrestricted reuse of treated GW. Practical disinfection technique can be incorporated into the treatment system. Current treatment system demonstrates great potential for treating low quality GW in rural areas achieving socio-economic and ecological benefits. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Four major tea management practices (organic, pollution-free, conventional, and semi-natural) are employed in Chinese tea plantations at present. These practices can induce changes in the physiochemical parameters, microorganism community and enzyme activity in tea plantation soil. However, understanding of their effects on soil nematodes is still scarce. This study aimed to investigate whether and how different management practices affect the biodiversity, function, and structure of soil nematode communities in tea plantation habitats. The soil nematode community structures and ecological indices were determined from the soil samples collected more than 6 y after their respective farming practices were first applied, and different management practices did not greatly affect soil nematode community evenness or species diversity, but organic practice increased nematode trophic diversity, common species diversity, and species richness. Pollution-free practice considerably increased fungivorous nematodes, and both pollution-free and conventional practice decreased bacterivorous nematodes markedly in the subsurface layers of soil. Predator and omnivorous nematodes were found to be more abundant in semi-natural plantation. Organic practice was more sustainable and suitable for tea cultivation, with the greatest biodiversity, best nutrient conditions, higher and more stable C/N ratio and lower interference in the food web.

AB  - Leaf nutrient concentration and the nutrient use efficiency (NUE) were compared among five canopy tree species of a subtropical forest in southern Brazil. Healthy and fully expanded leaves were collected under similar conditions such as canopy position and light exposure. Leaves were dried and ground, the macronutrients (N - Nitrogen, P - Phosphorus, K - Potassium, Ca - Calcium, Mg - Magnesium, S - Sulphur) and micronutrients (Cu - Copper, Fe - Iron, Mn - Manganese; Zn - Zinc and B - Boron) were determined by argon-plasma, optical-emission spectrometry (ICP OES), N by Kjeldahl method, and B by azomethine-H way. The mean leaf concentration of nutrients was similar to other subtropical ecosystems but there was a high interspecific variation, indicating that the species use the nutrients differently from a common pool from the soil. The nutrient use efficiency (NUE) sequence was P> S> Mg> Ca> K> N for macronutrients while for micronutrients the sequence was Cu> B> Zn> Fe> Mn. The elements P, Mg and S had higher NUE in all species. These results suggest different strategies to acquire and use of these essential elements for tree species growing in the same soil type. The interspecific differences of NUE can contribute to explain the coexistence of these species in natural forest communities.

AB  - Aims:
   To obtain needed data on the dry thermal resistance of Bacillus anthracis spores and other Bacillus species for waste incinerator applications.
   Methods and Results:
   Tests were conducted in a pilot-scale incinerator utilizing biological indicators comprised of spores of Geobacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus atrophaeus and B. anthracis (Sterne) and embedded in building material bundles. Tests were also conducted in a dry heat oven to determine the destruction kinetics for the same species. In the pilot-scale incinerator tests, B. atrophaeus and G. stearothermophilus demonstrated similar thermal sensitivity, but B. anthracis (Sterne) was less thermally resistant than G. stearothermophilus. For the dry heat oven tests conducted at 175 degrees C, the D-values were 0 center dot 4, 0 center dot 2 and 0 center dot 3 min for B. atrophaeus, B. anthracis (Sterne) and G. stearothermophilus, respectively.
   Conclusions:
   Bacillus anthracis (Sterne) possesses similar or less dry heat resistance compared to B. atrophaeus and G. stearothermophilus.
   Significance and Impact of the Study:
   Previous studies have demonstrated conditions under which bacterial spores may survive in an incinerator environment. The data from this study may assist in the selection of surrogates or indicator micro-organisms to ensure B. anthracis spores embedded in building materials are completely inactivated in an incinerator.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To assess the persistence of genetically modified and naturally occurring baculoviruses in an aquatic environment, replicate (three) outdoor, aquatic microcosms were spiked with spruce budworm viruses [Ireland strain of Choristoneura fumiferana multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (CfMNPV) and the recombinant CfMNPVegt(-)/lacZ(+)] at a rate of 1.86 x 10(10) occlusion bodies (OBs) m(-2) of surface area. The presence of virus in water samples collected at various times after inoculation was determined by PCR amplification of baculoviral DNA extracted from OBs.
   RESULTS: Although UV radiation rapidly degrades baculoviruses under natural conditions, both viruses persisted above the level of detection (> 100 OBs 450 mu L-1 of natural pond water) for at least 1 year post-inoculation, with little difference between the viruses in their patterns of persistence.
   CONCLUSION: The present microcosm study suggests that occlusion bodies of baculoviruses can persist in the flocculent layer of natural ponds. On disturbance, OBs could re-enter the main water column and thus be available for transport to new locations. Implications for environmental risk assessment are discussed.

AB  - Indigenous peoples' knowledge on changes in wildlife populations and explanations for these changes can inform current conservation and wildlife management systems. In this study, Tuhoe Tuawhenua interviewees provided matauranga (traditional knowledge) about a repertoire of visual (e.g. decreasing flock size), audible (e.g. less noise from kereru in the forest canopy), and harvest-related (e.g. steep decline in harvests since the 1950) indicators used to assess kereru (New Zealand pigeon; Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae novaeseelandiae) abundance and condition in Te Urewera, New Zealand over the last 100 years. Metaphorical explanations for the decline in kereru included the loss of mana (authority and prestige) by the iwi (tribe) over the kereru and forest, and the retraction of the kereru's mauri (life force) by Tine Mahuta (God of the Forest). Interviewees reported that predation and interspecific competition with introduced species, variability in food supply, and loss of habitat were the principal biophysical mechanisms to have caused declines in kereru abundance. Long-term qualitative monitoring by Tuhoe Tuawhenua has the potential to guide the restoration of kereru and wider environmental management in Te Urewera. Allowing iwi the self-determination to make management decisions according to their matauranga (or science, if desired) is likely to lead to greater application of results and altered practices where required for sustainability.

AB  - Biofilms are interface micro-habitats formed by microbes that differ markedly from those of the ambient environment. The term 'subaerial biofilm' (SAB) was coined for microbial communities that develop on solid mineral surfaces exposed to the atmosphere. Subaerial biofilms are ubiquitous, self-sufficient, miniature microbial ecosystems that are found on buildings, bare rocks in deserts, mountains, and at all latitudes where direct contact with the atmosphere and solar radiation occurs. Subaerial biofilms on exposed terrestrial surfaces are characterized by patchy growth that is dominated by associations of fungi, algae, cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria. Inherent subaerial settlers include specialized actinobacteria (e.g. Geodermatophilus), cyanobacteria and microcolonial fungi. Individuals within SAB communities avoid sexual reproduction, but cooperate extensively with one another especially to avoid loss of energy and nutrients. Subaerial biofilm metabolic activity centres on retention of water, protecting the cells from fluctuating environmental conditions and solar radiation as well as prolonging their vegetative life. Atmospheric aerosols, gases and propagatory particles serve as sources of nutrients and inoculum for these open communities. Subaerial biofilms induce chemical and physical changes to rock materials, and they penetrate the mineral substrate contributing to rock and mineral decay, which manifests itself as bio-weathering of rock surfaces. Given their characteristic slow and sensitive growth, SAB may also serve as bioindicators of atmospheric and/or climate change.

AB  - The ecological component is crucial in landscape planning according to the principles of sustainable development. We define "ecologically sustainable landscape" and develop a tool to measure how ecological sustainability is incorporated in landscape plans. This method acknowledges the critical role of spatial scale and pattern to the conservation of biodiversity. The metapopulation concept is used as a spatially explicit ecological theory, appropriate to describe the relation between biodiversity and the pattern of ecosystem patches ("ecosystem network") in intensively used regions. We propose that ecological sustainability is achieved if quality, area and configuration of the ecosystem network permit target species to persist. A simple decision-making model represents a theoretical framework for a tool comprising two sets of ecological indicators. One set indicates the awareness of actors to consider ecological principles of sustainable planning. The other set indicates their performance to apply these principles quantitatively in designing the ecosystem pattern. The method is applied on a sample of reports on Dutch landscape development plans. A majority of the reports shows awareness of the importance of spatial conditions for achieving planning goals, but perform inadequately on the quantitative indicators. We conclude that the tool could be developed as a guideline and assessment method for the ecological sustainability of landscape plans. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The study of the survival of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium in sewage treated by stabilization ponds, and then mixed more or less rapidly with coastal marine water, has been experimentally tested in microcosms (membrane diffusion chambers). The results obtained show that under the same experiment conditions (slow saline, marine and rapid saline stress) the survival time of the two bacteria varies considerably. In sewage treated by stabilization ponds, Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli exhibit the similar survival rates. T-90 evaluated for Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium in the winter period was, respectively, 125 and 132 h. In brackish water the survival rate of Salmonella typhimurium was generally higher than that of Escherichia coli. When these two bacteria were suspended in stabilization ponds effluent and rapidly mixed with brackish water, survival time was particularly short, whereas it was prolonged when the bacteria were submitted to a gradual increase in salinity. Biological factors, and in particular predation, can play an important role in eliminating enteric bacteria during pond system treatment, but their efficiency is supposed to diminish significantly when there is an environmental change such as the discharge of pond system effluent into brackish water. This can explain the increase of enteric bacteria survival.

AB  - Recognising that there is a growing trend of misfits between a firm's technology/routines and market customer needs due to the exponential technological change and linear-type needs evolution in the age of AI (artificial intelligence), this paper aims at developing a model/theory/paradigm that guarantees to attain the targeted outcome. It firstly draws the necessary conditions of BM/BMI from the natures of AI regime according to which literature review on BM/BMI is done and selects direct causal mechanisms of profit (DCMP) & business model schema (BMS) as the theoretical foundation, classifies all probable circumstances into several contingency settings in terms of environmental changes, technological change, needs evolution and bargaining power, specifies strategic indicators including normative business model (NBM) by contingency setting based on DCMP & BMS, builds the comprehensive unified paradigm (CUP) that introduces new strategising logic 'Seek NBM first & then Get-to-It' through new decision-making mode 'adaptising' with practical rationality, discusses about some vague/dubious notions in strategising, and concludes that CUP works as the general theory of BMI for it holds the universal and contingency rules for BMI simultaneously, asserting that when it comes to BM/BMI, there is nothing more robust, persuasive and practical than the general theory of BMI, CUP.

AB  - Performing toxicity testing on multiple species with differing degrees of evolutionary relatedness can provide important information on how chemical sensitivity varies among species and can help pinpoint the biological drivers of species sensitivity. Such knowledge could ultimately be used to design better multispecies predictive ecological risk assessment models and identify particularly sensitive species. However, laboratory toxicity tests involving multiple species can also be resource intensive, especially when each species has unique husbandry conditions. We performed lethality tests with 2 metals, copper chloride and zinc chloride, on 5 different nematode species, which are nested in their degree of evolutionary relatedness: Caenorhabditis briggsae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Oscheius myriophila, Oscheius tipulae, and Pristionchus pacificus. All species were successfully cultured and tested concurrently with limited resources, demonstrating that inexpensive, multispecies nematode toxicity testing systems are achievable. The results indicate that P. pacificus is the most sensitive to both metals. Conversely, C. elegans is the least sensitive species to copper, but the second most sensitive to zinc, indicating that species relationships do not necessarily predict species sensitivity. Toxicity testing with additional nematode species and types of chemicals is feasible and will help form more generalizable conclusions about relative species sensitivity.

AB  - Landlocked lagoons are naturally stressed environments. They are strongly influenced by freshwater input which not only varies naturally, but which is also impacted by anthropogenic activities. This study investigated the direct influence of freshwater discharges on the distribution patterns and abundance of benthic communities in two neighbouring landlocked coastal lagoons, assessing the whole system and the confluence area of each tributary. Sampling occurred in the wet and dry seasons of 2011 at two distances from freshwater discharge locations. Both lagoons were colonized by species from two different pools, freshwater and marine. Freshwater flow rates had a direct influence on the spatial structure of the benthic communities of brackish-water/freshwater interface areas, where also specific taxa can act as early indicators of freshwater input variations. The intensity of this influence is highly dependent on lagoon size, creating spatial heterogeneity or affecting the entire system. The benthic fauna at the confluence of the tributary that depends almost exclusively on groundwater showed the lowest variability, suggesting that the biogeochemical nature of the groundwater may be a central cause for setting specific ecotones. The results suggest that benthic communities of landlocked coastal lagoons can be highly impacted by flow reduction from freshwater aquifers under drought conditions or water abstraction activities.

AB  - Soil salinization and desalinization are complex processes caused by natural conditions and humaninduced risk factors. Conventional salinity risk identification and management methods have limitations in spatial data analysis and often provide an inadequate description of the problem. The objectives of this study were to identify controllable risk factors, to provide response measures, and to design management strategies for salt-affected soils. We proposed to integrate spatial autoregressive (SAR) model, multi-attribute decision making (MADM), and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for these purposes. Our proposed method was demonstrated through a case study of managing soil salinization in a semi-arid region in China. The results clearly indicated that the SAR model is superior to the OLS model in terms of risk factor identification. These factors include groundwater salinity, paddy area, corn area, aquaculture (i. e., ponds and lakes) area, distance to drainage ditches and irrigation channels, organic fertilizer input, and cropping index, among which the factors related to human land use activities are dominant risk factors that drive the soil salinization processes. We also showed that ecological irrigation and sustainable land use are acceptable strategies for soil salinity management.

AB  - In recent years there has been growing interest in composite indicators as an efficient tool of analysis and a method of prioritizing policies. This paper presents a composite index of intermediary determinants of child health using a multivariate statistical approach. The index shows how specific determinants of child health vary across Colombian departments (administrative subdivisions). We used data collected from the 2010 Colombian Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) for 32 departments and the capital city, Bogota. Adapting the conceptual framework of Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH), five dimensions related to child health are represented in the index: material circumstances, behavioural factors, psychosocial factors, biological factors and the health system. In order to generate the weight of the variables, and taking into account the discrete nature of the data, principal component analysis (PCA) using polychoric correlations was employed in constructing the index. From this method five principal components were selected. The index was estimated using a weighted average of the retained components. A hierarchical cluster analysis was also carried out. The results show that the biggest differences in intermediary determinants of child health are associated with health care before and during delivery. According to child health conditions, the departments grouped differently when compared to the traditional classification by Colombian geographical regions.

AB  - This paper presents the results of the FLUMAGIS project, in which we developed a spatial decision support system (SDSS) to support the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). The modelling approach is based on the integration of ecological and socio-economic assessment methods, scale-specific and GIS-based data and knowledge modelling and visualization techniques. The project study area is the intensively cropped Upper Ems River Basin in north-western Germany. A method was developed that enables the transfer of scale-specific data and information. Analyses were performed for baseline conditions and specific management and planning scenarios to improve water quantity and quality at micro-, meso- and macro-scale. The results of the study indicate that substantial, expensive water and land management changes at different scales would be necessary to achieve the WFD water quality targets in this basin. Ecological-economic analysis of cost-effectiveness reveals that the costs of achieving certain goals of the WFD can vary more than tenfold depending on which measure is chosen out of the pool of management alternatives. Moreover, the study shows that the differentiation between landscapes and other regional characteristics although considered essential to the successful implementation of WFD measures is very data intensive.

AB  - Long-term trends in subtidal macrobenthic communities of the lower Chesapeake Bay, USA, were examined using data collected quarterly (March, June, September and December) fr om 1985 through 1993 at 16 stations along a salinity gradient from tidal freshwater regions of the major tributaries (James, York and Rappahannock rivers) to the polyhaline region of the mainstem of Chesapeake Bay. In March 1989 two stations were added to the program in the mesohaline region of the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River, a region characterized by contaminated sediments. A non-parametric trend analysis procedure was applied to five parameters characterizing macrobenthic community structure: community biomass, species richness, abundance of individuals, proportion of biomass composed of opportunistic species (opportunistic biomass composition) and proportion of biomass composed of equilibrium species (equilibrium biomass composition). A total of 48 trends were detected. No trends were found at stations subjected to hypoxic/anoxic conditions ol at stations with contaminated sediments. Trends in benthic community parameters affected by eutrophication may be difficult to interpret at moderate levels of organic enrichment or sediment contamination. Therefore, trends in functional groups (e.g. opportunistic and equilibrium species) of the benthic community may be the best indicators of the ecological significance of changes in community structure.

AB  - Helicobacter pylori is one of the most frequent human pathogens and a leading etiological agent of various gastric diseases. As stringent response, coordinated by a SpoT protein, seems to be crucial for the survivability of H. pylori, the main goal of this article was to use in silico computational studies to find phytochemical compounds capable of binding to the active site of SpoT from H. pylori and confirm the ability of the most active candidates to interfere with the virulence of this bacterium through in vitro experiments. From 791 natural substances submitted for the virtual screening procedure, 10 were chosen and followed for further in vitro examinations. Among these, dioscin showed the most interesting parameters (the lowest MIC, the highest anti-biofilm activity in static conditions, and a relatively low stimulation of morphological transition into coccoids). Therefore, in the last part, we extended the research with a number of further experiments and observed the ability of dioscin to significantly reduce the formation of H. pylori biofilm under Bioflux-generated flow conditions and its capacity for additive enhancement of the antibacterial activity of all three commonly used antibiotics (clarithromycin, metronidazole, and levofloxacin). Based on these results, we suggest that dioscin may be an interesting candidate for new therapies targeting H. pylori survivability and virulence.

AB  - The increase in demand for food and the need to predict the impact of a warming climate on vegetation makes it critical that the best tools for assessing crop production are found. Chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) has been proposed as a direct indicator of photosynthesis and plant condition. The aim of this paper is to study the feasibility of estimating ChlF from spectral vegetation indices derived from Sentinel-2, in order to monitor crop stress and investigate ChlF changes in response to surface temperatures and meteorological observations. The regressions between thirty three Sentinel-2-derived VIs, and ChlF measured on the ground were evaluated in order to estimate the best predictors of ChlF. The r-Pearson correlation and polynomial linear regression were used. For maize, the highest correlation between ChlF and VIs were found for NDII (r=0.65) and for SIPI (r=-0.68). The weakest relationship between VIs and ChlF were found for sugar beets. Despite this, it should be noted that the highest correlation for sugar beets appeared for EVI (r=0.45) and S2REP (r=0.43). The results of this study indicate the need for a synergy of low and high resolution satellite data that will enable a more detailed analysis for estimating fluorescence and its relation to climatic conditions, environmental aspects, and VIs derived from satellite images.

AB  - Recharge playas are prevalent throughout the hyper-arid southern Negev and Arava Valley of Israel. While some of these playas are terminal, others were found to be not absolutely terminal, allowing, under extreme floods, the outlet of water from their beds to a draining, ephemeral channel. Indicators for ancient to recent-past agricultural practicing were recorded for two playas. In one of them, this included the archaeological remains of seven Byzantine-Age stone terraces across the playa bed, indicating ancient runoff harvesting agriculture. In another playa, the agricultural indicator included observations by key informants who reported the cropping of barley and wheat by Bedouin populations until the mid-1990s. This was supported by rare bibliographic sources, reporting the cropping of cereals at this site by Bedouins during the 1930s and 1940s. Agro-hydrological assessments of seven playas and their catchments were conducted, revealing a marginal agronomic potential under the current climatic conditions and only for a small number of them. The results highlight the profound environmental know-how of local populations that inhabited this harsh region. Furthermore, the results coincide with previous studies, which have reported drier climatic conditions at present compared to those in ancient times, and even compared to those during the mid-1990s.

AB  - The present study aims at investigating the possibility of assessing performance and depuration conditions of an activated sludge wastewater treatment plant through an exploration of the microfauna. The plant, receiving textile industrial (70%) and domestic (30%) sewage, consists of a two-step biological depurating plant, with activated sludge followed by a percolating system. A total of 35 samples were analyzed during five months, and 30 taxa of protozoa and small metazoa were found. Epistylis rotans, Vorticella microstoma, Aspidisca cicada and Arcella sp. were the most frequent protozoa identified. Several significant correlations between biological, physical chemical and operational parameters were determined, but no significant correlations could be established between biological parameters and removal efficiencies. The Sludge Biotic Index (SBI) reflected the overall state of the community but only presented statistically significant correlations with the influent total suspended solids (TSS), total suspended solids in mixed-liquor (MLTSS) and dissolved oxygen (DO). The determination of key groups and taxa along with general community parameters showed to have potential value as indicators of the depuration conditions. Despite the impossibility of correlating biological parameters and the removal efficiencies, the present study attests the value of the microfauna to assess the operation of the activated sludge systems even in the case of non-conventional plants and/or plants receiving industrial sewage.

AB  - Nubian ibex (Capra nubiana) prefer steep terrain in their landscape to reduce risks of predation and human nuisance disturbances. They also use vigilance and time allocation to manage risk of predation. We studied time budgets and habitat selection of Nubian ibex to: (1) identify the habitat variables to which Nubian ibex were behaviorally responsive; (2) investigate how time budget responses of Nubian ibex were related to season, slope condition, group size, and sex-age structure; and (3) develop behavioral-based models that account for the variations in the behaviors of Nubian ibex across the landscape and seasons.
   To quantify time budgets, we took regular field observations on focal individuals of Nubian ibex classified according to their habitat, group size, sex, and age. For each focal observation, we quantified environmental variables that were thought to influence the behavioral responses of ibex. Then, we developed behavioral models by correlating the proportion of behaviors measured in focal animal observations to the influential environmental variables. The behaviors of Nubian ibex significantly varied with sex and age structure, season, habitat type, and slope conditions. Adult females are more vigilant than adult male ibex, especially in the spring. This correlates with breeding and nursing activities. Based on the characteristics of the habitat, ibex behave to minimize risks of predation and human nuisance disturbances while maximizing their food intake.

AB  - Stipa tenacissima L., a perennial tussock grass widely found in semi-arid environments of the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa, is subjected to multiple stresses during the extreme summer conditions of south-east Spain. We characterised the photoprotective mechanisms of S. tenacissima during the transition from spring to summer and autumn. S. tenacissima experienced a marked water deficit (Psi (pd)<-8.4 MPa) and the complete suppression of CO2 assimilation in August, associated with a 72% reduction of maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (F (v)/F (m)). These reduced F (v)/F (m) values were related to the pre-dawn maintenance of high levels of epoxidized forms of xanthophyll-cycle pigments (DPS (pd), ca. 42% higher than spring values), and with a 60% reduction in the concentration of total chlorophyll (Chl a+b). These changes were associated with a low capacity of dissipation of the excitation energy non-radiatively (measured as NPQ). Leaves showed a complete recovery of F (v)/F (m) and xanthophyll and chlorophyll concentrations after the autumn rainfall, which reached levels similar to that of spring. This poikilohydric-type response of S. tenacissima to stress allows for a greater tolerance of water shortage, high temperature and high light intensity, which are typical in these semi-arid environments and accounts for its distinctive opportunistic growth.

AB  - Nine trailer loads of horses (n = 306) transported to slaughter facilities with distances ranging 596 to 2,496 km were studied to characterize the type of horses used in commercial markets and the physiological responses and number of injuries due to transportation under summer environmental conditions. Slaughter horse candidates were middle-aged (11.4 +/- .4 yr), possessed moderately fleshy body condition, weighed 432 +/- 3.3 kg, and were of Quarter Horse or Thoroughbred breeding. The mean weight loss during commercial transport was 4%. The percentage of injured horses was greater (P < .05) for two-tiered "potbelly" (29.2%) compared with straight-deck (8.0%) trailers; however, the stress indicators of cortisol and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio and rectal temperature showed greater (P < .05) responses following transport in straight-deck trailers. As trip duration increased from 5 h 45 min to 30 h, muscle fatigue (lactate concentration) and dehydration (hematocrit and total protein concentration) were the major physiological considerations, especially in durations over 27 h. The percentage of horses injured was less (P < .05) in trailers with 1.14 to 1.31 m(2) of floor area per horse than in trailers with 1.40 to 1.54 m(2) of floor area per horse. However, most physiological responses (white blood cell count, total protein concentration, and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio) to transportation were less (P < .05) in horses provided with the greater floor area.

AB  - Most theoretical models on evolution of male secondary sexual characters and female preferences for these characters suggest that the male characters evolve in response to female preferences that may themselves evolve in response to direct or indirect benefits of choice. In Drosophila montana (a species of the D. virilis group), females use male song in their mate choice, preferring males that produce songs with short sound pulses and a high carrier frequency. Mie demonstrate here that the females get indirect benefits from their choice: in our data the frequency of the male song correlated with the survival rate of the male's progeny from egg to adulthood (indirect benefit for the female), but not with the fecundity of his mating partner (no direct benefit for the female). Male wing centroid asymmetry did not correlate with male wing song characters, nor with female egg production nor the fitness of her progeny, suggesting that fluctuating asymmetry in male wings does not play a major role in sexual signalling. The fact that the male song gives the female information on the male's condition/genetic quality in D. montana suggests that in this species the evolution of female preferences for male song characters could have evolved through condition-dependent viability selection presented in some 'good genes' models.

AB  - An ecopathological study aiming at finding out risk-factors requires preliminary works during a so-called <<instruction phase>>. Their objective is to help the scientist in charge of the project by providing him a good expertise leading further to an adequate protocol for the study. The preliminary works will be focused on the research of descriptors related to the disease or to the syndrome under study. Risk factors hypothesis must be found so they will also describe the animals (age, parity, weight...) and their environment including microbial, feeding, physical aspects and more generally technical data. For this purpose, the analysis of literature is an important step. It gives informations on the main topics that have been explored until now about the disease. But since the epidemiological context might vary considerably from one report to another, it is very useful to undertake new investigations prior to the ecopathological inquiry. These can take the form of experimental trials in controlled facilities (to assess the role of infections agents) and of field observational studies (field cases). The field cases investigations must have pragmatic objectives : Set-up or validate under the present conditions (conditions of the target population) descriptors given by literature. Explore new fields not investigated until now and that might be involved in the disease.
   During this phase, accuracy, reliability, repeatability, and feasability of the descriptors have to be tested. Exemples of such descriptors from the author's experience are given and the usefullness of the requirements is discussed.

AB  - Improving the efficiency of fertilizer application is paramount to both the sustainability and profitability of forest plantations. Therefore, developing reliable, cost-effective tools to assess tree nutritional status is of great interest. This investigation sought to assess the use of phloem sap-derived metabolites as an indicator of nutritional status on a background of seasonal water availability of Eucalyptus globulus (Labill) trees grown under field conditions. Phloem is a central conduit for long-distance transport and signaling in plants and offers great promise in reflecting plant-scale resource limitations. Changes in the abundance of solutes and isotopes in phloem sap are sensitive to environmental cues. With a focus on both water and nutrient availability, we characterize patterns in phloem sugars, amino acids and the abundance of carbon isotopes in phloem sap obtained from E. globulus among different seasons and fertilizer treatments. Phloem-derived total amino acid concentration was found to increase with an increasing nitrogen (N) supply; however, this response was lost with the concurrent addition of phosphorus and at the highest level of N supply. Significant seasonal variation in all measured parameters was also detected, highlighting the need for caution in making quantitative relationships with growth. Broader implications of the interactive effects of both water supply and multi-nutrient additions and relationships with growth are discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this work was to experimentally determine conditional reference demographic indicators of laboratory populations of Daphnia magna Straus (1820). These indicators can be used when determining suitability of the aquaculture for bioassays of aquatic environments. The experiments were carried out with parthenogenetic clones of D. magna, the temperature of the environment was 20 degrees C, the light period was 12 h. It was found that the maximum lifetime of crustaceans is observed in groups with a density of 25 individuals/dm(3). In these groups, other demographic characteristics of D. magna such as the day of the first offspring (10 +/- 2 days), average lifetime (79.7 +/- 1.0 days), specific fertility (74.3 +/- 2.4 days) and other related parameters of well-being were established. Then, it was showed that the culture of D. magna, having the necessary sensitivity to the model toxicant K2Cr2O7, can significantly differ in demographic characteristics from the conventional reference groups. Audit of the conditions of keeping this aquaculture revealed a complex reason for the unsatisfactory state of D. magna: the lack of daily aquaculture care and increased concentration of nitrate ions in the cultivation water. Therefore, regular monitoring of D. magna demographic characteristics can complement procedures of standardization of test-cultures. This will contribute to improving the accuracy of bioassay results.

AB  - The sodium aluminate solution of the evaporation process is provided for the digestion process to recycle useful resources, decrease alkali concentration in waste solution, and reduce environmental pollution. However, the concentration of recycled sodium aluminate solution as an indispensable indicator for manipulating the evaporation process of the industrial alumina production is acquired offline leading to delayed feedback information. To ensure stable production of the subsequent process, reduce energy, and resource consumption, this article focuses on developing a hybrid prediction model for recycled sodium aluminate solution concentration in evaporation process. First, data reconciliation is utilized to improve the quality of material flow information, and the process mechanism model is established through mechanism research and equilibrium principle to obtain the concentration prediction result. Moreover, an industrial production condition analysis as well as fuzzy expert rules, are introduced for modifying prediction results from the mechanism model. Furthermore, the errors are predicted by the kernel extreme learning machine (KELM), and a concentration prediction model integrated error compensation results and modified predictions are established. The experimental simulations and industrial applications show that the accuracy of the prediction error obtained by the proposed model reaches 90% within +/- 2%, and the advantages of the hybrid model are particularly prominent under different conditions, which is beneficial for efficient and clean production.

AB  - Soil moisture is an important factor in soil systems. To examine the effects of a progressive loss of moisture (gradual drought) on the soil oribatid community of two ecosystems (pedunculate oak and holm oak forests), a laboratory experiment was carried out to (1) record changes in abundance, diversity and species composition and (2) determine drought-resistant and drought-sensitive species. In both ecosystems, the maximum values for species abundance were at the beginning of the experiment; by the end of the experiment, only a few species remained. The species that disappeared first were Damaeus onustus, Microppia minus, Suctobelba regia, Suctobelba trigona, Liochthonius brevis, Quadroppia pseudocircumita, Rhinoppia obsoleta and Suctobelbella subcornigera. Those that survived until the end of the experiment were Hermanniella dolosa, Odontocepheus elongatus and Tectocepheus velatus. The progressive rate of water loss (drought) was similar in both experiments. Species richness decreased in drier conditions. The communities remained intact until Day 30, even though the sample water content decreased by 83% in the pedunculate oak and 90.1% in holm oak soils during the first 15days. The species diversity and community balance were altered after 30days as a result of a reduction in numbers of both individuals and species, and the reductions were severe after 45days.

AB  - Snow cover on glacial surfaces is a sensitive environmental indicator. However, it is difficult to differentiate snow cover from a bare ice surface, and snow cover also changes rapidly during the melt season. Monitoring these dynamics requires sufficient time and spatial resolution; thus, traditional satellite data lack the necessary spatial resolution and rarely used to monitoring snow cover on glacier surface, which induced monitoring of snow dynamics on glacier is more challenging. Time-lapse photography has the advantage of obtaining images with high time and spatial resolution. By using an automated time-lapse digital camera, this paper documents two successive years snow cover dynamics on the Shiyi glacier and compared the meteorological conditions which induced different melt conditions. Monitoring indicate that the 2012 melt season experienced a higher snow cover fraction than the 2013 melt season because of a greater accumulated snow depth, lower air temperature and fewer sunlight hours. Successive photographs also indicate that, on the Shiyi glacier, atmospheric dust accelerates the snow melt speed and attenuates the snow depth. For the bare ice surface, the effects of atmospheric dust were reduced because the dusts were composed of Fine particles and are more easily washed away by melt water or rain. Studies on the Shiyi glacier indicate that the snow cover fraction is a key parameter that indicates the status of glacial accumulation or ablation.

AB  - Commonly the atmospheric pollution research is focussed on particulate indicators especially when mutagenicity was studied. On the other hand the volatile and semi-volatile compounds no adsorbed on to the particles can be genotoxic and mutagenic. Moreover some mutagenic compounds, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, are present both in the particulate and in the gas-phase in according to chemical conditions. This work is focussed on the assessing of the total mutagenicity shifting the gas-phase and particulate phase, during two seasons, in Turin. Two sampling sessions are conducted for total particulate matter and gas-phase pollutants. Moreover meteorological and usual air pollution monitoring data were collected at the same sampling station. The Salmonella assay using the strains TA98 and YG1021 was conducted on each organic extract. The mean level of total suspended particles, PM10 and PM2.5 were 73.63 +/- 26.94, 42.85 +/- 26.75 and 31.55 +/- 26.3514 mu g m(-3). The observed mutagenicity was PM induced YG1021 > PM induced TA98 > PM induced TA98+S9 >> non-particle induced YG1021 > non-particle induced TA98 > non-particle induced TA98+S9. The multivariate regression is significant when we consider air pollution and meteorological indicators and chemical conditions as predictors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The study was conducted to assess the status and trends of soil erosion and relate the perceptions of farmers on cattle productivity and botanical indicators to measured ecological conditions of rangelands in three altitude regions of southwest Ethiopia. A total of 342 farmers were interviewed. In addition, the ecological condition of rangelands was assessed. Severe soil erosion, ranked as the primary restriction to free-ranging livestock, occurred predominantly in the lower altitude region (LAR) (P < 0.05). More farmers in LAR witnessed an inadequacy of palatable plant biomass, grazable pasture as well as increased gully formation and expansion, which are strong indicators of soil erosion (P < 0.001). In addition to a decrease in grass cover and productivity of cattle, botanical composition, species richness and grazing capacity of herbaceous plants, less fodder trees and shrubs were observed (P < 0.05). There was a corresponding increase in the percentage of bare ground and soil erosion status along the degradation gradients (P < 0.05). The reported shift in botanical composition, and especially encroachment of invading plant species, can be attributed to soil erosion (P < 0.001). The results suggest that erosion is associated with reduced availability of feed resources and is related to altitude variation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Oxidative stress can take place in marine bivalves under a series of environmental adverse conditions. The study of different systems related to oxidative stress in these organisms can give important information about their physiological status and also about environmental health. Bivalves have been proposed as good sentinel organisms in pollution monitoring studies through the analysis of biochemical biomarkers, and most of the biomarkers analyzed are those related to oxidative stress. However, it is very important to know how other environmental factors not associated to the presence of pollutants might affect these parameters. We have studied a series of mechanisms related to oxidative stress in mussels which inhabit the Brazilian coast, especially in Perna perna species, subjected to different stress conditions, such as the exposure to different contaminants in the laboratory and in the field, the exposure of mussels to air and re-submersion, simulating the tidal oscillations, and in mussels collected at different seasons. Both oxidative damage levels and antioxidant defense systems were strongly affected by the different environmental stress. This review summarizes the data obtained in some studies carried out in bivalves from the Brazilian coast. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The increased attention to biodiversity worldwide has stimulated interest in understanding biophysical factors associated with indicators of biodiversity such as species richness. Although levels of biodiversity may seem to be equivalent in different areas, high species richness may be caused by accumulation of species over a long time in places where environmental conditions remained stable and predictable. The advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR)-normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been established to be a good proxy for studying interannual climate variability as well as regional drought condition. In this study, I examined the relationship between large herbivore species richness and AVHRR-NDVI derived climatic-variability indices, interannual average NDVI and coefficient of variation of NDVI at a regional spatial scale in Kenya. Regions with a relatively low coefficient of variation of NDVI and high interannual average NDVI characterize current ecoclimatic stability. By contrast, a high coefficient of variation of NDVI and relatively low interannual average NDVI characterize ecoclimatic instability (drought risk). Statistical analyses revealed that a high interannual average NDVI increases species richness, whereas a high coefficient of variation of NDVI lowers species richness. This indicates that maximum numbers of species are found in regions with current ecoclimatic stability. Understanding such relationships can help in explaining spatial distribution of species richness and predicting global changes resulting from human impacts on the environment.

AB  - A stratified-random sample of 48 Ohio dairy herds participated in a 1-year disease monitoring survey to study herd management and environmental conditions affecting udder infection and clinical mastitis incidence. The mean monthly bulk-tank somatic cell count was used as an indicator of overall udder infection. Clinical incidence was determined by monthly on-farm interviews with the dairy producers. Management and environmental conditions were assessed by direct observation as well as by personal interview of dairy managers. The final multivariable analysis-of-variance model of log bulk-tank somatic cell count had an R2 value of 0.43. Lower log bulk-tank somatic cell count was found in herds with hired milkers, a clean and dry cow exercise area, clean teats following milking and fewer milking cows. The number of months spent on pasture was also significant. The final model for clinical mastitis incidence had an R2 value of 0.38. Less clinical mastitis was found on farms where straw bedding was used, pre-dip was not used, where there were fewer cows, fewer person-hours per cow were spent milking cows, a greater percentage of calvings occurred in the designated calving facility, and cows spent fewer months per year on pasture. Other potentially important disease determinants could not be included in the final models because of limited sample size relative to the model degrees of freedom (six each).

AB  - Soil salinity is one of the most important abiotic stresses limiting crop growth and production worldwide. Some microorganisms can improve the plants' tolerance to salinity. For this purpose, a greenhouse experiment was performed to understand the influence of various microorganisms on soil biological indices and wheat growth under different saline conditions. The factors varied in the experiment were the microbial treatment (rhizobacteria, mycorrhizal fungi, endophytic fungus, and control) and salinity stress (0.5, 8, and 14 dS m(-1)). Rhizobacteria were isolated from saline soils, but the fungi were prepared from a microbial bank. Overall, ten isolates were purified, and three with promising growth-promoting properties were identified using phenotypic and molecular methods. The selected isolates belonged to the genera Pseudomonas (P. aeruginosa Ur83 and P. fluorescens Ur67) and Stenotrophomonas (S. maltophilia Ur52). Soil quality indices were found to decrease with increasing salinity, but inoculation with microorganisms alleviated this decline. Inoculation with plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs) increased basal respiration, substrate-induced respiration, microbial biomass carbon, acid and alkaline phosphatase activities, and carbon availability by factors of 1.37, 1.27, 1.83, 3.07, 1.29, and 1.11, respectively. These results show that inoculation with symbiotic microorganisms can improve agricultural soil quality under saline conditions and may thus be valuable in agriculture.

AB  - The present research evaluated the antioxidant and anti-apoptotic potentialities of wholepomegranate extract (WPE) on the performance, hemato-biochemical indices, carcass yield, and meat quality of male V-line rabbits under hot summer conditions. For this purpose, 48 weaned, 4-week-old male V-line rabbits were randomly divided into groups of 12 as: group 1 was fed a basal diet (control); and groups 2, 3, and 4 were fed a basal diet supplemented with 1,000 mg/kg (T1), 1,250 mg/kg (T2), and 1,500 mg/kg (T3) of WPE, respectively, for 60 days during the summer. Chromatographic analysis of WPE indicated that syringic acid (SA), vanillic acid and caffeic acid were the predominant flavonoids, while Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) was the major quantified fatty acid. Concerning growth performance, WPE supplementation increased the final rabbit weight gain compared with that of the control. Meat-quality traits that were significantly affected (P < 0.05) by dietary WPE supplementation were tenderness and yellowness. Physiologically, WPE induced high levels of dose-dependent hemoglobin, superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In addition, WPE significantly restricted heat oxidative stress indicators, namely malondialdehyde, aspartate

AB  - Human relations with the forest ecosystem vary greatly according to biophysical, demographic and economic conditions. Understanding the mutual relationships among these conditions can enable a better understanding of their drivers. Therefore, in this study, a forest management unit and the rural population within this unit were examined and the existence of the conflict phenomenon, the mutual relations between the elements possibly causing the conflict, and the dimensions of these relations were investigated. The study found that only 12% of the forest villagers were educated at a middle-school level or higher and only 17% of this section of low-income people worked in forestry activities for additional income. It was determined that the crime awareness level of the villagers engaged in forestry activities was higher than in those who did not work in this sector (X-2 = 30.78; p < 0.05). Moreover, the number of people who were penalized for forest crimes increased in parallel with the need for firewood / wood in their households (X-2 = 9.96; p < 0.05). It was found that by raising the forest villagers' awareness concerning their legal rights, their crime awareness level also increased. (X-2 = 157.46; p < 0.05). As a result, the study revealed that the income and education levels of the forest villagers had a direct effect on forest crime as the main indicator of the conflict between forest villagers and forest management.

AB  - Environmental risk assessment (ERA) and life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) models developed for the assessment of one form of non-ionic organic compounds, here termed species, have gained wide acceptance and use in assessments of chemicals in both ERA and LCIA (single-species approach). However, the aqueous chemistry of metal ions is very different from that of non-ionic organic compounds, since metals speciate into multi-species according to ambient aqueous and geochemical conditions as pH and availability of complexing agents (e.g. dissolved organic matter (DOM), chloride, carbonate). This study demonstrates a new modelling concept being able to perform both single-species assessment (SSA) and multi-species assessment (MSA). By applying multi-species fate modelling, the model has been shown able to account for a change in mobility of metals through coupled regions, caused by complexes formed with ligands such as DOM. It is concluded that single-species models should not be used to characterize the potential ecotoxicological impacts of metals in LCIA. Applying multi-species assessment methods strongly influences the availability of the most bioavailable form-the free metal ion, but it also makes the fate and exposure modelling of metals significantly more dependent on ambient conditions reflecting the very different speciation pattern and behaviour of metals at different sites.

AB  - Our previous results have shown that metabolic and thermal stressors influence interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) metabolic activity by increasing oxygen consumption and, consequently, altering the toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the antioxidative system activity. Since there is not enough evidence about the effect of psychosocial stressors on these processes, we studied the effect of acute crowding stress on the IBAT and hypothalamic monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity as well as IBAT antioxidative enzymes.. manganese (MnSOD), copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) and catalase (CAT), as the relevant indicators of MAT metabolic alternations under the stress exposure and the returning of animals to control conditions. The results indicated that acute crowding stress did not change the hypothalamic and MAT MAO activities, the generation of ROS and, consequently, the MAT CuZnSOD and CAT activities. However, all three antioxidative enzymes were affected only after the recovery period. It seems that peripheral overheating of rats during acute crowding changes the stress nature, by becoming more thermal than psychosocial and by supressing the hypothalamic efferent pathways involved in the IBAT thermogenesis regulation. However, it seems that returning of the animals to the control conditions after the stress termination causes the reactivation of IBAT thermogenesis with tendency to normalise the body temperature.

AB  - Soil organisms play an important role in providing soil stability. Understanding the diversity of soil organisms and their controlling environmental and management factors is essential for sustainable development of ecosystems. We studied the density, frequency and diversity of ground-dwelling arthropods at the family level in an arid to semi-arid shrubland under different management practices. The arthropods were sampled in the 50 x 50 x 25 cm plots and pitfall traps. In total, 167 species were found which belonged to 5 classes, 12 orders and 17 families. The class Insecta included about 60% of all arthropods. The family Formicidae had the highest density in both grazed and ungrazed areas. Shannon-Wiener diversity index was reduced from1.73 in the ungrazed areas to 0.86 in the grazed areas. Non-metric multidimensional scaling showed that Carabidae and Lycosidae were the main diagnostic families between grazed and ungrazed areas. Although there was a positive significant correlation between the vegetation cover and the frequency of most arthropods (p < 0.05), there was no significant correlation between soil properties (soil moisture and bulk density) and the accumulation of the arthropods (p < 0.05). Based on our results, insects are an appropriate bioindicator for monitoring rangelands under different management practices due to their high frequency and sensitivity to environmental and management conditions.

AB  - Development in the modern world is based on innovation. Many scientists are investigating the problem of innovative development. Most researches agree that innovation is the main driving force for economic and society development, solving environmental problems. The transition to an innovative development model is a priority issue for many countries. Ukraine is no exception, in which the national innovation system has just begun to form. This determines the relevance of the research. The aim of the article is to substantiate the methodological approach to assessing the socio-ecological and economic system of the country in the conditions of innovative development. In our opinion, the modern trajectory of innovative development is ensured not only by the presence of a national innovation system, but also by the innovativeness of the all sphere of country's vital activity, the main components of which are the social, ecological and economic systems. The innovativeness of the systems is proposed to be evaluated as an integral indicator, which is calculated of certain indices. The list of indices for economic, social and ecological systems is offered. The EU values with the best result were used as standard. The complex indicator are calculated of integral indicators and allows determining the position of Ukraine in comparison with the EU countries.

AB  - Hydromorphological alterations are among the most widespread anthropogenic pressures in rivers and streams. They comprise channelization, damming, water abstraction etc. resulting in habitats alteration and subsequent changes in aquatic community composition. Aim of this study was to test to what extent hydromorphological alterations influence aquatic macroinvertebrates as one of the best bioindicators to anthropogenic pressures. Our research took place in the Mediterranean part of Croatia. We sampled 40 sites which include perennial rivers varying in catchment size and altitude with similar environmental conditions along river reaches. Large rivers were omitted from this research because of their different functional group representation to the rivers covered used in this study. We used the functional approach to hydromorphological alteration by testing the following traits: reproduction strategy, functional feeding group and microhabitat (substrate type) preference. From the feeding standpoint shredders were the most affected group by hydrological alteration. Moreover, taxa confined to a specific relatively less common habitat e.g. phytal, pelal and lithal were the most negatively affected by morphological degradation due, mostly, to it leading to a homogenization of the substrate. Finally, the smaller and faster reproductive taxa were more resilient to hydromorphological degradation. We found that the functional approach to bioassessment complements the common biocenotical approach, at the same time it may provide sound ecological knowledge.

AB  - Ants are sensitive to habitat change and may be affected by disturbances, such as alien plant invasion. Alien plant invasion is associated with negative effects on the functioning of ecosystems and may have adverse impacts on biodiversity. The aim of this study was to determine the diversity of ground-dwelling ants in Tanglewood and Giba Gorge Reserves in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. Ants were sampled in the wet and dry seasons. Pitfall trap sampling was carried out in an intact grassland, forest and a disturbed grassland. We collected 360 samples resulting in a total of 2,577 occurrences comprising of 54 species. We found that diversity of ants in the two sites was influenced by vegetation type. The intact grassland in the two reserves had greater diversity (40 +/- 4.45) of ants compared with forest (22 +/- 4.86) and disturbed grassland (27 +/- 1.15); however, the disturbed grassland supported higher ant occurrences (50.03 +/- 31.6). Opportunists represented the most diverse functional group with 17 species followed by specialist predators with 13 species and generalised Myrmicinae with 10 species. These results suggest that grassland disturbance by alien plant invasion provides suitable environmental conditions that may increase ant occurrences but decrease ant diversity.

AB  - Annually laminated lake sediments provide high-resolution and accurate timescales for reliable paleoenvironmental reconstructions. We investigated human activity in a low-human-impact region of Poland, taking advantage of varved sediments from Lake Szurpily, which span the last 8200 years. Multiple sediment variables indicated that catchment evolution and lacustrine responses, mainly to changes in forest cover, were divided into four phases. Because of sparse or only seasonal occupation of settlements in NE Poland, human impact in the region was insignificant until ca. 939 +/- 55 BC (lacustrine phase I). During Phase II (939 +/- 55 BC-AD 1392 +/- 38), we recorded an increase in human indicators, reflecting the direct influence of a Yatvingian community. Afterwards, between AD 1392 +/- 38 and 1770 +/- 30 (phase III), permanent settlements and agricultural land use stabilized. The beginning of the last period (phase IV) was clearly identified by all sediment variables, which responded simultaneously to local human activities. Disappearance of laminae from AD 1858 +/- 22 until about AD 1997 indicated disturbance of pre-existing, stable depositional conditions, followed by environmental recovery in the last 20 years. Such recovery may have been related to recent socio-economic changes and establishment of a park that reduced human influence on the lake.

AB  - Devices that condense and disinfect water vapour to provide chilled drinking water in office environments, so-called 'air water generators' (AWGs), are being marketed as environmentally friendly alternatives to the traditional bottled water cooler. We sought to examine this claim.
   The approach adopted was a preliminary life cycle assessment with performance indicators for the use of energy and water and the emission of greenhouse gases. We compared an AWG with its main market competitor, the traditional bottled water cooler and a simple refrigerator containing a jug of water. Modelling was based on Australian conditions and energy supply. To manage possible scope uncertainty, we borrowed the idea of 'triangulation' as defined in the social sciences.
   We found that without a renewable energy supply, the claim of environmental superiority is not supported by quantitative analysis. For each indicator, the AWG's score was typically two to four times higher than the alternatives. Energy consumption was the key issue driving all three indicators.
   Considering the principal environmental issues related to these systems, air-to-water machines significantly underperform bottled water coolers. A simple refrigerator has the capacity to perform multiple functions and therefore outperform both the bottled and atmospheric water options once allocation of burdens is considered. These conclusions are supported by all three perspectives examined to manage uncertainty.

AB  - Increasing soil salinization of arable land has a major impact on the global ecosystem. One approach to increase the usable global forest area is to develop transgenic trees with higher tolerance to conditions of salt stress. An allene oxide cyclase homolog, mangrin, contains a core protein domain that enhances the salt tolerance of its host. We utilized this feature to develop improved salt-tolerant eucalyptus trees, by using transgenic Eucalyptus camaldulensis carrying the mangrin gene as a model. Since the Japanese government requires an environmental biosafety assessment for the surrounding biosphere, we performed experiments on trees grown in a special netted-house. This study examined the transgenic E. camaldulensis carrying the mangrin gene to assess the feasibility of using these transformants, and assessed their salt tolerance and environmental biosafety. We found that seven of 36 transgenic genotypes had significantly higher salt tolerance than non-transformants, and more importantly, that these plants had no significant impact on environmental biosafety. These results suggest that introduction of the mangrin gene may be one approach to safely enhance salt tolerance in genetically modified Eucalyptus species, and that the transformants have no apparent risks in terms of environmental biosafety. Thus, this study provides valuable information regarding the use of transgenic trees in situ.

AB  - Sustainability Impact Assessment (SIA) of economic, environmental, and social effects triggered by governmental policies has become a central requirement for policy design. The three dimensions of SIA are inherently intertwined and subject to trade-offs. Quantification of trade-offs for policy decision support requires numerical models in order to assess systematically the interference of complex interacting forces that affect economic performance, environmental quality, and social conditions. This paper investigates the use of computable general equilibrium (CGE) models for measuring the impacts of policy interference on policy-relevant economic, environmental, and social (institutional) indicators. We find that operational CGE models used for energy-economy-environment (E3) analyses have a good coverage of central economic indicators. Environmental indicators such as energy-related emissions with direct links to economic activities are widely covered, whereas indicators with complex natural science background such as water stress or biodiversity loss are hardly represented. Social indicators stand out for very weak coverage, mainly because they are vaguely defined or incommensurable. Our analysis identifies prospects for future modeling in the field of integrated assessment that link standard E3-CGE-models to themespecific complementary models with environmental and social focus.

AB  - Controversy has arisen concerning the likelihood of adverse health effects due to exposure to hormonally active agents or endocrine modulators such as environmental estrogens. With the aim to improve the basis for their toxicological evaluation, several chemicals of anthropogenic (bisphenol A, octylphenol, o,p'-DDT) and of natural origin (daidzein, genistein) were investigated with regard to their mode of hormonal action and potency as well as toxicokinetics. Experimental toxicodynamic and toxicokinetic data illustrate important points in a comparative assessment of environmental estrogens. A novel concept, the Hygiene-Based Margine of Safety (HBMOS), has been suggested to characterize the relative impact of these potential endocrine modulators on human health: It integrates exposure scenarios (i.a. those generated within the European Existing Chemicals Programme) and in vivo rodent potency data for xenoestrogens and for dietary phytoestrogens. On the basis of these informations, HBMOS values calculated for the alkylphenol and bisphenol A appear sufficiently high to ensure the absence of a practical risk to human health under the present exposure conditions. For slowly accumulating compounds (e.g. DDT) with much longer half-lifes than isoflavones, such comparison should be based on comparative blood levels rather than on scenarios of daily exposures.

AB  - The levels and the cellular distribution of heavy metals, and the extent by which the metals binds to metallothionein (MT) in brown trout (Salmo trutta) and European eel (Anguilla anguilla), were analyzed in order to assess the natural conditions of MT and heavy metals in these two fish species. There were no differences in heavy metals and MT concentrations between males and females of brown trout in a nonreproductive status and between adult brown trout individuals. Brown trout presented higher Cu content than European eel. The cellular distribution of Cu was also different between the two fish species; while in brown trout most of the Cu was in the noncytosolic fraction, Cu was mainly located in the cytosol in European eel. However, the cellular distribution of Zn, Cd, and Pb was similar in the two fish species. There was also an important difference in the metal content of MT between both species. Whereas, in brown trout, Cu-binding MT represented 75% of total metal-binding MT, this value was 25% in European eel. The between-species differences found in this study are intrinsic characteristics not associated with environmental factors, These results establish the basis to use MT as a bioindicator.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine which environmental variables are responsible for modern benthic chironomid distributions in a glacial setting. The chironomid communities from nine alpine lakes were assessed, and forty-three individual taxa were extracted and identified. Surface water temperature and nitrate were strongly and negatively correlated (-0.82, p = 0.007), suggesting that glacial meltwater (the driver that explains both surface water temperature (SWT) (degrees C) and nitrate (NO3 + NO2-N)) is the environmental variable that explains the most variance (15%). On average, lakes receiving glacial meltwater were 2.62 degrees C colder and contained 66% more NO3 + NO2-N than lakes only receiving meltwater from snow. The presence of taxa from the tribe Diamesinae indicates very cold input from running water, and these taxa may be used as a qualitative indicator species for the existence of glacial meltwater within a lake catchment. Heterotrissocladius, Diamesa spp., and Pseudodiamesa were present in the coldest lakes. Chironomus, Diplocladius, and Protanypus were assemblages found in cold lakes affiliated with the littoral zone or alpine streams. The modern benthic chironomid communities collected from the alpine of subalpine lakes of Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, represent a range of climatic and trophic influences and capture the transition from cold oligotrophic lakes to warmer and eutrophic conditions.

AB  - Business activity has become one of the most common types of social and economic activity of the population. The culture of business which takes place in modern Russian conditions largely determines the nature of the moral norms of other social groups. The problem of studying the peculiarities of the moral and ethical priorities of businessmen becomes rauther actual. The aim of this study is to analyze the main tendencies in the formation of the orientations of Russian businessmen to the priority of social responsibility principles in economic behavior. The article made the following conclusions. By the mid-2010s, the need to implement the principles of social responsibility in business, capable of positively influencing not only the growth of economic indicators of a business, but also giving it a social orientation that strengthens the basic foundations of society, became strongly pronounced in Russian society. An increasing number of businessmen declare their commitment to the principles of social responsibility, apply them in their economic activities as a necessary condition for effective management and successful development of the enterprise. This tendency indicates a gradual transformation of the value orientations of businessmen, a change in their perceptions about the nature and goals of business, its public purpose, which leads to the formation of a renewed business culture aimed at prioritizing social values.

AB  - Pollinators in agroecosystems are often exposed to pesticide mixtures. Even at low concentrations, the effects of these mixtures on bee populations are difficult to predict due to potential synergistic interactions. In this paper, we orally exposed newly emerged females of the solitary bee Osmia bicornis to environmentally realistic levels of clothianidin (neonicotinoid insecticide) and propiconazole (fungicide), singly and in combination. The amount of feeding solution consumed was highest in bees exposed to the neonicotinoid, and lowest in bees exposed to the pesticide mixture. Ovary maturation and longevity of bees of the neonicotinoid and the fungicide treatments did not differ fromthose of control bees. By contrast, bees exposed to the pesticide mixture showed slow ovary maturation and decreased longevity. We found a synergistic interaction between the neonicotinoid and the fungicide on survival probability. We also found an interaction between treatment and emergence time (an indicator of physiological condition) on longevity. Longevity was negatively correlated to physiological condition only in the fungicide and the mixture treatments. Delayed ovary maturation and premature death imply a shortened nesting period (highly correlated to fecundity in Osmia). Our findings provide a mechanism to explain the observed dynamics of solitary bee populations exposed to multiple chemical residues in agricultural environments.

AB  - The estimation of pesticide concentrations in surface water bodies is a critical component of the environmental risk assessment process required by regulatory agencies in North America, the European Union, and elsewhere. Pesticide transport to surface waters via deposition from off-field spray drift can be an important route of potential contamination. The spatial orientation of treated fields relative to receiving water bodies make prediction of off-target pesticide spray drift deposition and resulting aquatic estimated environmental concentrations (EECs) challenging at the watershed scale. The variability in wind conditions further complicates the simulation of the environmental processes leading to pesticide spray drift contributions to surface water. This study investigates the use of the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for predicting concentrations of malathion (O, O-deimethyl thiophosphate of diethyl mercaptosuccinate) in a flowing water body when exposure is a result of off-target spray drift, and assesses the model's performance using a parameterization typical of a screening-level regulatory assessment. Six SWAT parameterizations, each including incrementally more site-specific data, are then evaluated to quantify changes in model performance. Results indicate that the SWAT model is an appropriate tool for simulating watershed scale concentrations of pesticides resulting from off-target spray drift deposition. The model predictions are significantly more accurate when the inputs and assumptions accurately reflect application practices and environmental conditions. Inclusion of detailed wind data had the most significant impact on improving model-predicted EECs in comparison to observed concentrations.

AB  - Miscanthus is emerging as a potential bioenergy crop because of its high yield and ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, there is a lack of data on harvesting machinery performance for the USA conditions, and influence of yield on harvesting cost and fuel consumption. This study quantified performance of a mower-conditioner and a large square baler for Illinois conditions, and investigated influence of yield on fuel consumption and harvesting costs. To calculate performance parameters, a field area was segmented from which a bale was formed. Then in the segmented field area, yield and machine performance parameters were determined. The mower-conditioner's field capacity was 1.8 ha h(-1), and diesel consumption was 19.2 L ha(-1). The baler's field capacity was 1.4 ha h(-1), and diesel consumption was 19.7 L ha(-1). The mowing cost was 4.8 $ Mg-1, and baling cost was 6.8 $ Mg-1. An inverse correlation (R-2 = 0.62) was found between miscanthus yield and harvesting cost ($ Mg-1), and a direct correlation (R-2 = 0.67) was found between miscanthus yield and fuel consumption (L ha(-1)). It is expected that this study would help in more accurate assessment of environmental impact and economic feasibility of miscanthus, and may lead to further studies for quantifying crop yield and machine performance interactions.

AB  - Principles of statistical sampling design were used to guide refinement of a 30-year multispecies fishery-independent diver visual survey of population abundance and size structure of more than 250 exploited and non-target fishes in the Florida coral reef ecosystem. Reef habitat features and no-take marine reserves (NTMRs) were used to partition the 885 km(2) sampling domain into sub-areas (or strata) to control the variation of fish density. For the period 1999-2008, survey precision of population density and abundance (CV, coefficient of variation, ratio of standard error to mean) ranged from 7% to 20% for the majority of 13 primary exploited species in the Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas regions. Population sustainability metrics like species average length in the exploited life stage were comparable between our fishery-independent survey and fishery-dependent catch-sampling. The survey design also performed well for non-target fishes, yielding CVs between 6% and 15% for population density for the majority of 36 species. Sampling efficiency was improved over time via an iterative learning process by which past survey data was used to refine the stratification and allocation schemes of future surveys. We show how survey data are used to support multispecies stock assessments, evaluate the effectiveness of NTMRs, and assess ecosystem condition for the reef fish community. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Metasequoia was widely distributed across the mid and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere during the Cretaceous, and experienced range contraction associated with Tertiary climatic cooling and drying. We compile occurrences of Metasequoia from the literature, museum collections and new localities, and plot them in a plate tectonic framework to document these range changes through time. We note two pulses of range contraction: Eocene-Oligocene associated with cooling at high latitudes, and Late Miocene-Pliocene associated with cooling and drying in mid latitudes. Only the northern limit of the taxon's range changed during these intervals. Because of its apparent climate sensitivity, Metasequoia might be used to reconstruct palaeoclimate. To test this hypothesis, we assemble the climatic tolerances of living Metasequoia glyptostroboides under natural and cultivated conditions and compare them with palaeoclimate reconstructions across the genus' former range. The fossil record of Metasequoia shows that ancient members of the genus regenerated under similar conditions to those preferred by living M. glyptostroboides (mean annual temperature of 9-17 degrees C and mean annual precipitation of 953-2039 mm). However, some data suggest that early Tertiary representatives may have tolerated mean annual temperatures as high as 20-22 degrees C. Thus, the climate tolerance of Metasequoia appears to have evolved little since the Cretaceous, suggesting that it has potential as a palaeoclimate indicator when used in coordination with other climate proxies. However, Metasequoia alone cannot provide great precision. (C) 2007 The Linnean Society of London.

AB  - Mangroves are the dominant coastal vegetation in tropical estuaries and host a large diversity of brachyuran crabs. Crab larvae have adapted to dynamic hydrological conditions in estuaries using several physiological and behavioral strategies. Changes in crab larval assemblages can be monitored in time in order to detect ecological changes occurring within estuaries. For this study, we sampled quarterly crab larval assemblages in two sub-estuaries (Salado and Churute) of the Gulf of Guayaquil (GG) during 2016-2017. The largest community dissimilarities occurred between sub-estuaries, with Salado having higher morphological diversity and larval densities than Churute. Temporal patterns were only evident within each sub-estuary, and in relation to total and individual morpho-species density values. Ocypodidae larvae were dominant across samples; with zoea I of the red mangrove crab (Ucides occidentalis) showing maximal density values during spring tides. Hydrological parameters (i.e., turbidity, conductivity, salinity and temperature) contributed to only 19% of the variability in biota, demonstrating that crab larvae are physiologically adapted to a wide range of water conditions. This study established an ecological baseline for future studies using crab larval assemblages in the assessment of ecological changes occurring in mangrove tidal creeks of the GG. However, longer time series monitoring data and description of new species and stages of crab larvae are necessary to better assess potential future changes. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Littered waste is a severe environmental problem. Although there have been many studies on wastes littered in the environments like beaches and seas, there is insufficient information on littered wastes in the urban settings. In this research, employing visual survey by the field litter counts method, littered wastes in six urban land uses in Qazvin, Iran were studied. The results showed that administrative and recreational land uses, by an average of 5.22 and 9.59 items per 100 m, respectively, had the lowest pollution, while low-density commercial land use had the maximum pollution by 185.96 items per 100 m. Urban littered waste ratios were not the same in various land uses: cigarette waste and paper and cardboard accounted for higher than 80% of the whole littered wastes in most studied land uses. The cigarette butt was also the most frequently litter in the city. In terms of environmental status, administrative and recreational areas can be defined as places with good conditions, while low-density commercial land use had bad conditions. Consequently, urban land use was acknowledged as a significant factor in the density of littered waste. More attention to cleaning the commercial land use to reduce the density of littered waste, and also finding methods to decrease littering waste by citizens, is a need in urban environment.

AB  - Modified nano-carbon adsorbents have been employed in the immobilization of heavy metals in soil due to their good adsorption capabilities regarding metal ions. However, an assessment of their risks has not been extensively performed with soil organisms. To assess the toxic effects of three types of modified nano-carbon black (CB) on soil organisms, a laboratory test was conducted to expose the earthworm Eisenia fetida to artificial soil supplemented with 5% H2SO4-, HNO(3)(-)and KMnO4-modified nano-CB (SCB, NCB and KCB, respectively) under turfgrass growing conditions. The tested earthworms were systematically investigated for survival, biomass and the activities of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT). SCB and NCB were found to be more toxic and ecologically dangerous to E. fetida because significant decreases in biomass and survival were observed after 35-and 60-d exposures and the survival rate showed a tendency to decrease with exposure duration. The activities of SOD, CAT and POD were inhibited in all treatments with modified nano-CBs at 35 and 60-d, which indicated that oxidative stress was induced by modified nano-CBs. The results suggest that there is potential harm to earthworms in soil with 5% modified nano-CB and that it deserves special attention. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Indicators of forest site productivity may exhibit considerable spatial and temporal variability that should be considered in sustainable forest management. It is generally assumed that natural site conditions and, in turn, site productivity changes gradually and predictably. Our review illustrates many exceptions to this paradigm. Consequently, uni-dimensional productivity indicators such as the commonly used site index (estimated based on stand height) is not always sufficient to characterize site productivity for apparently homogeneous forest stands. To alleviate this problem, we suggest a hierarchical procedure for the estimation of forest site productivity including site mapping, unthinned reference stands (against which to measure growth performance) and adaptive modelling. The level and detail at which site mapping should be conducted (region, forest, management unit or subunit), depends on the objective (research vs. operational forestry), forest type and expected deviations in site productivity estimates compared with the cost of site mapping. Unthinned reference plots should preferably be maintained in the long term and the number of plots should increase with increasing site or stand heterogeneity (for homogeneous land we recommend one plot in 10 ha, two in 100 ha, etc.). With adaptive modelling site specific parameters can be updated at any time when new information has become available. Finally, the review indicates a need to re-define traditional measurement procedures to achieve a contemporary and rational statistical basis for the estimation of site productivity.

AB  - Coal is the world's largest energy source for electricity generation and is mined on 6 continents. Sulfate contamination of surface and ground water from these mining and processing operations is well recognized and commonly monitored as a primary indicator of coal mining impact to surface water and groundwater. However, under conditions frequently found in natural waters, especially groundwater, sulfate can be reduced by naturally occurring sulfate-reducing bacteria, creating hydrogen sulfide. As many communities that are adjacent to these operations rely on groundwater as their primary potable water source, this hydrogen sulfide gas is a largely unrecognized contaminant. Recently, investigators have found connection between coal production and negative health consequences, including increased risk of respiratory diseases (Hendryx and Ahern, in Am. J. Public Health 98(4): 669-671, 2008). Hydrogen sulfide is a contaminant associated with the same types of toxic effects as those found at increased prevalence in mining communities. This study of the central Appalachia region of the U. S. finds that when drinking water aquifers are contaminated, sulfide is liberated as a gas during domestic water use, creating conditions in coalfield homes where short-term and long-term exposures can exceed applicable health standards. Our investigation finds that this occurs at a concentration and frequency that warrants recognition by regulatory agencies and is monitored as commonly occurring mining-related contamination and a potential public health hazard.

AB  - The developmental stress hypothesis posits that the honesty of bird song is maintained by costs incurred during development, rather than at the time of adult song production. Song is learned, and the neural systems underlying song learning and production develop early in life at a time when nutritional and other stressors are prominent. Thus, adult song may reflect the early developmental conditions of a male and/or how well that male was able to cope with developmental stressors. Substantial evidence in support of the developmental stress hypothesis has accrued over the last decade, but much remains to be done. Here, we review the current evidence in support of the hypothesis and highlight future directions. With few exceptions, there is now solid evidence that a variety of developmental stressors impair development of song and the brain. We note that birdsong is potentially an example of a larger class of sexually-selected indicators of developmental conditions. Future issues include examining the effects of stress on females, resolving whether song indicates developmental stability or developmental environment, exploring the neuroendocrine mechanisms by which stress modifies song development, determining whether stressed birds are subject to phenotypic programming, and determining the effects of stressors on song in adult birds. The developmental stress hypothesis thus provides a rich framework for future integrative studies of birdsong and development.

AB  - A quantitative approach for calculation of the percentage of water of domestic wastewater origin in contaminated water wells is presented. The article is an extension of a reported approach to quantify leakage from a wastewater recharge facility to nearby water wells pumping predominantly from a pristine aquifer. The relative contamination from a specific source, a wastewater recharge basin, and the contamination from unspecified domestic wastewater sources under near steady state conditions are calculated for several water wells in the vicinity of a wastewater recharge system. Carbamazepine (CBZ), an antiepileptic drug whose refractory behaviour was reported before is evaluated as a tracer. It is demonstrated that CBZ fulfils the requirements of source-specific as well as non-specific wastewater tracer, under Israeli conditions. In addition to being biodegradation-resistant, a survey of the effluents of domestic wastewater treatment plants in Israel revealed that the CBZ level is roughly constant, 1407 +/- 204 ng/L in a wide range of water treatment facilities all over Israel. As such, at least for specific sites (e.g. Israel) CBZ can be used as a quantitative tracer for estimation of the fraction of effluent-originated water in water wells, and the uncertainty involved in such estimates can be calculated.

AB  - Different conditions (water level, oxygen supply) prevailing in both beds of the Kodijarve double-bed horizontal subsurface flow (HSSF) constructed wetland (CW) (Southern Estonia; constructed in 1996, total area 312.5 M2, 40 pe) provide the opportunity to compare how different operational methods have altered the efficiency of the purification processes inside the HSSF CW. In summer 2002 a vertical subsurface flow (VSSF) CW (total area 37.4 M2) was added as the first stage of the system. Data from 18 sampling wells installed in Kodijarve HSSF CW from two periods is compared: I st period - January 2000-April 2002 (before the VSSF CW was built); 2nd period -October 2002-December 2004 (after the construction of the VSSF filter). The VSSF CW has remarkably improved aerobic conditions in both beds of the HSSE Apart from total phosphorus concentrations in the right bed and nitrate nitrogen concentrations in the outflow of both beds, all of the water quality indicators (dissolved oxygen, total suspended solids, biological oxygen demand, ammonia nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, total nitrogen and total iron) improved after the construction of the VSSF filter. Typically, purification processes in the HSSF CW were dependent on oxygen supply, which was partly influenced by the water level inside the filter beds. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Trichoptera have been utilised infrequently in palaeoecological studies despite their value as environmental indicators of freshwater habitat structure and quality, via their aquatic larvae, and catchment macroclimate conditions, via the aerial adults. Two sites, dated ca. 11 600 C-14 yr BP, in the middle reaches of the River Trent (England) supported caddisfly (Trichoptera) assemblages indicative of a dynamic braided river with extensive floodplain development. At the first, Barrow-upon-Trent, the caddisfly assemblage was dominated by taxa indicative of a medium to large gravel-bed river (Lepidostoma hirtum, Micrasema setiferum and taxa from the family Hydropsychidae). At the second site, Hemington, the caddisfly fauna was dominated by taxa from the families Limnephilidae and Phryganeidae. These usually occur in slow flowing and standing waters and are indicative of cut-off channels on the floodplain. Micrasema setiferum does not occur in the contemporary UK fauna and has a modern distribution across central Europe and Fennoscandia. A gridded climatology extracted for those geographical areas where M. setiferum occurs today indicated a greater degree of continentality than currently prevailing in the Trent catchment. The value of Trichoptera in palaeoecological studies is explored and a model of channel evolution for the River Trent is presented based on caddisfly data. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The stratigraphic architecture and recent evolution of two late Holocene prodeltas (Guadalquivir and Guadalhorce rivers) from the south of Spain are compared on the basis of a high-resolution seismic stratigraphic analysis. These sedimentary bodies display a similar internal architecture, being characterised by a thin transgressive systems tract at their bases and an overlying thick, wedge-shaped highstand systems tract (HST). The internal structure of the HST deposits shows the repetition of two progradational/aggradational cycles, whose generation seems to be related to the influence of high-frequency climatic changes during the last 6-7 ka. Those changes probably involved small amplitude (< 3=1 m) sea-level oscillations and associated changes of sediment supply, conditioning the development of delta switching processes. Small differences in the distribution and characteristics of the seismic units in each area are attributed to local factors, such as physiography of the coastal plains, the wave climate and increased sediment supplies conditioned by anthropic actions.

AB  - Determining effective strategies for mitigating surface ozone (O-3) pollution requires knowledge of the relative ambient concentrations of its precursors, NOx, and VOCs. The space-based tropospheric column ratio of formaldehyde to NO2 (FNR) has been used as an indicator to identify NOx-limited versus NOx-saturated O-3 formation regimes. Quantitative use of this indicator ratio is subject to three major uncertainties: (1) the split between NOx-limited and NOx-saturated conditions may shift in space and time, (2) the ratio of the vertically integrated column may not represent the near-surface environment, and (3) satellite products contain errors. We use the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model to evaluate the quantitative utility of FNR observed from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument over three northern midlatitude source regions. We find that FNR in the model surface layer is a robust predictor of the simulated near-surface O-3 production regime. Extending this surface-based predictor to a column-based FNR requires accounting for differences in the HCHO and NO2 vertical profiles. We compare four combinations of two OMI HCHO and NO2 retrievals with modeled FNR. The spatial and temporal correlations between the modeled and satellite-derived FNR vary with the choice of NO2 product, while the mean offset depends on the choice of HCHO product. Space-based FNR indicates that the spring transition to NOx-limited regimes has shifted at least a month earlier over major cities (e.g., New York, London, and Seoul) between 2005 and 2015. This increase in NOx sensitivity implies that NOx emission controls will improve O-3 air quality more now than it would have a decade ago.
   Plain Language Summary Surface ozone has adverse effects on public health, agriculture, and ecosystems. As a pollutant that is not directly emitted, ozone forms from two classes of precursors: oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). We use satellite observations of formaldehyde (HCHO, a marker of VOCs) and NO2 (a marker of NOx) to identify areas that would benefit more from reducing NOx emissions (NOx-limited) versus reducing VOC emissions (VOC-limited). We use a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) to develop a set of threshold values for HCHO/NO2 that separate the NOx-limited and VOC-limited conditions. Satellite instruments do not measure the ground level concentrations but instead the vertical column density of the air above the surface. We use GEOS-Chem to link the column HCHO/NO2 with ground level HCHO/NO2. Combining model-derived threshold values with a decadal record of satellite observations, we find that major cities over northern midlatitude source regions (e.g., New York, London, and Seoul) show increasingly longer NOx-limited ozone chemistry in the warm season. This trend reflects the NOx emission controls implemented over the past decade. Increasing NOx sensitivity implies that regional NOx emission control programs will improve ozone air quality more now than it would have a decade ago.

AB  - There is growing interest in the use of canopy temperature to evaluate the water status of crops for irrigation water management. One of the main indicators currently used is the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI). In this index, the canopy temperature is normalized by the environmental conditions to account for the evaporative demand of the atmosphere. The theoretical framework, based on the Penman-Monteith equation, defined the CWSI as one minus the ratio between actual and potential water use (Jackson a al., 1981). For the first time in tree crops, we have related the actual transpiration of almond trees measured with heat-pulse sap flow probes with the CWSI, calculated using an empirical Non-Water Stress Baseline. The relationship obtained between the CWSI and the relative transpiration fitted the theoretical relationship, although it showed a large scatter (R-2 = 0.69; RMSE = 0.13). The variability in micrometeorological conditions among different parts of the canopy, the scatter of the NWSB, or inherent measurement errors are identified as probable causes of this scatter. Finally, the effect of this scatter on the accurate assessment of actual transpiration from canopy temperature is analyzed for practical irrigation management purposes. We found an error of about 10% in the relative transpiration, which seems acceptable for irrigation management applications.

AB  - In social species, conspecific outsiders present various threats to groups and their members. These out-group threats are predicted to affect subsequent within-group interactions (e.g., affiliation and aggression) and individual behavior (e.g., foraging and vigilance decisions). However, experimental investigations of such consequences are rare, especially in natural conditions. We used field-based call playbacks and fecal presentations on habituated wild dwarf mongooses (Helogale parvula)-a cooperatively breeding, territorial species-to examine postinteraction responses to the simulated threat of a rival group. Dwarf mongooses invested more in grooming of groupmates, foraged closer together, and more regularly acted as sentinels (a raised guard) after encountering indicators of rival-group presence compared to control conditions. These behavioral changes likely arise from greater anxiety and, in the case of increased vigilance, the need to seek additional information about the threat. The influence of an out-group threat lasted at least 1 h but individuals of different dominance status and sex responded similarly, potentially because all group members suffer costs if a contest with rivals is lost. Our results provide field-based experimental evidence from wild animals that out-group threats can influence within-group behavior and decision making, and suggest the need for greater consideration of the lasting impacts of social conflict.

AB  - Microwave fracturing has been proposed as an alternative approach to stimulate coalbed methane reservoirs as it is environmentally friendly, widely applicable and economical. Different microwave parameters (microwave power and treatment time) and saturation conditions of coal have great effect on the microwave heating effect, which further results in different microwave fracturing effects. In this study, repeated nuclear magnetic resonance experiments and quantitative analysis were performed to investigate the effects of microwave power, irradiation time and saturation condition on microstructure development of coal. Three indicators including macropore and fissure proportion variation (MFPV), variation rate of water porosity (VRWP) and moisture loss were proposed to evaluate microwave's effect on pore structure. It was found that the pore size, water porosity and moisture loss increase with rising microwave power and irradiation time. Microwave's effect on coal sample with saturations ranged from 0% to 100% was first studied in this paper. The results show that microwave irradiation has great effect on pore structure of coal samples when water saturation is less than 25% and becomes insignificant when the water saturation is larger than 50%. Surface topography measurements and SEM experiments were also performed before and after microwave treatment to observe the microstructure development. New fissures and cracks were observed on the surface of samples and the surface become smooth with less accumulated particles after microwave irradiation.

AB  - Intercropping Persian walnut (Juglans regia L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) have been widely applied in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in Northwest China as a means of reducing soil and water losses and improving both land-use efficiency and economic returns. To understand how changes in soil conditions and nematode community structure can contribute to the evaluation of wheat-walnut intercropping systems from the view of soil fauna, we studied the soil nematode community in wheat rhizosphere soil under both monoculture and intercropping systems for 2 years. The results showed that the pH and total nitrogen and organic matter contents in intercropping systems with walnut trees were decreased compared with those of system with wheat alone. The nematode communities differed significantly between intercropping and monoculture plots, e.g., Rhabditis and Dorylaimus were dominant only in monocultures, whereas Tylenchus was dominant only in intercropping systems. Moreover, intercropping systems resulted in decreased nematode abundance, increased proportions of plant-feeding nematodes, and decreased omnivores/predators, particularly in the second year (2012). The decrease in diversity indices (H') and ecological indices (WI, EI, and SI) of the nematode communities indicated high disturbance and low soil fertility in intercropping systems. Overall, wheat intercropping with walnut had a significant negative effect on wheat rhizosphere soil conditions.

AB  - This paper attempts to benchmark the municipal solid waste (MSW) management performance of the NUTS 2-regions in the EU by constructing a composite indicator. In order to account for commensurability, weighting and aggregation issues of the performance indicators in regional waste and materials' management, this paper advocates a conditional directional distance version of the Benefit-of-the-Doubt weighting technique. In addition, the waste management hierarchy defined by the EU is strongly embedded in the construction of our composite indicator. The results reveal considerable differences in the aggregate performance of the regions, even within Member States. In general, waste sectors of the NUTS 2-regions in Austria, Belgium, and Germany generally do well in terms of MSW management. Our results also reveal that some differences in the operating environment of the regions, such as the number of tourist overnight stays, are related to the aggregate performance of the regions. However, the observation that other conditions are not significantly related to the performance on a regional level is interesting as many policy makers frequently argue that the level of performance in their regions cannot be compared to that in other regions precisely due to this difference in operating conditions.

AB  - We use theories of risk allocation to inform trade-offs between foraging in a rich and risky habitat versus using a poor but safe alternative. Recent advances in the theory predict that the length of exposure to good or bad conditions governs risk allocation, and thus habitat choice, when patterns of environmental risk are autocorrelated in time. We investigate the effects of these factors with controlled experiments on a small soil arthropod (Folsomia candida). We subjected animals to nine temporally autocorrelated 16-day feeding treatments varying in both the proportion (0.25, 0.50, and 0.75) and duration (short, medium and long intervals) of time when food was present and absent. We assessed foraging trade-offs by the animals' choice of occupying a risky dry habitat with food (rich) versus a safe moist habitat with no food (poor). Irrespective of autocorrelation in conditions, the proportion of time spent with no food primarily determined habitat selection by these collembolans. Our results imply an energetic threshold below which F. candida are forced to forage in rich and risky habitat despite the possibility of mortality through desiccation. The link to energetic thresholds suggests the possibility of employing state-dependent habitat selection as a leading indicator of habitat change.

AB  - During the last years the worldwide legal framework has stimulated the biofuel development, causing their production and use to be exhaustively studied. Biodiesel has been mostly produced in European countries, but the agronomic potential of the Latin-American countries has led the effort toward the biodiesel production, via regulations. This is the case of Colombia, where the oil palm has been exploited as the major biodiesel feedstock. The acts, laws and regulations indicate the mandatory expansion of biodiesel usage. Nonetheless, the laws do not explain the way in that those expansion targets will be done. In this work, the optimal conditions of the supply chain biodiesel were studied via the techno-economic and environmental analysis. Using logistic restrictions, environmental assessment and cost minimization (all of them were estimated in this work), the optimal expansion conditions were decided, taking into account the minimal emissions and the effect of the Land Use Change (LUC) for the oil palm crop expansion. The results showed that the Middle Region is the most promising zone for biodiesel expansion, as well as the Eastern Region is the most adequate zone for expansion crops since the LUC impact is lowest. Finally, the results indicated that the biodiesel based industry must be addressed toward other feedstocks. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The fledging mass of penguin chicks can be an indicator of food availability and environmental conditions at a penguin colony. For the period 1989 to 2011, we analyzed predictor variables of environmental and food resource factors acting on multiple spatial scales near Palmer Station, Antarctica, that may influence the interannual variability in Adelie penguin chick fledging mass (CFM). To understand the influence of parental Adelie penguin diet on CFM, we modeled the energy density and krill demographics of penguin diet samples. We found a weak but significant positive relationship between the proportion of immature krill in adult penguin diets and CFM, which may indicate that krill recruitment and prey availability to adults influences CFM. However, the impact of large-scale climate and local weather outweighed the impact of parental diet characteristics on CFM. CFM was negatively associated with a positive Antarctic Oscillation (or Southern Annular Mode) and increased westerly winds and was positively associated with increased air temperature. The mechanistic relationship between climate, local weather, and CFM could include direct and indirect impacts, such as increased thermo-regulative costs for unattended chicks, decreased chick feeding frequency, and smaller meal mass for chicks driven by the geophysical transport of krill by climate and wind events.

AB  - Rangeland monitoring services require the capability to investigate vegetation condition and to assess biomass production, especially in areas where local livelihood depends on rangeland status. Remote sensing solutions are strongly recommended, where the systematic acquisition of field data is not feasible and does not guarantee properly describing the spatio-temporal dynamics of wide areas. Recent research on semi-arid rangelands has focused its attention on the evaporative fraction (EF), a key factor to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) in the energy balance (EB) algorithm. EF is strongly linked to the vegetation water status, and works conducted on eddy covariance towers used this parameter to increase the performances of satellite-based biomass estimation. In this work, a method to estimate EF from MODIS products, originally developed for evapotranspiration estimation, is tested and evaluated. Results show that the EF estimation from low spatial resolution over wide semi-arid area is feasible. Estimated EF resulted in being well correlated to field ET measurements, and the spatial patterns of EF maps are in agreement with the well-known climatic and landscape Sahelian features. The preliminary test on rangeland biomass production shows that satellite-retrieved EF as a water availability factor significantly increased the capacity of a remote sensing operational product to detect the variability of the field biomass measurements.

AB  - Anthropogenic structures introduced into the forest by silvicultural practices may lead to increased floristic diversity of the forest complex. Among artificial structures, ditches play a special role because they cause differences not only in lighting but also in moisture conditions. Species from contrasting habitats can exist together in a relatively small area because of the different conditions found on the bottom and slopes of the ditch. We studied the effect of the presence of three types of ditches (i.e. drainage ditches, road ditches, and war trenches) on the floristic diversity of forest phytocenoses in central Poland. These were managed forests on sites of Vaccinio-Piceetea and Querco-Fagetea phytosociological classes. In addition to measuring species richness, we analyzed the dominance structure, species rarity and ecological indicator values of plants. We have determined that species richness was higher in ditches than in the surrounding forest phytocenoses. Most species in ditches occurred at low frequencies. Based on Shannon's formula, ditches usually had greater diversity; species evenness, however, was variable in ditches when compared with the forest. Plants that occur in the ditches differed from these found in forests in terms of their trophic, humidity and light requirements. It has also become apparent that there are differences between the three types of ditches. Roadside ditches had the highest influence on floristic diversity, and war trenches the lowest.

AB  - Evolution of trimethylbenzoic acids in the KC-135 aquifer at the former Wurtsmith Air Force Base (WAFB), Oscoda, MI was examined to determine the functionality of trimethylbenzoic acids as key metabolite signatures in the biogeochemical evolution of an aquifer contaminated with JP-4 fuel hydrocarbons. Changes in the composition of trimethylbenzoic acids and the distribution and concentration profiles exhibited by 2,4,6- and 2,3,5-trimethylbenzoic acids temporally and between multilevel wells reflect processes indicative of an actively evolving contaminant plume. The concentration levels of trimethylbenzoic acids were 3-10 orders higher than their tetramethylbenzene precursors, a condition attributed to slow metabolite turnover under sulfidogenic conditions. The observed degradation of tetramethylbenzenes into trimethylbenzoic acids obviates the use of these alkylbenzenes as non-labile tracers for other degradable aromatic hydrocarbons, but provides rare field evidence on the range of high molecular weight alkylbenzenes and isomeric assemblages amenable to anaerobic degradation in situ. The coupling of actual tetramethylbenzene loss with trimethylbenzoic acid production and the general decline in the concentrations of these compounds demonstrate the role of microbially mediated processes in the natural attenuation of hydrocarbons and may be a key indicator in the overall rate of hydrocarbon degradation and the biogeochemical evolution of the KC-135 aquifer.

AB  - For the first time a biological source for the long-chain alkyl 1,14-diols and 12-hydroxy methyl alkanoates, lipids widely occurring in the marine water column and sediments, has been identified. Cultures of Proboscia indica and Proboscia alata, rhizosolenoid diatoms belonging to the widespread diatom genus Proboscia, contain C-28, C-28:1, C-30, and C-30:1 alkyl 1,14-diols, and C-27 and C-29 12-hydroxy methyl alkanoates as major neutral lipids. These components form a substantial fraction of lipid fractions from sediment traps or sediments, especially in areas with an elevated primary production such as upwelling regions. Examination of literature data reveals that as much as 20 to 35% of the total lipid flux in the Arabian Sea is derived from Proboscia diatoms during the start of the upwelling season. Their rapid transfer to the water-sediment interface may explain why corresponding 1,14-keto-ols, inferred oxidation products of diols, are hardly formed. These interpretations are supported by compound-specific carbon isotopic analysis of long-chain keto-ols and diols in surface sediments of the Arabian Sea. The data indicate that long-chain alkyl 1,14-diols and 12-hydroxy methyl alkanoates can be applied as indicators for high-nutrient conditions in the photic zone.

AB  - Age-dependent cortical bone loss was studied in two mediaeval Polish populations differing with regard to socio-economic status, as well as the intensity of the occurrence of skeletal indicators of living conditions in the early stages of ontogenesis (compression of the skull base and the narrowing of the lumbar vertebral canal). Cortical bone loss was analysed on the basis of the radiographs of the second metacarpal. Cedynia population (better living conditions) is characterized by higher arithmetic means for the height of the skull base in comparison with Slaboszewo group (low socio-economic status). In the case fo the vertebral canal index, significant interpopulation differences apply only to men. Similar patterns of difference between groups under study regarding bone loss was also found. It turned out that males from Cedynia had more bone mass in adultus and maturus age categories; in females, these differences concern only adultus category. The study involved an analysis of a relationship between the characteristics measuring reactions to environmental stress in early stages of growth and the intensity of bone loss in adult life. We believe that the results presented justify a conclusion that both phenomena may be interrelated to a considerable degree.

AB  - The sequence of the Ruisseau de l'Amourette, in the French Alps, covering the isotope stages 5e, 5d, 5c, and part of 5a and 6, was studied for terrestrial mollusks. Correspondence analysis of the mollusk assemblages permits reconstruction of temperature and moisture trends using knowledge of the modem ecology of the recognized species. The classic environmental succession of the last Interglacial-Early Glacial (Wurmian) is recognized. The Eemian (Sub-stage 5e) suggests warm and moist conditions. It is followed by the cold Melisey I (Sub-stage 5d) showing moisture variation, from dry in the lower pare to moist in the upper part. The mollusk equivalent of St. Germain I and II also indicates warm and moist conditions. The Melisey II stadial (Sub-stage 5b) is missing but may be reflected by the deposition of barren gravel layers. All these environmental oscillations agree with the fluctuations described in the literature. However Stage Se indicates a particular trend as the mollusks recorded two well individual cool events which seem to correspond to variations identified in various west-European continental records. However, as no particular cold indicator species were identified, these events cannot be related to strong climatic fluctuations as emphasized in the early studies of the Greenland GRIP ice-core or in North Atlantic and western European records.

AB  - The distribution of riparian plant species is largely driven by hydrologic and soil variables, and riparian plant communities frequently occur in relatively distinct zones along streamside. elevational and soil textural gradients. In two montane meadows in northeast Oregon, USA, we examined plant species distribution in three riparian plant communities-defined as wet. moist, and dry meadow-along short topographic gradients. We established transects from streamside wet meadow communities to the dry meadow communities located on the floodplain terrace. Within each of the three communities, we sampled plant species composition and cover and monitored water-table depth and soil redox potential (E-h) at 10- and 25-cm depths through three growing seasons (1997, 1998, and 1999). The Study objectives were (1) to characterize and compare seasonal patterns of water-table depth and soil redox potential in portions of the floodplain dominated by the three different plant communities; (2) to compare plant species composition, distribution, and diversity among the three communities; and (3) to relate plant species diversity and distribution to watertable depth and redox potential. Strong environmental gradients existed along the transects. Water-table depth followed the seasonal patterns of stream stage and discharge and was consistently highest in the wet meadow communities (ranging from +26 cm above the soil surface to -37 cm below the Surface), lowest in the city meadow Communities (-8 cm to - 115 cm), and intermediate in the moist meadow communities (+17 cm to -73 cm). Dynamics of redox potential were associated with the seasonal fluctuations in water-table depth and differed among the plant communities. In the wet meadow communities, anaerobic soil conditions (E-h <= 300 mV) occurred from March through July at 10-cm depth and throughout the year at 25-cm depth. In the moist meadow communities, soils were anaerobic during spring high flows and aerobic in summer and fall during low flows. In the dry meadow communities, soil conditions were predominantly aerobic throughout the year at both depths. Wet meadow communities were dominated by sedges (Carex spp.) and had the lowest species richness and diversity, whereas dry meadow communities were composed of a mixture of grasses and forbs and had the greatest number of species. Species richness and total plant cover were negatively correlated with mean water-table depth and positively correlated with mean redox potential at 10 cm and 25-cm depths (P < 0.01). Distribution of the 18 most abundant plant species in relation to watertable depth and soil redox potential showed that certain species, such as the obligate wetland sedges, occurred within a fairly restricted range of water-table depth, whereas other graminoids Occurred over wide ranges. These results Suggest that the biological diversity often observed in montane riparian meadows is strongly related to steep environmental gradients in hydrology and soil redox status.

AB  - Wildland fires and anthropogenic disturbances can cause changes in vegetation species composition and structure in boreal peatlands. These could potentially alter regeneration trajectories following severe fire or through cumulative impacts of climate-mediated drying, fire, and/or anthropogenic disturbance. We used lidar-derived point cloud metrics, and site-specific locational attributes to assess trajectories of post-disturbance vegetation regeneration in boreal peatlands south of Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada using a space-for-time-chronosequence. The objectives were to (a) develop methods to identify conifer trees vs. deciduous shrubs and trees using multi-spectral lidar data, (b) quantify the proportional coverage of shrubs and trees to determine environmental conditions driving shrub regeneration, and (c) determine the spatial variations in shrub and tree heights as an indicator of cumulative growth since the fire. The results show that the use of lidar-derived structural metrics predicted areas of deciduous shrub establishment (92% accuracy) and classification of deciduous and conifer trees (71% accuracy). Burned bogs and fens were more prone to shrub regeneration up to and including 38 years after the fire. The transition from deciduous to conifer trees occurred approximately 30 years post-fire. These results improve the understanding of environmental conditions that are sensitive to disturbance and impacts of disturbance on northern peatlands within a changing climate.

AB  - Density-dependent change in aggressive behavior contributes to the population regulation of many small rodents, but the underlying neurological mechanisms have not been examined in field conditions. We hypothesized that crowding stress and aggression-associated oxytocin (OT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) in specific regions of the brain may be closely related to aggressive behaviors and population changes of small rodents. We analyzed the association of OT and AVP expression, aggressive behavior, and population density of Brandt's voles in 24 large semi-natural enclosures (0.48 ha each) in Inner Mongolia grassland. We tested the effects of population density on the OT/AVP system and aggressive behavior by experimentally manipulating populations of Brandt's voles in the grassland enclosures. High density was positively and significantly associated with more aggressive behavior, and increased expression of mRNA and protein of AVP and its receptor, but decreased expression of mRNA and protein of OT and its receptor in specific brain regions of the voles. Our study suggests that changes in OT/AVP expression are likely a result of the increased psychosocial stress that these voles experience during overcrowding, and thus the OT/AVP system can be used as indicators of density-dependent stressors in Brandt's voles.

AB  - Cancer is a lethal disease and its incidences has been increasing day by day. The survival rates of the cancer patients are lesser due to lack of its awareness, available health facilities and other many socioeconomic conditions to treat it. Various abnormal metabolic and ionic changes occur in throat and mouth cancer patients than healthy persons. In this experiment, with average 36-42 years aged 21 throat and 24 mouth cancer patients were selected to analyze the changes in complete blood counts (CBC), liver functional tests (LFT) and electrolytes. Among the patients, Hb (g/dL) decreased and PLT (10(8)/mu L) increased significantly in both typed cancer patients than normal healthy persons. Higher ALP and bilirubin levels were observed high (p <= 0.05), while ALT and urea concentration remained unchanged among the patients to normals. Serum electrolytes i.e. Mg2+ was observed higher in patients (p <= 0.05), while Cl- and Ca2+ were decreased significantly in both throat and mouth cancer patients. The K+ mildly increased non-significantly remained within the reference ranges. Changes in biosynthesis of metabolites induces electrolyte imbalanced condition as well as the alterations in HB and PLT may also be caused by imbalanced nutrition-based factors. By early careful monitoring of such indicators in the cancer patients could play a preventive role in cancer disease prognoses.

AB  - The Kyoto Protocol has stipulated array of national policies to combat the climate change. To tackle the global warming, governments embraced Paris Agreement and Kigali Amendment which deal with the reduction of greenhouse gas emission. For example, the European F-gas regulation and the Japan METI now enforce refrigerants below 150 GWP for automobile industry and below 750 GWP for the residential air-conditioning applications. To invent a perfect refrigerant that meets performance requirement, environmental requirements, and safety standards is considered extremely difficult. On the other hand, some existing refrigerants exhibit excellent performance with safe operation but record high-GWP while refrigerants such as R1234yf and R744 possess almost 0 GWP. Thus, these refrigerant blends might serve as urgent solutions with minimum performance compromise. This paper evaluates the performance of binary and ternary blends using several promising refrigerants. Exploiting the excellent performance of R32 as the base refrigerant, R1123, R1234yf, R1234ze(E), and R744 are utilized in the blends. The performance indicators employed here are (i) GWP, (ii) temperature glide, (iii) volumetric capacity, and (iv) coefficient of performance. The advantages to reduce the irreversible heat loss by glide matching and energy saving potential for the blends are also discussed. Results showed that some refrigerant blends considering GWP 200 and 300 could successfully replace the widely used R410A in a residential air conditioner.

AB  - One challenge in plant breeding is to ensure optimized production under fluctuating environments while reducing the environmental impacts of agriculture. Thus, new rapeseed varieties should be adapted to a wide range of pedoclimatic conditions and constraints. Addressing this issue requires identifying the critical factors limiting production and the genotype by environment (G x E) interaction. Our goal was to characterize the effects of environment and G x E interaction on the seed yield of rapeseed grown over a large field network. First, we defined a pedoclimatic indicator set with the ability to highlight the potential limiting factors along the crop cycle by analyzing the yield of two genotypes grown under 20 environments. Out of the 84 pedoclimatic indicators, 10 were identified as limiting after a partial least squares regression analysis. The environments were then clustered into five envirotypes, each characterized by few major limiting factors: low winter temperatures and heat stress during seed filling (1); low solar radiation during seed filling (3); vernalization conditions during winter (4) and high temperatures at flowering (5). A larger genetic diversity was evaluated in a subset of 11 environments to analyze the impact of envirotyping on genotype ranking. Their results were discussed in light of field network management and plant breeding purposes.

AB  - The main aim of this research work is to assess the performance of the various mass transfer-based method with respect to standard FAO56-PM. Daily meteorological data from 1979 to 2018 has been used to compute reference evapotranspiration (ETo). The climatic data from 1979 to 2006 were used for the development of the calibrated equations and data from 2007 to 2018 were applied for validation purpose. The evaluated, calibrated and further validation of calibrated models were compared using statistical tools in order to ranked the models effectiveness using Global Performance Indicator (GPI) where higher GPI value shows better model. The models were then arranged using GPI and it was found that proposed model resulted with best GPI value of 5.02, 2.85 and 5.19 during evaluation, calibration and validation respectively followed by Albrecht model. The results of this study could be used by the water management system, crop cultivators, crop advisors, researchers from research centres. Moreover, it is beneficial for the decision maker in the vast field of agriculture, hydrology and environment. The calibration and validation of different ETo equations tend to increase their performance. Thus, the validated evapotranspiration model that used less climatic parameters can predict the ETo condition accurately for Asir region.

AB  - The role of entrepreneurship in societal wellbeing is well documented in the economic literature and well perceived in the public arena. The extensive positive externalities of entrepreneurship, such as innovation or increased productivity, have made researchers be interested in the conditions and motivations that can determine it to flourish. Many empirical studies test the relations between the entrepreneurial activity and different determinant variables, but the empirical results are mixed and sometimes contradictory, especially for developing versus developed countries. This can make public policy makers confused and misguided. In this article, we are interested in identifying the factors that influence the dynamics of entrepreneurship, aiming to understand whether there is a set of common factors globally, which explain entrepreneurship development. We use the density of newly registered companies for a set of 57 countries for yearly observations from 2004 to 2012, as a proxy for entrepreneurship development. Our conclusions indicate that the bankruptcies, the economic situation, the producer prices and competitiveness are directly influencing the new density, while the wages, the bank lendings to the private sector, the bankruptcies and the leading indicator show cointegration with the new density. We consider this as evidence that there is a common set of determinants that affect entrepreneurship development. Such an analysis at global level increases knowledge in the entrepreneurship research, as it has the merit to inquire into the nature and conditions of entrepreneurship as a universal human behavior, in the countries of the world.

AB  - Gammarids from the Caspian complex have invaded many European waters along the rivers and canals of the inland migration corridors. The species examined in this work are well known as invaders of European freshwater environments, so the colonization of brackish habitats is a phenomenon inviting more detailed investigation. The aim of this study was to determine the condition of the Ponto-Caspian gammarids Pontogammarus robustoides (G.O. Sars, 1894), Obesogammarus crassus (G.O. Sars, 1894), Dikerogammarus haemobaphes (Eichwald, 1841) and Dikerogammarus villosus (Sowinsky, 1894) as expressed by the relationship between total length and the wet weight of specimens in the brackish waters of the Gulf of Gdansk (Poland). The relationships can be regarded as responses to a newly expanded habitat after they overcome the salinity barrier of the southern Baltic Sea coastal waters. All these Ponto-Caspian gammarids demonstrated an increase in weight with increasing total length: P. robustoides (b = 2.852), O. crassus (b = 3.3477), D. haemobaphes (b = 3.7855) and D. villosus (b = 2.6917). The results are an indicator of the relatively good condition of the organisms and indicate that the brackish environment of the Gulf of Gdansk affords them excellent possibilities for growth.

AB  - 24-n-Propylcholestane (24-npc), a C-30 sterane compound derived from sterol precursors which are the major sterol constituents of modern pelagophyte microalgae, occurs in certain Neoproterozoic rocks and oils and throughout the Phanerozoic rock record. This broad distribution leads 24-npc to be widely considered a reliable indicator of open to partially restricted marine depositional conditions for source rocks and oils. Here we report two significant hiatuses in the occurrences of 24-npc in the Lower Paleozoic marine rock record: the first in the Middle-Late Cambrian and the second in the Late Ordovician-early Silurian transition for a range of lithofacies (carbonates and siliciclastic rocks), organic carbon contents (both organic-lean and organic-rich), and paleoceanographic environments (shelf and deeper water marine settings) and observed offshore of two paleocontinents, Laurentia and Baltica. The Ordovician-Silurian gap is at least 9 million years, and possibly up to 20 million years, in duration. Robust older occurrences of 24-npc steranes in some Neoproterozoic rocks and oils suggest that oceanographic conditions in our intervals of Lower Paleozoic time were unfavorable for the proliferation of pelagophyte algae as phytoplankton. Caution should therefore be applied when interpreting a lacustrine versus marine depositional environmental setting for source rocks and oils in these intervals of Early Paleozoic time using lipid biomarker assemblages.

AB  - Epiphytic mosses and liverworts contribute substantially to the bryophyte diversity of circumpolar boreal forests but are susceptible to altered growing conditions after forest harvesting. Management practices that retain some trees after harvest may enhance epiphyte survival; however, the effectiveness of this emerging method needs to be assessed. We examined the survival, composition, and nearest neighbour relationships of epiphytic bryophytes on trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) across a range (10%-100%) of dispersed green-tree retention 5 years after harvest in boreal mixed-wood forest. Growth of the forest floor moss Hylocomium splendens (Hedw.) Schimp. in B. S. G. was used as an indicator of changes in moisture availability for epiphytes following harvesting. Epiphyte richness and abundance increased with canopy retention and were positively correlated with local abundance of coniferous trees. Positive associations among neighbouring species in intact forest demonstrated that interspecies relationships form naturally. However, there was a shift in species composition after harvesting and fewer interspecific associations with declining retention. These trends were accompanied by reduced Hylocomium splendens growth, which implies that moisture may be an important driver of epiphyte response. Although different levels of canopy retention were similarly capable of maintaining some epiphytes, the loss of species associated with intact forest will require consideration of alternative management practices for their conservation.

AB  - Lacustrine sedimentary deposits are a primary archive of terrestrial paleoclimatic information, and groundwater fluxes under arid climates can dominate water budgets in lake and playa environments. In this paper, we investigate the effects of basin-scale water table fluctuations on lacustrine paleoclimatic records in and regions using the hydrogeologic model MWT3D. Boundary conditions for paleo-recharge over the past 57 ka, land surface topography, the location of lakes, and subsurface geology were based on information available for a 600-km cross section across the western Murray Basin, Australia. Results indicate the importance of the physical interaction between the water table and the land surface in controlling the location and the timing of formation of paleoclimatic lacustrine records. Lakes in different positions across the watershed preserved different records of climate (wet versus dry), although the same recharge history was applied. Changes in groundwater seepage to the surface lagged behind the climatic signal between 500 and 220 years across the basin. The size of the flow system, specifically the distance from the local discharge point to the adjacent groundwater divide, was the primary control on the time lag. With large fluctuations in water table elevation (>50 m) this distance changes considerably from wet to dry climatic conditions. Our results are largely consistent with observed paleoclimatic records derived from lakes across the Murray Basin.

AB  - Removing aromatic contaminants from the soil using ultrasonic waves is a new technology with the potential for practical use in industrial scale. In this study, the ultrasonication technology was presumed as a pre-treatment for soils contaminated with phenanthrene. Since the removal of this contaminant from the soil by ultrasonication reduces the cost of treatments such as soil washing, the optimization of independent variables has been investigated in the present study. Effect of variables such as phenanthrene primary concentration (7.5-517.5 mg/kg), ultrasonic power (0-395 W), the volume of water (0-400 mL) and the overall retention time (0-1 h) on the cost-saving of treatment for 100 g soil samples has been presented. The Response Surface Methodology has been used for modeling the results of this research. Based on the results of this research, the optimal conditions have been proposed for maximization of the cost-savings by ultrasonication and minimization of the ultrasonication operating costs. The best proposed conditions to achieve the maximum pollutant removal occurred in soil pretreatments using ultrasonication in water volume of 300 mL, the ultrasonic power of 139W, and 0.5 h process duration, which led to saving of 1.42 (sic)/100 g soil for the replacement of the soil washing by the ultrasonication process.

AB  - Depth erosion often occurs along rivers. Erosional tendencies are mainly caused by river training works, course shortenings, flood protection and reduced sediment supply due to dams and weirs. Balanced sedimentation, transport and erosion processes are of utmost importance for the connectivity of rivers and floodplains as well as for human water uses. In order to classify the level of bed incision, investigations were carried out for the case study area of the Lower Rhine in Germany, Europe?s most used waterway, using the hydromorphological classification tool Valmorph. It was developed to capture, quantify and evaluate hydromorphological conditions and changes. Comparative conditions for an evaluation have to be derived predominantly from type-specific historical quantitative data analyses. This paper analyses the Valmorph indicator ?mean bed level changes?. Data relating to the heights of the river bed levels between the years 1896?2010 were investigated. The classifications show an immense reduction from the previously extremely high erosion rates. Additionally, the monitoring identifies cause?effect relationships between incision rates and implemented sediment management measures. The findings are shown for various temporal and spatial resolutions, reflecting the development of the depth erosion. The knowledge obtained can be used for river basin management, for example for designing large-scale measures to restore river ecosystems with sediment deficits and for monitoring their success.

AB  - This work aimed to identify all the variables of soil loss potential risk condition in the municipality of Ouro Verde / SP. Therefore, along with identifying unsafe road sections to make the necessary adjustments, taking into account the nature of soil classification, geology, relief rainfall, land use and occupation, conservationists influence and cross-referencing to different information about current approach for unpaved road condition. The visual interpretation of the study area was performed on the basis of an assessment of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Municipal areas mappings has been carried out with cross-checks of information through application of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and the InVEST (R) program which has estimated the losses from soil erosion. In order to recognize and prioritize high-risk road stretches, it was inferred parameters of structures and situations, adapted from the Sustainable Rural Development Project - Hydrographic Microbasins II, obtaining full framework of Classes prioritization criteria. The result of prioritizing unpaved roads identified those that, in their total extent or stretches, which need immediate, medium-term and long-term action, enabling public administrators in the City Hall and FEHIDRO to use this guide as source of analysis and decision-making The InVEST (R) program made possible to explore scenarios with probable future results, and thus various erosion potentiality maps were generated.

AB  - Increasing attention is being given to energy-saving air conditioning technology in recent years. Using natural refrigerant and driven by low grade thermal energy, rotary desiccant cooling system has become a sound alternative solution to conventional vapor compression system. Although one-stage ventilation rotary desiccant cooling system is still the main stream, TSDC (two-stage rotary desiccant cooling) system recently emerges as the latest development, which can be driven by lower regeneration temperature (50-90 degrees C) compared with one-stage system. In this paper, performance of TSDC with different regeneration temperatures in two stages is analyzed. First integrated mathematical model of TSDC system is established by combing models of different components. Cooling power and COPth (thermal coefficient of performance) are utilized as performance indicators. Then system performance with respect to different combinations of two regeneration temperatures are simulated and discussed, while optimization investigation is also conducted to obtain maximum COPth with same cooling power. Under the simulation condition, results show that cooling power of the system increases with the increase of regeneration temperatures, however, COPth decreases. Also, when the first stage operates in higher regeneration temperature, TSDC system can obtain better performance reflecting in both cooling power and in COPth. Moreover, with the same cooling power provided, COPth of TSDC system obtains a minimum value when temperatures of the two stages approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the present study, drying experiments on mixed-mode solar dryer with cylindrical potato samples have been performed for a wide range of process variables. The variables investigated are absorbed thermal energy, air flow rate, food product loading density and sample thickness. A mathematical framework is developed to estimate several dryer performance indicators namely: drying efficiency, SEC (specific energy consumption), CO2 emissions mitigation, carbon credits earned and amount of different fossil fuels saved due to use of solar drying. The fossil fuels investigated in the present study are coal, diesel, natural gas and LPG (liquefied petroleum gas). The results of investigation indicate that for all drying test conditions, the given dryer is capable to mitigate the maximum CO2 emissions with the replacement of coal by solar energy. Larger values of absorbed energy and load density cause increased SEC and CO2 mitigation potential whereas reverse trend is observed for sample thickness. However, the influence of air flow rate on these parameters is found to be quite different. In order to establish functional relationship between SEC and process variables, a correlation is developed using Levenberg -Marquart algorithm. The statistical error analysis reveals that the proposed correlation is capable of satisfactory prediction of experimental results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - What is the disturbance response of low-arctic plant communities two to three decades after seismic exploration.
   Mackenzie River Delta, low-arctic, northwestern Canada.
   Plant communities in two upland tundra vegetation types were compared between winter seismic lines, created between 1970 and 1986, and adjacent "reference" tundra. Also, we used aerial surveys to quantify the total area impacted by visible linear features.
   Vascular plant cover was significantly higher, and lichen cover significantly lower, on seismic lines than in reference tundra. The increase in vascular plant cover was attributable to deciduous shrubs and graminoids. There were significant differences in plant community composition between seismic lines and reference tundra but no differences in species diversity or richness. Betula glandulosa and Arctagrostis latifolia were significant indicator species for seismic lines, while Saussurea angustifolia was a significant indicator for reference tundra. Based on the aerial surveys, these effects apply to at least 90% of seismic lines from two-dimensional programs in these habitat types during the 1970s.
   Vegetation composition and structure on 20-30-year-old seismic lines differs from reference upland tundra despite no persistent differences in organic layer depth or depth to permafrost. We propose that this reflects: (1) successional redevelopment following changes in soil conditions and nutrient availability arising from the disturbance, and/or (2) disturbance-initiated succession towards a community reflecting current climatic conditions.

AB  - The effects of starvation on various factors related to immunological defence in Sydney rock oysters (Saccostrea glomerata) were tested in controlled laboratory experiments. A range of parameters was assessed, including total haemocyte counts, and phenoloxidase (PO), superoxide, acid phosphatase and peroxidase activities. Condition indices were also monitored as an indicator of oyster fitness. We found that the frequency of haemocytes and phenoloxidase activity decreased by 25% and 14% respectively when oysters were fed half-satiation rations for three weeks.(1) These decreases became statistically significant when oysters were starved for three weeks. Superoxide and peroxidase activities also decreased significantly when oysters were starved for two to four weeks, while phenoloxidase and acid phosphatase activities were significantly inhibited after oysters had been starved for at least three weeks. All of the immunological parameters returned to at least their original levels after starved oysters were fed to satiation for six days. Phenoloxidase activities over-compensated during the recovery response, so that levels post-recovery were substantially higher than those evident before starvation. There were no significant changes in condition indices during any of the starvation treatments. These data indicate that starvation compromises immunological activity, and that the duration and intensity of starvation differentially affect immune responses. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry (FA), the small and random departures from perfect symmetry of an organism's bilateral traits, has been used as a measurement of developmental stability and an indicator of stress in endangered populations. We were interested in testing if the level of developmental stability is the same in different populations experiencing the same conditions, as the use of FA as an indicator of ecological stress is only meaningful if this is true. In order to do this, the effect of thermal stress on wing size FA over a range of temperatures was determined on three different lines of Drosophila melanogaster: two lines were maintained at one of two different constant temperatures (18 degrees C or 28 degrees C) and one under a fluctuating thermal regime (18 degrees C and 28 degrees C) for eight years. The differences in viability of these lines, when reared at a range of different temperatures, are associated with the temperature conditions they previously experienced. All lines showed a similar increase in FA at the two ends of the thermal range but with significantly different mean values. The two units of wing development (compartments) differed in their FA response depending on the selective history of each line. We discuss the implication of our results for the use of FA as an indicator of ecological stress.

AB  - The definition of storm morphological thresholds along the coast of the Emilia-Romagna Region strictly depends on its configuration and variability. The region is located in northern Italy, facing the Adriatic Sea. The coastline is characterised by very different levels of economic development, ranging from natural zones with dunes to highly developed stretches protected by breakwaters and groynes. The Integrated Coastal Zone Management effort is mainly concentrated on preserving urban areas that generate significant income for the regional economy. Natural areas, while small in comparison to the urbanised zone, are important for environment preservation. Because of such a multiplicity of issues at stake, it was decided to produce two different thresholds: one for the morphological impact on natural sectors and another for inundation and damage to structures along urbanised zones.
   The "forcing" component of the threshold definition for natural areas was calculated by summing the effects of surge + tide + waves (run-up elevation) to find the Maximum Water Level (MWL) reached by the sea during one, ten and one-hundred year storm return periods. For urbanised zones, historical storm information was collected starting from the 19605 in order to identify the forcing conditions causing real damages. Each storm was classified in terms of wave height, period, direction and surge level. Morphological information were obtained from Lidar flights performed in 2003 and 2004 and from direct surveys undertaken in September 2008 and February 2009 as part of the monitoring programme for the MICORE Project.
   The computed MWL for each return period was then compared to beach elevations along natural areas in order to calculate the Dune Stability Factor (DSF), an index that accounts for the eroded sediment volume above the MWL during a storm. Based on analysis along 41 profile lines at a 500 m spacing, it was found that the 1-in-1 year return period wave height + 1-in-1 year return period surge are able to erode and/or overwash 2/3 of the dunes.
   The historical storm hydrodynamic information was used to estimate which wave and surge conditions are able to inundate at least 2/3 of the beach profiles. The MWL was again compared to beach elevations, this time along 63 anthropogenic profiles spaced 500 m apart (or 1/3 of the urbanised coastline). It was found that a wave heights >= 2 m and surge + tide levels >= 0.7 m are able to flood between 18% and 36% of the built-up coast. The defined thresholds are related to the present coastal characteristics and are not "static", meaning that they are likely to change according to future evolution of the coastline. They are very important because they can be used as thresholds to issue warnings and alert the Civil Protection. Moreover they are the first thresholds defined for the Emilia-Romagna coastline and will be used as starting values to generate "dynamic" thresholds based on numerical model predictions of morphological change for a given wave and surge level.

AB  - In this study, a protocol was developed to identify reduction-oxidation (redox) transition zones in an effort to exploit natural source zone depletion processes. A sediment core with a total length of 18-m was collected from a site with historical contamination that includes chlorinated benzenes where the redox condition was preserved. In the four redox transition zones investigated, reactive iron coatings are characterized with a suite of analyses under anaerobic conditions. To distinguish surface coating mineralogy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, and field-emission scanning electron microscopy with an energy dispersive X-ray analyzer were applied along with a six-step sequential extraction process. The cycling of Fe and S, as an important contribution and indicator of ongoing natural attenuation processes for constituents of concern (COC), was delineated by using data from multiple and complementary analyses for isolating and identifying iron phases. Along with groundwater chemistry, contaminant concentrations, and microbial genera, attenuation of COCs is expected to be active and sustainable in redox transition zones, where there is an abundance of reactive iron mineral coatings cycling through biogeochemical reactions. Reactions in other redox transition zones may be limited where iron mineral coatings are not dominant.

AB  - The research was developed with the objective of evaluating the effect of QuitoMax (R) on the yield of garlic cultivation under organoponic conditions, clone "Chileno", for this, four treatments were studied: T1 (control treatment, without the application of the product); T2 (100 mg ha(-1)); T3 (150 mg ha(-1)) and T4 (200 mg ha(-1)). The experiment was developed in the organoponic belonging to the Urban Farm, located at the University of Matanzas, a substrate made up of 80 % soil (red Ferralitic) and 20 % organic matter was used, arranged in a completely randomized design. Samples were carried out at 30 and 60 days after planting the crop to determine the agromorphological variables: number of leaves, height of the plants and diameter of the base of the bulb and at the time of harvest, the yield variables were measured: the weight of the bulb, its equatorial and polar width and the number of teeth. The behavior of the morphological and performance indicators did not allow to define in a significant way a stimulating effect of QuitoMax (R), in the doses evaluated on the biological performance of garlic with respect to the control treatment, under the established study conditions. In the variables height of the plants and number of leaves, a positive response of the crop was evidenced in the period of greatest growth with the best response in the dose of 150 mg ha(-1).

AB  - Site productivity provides critical information for forest management practices and is a fundamental measure in forestry. It is determined using site index (SI) models, which are developed using two primary groups of methods, namely, phytocentric (plant-based) or geocentric (earth-based). Geocentric methods allow for direct site growth modelling, in which the SI is predicted using multiple environmental indicators. However, changes in non-static site factors-particularly nitrogen deposition and rising CO2 concentration-lead to an increase in site productivity, which may be visible as an age trend in the SI. In this study, we developed a geocentric SI model for oak. For the development of the SI model, we used data from 150 sample plots, representing a wide range of local topographic and site conditions. A generalized additive model was used to model site productivity. We found that the oak SI depended predominantly on physicochemical soil properties-mainly nitrogen, carbon, sand, and clay content. Additionally, the oak SI value was found to be slightly shaped by the topography, especially by altitude above sea level, and topographic position. We also detected a significant relationship between the SI and the age of oak stands, indicating the long-term increasing site productivity for oak, most likely caused by nitrogen deposition and changes in climatic conditions. The developed geocentric site productivity model for oak explained 77.2% of the SI variation.

AB  - Since the use of dental implants is continuously increasing, it is imperative for dental practitioners to understand the nature and treatment of peri-implant diseases. The purpose of this manuscript is to comprehensively review peri-implant diseases, their characteristics, as well as their non-surgical and surgical treatment. To that end, the current literature was searched and a narrative review was conducted. It is essential that the case definitions described in the 2017 World Workshop on the Classification of Periodontal and Peri-implant Diseases and Conditions are used to diagnose and classify peri-implant health, peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis. While recent epidemiologic studies on peri-implant diseases exist, there is great heterogeneity in the definition of these conditions. Several risk factors and indicators are reported in the literature, with smoking and diabetes being the most universally accepted. In peri-implant mucositis, non-surgical treatment seems to be sufficient. However, for the treatment of peri-implantitis, a surgical approach, which includes open-flap debridement, apically positioned flap and guided bone regeneration, is considered more appropriate. A great variety of adjuncts to mechanical treatment have been reported with controversial results. Finally, studies comparing results from different peri-implantitis treatments are warranted in randomized controlled clinical trials in order to provide stronger evidence-based approaches.

AB  - Wind turbines have been used for decades in order to produce electricity. Its main advantage is that its energy is clean, does not harm the nature and maintains its balance. For this reason, researchers and engineers have been focused on improving its design, performance and reliability. In addition, its condition monitoring has been studied for many years by processing its vibration signature. The latter is performed either by collecting it from the real mechanical system using sensors or by modeling its vibration signature. In this paper, a wind turbine drivetrain dynamic behavior is developed under different excitation conditions considering the influence of two-disk brake position. Main key factors involved in the dynamic behavior, such as wind turbine dimensions, gear mesh stiffness fluctuation, driving torque, braking torque and bearing stiffness, are taken into account in the model. To investigate a complex damage case, a typical gear fault, profile error and assembly defect are introduced. The dynamic response of the wind turbine, for healthy and damaged cases, is studied based on time series and spectra of acceleration signals. To diagnose gear faults, three indicators (RMS, STD and kurtosis) are used. Based on signal observations, it can be concluded that the disk brake location, wind turbine characteristics and gearbox defects have a direct influence on the dynamic behavior of the system.

AB  - Earthquake-induced landslides are one of the most catastrophic effects of earthquakes, as evidenced by many historic events over the past decades, such as the 1994 Northridge earthquake in California and the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China. Realistic prediction of coseismic landslides is crucial for the design of key infrastructure and to protect human lives in seismically active regions. To date, analytical methods for estimating coseismic landslides have been based on highly simplified models. In this study, an integrated Spectral Element Method (SEM)-Newmark model is developed to directly simulate three-dimensional wave field in complex topography on a regional scale, while the associated landslide is indicated by the Newmark sliding displacement analysis considering key model factors. Topographic amplification, soil response, near-field characteristics of earthquake shaking and hydrogeological conditions can be simulated, and their effects on coseismic landslides are studied. In this paper, two regional-scale case studies were conducted using the developed SEM-Newmark model, including landslide hazard assessment for natural terrain in the western part of Hong Kong island, and the massive landslides occurred during the 2014 M6.5 Ludian earthquake in China. These case studies demonstrated that the proposed integrated model can be effectively used for regional-scale coseismic landslide hazard assessment under various earthquake scenarios and hydrogeological conditions.

AB  - Infection-induced chronic pain is an under-studied pain condition. One example is apical periodontitis, which evokes considerable mechanical allodynia that persists after treatment in 7% to 12% of patients. Available analgesics often provide incomplete relief. However, a preclinical model to study pain mechanisms associated with apical periodontitis is not available. Here, we report a mouse model of apical periodontitis to facilitate studies determining mechanisms mediating persistent infection-induced pain. Mice were anesthetized and the left first molar was exposed to the oral environment for six weeks. Bone resorption, as an indicator of apical periodontitis, was quantified using microcomputed tomography. Mechanical allodynia was determined using extraoral von-Frey filaments in both male and female mice. The expression of c-fos in the medullary dorsal horn was assessed using immunohistochemistry. Mice with apical periodontitis developed significant mechanical allodynia by day 7 that was maintained for 42 days. Mechanical thresholds were significantly lower in females compared to males. Administration of ibuprofen, morphine, or MK-801 reversed mechanical allodynia. Finally, apical periodontitis triggered an upregulation of c-fos in the medullary dorsal horn. Collectively, this model simulates signs of clinical pain experienced by patients with apical periodontitis, detects sex differences in allodynia, and permits the study of peripheral and central trigeminal pain mechanisms.

AB  - The objective of this work is to know the structure (composition and density) of the community of the oribatid mites and their relationship to edaphic parameters in 2 agricultural parcels with different type of irrigation. It constitutes the first work done with oribatid mites in agricultural plots irrigated with waste water in Mexico. Two agricultural parcels were selected: one is irrigated with waste water (San Salvador) and the other with well water (El Bondho) from the municipality of San Salvador. The density of oribatids in San Salvador was higher than that from El Bondho (2,360 and 1,935 ind/m(2), respectively). The maximum abundances in percentages in San Salvador were for 3 species: Tectocepheus velatus elegans (48%), Scheloribates sp. (15%) and Oppiella nova (13%); but for El Bondho, there were only 2 species: Zygoribatula connexa (74%) and Ramusella sp. (10%). Due to soil conditions by the irrigation type, results gave information, on one hand, about the tolerance of some species like O. nova, R. ardua, and T. velatus elegans to heavy metals, and on the other hand, about the low resistance to heavy metals of Epilohmannia pallida and Z. connexa, which were present in the less polluted parcel, but are tolerant to saline soils. Results can be useful to support the use of some species of oribatid mites as bioindicators in ecosystems with similar conditions.

AB  - The Ammonia-Elphidium Index (IAE) allows to assess the oxygenation levels of coastal regions. Both genera used in this index are resistant to oxygen reduction conditions. The genus Ammonia has a greater resistance than the genus Elphidium to low oxic conditions, and both are abundant in the coastal zones, which makes possible the use of this index to access the impact caused by organic matter pollution in these regions. Hence, this index has been used in the literature to study polluted regions by large contribution of organic carbon. The Petrobras Polo Atalaia Production complex is responsible for the outfall of treated petrochemical effluents, called PAP-1, which introduce pollutants in the coastal area of Sergipe State, northeast Brazil. In view of the environmental complexity of the region, the objectives of this work were: 1) to analyze the dimension and diversity of living foraminifera assemblages in surface sediment samples collected in February 2014 around the Sergipe-Mar Subsea Outfall of Active Production (SMP); and 2) to apply the Ammonia-Elphidium index in this region as a proxy of environmental impact. The results allowed to evaluate the impact caused by the contribution of the effluents released by the SMP outfall of the Petrobras Polo Atalaia Production complex and their influence on the density and diversity of living benthic foraminifera in the study area.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are known to exhibit photo-induced toxicity. Hundreds to thousands of PAH parent and substituted compounds are found in the environment, and developing a predictive model applicable to a wide variety of PAHs and organisms is a necessary precursor to environmental risk assessments. There has been evolutionary progress in phototoxicity modeling since 1977. In the present study, a comprehensive review of the models developed to predict phototoxicity of PAHs is presented. The contributions of each of the models to the state of the art are discussed. The models are compared in terms of their scope of applicability to different organisms, PAHs, endpoints (median lethal time and median lethal concentration), and light conditions. The current state of the science that accounts for the key elements of phototoxicity modeling, including the differences in species sensitivity, the partitioning of PAHs into the target lipid of the organisms, and light absorption by the chemicals, as well as light exposure time and conditions, is discussed. In addition, the remaining issues that need to be addressed are explored: the effect of time-varying exposures to light and PAH concentrations, and the lack of a mechanistic understanding that can explain the failure of the Bunsen-Roscoe law of reciprocity.

AB  - Despite a general decrease in Dutch environmental emission trends, it remains difficult to comply with European Union (EU) environmental policy targets. Furthermore, environmental issues have become increasingly complex and entangled with society. Therefore, Dutch environmental policy follows a pragmatic line by adopting a flexible approach for compliance, rather than aiming at further reduction at the source of emission. This may be politically useful in order to adequately reach EU targets, but restoration of environmental conditions may be delayed. However, due to the complexity of today's environmental issues, the restoration of environmental conditions might not be the only standard for a proper policy approach. Consequently this raises the question how the Dutch pragmatic approach to compliance qualifies in a broader policy assessment. In order to answer this question, we adapt a policy assessment framework, developed by Hemerijck and Hazeu (Bestuurskunde 13(2), 2004), based on the dimensions of legitimacy and policy logic. We apply this framework for three environmental policy assessments: flexible instruments in climate policy, fine-tuning of national and local measures to meet air quality standards, and derogation for the Nitrate Directive. We conclude with general assessment notes on the appliance of flexible instruments in environmental policy, showing that a broad and comprehensive perspective can help to understand the arguments to put such policy instruments into place and to identify trade-offs between assessment criteria.

AB  - Studies about processes determining biodiversity in Pantanal are urgently needed and the use of invertebrates for this purpose may be an efficient tool. The purpose of this paper is to verify whether ants could be used to predict human impacts on Pantanal, assessing how environmental characteristics of gallery forest influence arboreal ant species richness. Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that: (i) resource availability (estimated by tree density) and (ii) diversity of environmental conditions (estimated by structural heterogeneity) positively influence arboreal ant species richness and composition. Ants were sampled in a gallery forest in the Miranda River. Ant species richness did not respond to tree density, but increased with structural heterogeneity. Species composition was affected both by tree density and structural heterogeneity. The species list produced in the present study showed a high similarity between arboreal ant faunas of Cerrado and Pantanal, which are contiguous biomes. The relationship of ant species richness with heterogeneity, as well as the observed changes of species composition with tree density and heterogeneity may be explained by the presence of a variation of environmental conditions, which create several micro-habitats in the forest. The response of the ant community can reflect human impacts on the forests of the studied region, which are usually modified to create patches for sport fishing and by pathways used in ecotourism.

AB  - Information on N removal by maize (Zea mays L.) grain production is not only required for proper soil N management, but also a prerequisite for environmental risk assessment. The objectives of this field study were to (i) assess the variations of maize grain N removal in relation to weather and agronomic practices, and (ii) determine if a common N removal factor can be used for environment risk assessment with the Ontario N index method. Maize grain samples from four field experiments including treatments of hybrids, rotation systems and fertilizer N levels under different environmental conditions were used to determine nitrogen removal factor (grain N in kg ha(-1) divided by grain yield in Mg ha(-1), i.e. kg N Mg-1). In general, grain N removal averaged 12.0 kg N Mg-1, which is substantially smaller than 16 kg Mg-1 used in the Ontario N Index model. However, large variations (7.1-16.7 kg N Mg-1) in the N removal factor existed among years, rotation systems, hybrids and level of fertilizer N application. Our data indicate that an index using a constant grain N removal factor may not be representative of different growing conditions, hybrids and fertilizer levels. Hence, care must be taken when using a constant grain N removal factor with the N index approach to assess N overloading for nutrient management legislation purposes.

AB  - Objectives: The goal of this study is to compare both dental and skeletal stress indicators of the Classic and Post-classic coastal and inland sites of the State of Quintana Roo, Mexico. The hypothesis is that coastal populations will show osteo and dental pathologies characteristic of a primarily marine food source combined with a diet of horticultural resources. This kind of alimentation provides people with less environmental stress and therefore a better health status. However, over time, in the Postclassic period, the health conditions deteriorated among both coastal and inland inhabitants, according to the hierarchization of the society, militarization, and commercial activities of all the coastal sites.
   Methods: The sample was drawn from 19 sites (196 individuals of both sexes) from the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, as well as from inland localities within the boundaries of Quintana Roo. Both dental and osteological stress indicators were analyzed, and crosstabs were applied for absolute and relative frequencies and their corresponding chi(2) and F Fisher analyses. The osteopathological index of the coastal and inland sites of the Classic period were compared over time between the Classic coastal inhabitants and the Postclassic coastal inhabitants so as to understand how life conditions changed over time. The Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio, with the crosstabs controlling for sex (males and females), was also carried out.
   Results: There are low frequencies of dental pathologies and anemia present in both the coastal and inland populations of Quintana Roo in the Classic and Postclassic times. Only the presence of periostitis is highly common in both types of site, and this is the only indicator with significant differences. The dental pathologies, anemia and periostitis, in general, present a slight upward trend in both the coastal and inland populations over time. The coastal populations have fewer frequencies of the above than the inland sites whilst, in the Postclassic period, both the coastal and inland sites register increased frequencies of all the indicators. Linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH) is the only indicator that does not follow this tendency.
   Conclusions: The analyzed indicators are in accord with the general tendency reported in the literature. The results revealed a general trend whereby the Classic inland sites display poorer life conditions than the Classic coastal sites. In the Postclassic period, this pattern changed because the frequencies of all stress indicators increased. The explanations regarding this tendency are related to the differential access to food resources between regions; coastal people had a varied diet and better sources of protein, taking into account the culture of alimentation, the type, and the sources (in general, fish) that have an important impact on the absorption of micronutrients and therefore greater impact on local health conditions. Also, it is plausible that they were able to access imported food through commerce (such as meat and vegetables/corn). The decline in health of the coastal people in the Postclassic period was probably associated with social stratification, increasing militarism, changes in the economic corpus, new pathogens, and the decline of the power structures prevailing throughout the Classic period.

AB  - River basin governance has become increasingly challenged in many river basins around the world. At heart is the poor understanding of governance performance and its interaction with biophysical restoration targets. This paper aims to improve the Murray-Darling Basin governance for better environmental outcomes by understanding the interactions between governance performance indicators and biophysical indicators. A diagnostic framework consisting of social indicators (Collaboration, Leadership, Institutions and Learning) and biophysical indicators (River Flows, Water Quality, Biodiversity and Species Recovery) was used to estimate condition and target for each indicator from a range of stakeholder groups representing different interests and perspectives. In addition, stakeholders also measured synergistic effects of indicator progress towards target on other indicators using strength of indicator interaction scores. A network analysis of indicator condition and interaction scores was used to determine a composite enabling pathway to suggest stakeholder contributing roles to polycentric governance. Leadership and its role in regulation, compliance and operating rules is a recurring challenge mentioned by multiple stakeholder groups, requiring clarification of roles and subsidiarity decision-making through enhanced collaboration and institutional reform. The enabling pathway proposes collaborative learning by assigning co-implementation priorities based on diagnostics rather than stakeholder specific identified key challenges. This novel approach offers a tangible way for developing sectorised stakeholder engagement strategies where participation is conceived as active collaboration towards decision-making and co implementation.

AB  - With growing interest in ocean uses for sustainable economic development, there is an increasing need for cross-sectoral marine spatial planning to balance different resource uses and conservation requirements. Ecosystem service assessments can provide the evidence to inform marine spatial planning decisions. Existing case studies suggest that these assessments can also have positive effects on the engagement of marine stakeholders in management and planning processes. Stakeholder engagement is a central element in marine spatial planning and other area-based management approaches. However, in a marine context, engagement is often difficult due to the lack of clear boundaries in the ocean, traditionally sectoral marine management and limited understanding of marine ecosystems. The study presented here investigated ecosystem service assessments as a tool for improving marine stakeholder engagement. Stakeholder experiences with ecosystem service assessments in six marine management and planning case studies were analysed to identify why, how and under what conditions ecosystem service assessments can support effective engagement. The findings show that under the right conditions, ecosystem service assessments can provide an inclusive and integrative platform for engagement, enable a better understanding of marine ecosystems, human-ecosystem interactions and management contexts, and support better stakeholder relationships. Stakeholder participation also improves the evidence base for ecosystem service assessments. Thus, involving stakeholders in ecosystem service assessments can improve marine spatial planning decisions and lead to better management and conservation outcomes for the ocean.

AB  - Drawing from the existing social science literature, we examine the relationship between fossil fuel use and the adoption of policy to address climate change at the local level. In our analysis, we incorporate direct measures of fossil fuel use in a manner that allows us to distinguish carbon emissions from consumption-based and production-based activities. Focusing on the 36 most populous and urbanized counties within the state of California, we merge these emissions, along with other political and economic measures, with an indicator of extensive policy support derived from climate agreement signatories. We then use fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to examine conditions that are sufficient for broad adoption of climate policy within a given county. Based on the results, we frame consumption-based and production-based emissions as distinctive in the way that their relationship with climate policy adoption depends on other favorable political and economic conditions. In particular, we identify several routes to extensive adoption for counties that have a combination of low emissions and a favorable political environment. In the conclusion, we discuss the QCA findings and elaborate on the theoretical and practical implications for efforts to understand and to promote carbon reduction efforts at the local level.

AB  - Land planarians are an interesting group of free-living flatworms that can be useful as bioindicators because of their high sensitivity to environmental changes and low dispersal capacity. In this study, we describe and compare assemblages of land planarians from areas with different conservation degrees of the Interior Atlantic Forest (Misiones, Argentina), and assess factors that could be related to their abundance and richness. Eight sites were tracked in search of land planarians in Reserva de Vida Silvestre Urugua-i (RVSU) and Campo Anexo Manuel Belgrano (CAMB). Diurnal and nocturnal surveys were performed in each site along nine sampling campaigns. We collected 237 individuals belonging to 18 species of the subfamily Geoplaninae. All sites were dominated by Geoplana sp. 1 and Pasipha hauseri. The richness estimators showed that there would be more species in RVSU than in CAMB. The abundance and richness of land planarians was high during the night and after rainfalls, suggesting an increased activity of flatworms under such conditions. The abundance and richness of land planarians were also related to the conservation condition of the sites. Disturbed sites showed less abundance and richness, and were segregated from non-disturbed ones by nmMDS analysis. Beta diversity between sites was higher than expected, indicating that the species turnover between sites contributed more to the total richness (gamma diversity) than the alpha diversity.

AB  - Since predicted changes in climate will modify temperature and rainfall patterns, there are concerns about the potential impacts of these changes on agricultural drought and agricultural water resources management. An agricultural drought is influenced by several factors such as rainfall, soil characteristics, crops, and reservoir water supply and may be defined as the imbalance of water circulation in paddy and water environments. In particular, soil moisture and water supply for reservoir demand are the most direct and important indicators of agricultural drought events. In the past, conventional drought management approaches based on climatic and meteorological observations have been the primary tools used for measuring drought severity. Because of the spatial and temporal variability and multiple impacts of drought, it is necessary to improve tools to determine the onset, severity, spatial extent, and end of the drought conditions. Improved and available data for mapping and monitoring of this phenomenon are also needed. Effective and efficient drought management can be achieved through drought monitoring based on the ability to assess current conditions and provide improved tools to adapt and mitigate the impacts of future changes. In this article, a methodology is developed to support the risk-based decision-making process involved in agricultural drought management using the following four strategies: drought assessment and monitoring, drought forecast and outlook, drought countermeasures, and drought records management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Considering the economic importance of tomato and its nutritional benefits to human health, a study was conducted on how different environmental factors (temperature, solar radiation and vapour pressure deficit (VPD)) influence hydrogen peroxide detoxification and several stress indicators in cherry tomato (Solanurn lycopersicum cv. Naomi) fruits grown in two experimental Mediterranean greenhouses of parral (low-technology) type and multispan (high-technology) type.
   RESULTS: Three fruit samplings were made at the beginning, middle and end of the fruit production period. Values of temperature, solar radiation and VPD peaked at the third sampling in both greenhouses, being higher in the parral-type greenhouse, while there was a reduction in market production at the third sampling. Peroxidation (malondialdehyde content and lipoxygenase activity) increased significantly at the third sampling, indicating the presence of oxidative stress caused by the rise in temperature, solar radiation and VPD. The ascorbate content, the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and ascorbate peroxidase and other stress indicators (proline and sucrose degradation) also increased at the third sampling.
   CONCLUSION: This study showed that conditions of higher environmental stress occurred at the third sampling and in the parral-type greenhouse, leading to the accumulation of ascorbic acid in cherry tomato fruits and therefore to higher nutritional quality. (C) 2009 Society of Chemical industry

AB  - Forest ecosystems are subject to a variety of influences such as forest management, nitrogen deposition, changes in the groundwater level or the immigration of invasive species. The repetition of historical releves is an important means of documenting the resulting changes in plant communities and determining their main drivers. In 2015, we examined the vegetation change in 140 semi-permanent plots in managed forests in the Elbe valley in the NE German lowlands (Saxony-Anhalt, Brandenburg). The first survey took place from 1956 to 1963. The releves cover an almost uniquely broad spectrum of different site conditions, ranging from wet forests (alluvial, swamp and bog forests of Alnion incanae, Alnion glutinosae and Betulion pubescentis) to acidic mixed oak forests (Quercion roboris) up to acidic, mostly dry pine forests with different nutrient status (Dicrano-Pinion).
   We analyzed the changes in the vegetation with the help of forest stand data, winner and loser species, alpha- and beta-diversity as well as the Ellenberg indicator values for nitrogen, reaction, moisture and light. In contrast to previous resurvey studies, areas were also taken into account on which a complete change of forest stand had taken place before the second survey.
   Particularly in the wet forests and acidic forests with a moderately good nutrient supply, changes in the main tree species have been recorded, and many pine stands have been newly established in the meantime. The species richness has decreased overall and in almost all forest types, but the beta-diversity has remained unchanged or has increased. The Ellenberg values indicate a decrease in soil moisture in the wet forests, while the acidic pine forests in particular have become darker, richer in nutrients and more humid. The number of loser species is more than twice as high as that of the winner species, but with different developments in the individual forest types. In particular, the wet forests, the acidic mixed oak forests and the lichen-pine forests have lost most of their characteristic species.
   The resurvey after more than 50 years shows a different development of the individual forest types. Vegetation changes in the wet forests are mainly due to local groundwater level drawdown and the resulting increased availability of nutrients. The alluvial forests were also strongly influenced by forest interventions. The reasons for the trend towards more humid and more nutrient-rich conditions in formerly dry acidic pine and oak forests are nitrogen depositions and a succession after the abandonment of historical forms of forest use (litter raking, forest pasture). Although the individual forest types have developed differently, eutrophication, falling groundwater levels and silviculture are the most important causes for the changes in vegetation. Silvicultural interventions such as clear cutting and stand conversion with a change of tree species are at the same time the main reason why the vegetation has not been homogenized despite the leveling of the site gradient as measured by the beta-diversity.

AB  - Nuclear abnormality (NA) assay in fish has been widely applied for toxicity risk assessment under field and laboratory conditions. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has become a suitable model system for assessing the NA induced by pollutants. Thus, the current study aimed to summarize and discuss the literature concerning micronucleus (MN) and other NA in zebrafish and its applications in toxicity screening and environmental risk assessment. The data concerning the publication year, pollutant type, experimental design, and type of NA induced by pollutants were summarized. Also, molecular mechanisms that cause NA in zebrafish were discussed. Revised data showed that the MN test in zebrafish has been applied since 1996. The MN was the most frequently NA, but 15 other nuclear alterations were reported in zebrafish, such as notched nuclei, blebbed nuclei, binucleated cell, buds, lobed nuclei, bridges, and kidney-shaped. Several pollutants can induce NA in zebrafish, mainly effluents (mixture of pollutants), agrochemicals, and microplastics. The pollutant-induced NA in zebrafish depends on experimental design (i.e., exposure time, concentration, and exposure condition), developmental stages, cell/tissue type, and the type of pollutant. Besides, research gaps and recommendations for future studies are indicated. Overall, the current study showed that zebrafish is a suitable model to assess pollutant-induced mutagenicity.

AB  - This paper analyzes a moving grate biomass boiler operating with three alternative waste fuels, including biomass pellets, wood waste, and refuse-derived fuel (RDF) from a combination of thermal, economic, and environmental perspectives. The focus of this paper is on system functionality adaptation to retrofit the current systems operational conditions. A one-dimensional numerical bed model integrated with a black-box overbed model was developed to carefully investigate the fuel bed's thermal characteristics, as well as the boiler's output. According to the results, the system operates more efficiently under the biomass pellets feeding and annually generates 548 GJ heat, while it drops significantly in other scenarios. The system was economically evaluated based on a 25-year life cycle cost analysis. Subsequently, an internal rate of return (IRR) of 36% was calculated for biomass pellets, while the value reduced by 50% and 27% regarding wood waste and RDF, respectively. The fuel cost was identified as the main contributor to the total life cycle cost of the heating system, regardless of which feeding fuel was utilized. A long-term environmental impacts assessment of the boiler operation emerged, to show how plant-based fuels can significantly decrease the impacts of climate change that have originated from fossil fuel usage. The current study concludes that all the proposed scenarios are feasible to different degrees, and can extensively benefit a diverse set of energy sectors.

AB  - Invisible mercury ion is an incredibly toxic pollutant to the atmosphere. Thus a quick and sensitive detection method is of considerable importance for toxicological assessment, environmental protection and human health. A novel electrochemical sensing system has been developed for the detection of mercury (Hg2+) ions in canned tuna fish and tap water. The sensing platform was developed on the cubic copper-metal-organic framework (CuMOF) based nanoparticles. Cu-MOF has a porous architecture with a large, unique surface area that is favorable for mercury ions adsorption and preconcentration. The electrochemical properties of Cu-MOF nanoparticles modified electrode were investigated. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were applied for the detection of mercury in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) at pH 9 under ambient conditions. Under optimized conditions, the limit of detection (LOD) for Hg2+ is around 0.0633 nM with a linear range of 0.1-50 nM. Cu-MOF nanoparticles were successfully applied to the analysis of mercury ions in canned tuna fish and tap water. The developed sensor demonstrated satisfactory anti-interference, reproducibility, reliability, repeatability and applicability for the detection of mercury ions. This proof of principle serves as a steppingstone towards promoting ultrasensitive and precise assay for the detection of mercury.

AB  - The study was aimed to evaluate the adaptability and stability of the soybean genotypes based on the seed yield and the other observed characteristics in the sites cultivated second crop soybean of Turkey which have Mediterranean climate conditions using the GGE biplot analysis method. The experiments were performed under irrigated conditions in 2014, 2015 and 2016 in four different locations (Adana, Antalya, Izmir and Sanliurfa) of Turkey. Fourteen soybean genotypes consisting of 10 advanced soybean lines and four standard varieties were analyzed by a randomized complete block design with 4 replications. The combined analysis of variance revealed significant (P<0.01) effects for all sources of variation (environment, genotype, and GxE interaction) for the seed yield and yield components. Genotype and environment accounted for about 2.59% and 51.04% of the total variation for seed yield, respectively, while the GE interaction explained 20.84% of the total variation. According to the GGE principle, five mega-environments were formed in the present study. Results of the research revealed that genotypes G8 (KANA), G9 (KASM 02), G11 (ARISOY), G3 (BATEM 306), G1 (BATEM 207) and G12 (ATAEM 7) were found as stable. According to GGE Biplot analysis for all traits and genotypes, G4 (BATEM 317) had the largest values for plant height, first pod height, days to 50% flowering, days to maturity and seed yield.

AB  - The toxicological research of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) has focused on its neurotoxicity; however, many questions still remain. For example, behavioral effects other than basic locomotion are seldom reported. To further evaluate the neurobehavioral toxicity of 2, 2', 4, 4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), a typical PBDE congener in animal tissues, we employed three different exposure modes, namely, continuous, early pulse, and interval exposure, to investigate the path angle and social activity changes of zebrafish larvae exposed to BDE-47 using automated equipment (Zebrabox). The results showed that different exposure modes might have different effects on the larval path angle and social activity. BDE-47 treatments caused more responsive turns in all exposure modes in the path angle test and more contacts in most of the two-fish social tests, indicating that the neurobehavior of larvae was disturbed by BDE-47. The light condition was also a key impact factor in the effects of BDE-47. The effects of BDE-47 were different during the dark and light conditions. Our study shows a useful neurobehavioral test method for environmental pollutant monitoring and further supports the utility of zebrafish to study neurobehavior, indicating that the path angle has the potential to be a practicable behavioral indicator.

AB  - Most climate projections predict that average surface temperature and precipitation variability will increase at the global scale, triggering hydrological variations and alterations in river flows and groundwater table levels. Climate change impacts on freshwater resources are likely to affect freshwater availability and quality and by extension, the ability of water systems to support natural processes and ensure population needs. As a result, the vulnerability of water systems to adverse conditions (e.g. water shortages, overexploitation, and quality deterioration) is intensified; hence, methods and tools for vulnerability assessment and identification of adaptation measures are necessary. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for the assessment of water systems' vulnerability to adverse water related conditions and the identification of potential adaptation strategies. The proposed methodology is applied in the four study site areas of the FP7 COROADO project (selected river basins in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico), and an indicator-based framework is adopted, expressing natural, physical, socio-economic, and institutional attributes of the examined areas. The vulnerability assessment was conducted following a disaggregated analysis (use of proxy indicators). The vulnerability profiles of the four study sites were formulated, describing the factors shaping vulnerability and the aspects that need improvement. Additionally, the anticipated contribution of alternative strategies to vulnerability mitigation was assessed. The systems' response to alternative strategies (what-if scenarios) was analyzed following an aggregated analysis (estimation of an overall vulnerability index).

AB  - The recently adopted model by ICCAT Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) for the western Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABFT), Thunnus thynnus (L.) (RW = 0.0000159137 SFL3.020584, WEST), together with the model used to date (RW = 0.0000152 SFL3.0531, Ec 1) is analyzed in using a bivariant sample (SFL (cm), RW (kg)) of 698 pairs of data (K = 2.02 +/- 0.23 SD) in order to validate them and to establish the model that fits best the reality represented by the sample and, therefore, will have the greatest descriptive and predictive power. The result of the analysis indicates that the adopted model WEST clearly underestimates the weight of spawning ABFT being model Ec 1 that best explains the data of the sample. The result of the classical statistical analysis is confirmed by means of the quantile regression technique, selecting the quantiles 5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 95%. Other biological and fisheries indicators also conclude that the model WEST gradually underestimates the weight of ABFT spawners (of 2-3 m) by 11-13%, does not meet the criterion that for RW = 725 kg (W-max), SFL = 319.93 +/- 11.3 cm (L-max), and the average value of K (1.77) obtained for a wide range of size-weight values, using WEST model, represents ABFT in low fattening condition.

AB  - The trace fossil Macaronichnus is reported for the first time from low-latitude, tropical settings based on its occurrence in nearshore deposits in the Upper Oligocene-Lower Miocene Naricual Formation and in the Middle to Upper Miocene Urumaco Formation in northern Venezuela. Macaronichnus is an intrastratal trace fossil attributed to the deposit-feeding of worms in high-energy, sandy shallow-marine environments. The majority of its occurrences are from Mesozoic to Cenozoic high-to intermediate-latitude shorelines. The opheliid polychaetes Ophelia limacina and Euzonus mucronata make structures identical to those described from the fossil record in modern intertidal and shallow subtidal sediments of northwestern United States, western Canada, and Japan. Macaronichnus shows a geographical and environmental distribution in the fossil record similar to that of its modern producers and has been proposed as an indicator of high to intermediate latitudes. Accordingly, its presence in the Neogene of Venezuela is highly anomalous and seems to challenge its paleoclimatic value. However, this occurrence may be related to seasonal coastal upwelling of nutrient-rich cold waters. Such oceanographic conditions were prevalent in the northern coast of South America, at least from the Late Oligocene to the Early Pliocene prior to the final closure of the strait of Panama. This study underscores the value of Macaronichnus because its presence in the tropics may indicate upwelling conditions, providing high-resolution information in paleoceanographic reconstructions.

AB  - The magnitude of the environmental and social consequences of soil erosion and land degradation in semiarid areas of the Mediterranean region has long been recognized and studied. This paper investigates the interrelationship between land use/cover (LULC) changes and land degradation using remotely sensed and ancillary data for southeastern Spain. The area of study, the Xalo River catchment situated in the north of the Alicante Province, has been subjected to a number of LULC changes during the second half of the 20th century such as agricultural abandonment, forest fires, and tourist development. Aerial photographs dating back to 1956 were used for the delineation of historic LULC types; Landsat ETM+ data were used for the analysis and mapping of current conditions. Two important indicators of land degradation, namely, susceptibility to surface runoff and soil erosion, were estimated for the two dates using easily parametrizable models. The comparison of 1956 to 2000 conditions shows an overall "recuperating" trend over the catchment and increased susceptibility to soil erosion only in 3% of the catchment area. The results also identify potential degradation hot-spots where mitigation measures should be taken to prevent further degradation. The readily implemented methodology, based on modest data requirements demonstrated by this study, is a useful tool for catchment to regional scale land use change and land degradation studies and strategic planning for environmental management.

AB  - The close relation between metabolic activity and heat release means that calorimetry can be successfully applied for on-line monitoring of biological processes. Since the use of available calorimeters in biotechnology is difficult because of technical limitations, a new sensitive heat-flux calorimeter working as a laboratory fermenter was developed and tested for different aerobic and anaerobic fermentations with Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Zymomonas mobilis. The aim of the experiments was to demonstrate the abilities of the method for biotechnological purposes. Fermentations as well as the corresponding heat, substrate and product analyses were reproducible. During experiments the heat signal was used as a sensitive and fast indicator for the response of the organisms to changing conditions. One topic was the monitoring of diauxic growth phenomena during batch fermentations, which may affect process productivity. S. cerevisiae was used as the test organism and a protease-excreting Bacillus licheniformis strain as an industrial production system. Other experiments focused on heat measurements in continuous culture under substrate-limiting conditions in order to analyse bacterial nutrient requirements. Again, Z. mobilis was used as the test organism. Ammonium, phosphate, magnesium, biotin and panthothenate, as important substrate compounds, were varied. The results indicate that these nutrients are required in lower amounts for growth than formerly suggested. Thus, a combination of heat measurements and other methods may rapidly improve our knowledge of nutrient requirements even for a well-known microorganism like Z. mobilis.

AB  - Despite phosphorus resources on Earth being limited, over fertilization in many agricultural situations causes significant resource consumption. Phosphorus-recycling within agricultural production can reduce global dilution into the environment and is thus essential to secure sustainable future supply. This study investigated the fertilization efficacy of phosphorus fertilizers recycled from biogas digestates in maize shoots grown under controlled greenhouse conditions, in two soils, in a pot experiment. Variables investigated were plant-available phosphorus in soil, plant biomass production, and concentration of phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium in shoots. Soils were treated with three different fertilizer fractions, separated from biogas digestates, at equivalent phosphorus concentrations, using different combinations and application techniques, isolated or in combination, and compared to triple superphosphate (TSP) as a reference. One of the fractions (P-Salt) had effects on biomass production and plant phosphorus concentration equivalent to TSP in agricultural surface soil. In the second soil (with less active soil life and nutrient content), equivalence to TSP was achieved with combinations of two recycled fractions (P-Salt and dried solids). The enhancement of the phosphorus fertilizing effect by the solids was synergistic, indicating that the solids had a soil conditioning effect. The results show that biogas digestates are a valuable source for phosphorus recycling of fractions that have equivalent or even superior fertilizing properties compared to TSP.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to introduce a new thermodynamic system where hot water, heating, cooling, dry air (conditioned air) and electricity are generated from a single source of clean energy. The proposed multi generation system consists of a solar-driven organic Rankine cycle integrated with a series type of triple effect absorption chiller that employs LiBr-H2O as working fluid. In addition, a new molten salt, NaCl-MgCL2, which is utilized in the solar block is investigated. The present work has two main parts; in the first part, an energetic and exergetic analysis of the system is carried out. In the second part, an environmental assessment of the system is conducted. Engineering Equation Solver (EES) is used to determine the above mentioned productions. Finally, the effects of various operating conditions and configurations on the aforementioned outputs are discussed. The results show that the system has the exergetic utilization factor of 0.39 based on generating electricity of 428 kW. Furthermore, the energetic COP of absorption chiller is determined to be 1.34. In the proposed system, the energetic and exergetic efficiencies of organic Rankine cycle are 14.4 and 26%, respectively. In addition, environmental analysis shows the system can be more beneficial for the environment with a low ambient temperature.

AB  - Environmental risk assessment is required for genetically modified (GM) crops before their import into Japan. Annual roadside monitoring along transportation routes from ports to processing facilities for GM soybean (Glycine max (L.) Men.) have been requested as a condition of import only approval because of lack of information on the likelihood of persistence of imported GM soybean for food, feed and processing and the potential for transfer of transgenes into wild soybean (Glycine sofa Seib. et Zucc.) through gene flow under the Japanese environment. The survey of soybean seeds, plants and wild soybean populations were conducted along transportation routes from unloading ports to processing facilities that provided data to help quantify actual exposure. The survey indicated that the opportunities for co-existence and subsequent crossing between wild soybean populations and imported soybean are highly unlikely. Together the survey results and the comprehensive literature review demonstrated low exposure of imported GM soybean used for food, feed and processing in Japan. This evaluation of exposure level is not specific to particular GM soybean event but can apply to any GM soybean traits used for food, feed and processing if their weediness or invasiveness are the same as those of the conventional soybean.

AB  - Chlorophyll (Chl) a/b ratio has been predicted to increase with the increase in irradiance but responds differently under varying nitrogen (N) availability. Since few studies have ever examined light and N stress among plants in arid ecosystems, this study attempted to understand such phenomenon in Haloxylon ammodendron (C. A. Meyer) Bunge at Gurbantunggut Desert, China, by investigating the seasonal trend in Chl a/b ratio relative to light and N content during the three-year growing seasons. The results revealed that regardless of irradiance, Chl a/b ratio increased with the progression in seasonal courses while chlorophyll concentration [Chl] decreased relative to the decrease in N content. N was negatively correlated to Chl a/b ratio and positively correlated to [Chl]. Adaptation to light/shade conditions did not affect Chl a/b ratios and hence contradicted the universal application of low Chl a/b ratio as an indicator of shade tolerance in plant species. Our results suggests that although morphological adaptations "assimilating shoots" enhances the species survival in the fragile arid ecosystem, water availability and N are probably the main drivers of biochemical plasticity. Although our results challenges the universal application of Chl a/b ratio to classify sun/shade plants under field condition, these ratios can be applied for rapid detection of plant stress in arid ecosystems, especially when combined with concomitant measurement of N.

AB  - Vertebrate pigmentation is known to be influenced by oxidative stress, but few studies have tested the hypothesis that structural coloration can be similarly affected. We tested whether fish iridophores, which produce structural color using guanine stacks, might be affected by the prooxidant-antioxidant balance of the animal. Specifically, we hypothesized that convict cichlids (Amatitlania nigrofasciata) metabolize guanine present in iridophores to uric acid, an antioxidant, in response to oxidative damage. We used Hunter's contrast gloss and high performance liquid chromatography to determine whether dietary guanine supplementation allows fish to maintain their structural coloration despite oxidative stress induced via ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation. We found that dietary guanine was associated with greater skin gloss, and that exposure to UV-B light reduced glossiness. UV-B exposure did not increase oxidative damage (acrolein) or total antioxidant capacity in the skin or liver. Our experiment did not detect effects of dietary guanine or UV-B light on uric acid, but uric acid was positively related to antioxidant capacity. Our results support the hypothesis that structural color in fish may be altered by environmental stressors such as exposure to UV light, and highlight the need for future studies to consider the role of iridophores in condition-dependent visual signaling.

AB  - The main aim of this work is to study the influence of a roof monitor skylight on comfort criteria. The roof monitor skylight simultaneously provides lighting and outdoor ventilation air for a living room or a master bedroom in a house with an underfloor heating/cooling system. The air is introduced into the room through an air inlet in the carpentry of the opening in the roof monitor skylight and located - for the purposes of this study - in different positions in the carpentry. To evaluate the comfort variations caused by this change of position, a series of lighting and thermal numerical indicators are applied to a set of simulation models, generating a complete analysis to determine optimal positions for the air inlet. These models are designed for the context of a Mediterranean climate, with extreme calculation conditions (overcast sky in winter and clear sky in summer). The simulation tools Daylight Visualizer 2.5 and Design Builder 2.42 have been selected to generate the models. This work concludes that the optimal position for the air inlet is in the side of the carpentry of the roof monitor skylight opening, ensuring the maximization of both lighting and thermal comfort conditions.

AB  - In an intensive study of the vertical and horizontal distribution of zooplankton in a eutrophic lake (Katepwa Lake), we found that only adult Leptodora kindtii (> 5 mm in body size) exhibited diel vertical migration (DVM), whereas juvenile Leptodora (< 5 mm) and other zooplankton species did not. Even though a longitudinal survey of five lakes (1994-2004) indicated that variation in Leptodora density was correlated with several indicators of habitat use (e.g., water temperature) and resource availability (e. g., zooplankton abundance), feeding experiments performed in both lit and unlit conditions demonstrated that a vertebrate predator (perch) strongly reduced Leptodora abundances under all conditions and always preferentially selected large-bodied individuals. Collectively, this evidence suggests that the migratory behavior of large Leptodora is consistent with an anti-predator defense strategy. To estimate the ecological significance of Leptodora DVM behavior, we modeled how predation rates on different zooplankton taxa differed between day and night in Katepwa Lake. We found that Leptodora had as much as five-fold higher prey-specific predation rates at night, particularly for intermediatesized prey. We conclude that ignoring the habitat use, size-structure, and vertical migration behavior of Leptodora could considerably underestimate the significance of invertebrate predation in lake food webs, particularly in eutrophic lakes where Leptodora can coexist at high densities with planktivorous fish.

AB  - Riparian condition is commonly measured as part of stream health monitoring programs as riparian vegetation provides an intricate linkage between the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Field surveys of a riparian zone provide comprehensive riparian attribute data but can be considerably intensive and onerous on resources and workers. Our objective was to assess the impact of reducing the sampling effort on the variation in key riparian health indicators. Subsequently, we developed a non-parametric approach to calculate an information retained (IR) statistic for comparing several constrained systematic sampling schemes to the original survey. The IR statistic is used to select a scheme that reduces the time taken to undertake riparian surveys (and thus potentially the costs) whilst maximising the IR from the original survey. Approximate bootstrap confidence intervals were calculated to improve the inferential capability of the IR statistic. The approach is demonstrated using riparian vegetation indicators collected as part of an aquatic ecosystem health monitoring program in Queensland, Australia. Of the nine alternative sampling designs considered, the sampling design that reduced the sampling intensity per site by sixfold without significantly comprising the quality of the IR, results in halving the time taken to complete a riparian survey at a site. This approach could also be applied to reducing sampling effort involved in monitoring other ecosystem health indicators, where an intensive systematic sampling scheme was initially employed.

AB  - Zoltan Batori, Janos Csiky, Laszlo Erdos, Tamas Morschhauser, Peter Torok & Laszlo Kormoczi: Vegetation of the dolines in Mecsek mountains (South Hungary) in relation to the local plant communities
   This paper deals with the forest vegetation of the lower part of the dolines in Mecsek Mts. (South Hungary). In order to characterize this vegetation type, samples were compared to the 6 Plant communities Occurring in the neighbourhood of the dolines. Considering the vegetation texture and species composition, the vegetation of the dolines resembles mainly the extrazonal beechwoods (Helleboro odori-Fagetum) and local ravine forests (Scutellario altissimae-Aceretum) that preserve several Mountain, subatlantic relict species in this area. Our study revealed that the plant communities characteristic of the karst Surface of Western Mecsek are arranged along a moisture and nutrient gradient. In this system, the habitat conditions of the dolines are similar to those of the beech forests and the local ravine forests, fresh and relatively rich in nutrients. In the karst, dominated by oak-hornbeam and beech forests, effects of the thermal inversion are the most spectacular where beech forests follow turkey oak-sessile oak forests and oak-hornbeam forests on the lower part of the doline slopes. The described vegetation type of these depressions is developed by edafic factors; its identification as a separate association is not supported by the analyses.

AB  - The potential to provide environmental proxies using stable carbon isotopes from modern and archaeological charcoal is explored. Experiments on modern Podocarpus (Yellowwoods) show that delta C-13 values of stems, branches and charcoal preserve proxy environmental conditions, including rainfall, humidity and temperature. An additional experiment showed that combustion temperature affects the carbon isotope signature of charcoal. Burning at 450 degrees C to 500 degrees C depletes delta C-13 values with respect to the original wood, but the charcoal retains the seasonal and inter-annual isotopic trends recorded during the growth of the tree.
   The delta C-13 of Podocarpus charcoal from three levels from the Middle Stone Age site of Sibudu Cave, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, was compared with modern analogues from two different environments, Seaton Park (KwaZulu-Natal) and the Baviaans Kloof (Eastern Cape). Other environmental proxies from levels dated from >70 ka and similar to 48 ka, show that environmental conditions changed from warmer and wetter to colder and drier and finally becoming warmer and drier. The isotope data is consistent with this reconstruction. The results from this series of experiments indicate that it is possible to obtain meaningful palaeoenvironmental information from delta C-13 values of archaeological charcoal. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Environmental variations can be recorded in bivalve shells, and this proxy information can be crucial for paleoceanographic studies in regions where other proxies (e.g. corals) are absent. We present the first sclerochronological study of Protothaca thaca (Mollusca, Veneridae), a common upper subtidal bivalve, characterized by a high temperature tolerance, from the SE Pacific Ocean (12 to 45 degrees S). P. thaca is present in archaeological deposits and Holocene marine terraces, making it a potentially useful paleo-environmental recorder, particularly in respect to El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) reconstructions. The sclerochronological analysis of recent P. thaca shells from Peru and Chile was done by microscopy of thin sections and acetate peel replicates; it shows that a clear 'summer check' (SC) is formed in the shell when sea surface temperature (SST) exceeds 18 degrees C for several weeks. Under La Nina conditions in summer, SCs can be absent due to lower SST and enhanced productivity. During the strong 1997-1998 El Nino, long-lasting high summer SST produced an SC > 520 mu m wide. The relative width of SC on fossil shells may thus be an indicator of paleo-ENSO events. Our sclerochronological analysis has established a temporal framework in P. thaca shells, providing precise time-series analytical profiles, which is a prerequisite for future calibration of geochemical proxies.

AB  - The c-myc protein was one of the first proto-oncogene products to be linked to the increased proliferative activity of neoplastic cells. However, few studies have attempted to quantify changes occurring in cellular c-myc protein content in response to growth-inhibitory conditions, or to relate such changes to total cellular protein (TCP) levels, %S phase cells and/or cellular growth balance. Knowledge of such relationships is important for determining the biological relevance of the c-myc protein as a marker for proliferating cells. In this study, a dual-laser flow cytometric technique employing three fluorescent dyes was used to quantify cellular changes in c-myc protein, TCP, DNA and growth balance in exponentially-growing and serum deprived U118MG, A-172 and HL-60 cells. Results obtained by flow cytometry were verified using other techniques. Changes in c-myc protein content were found to occur independently of changes in TCP, %S phase or cellular growth balance, and varied between cell lines. These results indicate that cellular c-myc protein determinations convey information that is unique from other indicators of cellular growth and proliferation. Such information may be linked, however, to the nutritional status and origin of the cells being assayed.

AB  - The soil surface diurnal temperature range (SSDTR), reflecting the synchronicity of changes in the daily extremes of soil surface temperatures, provides an important and sensitive indicator of climate change. The climatology of SSDTR and its trends have a strong connection with the land surface energy budget, but this has received little notice up to now. Our research examines the spatial-temporal characteristics of the annual cycle of SSDTR and its connection with other climate variables in China. The results demonstrate that the annual SSDTR curve changes gradually across space, with both regional and zonal characteristics. The shape of the annual SSDTR curve varies among regions. While it shows consistently strong positive associations with solar irradiance across China, a strong negative association with relative humidity is evident only in the dry western regions and the connection with relative humidity progressively decouples as we move toward the moist eastern regions. Atmospheric circulation affects SSDTR indirectly through derived changes in the seasonal cycles of moisture and solar irradiance. This produces a zonal character of the SSDTR annual curve in the east, while in the west the positive land-atmosphere feedback under low moisture conditions is associated with a regional character. The magnitude of the annual cycle of SSDTR is large compared with temporal change, contributing to the generally stable nature of the cycle under global warming conditions.

AB  - Microbial presence and regrowth in drinking water distribution systems (DWDSs) is routinely monitored to assess the biological stability of drinking water without a residual disinfectant, but the conventional microbiological culture methods currently used target only a very small fraction of the complete DWDS microbiome. Here, we sequenced 16S rRNA gene amplicons to elucidate the attached and suspended prokaryotic community dynamics within three nonchlorinated DWDSs with variable regrowth conditions distributing similarly treated surface water from the same source. One rural location, with less regrowth related issues, differed most strikingly from the other two urban locations by the exclusive presence of Pseudonocardia (Actinobacteria) in the biofilm and the absence of Limnobacter (Betaproteobacteriales) in the water and loose deposits during summer. There was a dominant seasonal effect on the drinking water microbiomes at all three locations. For one urban location, it was established that the most significant changes in the microbial community composition on a spatial scale occurred shortly after freshly treated water entered the DWDS. However, summerly regrowth of Limnobacter, one of the dominant genera in the distributed drinking water, already occurred in the clean water reservoir at the treatment plant before further distribution. The highlighted bacterial lineages within these highly diverse DWDS communities might be important new indicators for undesirable regrowth conditions affecting the final drinking water quality.

AB  - Bank filtration (BF) and soil aquifer treatment (SAT) are efficient natural technologies in potable water reuse systems. The removal of many organic micro-pollutants (OMPs) depends on redox-conditions in the subsoil, especially on the availability of molecular oxygen. Due to microbial transformation of particulate and dissolved organic constituents, oxygen can be consumed within short flow distances and induce anoxic and anaerobic conditions. The effect of accumulated particulate organic carbon (POC) on the fate of OMPs in BF and SAT systems is not fully understood. Long-term column experiments with natural sediment cores from the bank of Lake Tegel and from a SAT basin were conducted to investigate the impact of accumulated POC on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release, on oxygen consumption, on mobilization of iron and manganese, and on the elimination of the organic indicator OMPs. The cores were fed with aerated tap water spiked with OMPs to exclude external POC inputs. Complete oxygen consumption within the first infiltration decimeter in lake sediments caused mobilization of iron, manganese, and DOC. Redox-sensitive OMPs like diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole, formylaminoantipyrine, and gabapentin were eliminated by more than 50% in all sediment cores, but slightly higher residual concentrations were measured in effluents from lake sediments, indicating a negative impact of a high oxygen consumption on OMP removal.

AB  - An approach for assessing the potential ecologic response of groundwater-dependent riparian vegetation to flow alteration is developed, focusing on change to groundwater. Groundwater requirements for riparian vegetation are reviewed in conjunction with flow alteration statistics. Where flow alteration coincides with groundwater-related vegetation sensitivities, scenarios are developed for groundwater simulation. Groundwater depths and recession rates in the riparian zone are simulated for baseline and altered stream hydrographs, with changes to river stage and width represented with a transient, flow-dependent boundary condition. Potential flow diversion from the Upper Gila River in New Mexico is examined. Statistical flow alteration analysis, applying prospective diversions to a 76-year record of daily flow, shows that flows in the winter-spring months and within the high-pulse to small flood range are subject to greatest potential change. Groundwater simulation scenarios are developed for these flow conditions in representative dry, near-average, and wet years. Differences in groundwater elevations, generally less than 0.25 m during the flow alteration period, dissipate rapidly following cessation of diversion. Relating groundwater depth, recession rates and range of fluctuations to riparian vegetation needs, we find adverse ecological response is not expected from groundwater impacts for the flow alteration examined.

AB  - Although previous studies have related variations in environmental noise levels with alterations in communication behaviors of birds, little work has investigated the potential long-term implications of living or breeding in noisy habitats. However, noise has the potential to reduce fitness, both directly (because it is a physiological stressor) and indirectly (by masking important vocalizations and/or leading to behavioral changes). Here, we quantified acoustic conditions in active breeding territories of male Eastern Bluebirds (Sialia sialis). Simultaneously, we measured four fitness indicators: cuckoldry rates, brood growth rate and condition, and number of fledglings produced (i.e., productivity). Increases in environmental noise tended to be associated with smaller brood sizes and were more strongly related to reductions in productivity. Although the mechanism responsible for these patterns is not yet clear, the breeding depression experienced by this otherwise disturbance-tolerant species indicates that anthropogenic noise may have damaging effects on individual fitness and, by extraction, the persistence of populations in noisy habitats. We suggest that managers might protect avian residents from potentially harmful noise by keeping acoustically dominant anthropogenic habitat features as far as possible from favored songbird breeding habitats, limiting noisy human activities, and/or altering habitat structure in order to minimize the propagation of noise pollution.

AB  - The Pliensbachian rhythmite of Asturias (Northern Spain) consists of alternating layers of limestone and marl of postdepositional origin. The sediments are organized in shallowing upwards parasequences of varying energy. Minor scale microcycles are found within the parasequences which probably represent the record of sudden high energy events alternating with quiet hemipelagic or pelagic sedimentation. Organic petrographic and geochemical study of different marry samples throughout the sections did not show significant compositional differences. There are three laterally equivalent intervals with higher TOC and total sulphur contents, higher concentration of aromatic compounds and heterocompounds, higher Pr/n-C-17 and Phy/n-C-18 ratios, and lower Pr/Phy ratio and CPI values. These intervals correspond to the end of the jamesoni zone, the boundary of the ibex and davoei zones and especially the lower part of the margaritatus zone. The uniformity of petrographic and qualitative chemical composition throughout the sections indicates that the nature of the organic matter supply did not change significantly during sedimentation, implying that changes in the conditions of preservation were likely responsible for the formation of the organic-rich intervals. Lower dissolved oxygen conditions probably produced a higher preservation of both organic carbon and aromatic and heterocompounds, as indicated by the fluorescence properties and the infrared spectra of the extracts.

AB  - The Ordovician Trenton Group (Sherman Fall and Cobourg formations) and the Lindsay (Collingwood Member) and Blue Mountain formations of southwestern Ontario were examined using Rock-Eval pyrolysis, gas chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry,and incident-light microscopy to evaluate their paleodepositional environments, thermal maturities, and source rock potential. All units contain sufficient amount of oil-prone (type II), predominantly marine organic matter to be considered as petroleum source rocks; Unstructured bituminite with varying proportions of unicellular alginite are the dominant dispersed organic matter macerals. The bituminite typically occurs in massive to laminated, granular or patchy populations that commonly show microtextural relationships. Persistent inclusions of Leiosphaeridia telalganite demonstrate that planktonic algal debris was a primary organic substrate for blooming microbes. Disseminated coccoidal Gloeocapsomorpha prisca is found in minor amounts, usually in association with common to abundant acritarchs, Zooclasts (chitinozoa, graptolites, scolecodonts)and solid bitumen also are present as maceral inclusions within the bituminite network.
   The biomarker distributions for all of the studied units are those expected for marine organic matter deposited in a elastic-dominated environment. The extracts are characterized by a smooth n-alkane profile, with low abundance of C20+ members, typical for marine derived organic matter. Pristane/phytane ratios range from 0.37 to 1.72, indicating dysoxic conditions during deposition. Smooth C-31-C-35 homohopane profiles, T-s/T-m ratios (typically above 1.0), and a higher concentration of diasteranes relative to regular steranes all appear to indicate the clay-bearing character of these rocks. The predominance of C-30 hopane over C-29 regular sterane is interpreted to reflect a primary microbial input and extensive reworking of the organic matter.
   Optical (reflectance, fluorescence) and geochemical <T-max, biomarker data) thermal maturity parameters indicate that the Trenton and Blue Mountain strata are within the zone of prolific oil generation throughout the whole area of study. The Collingwood shales are mature with respect to petroleum generation in the eastern part (Toronto area) and only marginally mature in the northern part (Georgian Bay area) of the study area. In general, the biomarker composition of the extracts from all examined units is compatible with that of the oils found in the Trenton reservoirs of southwestern Ontario; however, geochemical and geological evidence suggests that the organic-rich shaly laminae within the Trenton Group are the principal source of these oils.
   Accumulation of organic carbon in the Ordovician sediments of southern Ontario is suggested to derive from low-energy, normal-marine environments grading from shallow-shelf into deep-shelf and open-basinal settings. The nutrient availability and, consequently, higher bioproductivity, more intense consumption of oxygen, and progressing anoxia, controlled by a low-latitude location, diminished water circulation, stratification of the water column, and a depressed pycnocline resulted in high preservation rates. The amorphous nature of kerogen reflects significant microbial interaction at the water/ sediment interface and within the sediments where reducing conditions must have periodically predominated.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate associations of freestall design and cleanliness with cow lying behavior, hygiene, lameness, and risk of new high somatic cell count (SCC). Cows from 18 commercial freestall dairy herds (22 +/- 15 cows/farm; mean +/- SD) in Ontario, Canada, were enrolled in a longitudinal study. Four hundred focal cows that were <120 d in milk, had no mastitis treatment in the last 3 mo, and had an SCC <100,000 cells/mL at their most recent milk test were selected for the study. Data on SCC were collected through Dairy Herd Improvement Association milk testing (at similar to 5-wk intervals). Each farm was visited 5 +/- 3 d (mean +/- SD) after each milk test until 3 tests were completed (similar to 105 d), for a total of 3 observation periods per cow. Elevated SCC was used as an indicator of subclinical mastitis. An incident of new high SCC was defined as a cow having SCC >200,000 cells/mL at the end of an observation period, when SCC was <100,000 cells/mL at the beginning of that period. Lying behavior was recorded for 6 d after each milk sampling, using electronic data loggers. Cows were scored during each period for lameness (5-point scale, with scores >= 3 = lame), body condition score (BCS; 5-point scale; 1 = thin to 5 = fat), arid hygiene (4-point scale). Stall cleanliness was assessed during each period with a 1.20 x 1.65-m metal grid, containing 88 squares. The grid was centered between stall partitions of every tenth stall on each farm, and the squares containing visible urine or fecal matter (or both) were counted. Cow lying time averaged 10.9 +/- 1.9 h/d. On average, cows with low BCS (<= 2.5) spent 37 +/- 16.6 min/d less time lying down than high-BCS cows (>= 4.0). On average, cows tended to spend 36 +/- 18.3 min/d more time lying down in deep-bedded versus mattress-based stalls. Mean proportion of soiled squares per stall was 20.1 +/- 0.50%. Across farms, cow lying time decreased as the proportion of soiled squares per stall increased. A difference in daily lying time of similar to 80 more min/d was modeled for cows housed in barns with the cleanest stalls compared with those with the dirtiest stalls. Higher neck rail height [for every 1 SD (10 cm) increase] increased the odds (odds ratio = 1.5) of cows having a dirty upper leg flank arid udder. The odds of a cow having a dirty upper leg-flank, udder, and lower legs were 1.5, 2.0, and 1.9 times greater, respectively, for cows housed with dirtier stalls. Also, cows housed on farms with dirtier stalls had 1.3 times greater odds of being lame at the time of observation. Over the study period, 50 new high-SCC cases were detected, resulting in an incidence rate of 0.45 cases of new high SCC per cow-year at risk. No measured factors were detected to be associated with risk of a new high SCC. Overall, our results confirm that cows lie down longer in cleaner and more comfortable environments. Further, these results highlight the need for improved stall cleanliness to optimize lying time and potentially reduce lameness.

AB  - The organic geochemistry is studied for the rocks of three Jurassic formations: Sargelu, Naokelekan, and Chia Gara from the north of Iraq. These rocks comprise bituminous carbonate and shale rocks. The hydrocarbon source rock potential is evaluated by using total organic carbon (TOC) and Rock-Eval Pyrolysis. The prevalence of high values of TOC (2.21-45.12 wt.%) associated with moderate to high values of HI (225-550 mg HC/g TOC), low OI (1-33 CO2/g TOC), and high S2 values (4.53-181.0) indicate very good to excellent source rock potential for these rocks with mostly type II kerogen and few mixed-type II/III kerogen of oil prone source rocks. This is supported by high values of S2/S3 ratios (> 5). Tmax values range from 440 to 447 A degrees C in agreement with the calculated R (o) values (0.76-0.90) infer early to peak thermally mature stage. Based on the TOC and pyrolysis data, the rocks of the three formations have indigenous hydrocarbon mature oil prone. The geochemical investigation of biomarker parameters were performed for oil samples from two oil seepages (Banik and Tawke) which are located in the same area using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and stable carbon isotope measurements. The measured values of Pr/n-C17 for oil samples are low coupled with high values of Ph/n-C18 indicating marine organic matters with type II kerogen accumulated under marine reducing condition. The values and plots of delta C-13 (saturate and aromatic) also approve the prevalence of marine reducing condition. The source rocks for the oils of both seepages are interpreted to be carbonate rocks of Mesozoic age by the measured CV values which are < 0.47. These oils are characterized by high values of tricyclic terpane C22/C21, low values of C24/C23, C26/C25, and C31R/C30 hopane ratio > 0.25. All these data are in consistent with marine carbonate source rocks for these oils. The paleoredox depositional environment for the source rocks is interpreted by the low value of Pr/Ph (0.74 in Banik) and high values of homohopane ratio C35S/C34S (1.21 in Banik and 1.13 in Tawke); the values of C29/C30 (norhopane/hopane > 1) as well as the high sulfur content all indicate reducing condition during the deposition of the marine source rocks. The concentrations of C27, C28, and C29 reflect the prevalence of marine algal plankton organic matters. The measured Oleanane index equal zero which indicates age older than Lower Cretaceous for the source rocks. This documented by the calculated values of C28/C29 sterane ratio, and plots on Geomark Research database gives an age of Middle-Upper Jurassic for the source rocks. According to the characteristics of depositional environment of the source rocks, the paleoredox condition, and age estimation, the oils of Banik and Tawke could be derived from the rocks of Sargelu, Naokelekan, and Chia Gara Formations.

AB  - Background: Some additives are able to improve animal performance in growing and finishing periods. Monensin was first used to control coccidiosis in poultry and was extended to other animals, like ruminants, to act also as a growth promoter and improve cattle performance. In this species, monensin improves the synthesis of propionic acid in the rumen and decreases methane synthesis and protein degradation, resulting in better performance in protein and energy metabolism. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of monensin controlled-release capsules on animals grazing Lolium multiflorum intercropped with Trifolium repens on metabolic profile and performance.
   Materials, Methods & Results: Thirty Hereford cows were randomly distributed into two groups: control (CG) and monensin group (MG). Monensin was individually administered by controlled-release capsules placed in the rumen through oroesophageal pathway. All animals were identified through earring and kept under the same management condition, grazing on upland pasture mixture of Trifolium repens and Lolium multiflorum. Data from biochemical profile and performance were collected during 45 days. Blood samples started on the day of monensin controlled-release capsule placement (day 0) and continued in periods of 15, 30 and 45 days, after initial placement. Serum levels of albumin, glucose, urea, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were evaluated using colorimetric diagnostic kits. In the rumen fluid, pH was measured and protozoa count was performed. All statistical analyses were made using software SAS. Albumin, AST, glucose, LDH and urea were analyzed through MIXED procedure and Tukey-Kramer test was applied for comparison of means. For average daily gain, the orthogonal polynomials test was applied. Treatments did not differ in BSC, body weight and average daily gain (ADG). None of these performance parameters were significantly affected by the addition of monensin. Blood biomarkers did not show statistical differences between treatments and markers of rumen activity did not suffer interference from monensin supplementation. There was only a tendency (P = 0.07) for the first time (0) to a higher pH value in CG.
   Discussion: Animals grazing in the finishing period, characterized by a continuous and linear weight gain, did not suffer any kind of stress situation. This condition did not provide a striking challenge that could reach the level of a metabolic change in animals. Facing feed shortages, or other stressful condition, supplementation with monensin and other additives, such as yeast, showed to be more effective, compared to animals in nutritional comfort. Weight gain increase is related to the expected changes in biochemical profile, as increased AST, glucose and LDH. The increase in AST levels on day 30 (P < 0.0001) is explained by the greater weight gain of animals in the previous period (day 15, P < 0.0001), where there was a higher hepatic activity to meet this anabolism and also by AST been an enzyme indicator of liver activity. This study did not show statistical treatment differences in relation to ruminal pH but, just a trend (P = 0.07) of higher pH in CG which is not caused by monensin supplementation that occurred since the first time (0), when animals were moved to pasture and receiving the monensin capsule. Since there was a low consumption of monensin capsules, the results were consistent with environment conditions and the phase in which the animals were. The results were also in agreement with finishing period, metabolic changes and animal performance at the same moment.

AB  - Pupienis, D., Buynevich, I. V. and Bitinas, A., 2011. Distribution and significance of heavy-mineral concentrations along the southeast Baltic Sea coast. Journal of Coastal Research, SI 64 (Proceedings of the 11th International Coastal Symposium), 1984 - 1988. Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208
   Heavy mineral concentrations (HMCs) in coastal sands are important from both scientific and practical standpoints. On one hand, they may serve as local sources of iron and other economically important metals, and on the other they are good indicators of hydro-meteorological and sedimentological conditions along the coast. A variety of HMC types have been documented in beach, foredune, and relict dune environments of Lithuania. The study region is located along the Curonian Spit (Nida) and mainland coast (Butinge). The ocean beach sites range from 25 to 35 m in width and are backed by 5-10 m-high foredunes. The Great Dune Ridge on the Curonian Spit consists of relict (mid-late Holocene) dunes which are the highest coastal dunes in Northern Europe (more than 60 m above sea level). The prevailing westerly winds attain speeds of 4.2 m/s in the summer and 5.5 m/s in autumn and winter. Along the southeast Baltic Sea coast, quartz and feldspars-rich sands contain variable amounts (1-8%) of heavy minerals, such as garnet, rutile, zircon, magnetite, ilmenite, hornblende, and other accessory minerals. On the beach, HMCs typically range in thickness from 0.1 to more than 3.0 cm and represent increased wave and run-up regime. Based on previous studies of coastal morphodynamics and field observations during 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2010 enriched horizons near the foot of the foredune are the result of storm reworking and subsequent aeolian deflation. Similar process concentrates almandine garnet and magnetite along the Curonian Lagoon shoreline, on the opposite side from the Nida beach site. Based on their occurrence in the Great Dune Ridge, we suggest that buried HMCs likely represent periods of increased wind activity (storminess). Due to their relatively high fraction of heavy minerals, HMCs have substantially higher magnetic susceptibility (MS) values than background quartz-rich sands and, where well developed, they can be used for spatial correlation of subsurface horizons. Therefore, the MS method was used as a tool for cataloguing the properties of HMCs in the field and in the laboratory. For documenting lithological differences between exposed heavy-mineral concentrations and background quartz-rich sands, this study focused on coastal environments with different sedimentary regimes: 1) surface profile and shallow trenches through the upper berm at Bating (wave run-up setting along the mainland shoreline); 2) a 40-m-long shore-normal beach profile at Nida on the Baltic Sea shoreline of the Curonian Spit, (mixed wave/aeolian conditions) and 3) a short surface profile along a lagoon beach at the base of the Paranidis Dune (the landward side of the spit). The 2008 and 2010 data were compared to previous studies of the HMCs in relict dunes (exclusively aeolian setting). The spatial and temporal distribution of HMCs in different sedimentary environments is a function of: 1) the initial heavy-mineral content prior to high-energy events and 2) hydro-meteorological and sedimentary conditions during the events responsible for removal of lighter minerals and HMC formation as a lag deposit. The thickness, degree of concentration, and rhythmicity of HMC horizons offer opportunities for quantifying the periodicity and intensity of hydrodynamic processes along sandy coasts.

AB  - In a contrasting background of declining renewable water resources and increasing demand for drinking water, recourse to seawater desalination appears an attractive alternative to explore. The main role of a seawater desalination plant is therefore to ensure drinking water that meets sanitary norms while causing the least harm to the marine environment. The Hamma Water Desalination (HWD) plant in Algeria has attracted our attention as it drains 500,000 m(3)/d of seawater on which 300,000 m(3)/d is being discharged as brine into the shallow water of the Algiers bay at -8 m water depth. The study deals with monitoring the plant's outfall surrounding area using the satellite images provided by Google Earth Pro software. The horizontal spreading on the water surface caused by the brine jet was tracked over time, and its behavior was analyzed using image processing at different marine conditions. This investigation thus provides a better understanding of the complex behavior of free surface spreading of brine discharges in shallow waters. In this regard, environmental conditions have a significant impact on the horizontal spreading on the water surface, which may affect the dilution process. Based on the satellite observations, this investigation suggests making changes to the design of the HWD plant outfall or replace it with a modern discharge system.

AB  - Most of the long persistent luminescence (LPL) materials are investigated at room temperature or higher temperatures. However, LPL materials have promising applications in extremely low-temperature conditions. Here, we report a phosphor, namely BaGa2O4:Bi3+, with LPL that can act as a biological-temperature indicator and thermometer at extremely low temperatures. The traps were investigated in detail with the lowest and highest trap densities of 2.39 x 10(6) and 7.23 x 10(7), respectively. The trap distribution ranges from 150 to 750 K in the thermoluminescence (TL) spectrum with corresponding trap depths ranging from 0.310 to 0.716 eV. The TL spectra show that the distribution of the carriers stored in the traps to two emission centers changes with the temperature rising. The low-temperature steady-state photoluminescence (PL) was also investigated. Since the CIE colour coordinates are almost unchanged and the integrated emission intensity at 300 K was still maintained at 88.2% of 7 K, the phosphor presents a stable colour and intensity output. By decomposing the PL spectra at different temperatures, we noticed that one of the deconvoluted full width at half-maximum (FWHM) bands is temperature-sensitive; the thermometer-related parameters were calculated with the maximum values of S-a and S-r to be 0.163 and 0.108%, respectively. Our concept of investigation may promote the follow-up exploration of LPL phosphors under extreme conditions.

AB  - The current study aims to design and explain a comprehensive model for employee productivity improvement indicators. This research is objectively a fundamental-practical study, naturally a survey research, and paradigmatically an exploratory blended research. The statistical population consists of human resource experts and organizational behavior in the qualitative section. The targeted sampling and snowball were used to identify the experts. Twenty experts were employed due to the data adequacy. To test the model, 245 employees of Agriculture Jihad Organization of Ilam province were used. The analysis method included the grounded theory and the structural equation approach. Data were collected through deep interviews along with a 69 item questionnaire. The grounded results indicate the fact that the supportive atmosphere and attention to the learning organization were identified in causal conditions. The main phenomenon of individual characteristics was identified in relation to the intervention conditions, the internal and external factors of the organization. The governing body of organizational culture and laws and regulations and merit-based leaders and human resources skills have been identified in relation to the main strategy of human resource management (HRM) practices. The main consequence of this model is also the productivity of human resources, and the results of the partial least squares model were approved and its relationships were correctly designed.

AB  - Fruit firmness and color as simple, and ethylene emission as more sophisticated, are indicators of fruit maturity. Many studies have reported that 'William' pears generally ripen within 7 days at 20 degrees C after purchase. Usually, this information is based on experiments that were performed in a controlled environment. In reality, at the point of sale, storage time and conditions are not known, neither commercial handling procedures implemented to extend the shelf life after storage. The objective of this study is to implement and evaluate the electrochemical sensor system as a non-destructive approach to measure ethylene, which might be a reliable indicator of overall fruit maturity. Three experiments were performed during 9 days of shelf life at a temperature of 25 degrees C to obtain firmness (N), color parameters (L*, a*, b*), calculate hue angle (h degrees), and ethylene emission of 'William' pears purchased at the local store. Based on firmness, we have defined three ethylene concentration stages (ECS) with distinct ethylene emission rates that were determined by our sensor system (ECS1 - underripe, not ready to eat, ECS2 - ripe, ready to eat, ECS3 - overripe, senescent). The system gives good reproducibility and good correlation to the firmness stages as defined from related work. In general, the employed sensor system can determine ripening stages based on ethylene emission rate that also includes other volatile compounds.

AB  - Drought is the most common cause of severe crop production shortage in developing countries, and global warming is predicted to further exacerbate drought's impact. The present study investigates the efficiency of drought tolerance indices in classifying 24 super sweet maize inbred lines with the highest yield potential and drought tolerance performance. The experiment was conducted as a completely randomized block design with 4 replications. Twenty indices were compared based on grain yield, under two environments (Non-Stressed and Drought-Stress condition) during the 2018 growing season. All drought indices revealed significant differences among inbred lines, except GM. Results in ranking method, indicate that STI, GMP, MP, HARM, MRP, REI and RDY are suitable indicators because of positive correlations among each other and also the highest correlation with grain yield (GY) in both environments. Cluster analysis and threedimensional plots, showed inbred lines with the highest tolerance to drought, in both conditions. The first three principle components (PCs) explained 96.34% of total variation and the PC1 can be nominated as a potentially stable yield. The Biplot diagram based on PCs, and drought tolerance indices showed that MP, GMP, STI, HARM, MRP, REI, MSTIK1, MSTIK2 and YI were the best indices for screening tolerant inbred lines such as MCH87002/19-1, MPA90010/51-1 and MSH90011/82-1.

AB  - Based on the Working Conditions Survey (2013), this article aims to construct a typology of occupations with a 'worker' or 'employee' status based on their level and type of job quality. This approach to job quality by occupation appears to be important for three complementary reasons: first, because the nature of the occupation, beyond the characteristics of the individuals who do the jobs, explain differences in terms of job quality: second, because of the importance of the nature of occupations in terms of the rules governing work; and finally, because of the role played by public policies in supporting quality in many occupations.
   As a first step, we develop a set of 15 indicators measuring the different dimensions of job quality by combining variables relating to the wage relationship (in particular remuneration), non-material interest in exercising a profession (such as degree of autonomy or social relations), or working conditions (in particular the constraints related to work or difficulties experiences by employees, such as physical difficulties).
   As a second step, based on these 15 indicators, we construct a hierarchical ascending classification that reveals eight occupational classes. The fracture lines that oppose them then make it possible to establish a partial hierarchy of occupations in terms of job quality.
   Finally, we specify the compositions of these classes (relevant occupations and socio-demographic characteristics of individuals) and highlight the concentration of some types of workers in good or poor quality occupations.

AB  - Fresh foods with functional properties such as their antioxidant content are in increasing demand for their benefits to human health. The agronomic management of specific conditions as water stress could permit to obtain fresh foods with a high antioxidant content based on the plants response. In this project, the kinetics of the physiological and antioxidant responses to water stress were studied in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) to identify the appropriate conditions to obtain plants with a higher content of antioxidant phytochemical compounds. The response in terms of mineral composition was also studied. Before harvest, the plants were subjected to a water stress treatment and evaluations were performed on the days 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. The photosynthesis rate increased in response to water stress, reaching its highest values on day 4, while the highest content of phenolic compounds was determined on day 6. A physiological and non-destructive determination such as the photosynthesis rate could he used as an indicator of a high antioxidant content prior to harvest. The mineral composition and the plant morphology remained without important variations on day 6. The experimental evidence suggests that it would be possible to obtain lettuce plants as fresh food with antioxidant proprieties through the agronomic management of the water stress; however, further studies are needed in post-harvest and regarding human health benefits.

   Methods: A statistical Maxent model was used to assess the potential spatial risk of ZIK and CHIK dissemination; this considered the number of probable autochthonous ZIK and CHIK cases in 2015 and 2016, along with environmental variables and social indicators.
   Results: Land use was the most significant variable that best defined the distribution of ZIK and CHIK. Of the social variables, garbage destination, type of sanitary installation, and pipe-borne water were the most significant. An estimated 65 million people in Brazil live in areas at high risk of ZIK and 75 million people in areas at high risk of CHIK. The southeast and northeast regions of Brazil presented the largest areas of high risk for both ZIK and CHIK.
   Conclusions: Many areas across the Brazilian territory are exposed to ZIK or CHIK infection risks, which are related mainly to land use. The study findings offer valuable information to support time-sensitive public health decision-making at the local and national levels.

AB  - Research supports the effectiveness of a dissonance-based eating disorder prevention program wherein high-risk young women with body dissatisfaction critique the thin ideal, which reduces pursuit of this ideal, and the theory that dissonance induction contributes to these effects. Based on evidence that dissonance produces attitudinal change by altering neural representation of valuation, we tested whether completing the Body Project would reduce response of brain regions implicated in reward valuation to thin models. Young women with body dissatisfaction were randomized to this intervention or an educational control condition, completing assessments and fMRI scans while viewing images of thin versus average-weight female models at pre and post. Whole brain analyses indicated that, compared to controls, Body Project participants showed greater reductions in caudate response to images of thin versus average-weight models, though participants in the two conditions showed pretest differences in responsivity of other brain regions that might have contributed to this effect. Greater pre-post reductions in caudate and putamen response to thin models correlated with greater reductions in body dissatisfaction. The finding that the Body Project reduces caudate response to thin models provides novel preliminary evidence that this intervention reduces valuation of media images thought to contribute to body dissatisfaction and eating disorders, providing support for the intervention theory by documenting that this intervention alters an objective biological outcome.

AB  - The aim of the presented study was to characterize the physiological state of spruce needles from an alpine profile depending on altitude (970-1420 m above sea level) and needle age class (current year needles, one-year-old needles) during two consecutive years by investigating components of the antioxidative scavenging system (water extractable thiols, ascorbic acid, total peroxidase). The chlorophyll content was measured as a non-specific indicator of the general plant condition. With the exception of thiols the one-year-old needles always had higher needle contens of antioxidants and chlorophylls and the means of thiols and chlorophylls were significantly higher in the second sampling year. A more or less continous increase of antioxidants and a decrease of chlorophylls with increasing altitude was observed from the middle elevations (1140-1240 m a.s.l.) up to the highest site near the timberline (1420 m a.s.l.) and was interpreted as a response of the needles to increased oxidative stress due to the more uncomfortable environmental conditions at these elevations. However, high levels of antioxidants near the valley bottom (970-1050 m a.s.l.) also indicated an enhancement of the detoxification system and rather low chlorophyll levels (means of one-year-old needles <1100 mu g/g dw) probably reflected high environmental impact on the trees at these sites.

AB  - Pop-up archival tags (PAT) provide summary and high-resolution time series data at predefined temporal intervals. The limited battery capabilities of PATs often restrict the transmission success and thus temporal coverage of both data products. While summary data are usually less affected by this problem, as a result of its lower size, it might be less informative. We here investigate the accuracy and feasibility of using temperature at depth summary data provided by PATs to describe encountered oceanographic conditions. Interpolated temperature at depth summary data was found to provide accurate estimates of three major thermal water column structure indicators: thermocline depth, stratification and ocean heat content. Such indicators are useful for the interpretation of the tagged animal's horizontal and vertical behaviour. The accuracy of these indicators was found to be particularly sensitive to the number of data points available in the first 100m, which in turn depends on the vertical behaviour of the tagged animal. Based on our results, we recommend the use of temperature at depth summary data as opposed to temperature time series data for PAT studies; doing so during the tag programming will help to maximize the amount of transmitted time series data for other key data types such as light levels and depth.

AB  - Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios have been used as markers for palaeoclimatic and palaeoecological reconstructions across various geographical and temporal ranges. Such studies are essential for understanding how a particular species responded to changing environmental conditions in the past, especially changing vegetation, which might have even generated conditions stressful enough to threaten the very survival of the species. We present in this study a dataset of stable carbon and nitrogen isotope measurements (delta C-13 and delta N-15) generated from 160 Pleistocene and Holocene musk ox (Ovibos moschatus) specimens. We used the dataset to evaluate the usefulness of these dietary indicators in tracing vegetation and climatic fluctuations in the holarctic region during the Pleistocene and Holocene. Our data show that musk ox stable isotopes largely followed changes in precipitation and that these variations were closely associated with events such as the cold and arid Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), Bolling-Allerod interstadial, Younger Dryas stadial and the warmer and humid Holocene. Regional differences in the isotopic composition of the musk ox populations are also noticeable, altogether providing insights into how an adaptable, generalist diet in the face of climate change might have helped this species survive the Holocene megafaunal extinctions.

AB  - The paper gives an overview of possibilities to determine the values of tractor's fuel consumption, exhaust emissions and engine load in real operating conditions by using data accumulated in electronic control units. There is ecological and economic importance for the tractors to be operated correctly: time of engine idling, operation at low and too high loads or high speeds should be shortened. To monitor tractor's operating performance, tools and techniques are necessary that would allow to determine the controlled indicators.
   The paper presents research of tractor's engine load factor, fuel consumption and engine exhaust emissions during operation of ploughing. The research is conducted on the base of data accumulated in engine's electronic control units. Histograms are presented that show time intervals of the ploughing process, fuel consumption and emission components (CO2, NOx and CO) in engine speed and cyclic fuel injection modes. Test results are analyzed separately for the processes of technological ploughing and works at headlands. Test results showed that in the ploughing process, the main amount of fuel was consumed and CO2 emitted during technological process of ploughing, and CO - during the work at headlands. Large quantities of NOx were emitted during technological process of ploughing, and during the work at headlands as well. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Modeling flow and transport of pollutants in fractured and karstic aquifers remains an open issue. In fact, a completely adequate model for them has not been developed. These aquifers are highly vulnerable to groundwater contamination. Karst conduit system permits a rapid transport of pollutants, often under turbulent conditions and traveling long distances. Moreover, the cavities filled by residual dissolution products delay the propagation of contamination principally by means of sorption processes. The classical equivalent porous model paradigm does not permit to take into account the discrete nature of these aquifers.
   In this context, the reconstruction of a detailed geological model is very important in order to extend the knowledge on fluid flow and solute transport phenomena. This permits, consequently, to choose a plausible conceptual model with state variables and boundary conditions more adequate than the classical equivalent porous approach.
   The present work studies the area of an ex Gasometer heavily contaminated by hydrocarbons. hi this area, a pump & treat system has been designed approximating the nature of aquifer to a homogeneous isotropic porous medium. The work focuses on the importance of the realization of a detailed geological reconstruction to be implemented in a flow and transport model in order to interpret the dynamics of the flow field and the transport of contamination. The obtained results have proven to be coherent with previous studies in that they show that the flow field and the transport of contaminants depend primarily on karst network architecture.

AB  - The knowledge of the mechanical behaviour of woven fabrics is necessary in many applications in particular for the simulation of textile composite forming. This mechanical behaviour is very specific due to the possible motions between the fibres and the yarns. In this paper, the in-plane shear behaviour is analysed from virtual tests on the Representative Unit Cell. The in-plane shear strains can be very large (up to 50 degrees) in case of draping on a double curved surface. These virtual tests avoid performing tricky experimental tests. The presented 3D finite element analyses involve two main specific aspects. Firstly the boundary conditions have to render the periodicity at large deformations and, in some cases, the evolution of contacts between neighbouring yarns during the motion. Secondly the yarn that is made of thousand of fibres is modelled as a continuous medium but its constitutive law has to take its fibrous nature into account. For that reason a rate constitutive equation using a specific objective stress rate is used. It is based on the rotation of the fibre. The analysis is performed for two unit cells. Both results are in good agreement with the experiments, but the use of one of the cells turns out to be much easier. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: This article analyzed the perception of professionals, women, and men, about the condition of women in the workplace in a multinational company in the mining sector.
   Method / approach: A survey field research was applied in a multinational in the mining sector, covering a sample of 262 employees.
   Main findings: The results show that men showed a greater tendency to agree in relation to questions about women's careers, that is, male professionals clearly perceive less barriers to women's careers than they do. As for the Prejudice and Discrimination indicator, there was a significant difference in perception between females and males, evidencing a sharper perception of women regarding the occurrence of situations of prejudice and discrimination in the organization. In the Work and Family indicator, differently from what was expected, the data show that there was no significant difference in perception between females and males.
   Methodological / social / managerial contributions: The research confirms barriers experienced by women in terms of career advancement and development and corroborates the existence of situations of prejudice in contexts marked by male hegemony.
   Originality / relevance: Women in mining was addressed in only one national study and, by bringing this debate to the fore, the article reinforces the importance of thinking about the development of policies and practices focused on women's needs so that they can obtain equal working conditions, salary and advancement in organizations.

AB  - This study investigates the relationship between sediment contamination and hydrodynamic conditions in the Gaeta Gulf (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy), an anthropogenically impacted and sheltered coastal area. The pollution levels, potential toxicity, and ecological risk of trace metals were analysed in 16 sediment sampling sites using Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs), the Adverse Effect Index (AEI), and the Mean ERM Quotient (m-ERM-Q). The bottom shear stress of the study area, evaluated using an annual simulation of a 3D numerical model, was used to calculate a new Sediment Mobilisation Index (SMI) that detects the coastal zones where a low probability of sediment resuspension occurs. As, Ni, and Cu concentrations exceeded the Threshold Effects Level (TEL) guideline value and AEI limit in several sampling sites, indicating their ability to produce adverse effects on biota. Moreover m-ERM-Q showed the highest values of potential ecological risk in most of the sampling sites located in the inner part of the Gulf of Gaeta. In this area, the highest SMI values were also identified, demonstrating that there is a tight relationship between the two indexes (R-2 = 0.8214). The application of SMI in sheltered areas will help achieve high performance of monitoring and hazard assessment tools through obtaining predictable responses on hotspot identification.

AB  - Adaptive co-management (ACM) is an emerging approach to the governance of social-ecological systems, but there are few long-term assessments of its efficacy. This is especially true in conservation conflicts, where ACM can mitigate disputes between polarised stakeholders. We evaluated ACM that emerged in 2005 to address conflict between seal conservation and fisheries interests in the Moray Firth, Scotland. We interviewed 20 stakeholders in 2015, repeating a survey carried out in 2011 which applied an indicator framework to measure outcomes and pre-conditions for ACM to continue. In 2015, all but one of the 12 outcome indicators were positive, the exception being the conservation status of salmon. However, pre-conditions for ACM's continuation had weakened, with declines between 2005, 2011 and 2015. These were most marked for three indicators: leaders prepared to champion the process, presence of a bridging organisation or individual, and participation of all impacted stakeholders. The results show that ACM in this conservation conflict is dynamic. Perceived declines in salmon abundance and increases in seal numbers have renewed tensions amongst stakeholders, triggering a 'revival' phase of ACM initiated by fishery interests. Our study provides empirical evidence of ACM's fluid na-ture, and how resource crises can reignite ACM. We suggest that participatory evaluation is a potentially important early-warning mechanism that can identify remedial action and galvanise stakeholders to respond to the re-emergence of conflict.

AB  - Mining generates a significant quantity of waste material including ballast, gravel, and slags, which are often deposited in areas without taking into account the environment impacts and the need to ensure the physical and chemical stability of the disposed waste. One of the less studied problems is the emission of particulate matter produced by wind erosion at the dumpsites. This erosion is mainly caused by two factors, wind speed and turbulence, due to surface phenomenon. Until now, the design of waste dumpsites in the Chilean mining industry has not considered these environmental conditions. Efforts to minimize disposal costs have always been achieved by depositing ballast without considering these variables. When wind impacts this unprotected surface, it creates a source of dust that requires some special attention. The problem that this research tries to solve is to reduce particulate material to the atmosphere from waste dumps in which, under certain atmospherics and geographic conditions, specifically on winter season, its concentrations overpass the maximum limit allowed by law, generating bronchopulmonary diseases and even closing partially or totally mine operation. The result is the creation of a waste dumpsite design model, with its corresponding algorithms, which will allow optimization of the waste dumpsite design. From these results, future researches could explore more sustainable mining, such as unit operations, drilling, blasting, load and crushing material, reducing particulate material emissions to the atmosphere, and minimizing environmental impact due to exploitation.

AB  - Extensive green roofs are urban construction systems that provide thermal regulation and sound proofing for the buildings involved, in addition to providing an urban heat island mitigation or water retention. On the other hand, policies towards reduction of energy consumption, a circular economy and sustainability are core in the European Union. Motivated by this, an experimental study was carried out to evaluate the environmental risk assessment according to release levels of polluting elements on leachates of different green roof substrate mixtures based on recycled aggregates from construction and demolition waste through (i) the performance in laboratory of two procedures: compliance and percolation tests and (ii) an upscaled experimental leaching test for long-term on-site prediction. Four plots were built on a building roof and covered with autochthonous Mediterranean plants in Cordoba, South of Spain. As growing substrate, four mixtures were used of a commercial growing substrate with different proportions of a fine mixed recycled aggregate ranging from 0 to 75% by volume. The results show that these mixtures were classified as non-hazardous materials according to legal limits of the Landfill Directive 2003/33/CE. The release levels registered in extensive green roofs were lower compared to the laboratory test data. This shows how laboratory conditions can overestimate the potential pollutant effect of these materials compared to actual conditions.

AB  - Intersection control delay is one of the most important performance indicators for evaluating the traffic level of service and intersection capacities. In current traffic data detection infrastructure, control delay is not directly measurable. Although video-based detection approaches have been applied, their detection accuracy and reliability are constrained by application conditions and detection environments. Manual control delay data collection is labour-intensive, tedious, and time-consuming. High-resolution global positioning system (GPS) data provide an effective means of estimating control delays at intersections, but computationally intensive algorithms and hardware support are needed to handle a large network and impede their wide applications. In this study, a computationally cost-effective control delay estimation algorithm is developed based on low-resolution GPS-based transit bus trajectory data. Transit bus travelling behaviour is formulated to facilitate delay estimation. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is examined and verified by the field data and the results indicate that the proposed algorithm provides accurate and reliable control delay estimation at intersections under various conditions.

AB  - The spatial spring distribution of Eurytemora affinis (adults and C5) in the Scheldt estuary (Belgium) brackish and freshwater reaches was studied in between 1996 and 2007. The bulk of the E. affinis population being generally situated in the brackish water reach (salinity > 0.5); we studied which environmental factors are responsible for its recent sporadic occurrence in the freshwater estuarine reach. Using PLS analysis, it is shown that its presence upstream is limited by a sufficient oxygen concentration (>4 mg l(-1)) that is associated with temperature. Not only are the environmental conditions in the upstream zone important, but also the frequent presence of an O(2) minimum zone in the mid-estuary (O(2) min < 1.3 mg l(-1)) seems to block the movement of the downstream E. affinis population in an upstream direction. Occasionally, the bulk of the population is however situated upstream. During these periods, high E. affinis abundance was also observed in the Durme tributary. Our findings suggest the possibility to use E. affinis as an "indicator" species of water quality, but also lead us to stress the necessity to consider conditions over the entire estuary when studying restoration effects, not exclusively in the zone of interest.

AB  - The article is devoted to the study of natural factors that influence the regularities in the distribution of the quality of carbonate raw materials in the deposits of the Articulation Zone of the Donbass Basin with the Priazovskiy block of the Ukrainian Shield. Paleogeographic conditions of sedimentation and the processes of secondary quality change were established by comparing the lithologic-stratigraphic sections of deposits in different parts of the Articulation Zone: from the west (Novotroitskoe deposit) through the center (Elenovskoe deposit) and to the east (Karakubskoe deposit). The variability in the quality of carbonate raw materials was estimated from the results of statistical processing of the chemical analysis of exploratory samples. Geochemical associations were established for carbonate rocks within the stratigraphic horizons of each deposit. The best in quality of all deposits of the Donbass Articulation Zone are the carbonate rocks of the C(1)(t)c horizon. The conditions for their formation were the most stable. They are characterized by a negative connection of the main quality component (CaO) with all other quality indicators. At the same time, the association of indicators associated with a significant positive connection is retained: SiO2, R2O3, S. The process of forming carbonate strata are accompanied by intense silicification processes that relate to climatic changes in temperature, salinity and depth of the sea basin. This is confirmed statistically, because the significant negative correlation between the main component of quality and silica is established on the horizons of carbonate rocks with an increased silica content. The process of dolomitization of the carbonate stratum took place in two stages. At the beginning of the accumulation of the carbonate layer, the sea basin was characterized by lower temperatures and higher magnesium contents than in the subsequent period. Therefore, the lower stratum of the Novotroitskoe and Elenovskoe deposits include sedimentary dolomites. Later, the conditions changed, so there are no dolomites in the Karakubskoe deposit. The second stage of dolomitization is associated with the post-carbon andesite-trachyandesite magmatic complex. The rocks of this complex are found in the carbonate stratum in the form of interplastic intrusions, dikes and stock-like bodies. This contributed to the appearance of sulphide mineralization, zones of silicification and recrystallization of carbonate minerals in spot-dolomitized limestones. The structural-tectonic factor, which is manifested by intensive leaching processes, exerts the greatest influence on the degradation of the quality of carbonate raw materials. In zones of tectonic disturbances, they have maximum extension areas. The structural transformations that began in the Donbas after the early Carboniferous disrupted the primary stratified occurrence and quality of the carbonate thickness. The upper Visean horizons are subject to intensively leached, similar to tectonic, melange. The contribution made by these studies to scientific knowledge lies in the identification of the natural factors that determined not only the quality of carbonate rocks, but also indicators of the development stages of the Donbass Articulation Zone of two major tectonic structures - Donbass and the Ukrainian Shield.
   The practical significance of the results of the work is connected with the fixed possibility of conducting geological and technological mapping and further construction of varietal maps of the deposits of carbonate raw materials.

AB  - Planar deformation features (PDFs) in various minerals have long been accepted as evidence of impact-induced deformation. The uniqueness of this association was challenged in the context of the K/T Boundary extinction debate, after mosaicism and microstructures similar to PDFs were reported from the products of explosive volcanism. As a result of this debate, a significant volume of new experimental and observational data on the development of shock-induced microstructures has become available over the last ten years. The results reveal that factors such as pre-shock temperature, pulse duration, and crystallographic orientation of target minerals to the shock wave have a primary influence on how these microstructures develop. Data from diamond anvil cell and high-pressure friction experiments reveal that the same solid-state amorphization process that produces shock-induced PDFs at low temperatures also occurs at much lower strain rates in static experiments.
   The experimental data indicate that the amorphization process is thermally activated and that the character of the resulting PDFs is a function of the applied strain rate, Shock-induced amorphization occurs along those crystallographic planes that are most readily transformed to the high-pressure phase during very short pulse durations and produces PDFs that are visible at the optical scale, Lower strain rate deformation produces TEM scale amorphization with orientations that are more homogeneously distributed throughout the target mineral and produces no optically visible PDFs. The data confirm the uniqueness of multiple intersecting sets of optically visible PDFs as a diagnostic indicator of hypervelocity impact. The data also support the hypothesis that the amorphization process can occur at a wide range of strain rates, and that the limiting pressure for the process is controlled by the phase stability of the target mineral under the applied loading conditions, not by the HEL. The data also suggest that the onset pressure, the maximum pressure, and the pressure range for producing optically visible PDFs decrease with increasing temperature and decreasing strain rate. As the pressure range for optically visible PDF formation decreases, it is replaced by homogeneous amorphization as observed in the anvil cell experiments, Thus, the uniqueness of multiple intersecting sets of optically visible PDFs to hypervelocity impact is not due to a unique process, but rather to a specific set of loading conditions that produce an optically visible microstructure, Likewise, single sets of microdeformations observed in volcanic rocks are produced by the same process, but at different loading conditions that preclude the development of multiple intersecting sets of PDFs. The data also indicate that shock mosaicism, which occurs above the HEL, represents a plastic response of the target mineral to loading rates that are too large to be accommodated by crystal plastic mechanisms. Observational data for some naturally deformed samples from the K/T Boundary, the Vredefort Dome, and volcanic rocks, along with the experimental observations. are used to constrain the range of conditions under which the natural microstructures form, and to understand the differences between microstructures produced by impact, volcanic, and other natural processes. Finally, some possible mechanisms for producing the microstructures observed in volcanic rocks are proposed.

AB  - The variable amounts of ice rafted debris (IRD) and foraminifers in North Atlantic sediments are related to the abrupt, millennial-scale alteration from Greenland stadials to interstadials during the last glacial period and indicate past ice sheet instabilities, changes in sea-ice cover and productivity. In the Norwegian Sea, Greenland stadials were likely characterized by an extensive, near-perennial sea-ice cover whereas Greenland interstadials were seasonally ice-free. The variability in other areas, such as the Labrador Sea, remains, however, obscure. We therefore investigated deep-sea sediment core GS16-204-22CC retrieved south of Greenland. Using a multiproxy approach, we distinguish two sediment regimes and hence different environmental conditions between ca. 65 and 25 ka b2k. Regime 1 (similar to 65-49 ka b2k) is characterized by the dominance of planktic foraminifers in the sediments. During late MIS4 and early MIS3, the site was covered by near-perennial sea-ice with occasional periods of iceberg discharge. During the younger part of regime 1 the northeastern Labrador Sea was seasonally ice-free with hardly any icebergs melting near the site and long-term environmental conditions were less variable. Regime 2 (similar to 49-25 ka b2k) is characterized by pronounced stadial-interstadial variability of foraminifer and IRD fluxes, suggesting an extensive sea-ice cover during most Greenland stadials and seasonally ice-free conditions during most Greenland interstadials. During MIS2 environmental conditions were very similar to those of the younger part of regime 1. While all Heinrich (H) related Greenland stadials are marked by depleted oxygen isotope values at our core site, only H4 and H3 are associated with pronounced IRD peaks.
   Plain Language Summary North Atlantic sediments contain variable amounts of sand-sized mineral grains and microorganism shells. Mineral grains indicate iceberg transport from continental ice sheets, like the Greenland ice sheet (more icebergs/melting sea-ice, more grains). If the sea-ice cover is too thick, no light can penetrate and fewer microorganisms live in the water beneath the ice. Using these indicators, we investigated ocean sediments from south of Greenland covering the time period between ca. 65 and 25 thousand years ago. This time period was characterized by several abrupt changes between cold and warm climates on millennial timescales. We find that the ocean south of Greenland was sea-ice covered for most of the year with occasional time periods of iceberg discharge between 65 to 56 thousand years ago. From 56 to 49 thousand years ago the ice-free season was extended and hardly any icebergs melted near the site. From 49 thousand years ago our study area was covered by sea-ice year-round during cold time intervals whereas warm time intervals were only seasonally sea-ice covered. Continental ice sheets were growing during this time interval and we observed two major calving events related to two of the four very cold climate intervals recorded in the analyzed sediment.

AB  - The selection of broilers for rapid early growth is in contrast to egg production, fertility and livability of parent stocks under ad libitum feeding conditions. Hence, broiler parent stocks are being fed under strict rationed schedules. The restriction of feed intake has become a welfare issue and is debated extensively. In most studies on the well-being of broiler parent stocks the rationed feeding schedule has been compared with ad libitum feeding schedules. Rationing of the diet is being carried out either quantitatively or quantitatively. In quantitative feeding schedules the diet is fed once-a-day. Qualitative feeding is being carried out by adding ballast components to the diet, reduction of the protein level or provision of appetite reducing components. Furthermore, different feeding strategies, such as feeding the diet twice a day or feeding double amount every second day (skip-a-day) have been investigated. Restricting the feed intake underneath the level of voluntary feed intake (ad libitum) reduced the duration and increased intensity of feed intake. Under these conditions the development of behavioural stereotypies such as pecking at the empty feeder, at the drinker and at other objects ocured. The short time spent feeding with the quantitative feed restriction changed the behavioural budget mainly insofar as the pecking activity was directed towards the litter, the feeder and the drinker. Stereotyped pecking was especially expressed when the diet was finished and visual stimuli maintained the expectation of feed. Stereotyped pecking was often reported as indicator of frustration and lacking well-being. Under rationed feeding conditions there was an increase of locomotor activity and reduced resting behaviour. Since all behaviours showed a very high variability, the effect of rationed feeding was often not significant or not consistent with the level of feed restriction. There was, however, a tendency of a higher sensibility towards various environmental conditions of the rationed fed birds. The presence of litter, type of equipment and different management procedures superseded the effect of feed restriction. Besides changes in behaviour the response of the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrena axis (HPA) on restricted feeding has been investigated. Increased levels of corticosterone and the corresponding Heterophile-Leucocyte ratio (H/L) were considered as indicators of stress due to hunger. Other authors, however, stressed the point that corticosterone plays a central role in the chicken's energy metabolism, and the increased activity of the HPA may be the expression of a normal regulatory process. Feeding the daily feed allowance in two separate meals showed no advantages as compared to feeding once a day only. The same was true with regard to daily feeding and skip-a-day feeding. Feed additives with appetite-reducing properties, such as proprionic acid or Monensin-Na, have proved to be not efficient in adjusting the feed intake at the level required and to reduce the criteria of poor welfare. High crude fibre levels in the diet lead to increased time spent feeding and reduced expression of stereotyped behaviours. The expected reduction in body weight gain was often not achieved since the birds responded with an increase of feed intake. There were no essential changes among ad libitum and rationed feeding in the activity of the HPA axis. Further studies are required to prevent the development of stereotyped behaviour in rationed fed broiler parent stock.

AB  - We determined redox-induced (im)mobilization of geogenic nickel (Ni) as well as binding forms of Ni in a Fluvisol at the River Velika Morava valley (Serbia), enriched with serpentine minerals. The selected site is representative for intensive agricultural land use in the area and susceptible to dynamic redox conditions due to periodical flooding. A seven-step sequential extraction, grain-size and light-liquid separation as well as mineralogical analyses were used, first, to assess binding forms of Ni and second, to determine relationships between grain-size fractions, abundance of heavy density minerals, and Ni concentration in the bulk soil. The sequential extraction revealed that the majority of Ni was in the residual fraction, followed by organic matter and Fe oxides. Fine grain-size fraction (<63 mu m) was the major location of accumulation of Ni in the soil. Minerals which are characteristic for serpentine soils such as serpentine, spinels, hematite, and magnetite were found in silt and in the heavy density fraction (>2.9 g ml(-1)) of the medium and fine sand. However, the light minerals quartz, chlorite, micas, and secondary clay minerals dominate the soil mineral composition. Thus, total Ni concentration in the soil is derived from the content of Ni-bearing minerals and diluted by the minerals which are low in Ni.
   We simulated flooding using an automated biogeochemical microcosm system and determined the release dynamics of Ni at controlled redox potentials (E-H) in soil slurries. Pre-defined redox-windows were systematically created in steps of approximately 100 mV from reducing to oxidizing conditions while E-H and pH were continuously monitored. In parallel, the release dynamics of soluble nickel (Ni), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and sulfate (SO42-) were measured at each E-H-window. Our results highlighted that geogenic Ni can be mobilized to a considerable amount during low E-H, while elevating E-H from reducing to oxidizing conditions generated an immobilization Ni. We suggested that mobilization of Ni has been primarily affected by formation of Ni DOC complexes at low E-H, whereas Ni seems to be immobilized as a result of formation of Fe/Mn (hydro)oxides and the linked co-precipitation of Ni during oxidation. Factor analysis (FA) as multivariate statistical method explained 85.08% of the variance (67.89% and 17.19% component Nos. 1 and 2, respectively). The FA reveals that soluble Ni, Fe, DOC, Mn, and Mg were clustered in one group which indicate that the combined effect of DOC together with the chemistry of Fe, Mn, and Mg might be linked to the redox-induced release dynamics of Ni. The practical perspective of the study was to draw attention to dynamics of soluble Ni in fluctuating conditions for a better ecological risk assessment of floodplain sites under agricultural use. Nevertheless, similar studies should be conducted with further serpentine soils from various sites world-wide to verify the detected dynamics and processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Formulation of the problem. Peridotites of ophiolite complexes,being the fragments of the oceanic upper mantle that have undergone several stages of partial melting, brought to the surface by tectonic movements, also have undergone metamorphic transformations almost immediately after its formation. Because of serpentinization, the mineral composition of the rocks became more complicated. The analysis of the final structure and composition of apoperidotites allows obtaining data for geodynamic reconstructions regarding the stage of their formation.
   Review of previous publications. It has been determined that serpentines are the most common secondary minerals of peridotites of the Uholskyi complex in the Ukrainian Carpathians, and the processes of serpentinization took place at a depth of 40-50 to 100 km (?) at T = 450-600 degrees C and P = 13-16 kbar (Stupka 0., 2013). The study of serpentinites of the Main Ural Fault (Panas'yan L. et al., 2014) revealed that high alumina and high chromium serpentinites have ultrabasic protoliths formed in the mantle, and medium alu- mina and low chromium varieties - the protoliths of the basic composition which were born in the conditions of the crust. Based on the study of serpentinites in the orogenic Qinling belt (China), researchers (Wu K. et al., 2018) determined their mantle origin: magnetite-enriched antigorite serpentinites were formed as a result of the interaction of serpentinized apoperidotites of mantle protoliths with molten rock in the subduction channel.
   Purpose. We have investigated secondary serpentines in order to reconstruct the geodynamic conditions of the formation and transformations of the peridotites (Uholskyi complex), localized in the Marmarosh rocky zone in the Internal Ukrainian Carpathians, and are most widely spread in the interfluve of Velyka and Mala Uholka-rivers.
   Methods. The work is based on the results of geological observations of the Uholskyi complex rocks in natural outcrops, as well as petrographic, mineralogical (including X-ray diffraction, thermal and microprobe analysis), and geochemical studies.
   Results. The paper presents the study results of serpentinized apoperidotites of the ophiolite Uholskyi complex in the Internal Ukrainian Carpathians. Serpentinized apoperidotites (T-2-K-1?) form olistoliths in the Soimulska olistostrome-conglomerate strata of the Lower Cretaceous age. The investigated serpentines are the rock-forming minerals of lizardite and antigorite serpentinites. Lizardite serpentinites are characterized by lenticular-looped textures formed by alpha-lizardite and non-altered chrome-spinellids. Antigorite serpentinites, recognized by striped-shale textures, contain antigorite, beta-lizardite and magnetite. Lizardite serpentinites are characteristic of the regressive metamorphism of the greenschist facies upper part, and antigorite serpentinites are a typical formation of the progressive metamorphism of the lower greenschist - upperlower epidote-amphibolite facies. Regressive metamorphism occurred under geodynamic conditions of spreading and the progressive ones - under subduction conditions between the terrains of Dacia and Tisza, which led to the closure of the Transylvanian-Murq Paleocean. It has been concluded, that the protoliths of lizardite serpentinites were the primary mantle rocks of the ultrabasic (restitic) composition, and the protoliths of the antigorite serpentinites were the lithospheric rocks of the basic composition.
   Conclusions. The complex study of serpentinized apoperidotites of the Uholskyi complex makes it possible to reconstruct the metamorphic transformations of the primary mantle protoliths and to determine the stages of lithosphere formation within the fold-nappe structures. The obtained results can be used for prediction of serpentinite mineralization.

AB  - Horns, antlers, and other horn-like structures are products of sexual selection, confer reproductive advantages, and are heritable and honest indicators of individual quality. In addition to serving key biological functions, horns and antlers garner societal interest that, when combined with the powerful motivation to acquire trophy animals, likely has spawned a growing hornographic culture fixated on males with exceptional horn-like structures. The concern that harvest of large, fast-growing males may cause evolutionary change to the very trait being sought has been the source of controversy in the popular and scientific literature over the past 2 decades. Mountain sheep (i.e., bighorn and thinhorn; Ovis spp.), possibly the only large ungulates in North America managed almost exclusively as trophy species throughout their ranges, embody this controversy, which has led to polarizing views among scientists and stakeholders as to how mountain sheep should be managed. Our goal in this commentary was to discuss the relative contributions of the key ecological and intrinsic factors that influence horn growth, how those factors might interact with harvest strategies, and identify what determinants of horn size are most amenable to management and most effective in achieving desired outcomes. Despite repeated results demonstrating that age or nutrition frequently override genetic contributions to size of horns, attention has been given to the role of genetics and its relationship to harvest of mountain sheep. Given the hyperbole surrounding trophy management and big horns, we suggest the importance of females in the management of mountain sheep has been largely forgotten. Maternal condition can instigate life-long effects on size and growth of males (via maternal effects), and abundance of females, in turn, affects nutritional limitation within populations through density-dependent feedbacks. If production of males with large horns is an objective, we contend that management programs should, integrate monitoring of nutritional status of populations, and where evidence indicates nutritional limitation through density dependence, seek to regulate abundance and per capita nutrition via harvest of females. We propose that extrinsic regulation (i.e., removal by harvest or translocation) is the most effective way to manage per capita availability of forage resources and, thus, nutritional limitation on growth of males. Not only can female harvest improve growth in body size and horns of males through enhanced nutrition of growing males and their mothers, such management also 1) may yield a nutritional buffer against environmental stochasticity and erratic population fluctuations, 2) be employed in areas where other management alternatives such as habitat manipulation may not be feasible, 3) may reduce frequency or magnitude of epizootic die-offs, and 4) will increase hunter opportunity and involvement in management. Ultimately, we call for greater recognition of the pervasive role of the ewe, and other female ungulates, in the production of trophy males, and that accordingly, females be better integrated into harvest and management programs.

AB  - In December 2004, a huge tsunami in SE Asia claimed many lives and caused catastrophic damage. This event has stimulated a debate about the role played by coastal ecosystems such as mangrove forests and coral reefs in protecting low-lying coastal areas. While some observers claim that these ecosystems play an important role, others are more sceptical and fear that financial resources may be diverted away from tsunami preparedness programmes to ecosystem rehabilitation schemes. Here, we review the role of coastal ecosystems in mitigating sea wave hazards. In particular, we examine the influence of coastal vegetation in severely affected parts of Aceh and Southern Thailand during the 2004 tsunami, and include direct observations made during two field visits in 2006.
   Numerous scientific studies illustrate that coastal ecosystems are important in protecting the coast against normal and extreme wind-driven waves, including cyclonic storm surges. However, much less information is available concerning the role of coastal ecosystems in protecting against tsunamis, and most studies have been too limited in scope to be able to generalise over large geographic areas and diverse conditions. In particular, few studies have taken account of the high variability in the energy and speed of tsunami waves along different coastline stretches, making it difficult to compare the role of ecosystems in different regions. Other aspects that have been little studied include the spatial patterns of impact, e.g. flow diversion and channelling as a result of hydraulic resistance, and the effects of tree breaking and flow debris. However, despite these limitations, some tentative conclusions can be drawn about the protection provided by ecosystems against tsunami waves:
   (1) The most important predictor variables of the tsunami hazard (i.e. set-up and inundation) at the regional and landscape levels are distance to the tsunami source and coastal topography, in particular near-shore bathymetry.
   (2) The influence of coral reefs on tsunami waves is complex. While closed, intact reefs can provide some protection, water may be accelerated through channels in fragmented reefs, causing even greater destruction on land.
   (3) In contrast, seagrass beds appear to provide a more consistent buffering against tsunamis, though more data are needed to quantify this effect.
   (4) In several locations (particularly farther away from the tsunami source), mangroves and other vegetation probably provided some protection against the 2004 tsunami; in numerous other locations, however, vegetation provided no protection or may in some cases even have increased the hazard (e.g. by contributing to flow debris, or by channelling water flows). It seems that whether or not vegetation does provide protection depends on many factors, including stand size, density, species composition, structure and homogeneity. Overall, the value of vegetation as a potential tsunami buffer is probably fairly minor, though it cannot be completely dismissed. Many more detailed spatial and hydro-dynamic analyses are needed before the hazard-vegetation interactions can be realistically modelled and visualised, e.g. on risk maps.
   (5) Tsunami greenbelts should not be treated as alternatives to early warning systems. Greenbelts may only be considered as an economical (and multi-functional) means to provide relative hazard protection for material assets (e.g. infrastructure, agriculture).
   We recommend a more holistic view, with tsunami hazard mitigation being seen as one of several services provided by coastal ecosystems. Equally, the value of other ecosystem services may be seen within the frame of risk management as they foster social stability and, in case of disaster, robustness. To assess the overall value of these services and to develop more accurate indicators of risk will require much more transdisciplinary research. (C) 2007 Rubel Foundation, ETH Zurich.

AB  - Fossil forests provide some of the most fascinating and compelling records of the geological past. If rapidly preserved in-situ, they yield multifaceted knowledge about the palaeoenvironment and habitat structure, diversity of organisms and their varied interrelationships. Further, fossil forests shed light on palaeoclimaric conditions and raphonomic pathways. Although discovered almost 300 years ago, only during the last decade, the Chemnitz Fossil Forest, central-east Germany, has been recognised as a complex fossil lagersratte represented by outstanding fossil assemblages preserved by pyroclastics. The fossil biota was buried as a T-0 thanarocoenosis resulting from instantaneous entombment by the Zeisigwald Tuff (Leukersdorf Formation, Chemnitz Basin). The eruptions constitute some of the last events of post-Variscan felsic volcanism in Central Europe and resulted in ash falls, pyroclasric surges, and flows, which ultimately covered and preserved the ecosystem. Based on magmatic zircons, the tuff yielded an age of 291 +/- 2 Ma (lace Sakmarian/early Artinskian).
   Fine-crystalline alpha-quartz, chalcedony, moganite, and particularly fluorite, which is restricted to plant fossils, pumice lapilli and vitreous matrix constituents, affected wood petrifaction. Organic remains in fossil wood are limited to scattered anthracite particles. Cathodoluminescence uncovered sire-specific multiphase silicification, including rapid precipitation under oxygen-deficiency in a low-temperature ( < 250 degrees C) hydrothermal environment.
   Attention is focused on two excavations in Chemnitz that recovered abundant new data and opened a unique window into a low-latitude 'wet spot' ecosystem. This spatially restricted habitat sheltered a dense hygrophilous arborescent vegetation of seed plants and cryptogams bur also epiphytes and climbers. The biota also includes a diverse fauna of vertebrates, arthropods and gastropods, several of them documented for the first rime from the Permian. Chemnitz reflects a relatively youthful but already well-established forest bionetwork with a remarkably well-developed trophic pyramid. Highlighted by many trees, still standing upright in their places of growth and rooted in the palaeosol, the Chemnitz Fossil Forest represents the most complete Permian forest biome/ecosystem recorded to date. To illustrate the environmental settings more precisely, palaeontological, pedological and geochemical indicators of deep-rime palaeoclimate have been rested. The ecosystem developed on a palaeosol of low maturity, even though it received annual precipitation of ca. 800-1100 mm. Although the habitat was affected by environmental disturbances and seasonality, conservative hygrophilous forms dominated the multi-aged vegetation. Growth features of woody trees provided excellent natural data archives and afforded reliable information, e.g., severe droughts and lightning strikes recorded as event rings and wound responses in affected trees. Tree-ring sequences were analysed to ascertain both annual growth rates and mean sensitivity and correlate growth increments between the trees. The tree-ring data provided insights into the fourth dimension (time), enabling appraisal of the stages of forest growth. The results yield a high-resolution palaeoenvironmental signal for eight decades during the early Permian and permit the recognition of fossil deadwood for the first time. Surprisingly, the woody trees, medullosan seed ferns, cordaitaleans, and calamitaleans revealed nearly 11-year cyclicity in tree-ring formation despite exhibiting different physiological reactions. The 11-year sunspot cycle, usually affecting atmospheric circulation patterns, was recorded in the trees and demonstrates how abiotic factors affect plant growth. Finally, multidisciplinary research achieved conclusions comparable to analyse modern ecosystems. The Chemnitz Fossil Lagerstatte significantly contributes to understanding the controls of palaeoclimate, palaeoenvironment, and palaeoecological dynamics on a confined wet-forest habitat of subtropical Northern Hemisphere Pangaea.

AB  - Relevance of the study is determined by the necessity to provide ecological and geochemical assessment of technogenic impact on environment and population health related to urbanization and industrial development resulting in contamination of natural assets with various pollutants.
   The aim of the study is to assess mercury loads onto the natural components of an urbanized territory with a well-developed industrial infrastructure by studying leaves and cores of balsam poplar (P. balsamifera L.).
   Subjects of research are poplar leaves and annual rings. This species of poplar is very common in urban localities of temperate zone. It has a number of features allowing it to capture significant amounts of dust particles and aerosols, namely, relatively large area, wax covering and presence of both abaxial and adaxial stomata; the tree serves as an indicator of community air.
   Research methods were sampling of poplar leaves through the period of 2014-2018 and following a 4.4 uniform area grid with a further concentration of 1.1 km near assumed pollution sources; sampling of wood from separate trees at a distance of 0,5 to 1 km from the assumed pollution source; atomic absorption spectrometry of Hg by pyrolysis; statistical processing of data; plotting maps and graphs.
   Results. During the field and laboratory works, the authors have obtained the data on geochemical features of Hg distribution through the leaves and annual rings of balsam poplar (P. balsamifera L.) in the territory of the city of Novosibirsk. In the northwestern part of the city, a biogeochemical halo of Hg concentrations was identified; it is isometric in form, has an area of approximately 25 km(2) and is characterized by Hg content of over 100 ng/g. In 2017, a high Hg concentration (1300 ng/g) in poplar leaves was recorded in Kalininsky district, near the industrial site of the Novosibirsk Chemical Concentrates Plant. The studies have shown a clear trend for Hg accumulation in poplar leaves throughout the vegetation period. Maximum average content was found in leaf litter at 2006 ng/g (the range is 1153-2425 ng/g). However, the average Hg content in soil is 294 ng/g, which is significantly lower than the maximum allowable concentration of 2100 ng/g. Distribution of Hg content in poplar leaves depending on leaf position in the tree crown was studies for a tree in the epicenter of biogeochemical halo of Hg concentrations. Upwind the emission source, Hg concentration in the leaves is on average 1,5 times higher than in the wind shadow. During the studies of Hg forms in poplar leaves it was established that Hg is primarily found in free and physically-bound forms, which are the most mobile, prone to increased migration, transformation and methylation under the environmental conditions. Studies of wood cores in the vicinity of the pollution source allowed establishing three periods of Hg emission: the first period, with the maximum emission covers 1967-1985, the second period of 1991-2000 shows a decrease in Hg content; the third period of 2000-2007 is characterized with a relatively low level of Hg concentration.
   A large biogeocheimcal halo of Hg concentrations was mapped in the city of Novosibirsk, a possible emission source was found. Dendrobiogeochemical methods applied in the epicenter of the area with the highest mercury content allowed establishing long-term dynamics in Hg content in the subjects of the study. A period with the highest technogenic impact on the urban environment was established. In residential and industrial zones in the northeast of Novosibirsk, in the territory of a large biogeochemical Hg-related halo, the authors recommend to establish environmental and geochemical monitoring with mercury metering of air samples, studies of soil and plant cover, monitoring of sanitary and hygienic indicators of population's health.

AB  - The structure and dynamics of small plantations of pine (Pinus caribaea; 4 and 18.5 yr old in 1980) and mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla; 17 and 49 yr old in 1980) were compared with those of paired secondary forest stands of similar age and growing adjacent to each other under similar edaphic and climatic conditions. The study was conducted in the Luquillo Experimental Forest between 1980 and 1984. Comparisons included a variety of demographic, production, and nutrient cycling characteristics of stands. Although the small unmanaged plantations had a lower number of species in understory than paired secondary forests, the understory of the older plantations developed high species richness, including many of native tree species. After 17 yr, native tree species invaded the overstory of plantations. After 50 years the species richness in the understory of a mahogany plantation approached that of its paired secondary forest. Plantation understories had important ecological roles, including high nutrient accumulation. Understory plant tissue, particularly leaf litter, had higher nutrient concentration pine plantations than in paired secondary forests. Understory biomass in plantations accumulated a higher proportion of the total nutrient inventory in the stand than did the understory in paired secondary forests. Plantations had higher aboveground biomass and net aboveground biomass production than paired secondary forests. Higher root densities and biomass were found in secondary forests as were greater depth of root penetration, higher nutrient concentration in roots, and more microsites where roots grow, than paired plantations.
   These characteristics may improve the capacity of secondary forests relative to that of paired plantations to rapidly recapture nutrients that become available by mineralization and that could otherwise be lost through hydrological or gaseous pathways. Both forest types accumulated nutrients and mass, but secondary forests recirculated nutrients much faster than the plantations, which tended to store the nutrients. Plantations had higher leaf fall and total litterfall, had litterfall with lower nutrient concentrations, accumulated more nutrients in litter, decomposed more litter on an annual basis, exhibited more variation in the spatial distribution of litter mass, and had more month-to-month variation in litter storage than paired secondary forests. Litter of the secondary forests, on the other hand, had a faster nutrient turnover than plantation litter, though plantations retranslocated more nutrients before leaf fall than did secondary forests. Nutrient retranslocation increased with plantation age. Plantations, particularly pine plantations, produced more litter mass per unit nutrient return than did paired secondary forests. Total nutrient storage in soil gave the best correlation with nutrient use efficiency estimated as element:mass ratios in various compartments. Nutrient use efficiency ranked differently among forest pairs, depending upon which nutrient and ecosystem parameters were being compared. Because of high retranslocation of nutrients, and in spite of greater nutrient "need" to produce higher biomass, plantations had nutrient demands on soil similar to paired secondary forests. Among the ecosystem parameters measured, nutrients in leaf fall correlated best with differences in soil nutrients across stands. Nutrient concentrations in understory species appeared to be a sensitive indicator of whole-stand nutrient use efficiency. Some of the observations of the study could be attributed to intrinsic differences between small unmanaged plantations and secondary forests, but many could be explained by species differences (i.e., timing of leaf fall), age of plantation (i.e., accumulation of biomass or species), or the relative importance of angiosperms and gymnosperms (i.e., nutritional quality of litter). The study challenges the conventional dogma with respect to differences between plantations and native successional ecosystems and underscores the dangers of generalizing about all tropical tree plantations or all natural tropical forests, or even extrapolating from one sector of the ecosystem to another.

AB  - Within the past few decades, major losses of seagrass habitats in coastal waters impacted by cultural eutrophication have been documented worldwide, in confronting a pressing need to improve the management and protection of seagrass meadows, surprisingly little is known about the basic nutritional physiology of these critical habitat species, or the physiological mechanisms that control their responses to N and P gradients. The limited available evidence to date already has revealed, for some seagrass species such as the north temperate dominant Zostera marina, unusual responses to nutrient enrichment in comparison to other vascular plants. Seagrasses derive N and P from sediment pore water (especially ammonium) and the water column (most nitrate). The importance of leaves versus roots in nutrient acquisition depends, in part, on the enrichment conditions. For example, a shift from reliance on sediment pore water to increased reliance on the overlying water for N and P supplies has been observed under progressive water-column nutrient enrichment. Seagrasses may be N-limited in nutrient-poor waters with sandy or (less so) organic sediments, and P-limited in carbonate sediments. On the basis of data from few species, seagrasses appear to have active uptake systems for NO3- and PO4-3, but NH4+ uptake may involve both low- high-affinity systems. P-i uptake affinities reported thus far are much lower than values for active ammonium uptake, but comparable to values for nitrate uptake by leaf tissues. Beyond such basic information, seagrass species have shown considerable variation in nutritional response. Dominance of acropetal versus basipetal nutrient translocation appears to vary among species as an innate trait. While some species follow classic Michaelis-Menten kinetics for N-i uptake, others have exhibited sustained linear uptake with limited or negligible product feedback inhibition, perhaps in adaptation to oligotrophic environments. Zostera marina also is able to maintain nitrate reductase (NR) activity during dark periods if adequate carbohydrate reserves and substrate are available. Thus, this species can respond to nitrate pulses throughout a diel cycle, rather than being limited as most plants to nitrate uptake during the light period. Further adaptations may have occurred for seagrasses in extremely nitrate-depauperate conditions. For example, Halophila decipiens and H. stipulacea lack inducible NR and apparently have lost the ability to reduce nitrate; and a biphasic rather than hyperbolic P-i uptake curve, with 'surge' uptake, has been described for Zostera noltii. Many seagrasses respond favorably to low or moderate N and/or P enrichment. However, excessive N-I loading to the water column can inhibit seagrass growth and survival, not only as an indirect effect by stimulating algal overgrowth and associated light reduction, but-for some species-as a direct physiological effect. The latter direct impact has been most pronounced for plants growing in sandy (nutrient-poor) sediments, and is exacerbated by elevated temperatures and/or light reduction. Ammonia toxicity, known for many vascular plants, has been reported in seagrasses Ruppia drepanensis and Z. marina (125 mu M water-column NH4+, 5 weeks). Z marina has shown to be inhibited, as well, by pulsed water-column nitrate enrichment (as low as 3.5-7 mu M NO3-, 3-5 weeks)
   which is actively taken up without apparent product feedback inhibition.
   Inhibition by elevated nitrate has also been reported, with description of the underlying physiological mechanisms, in certain macroalgae and microalgae. In Z. marina,this effect has been related to the high. sustained energy demands of nitrate uptake, and to inducement of internal carbon limitation by the: concomitant 'carbon drain' into amino acid assimilation. In contrast, nitrate enrichment can stimulate growth of Z. nln,marina when the sediment, rather than the water column, is the source. Because seagrass species have shown considerable variation in nutritional response, inferences about one well-studied species, from one geographic location, should not be applied a priori to that species in other regions or to seagrasses in general. Most of the available information has been obtained from study of a few species, and the basic nutritional physiology of many seagrasses remains to be examined and compared across geographic regions. Nonetheless, the relatively recent gains in general understanding about the physiological responses of some seagrass species to nutrient gradients already have proven valuable in both basic and applied research. For example, physiological variables such as tissue C:N:P content have begun to be developed as integrative indicators of nutrient conditions and anthropogenic nutrient enrichment. To strengthen insights for management strategies to optimize seagrass survival in coastal waters adjacent to exponential human population growth and associated nutrient inputs, additional emphasis is critically needed to assess the role of variable interactions-among inorganic as well as organic N, P and C, environmental factors such as temperature, light, and other community components-in controlling the physiology, growth and survival of these ecologically important marine angiosperms.

AB  - 1. The complex, nonlinear response of dryland systems to grazing and climatic variations is a challenge to management of these lands. Predicted climatic changes will impact the desertification of drylands under domestic livestock production. Consequently, there is an urgent need to understand the response of drylands to grazing under climate change. 2. We enhanced and parameterized an ecohydrological savanna model to assess the impacts of a range of climate change scenarios on the response of a semi-arid African savanna to grazing. We focused on the effects of temperature and CO2 level increase in combination with changes in inter- and intra-annual precipitation patterns on the long-term dynamics of three major plant functional types. 3. We found that the capacity of the savanna to sustain livestock grazing was strongly influenced by climate change. Increased mean annual precipitation and changes in intra-annual precipitation pattern have the potential to slightly increase carrying capacities of the system. In contrast, decreased precipitation, higher interannual variation and temperature increase are leading to a severe decline of carrying capacities owing to losses of the perennial grass biomass. 4. Semi-arid rangelands will be at lower risk of shrub encroachment and encroachment will be less intense under future climatic conditions. This finding holds in spite of elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 and irrespective of changes in precipitation pattern, because of the drought sensitivity of germination and establishment of encroaching species. 5. Synthesis and applications. Changes in livestock carrying capacities, both positive and negative, mainly depend on the highly uncertain future rainfall conditions. However, independent of the specific changes, shrub encroachment becomes less likely and in many cases less severe. Thus, managers of semi-arid rangelands should shift their focus from woody vegetation towards perennial grass species as indicators for rangeland degradation. Furthermore, the resulting reduced competition from woody vegetation has the potential to facilitate ecosystem restoration measures such as re-introduction of desirable plant species that are only little promising or infeasible under current climatic conditions. On a global scale, the reductions in standing biomass resulting from altered degradation dynamics of semi-arid rangelands can have negative impacts on carbon sequestration.

AB  - Two sedimentary cores with pollen, charcoal and radiocarbon data are presented. These records document the Late-glacial and Holocene dry forest vegetation, fire and environmental history of the southern Cauca Valley in Colombia (1020 m). Core Quilichao-1 (640 cm; 3degrees6'N, 76degrees31W) represents the periods of 13 150-7720 C-14 yr BP and, following a hiatus, from 2880 14C yr BP to modern. Core La Teta-2 (250 cm; 3degrees5'N, 76degrees32W) provides a continuous record from 8700 C-14 yr BP to modern.
   Around 13 150 C-14 yr BP core Quilichao-1 shows an active Late-glacial drainage system and presence of dry forest. From 11 465 to 10520 C-14 yr BP dry forest consists mainly of Crotalaria, Moraceae/Urticaceae, Melastomataceae/Combretaceae, Piper and low stature trees, such as Acalypha, Alchornea, Cecropia and Celtis. At higher elevation Andean forest comprising Alnus, Hedyosmum, Quercus and Myrica was common. After 10520 C-14 yr BP the floral composition of dry forest changed, with extensive open grass vegetation indicative of dry climatic conditions. This event may coincide with the change to cool and dry conditions in the second part of the El Abra stadial, an equivalent to the Younger Dryas. From 8850 C-14 yr BP the record from La Teta indicates dry climatic conditions relative to the present, these prevailing up to 2880 C-14 yr BP at Quilichao and to 2720 C-14 yr BP at La Teta. Severe dryness reached maxima at 7500 C-14 yr BP and 4300 C-14 yr BP, when dry forest reached maximum expansion. Dry forest was gradually replaced by grassy vegetation, reaching maximum expansion around 2300 C-14 yr BP. After 2300 C-14 yr BP grassy vegetation remains abundant. Presence of crop taxa (a.o. Zea mays), disturbance indicators (Cecropia) and an increase in charcoal point to the presence of pre-Columbian people since 2300 C-14 yr BP. After 950 C-14 yr BP, expansion of secondary forest taxa may indicate depopulation and abandonment of previously cultivated land. After 400 C-14 yr BP, possibly related to the Spanish conquest, secondary forest expanded and charcoal concentrations increased, possibly indicating further reduction of cultivated land. During the past century, Heliotropium and Didymopanax became abundant in an increasingly degraded landscape. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Simple Summary The concern for better farm animal welfare has been greatly increasing among scientists, veterinarians, farmers, consumers, and the general public over many years. As a consequence, several indicators have been developed to assess animal welfare, and several specific protocols have been proposed for welfare evaluation. Most of the indicators developed so far focus on the negative aspects of animal welfare (e.g., lameness, lesions, diseases, presence of abnormal behaviours, high levels of stress hormones, and many more). However, the lack of negative welfare conditions does not necessarily mean that animals are in good welfare and have a good quality of life. To guarantee high welfare standards, animals should experience positive conditions that allow them to live a life that is really worth living. We reviewed the existing indicators of positive welfare for farmed ruminants and identified some gaps that still require work, especially in the domains of Nutrition and Health, and the need for further refinement of some of the existing indicators.
   Abstract Until now, most research has focused on the development of indicators of negative welfare, and relatively few studies provide information on valid, reliable, and feasible indicators addressing positive aspects of animal welfare. However, a lack of suffering does not guarantee that animals are experiencing a positive welfare state. The aim of the present review is to identify promising valid and reliable animal-based indicators for the assessment of positive welfare that might be included in welfare assessment protocols for ruminants, and to discuss them in the light of the five domains model, highlighting possible gaps to be filled by future research. Based on the existing literature in the main databases, each indicator was evaluated in terms of its validity, reliability, and on-farm feasibility. Some valid indicators were identified, but a lot of the validity evidence is based on their absence when a negative situation is present; furthermore, only a few indicators are available in the domains of Nutrition and Health. Reliability has been seldom addressed. On-farm feasibility could be increased by developing specific sampling strategies and/or relying on the use of video- or automatic-recording devices. In conclusion, several indicators are potentially available (e.g., synchronisation of lying and feeding, coat or fleece condition, qualitative behaviour assessment), but further research is required.

AB  - Following the investigations of Odin and others into the distribution of green granules, glaucony has been widely assumed to be a reliable indicator of a fully marine, open shelf environment with a low sedimentation rate. We have investigated the value of glaucony as a palaeoenvironmental indicator through an investigation of the pellets, and their distribution and reworking in the predominantly brackish to shallow marine Tertiary sediments of the Hampshire basin, together with a re-evaluation of the sedimentology.
   Glaucony has apparently formed in situ in all lithofacies from shallow marine to estuarine. Of the three highest glaucony concentrations (all dominated by ill situ glaucony) two occur within highstand system tracts, the third is at a sequence boundary. Several important surfaces do not have more than a Few percent glaucony, with very variable proportions of mature and in situ pellets. The correlation between glaucony concentration and sequence stratigraphy is most obvious in the London Clay and Wittering Formations, where least reworking of pellets has occurred. In;he Barton Group there are no major concentrations of glaucony at any of the important stratal surfaces, we believe this more random glaucony distribution is due to limited glaucony formation and reworking of older glaucony. In these sediments ideal conditions for glaucony formation are interpreted to have been: fully marine, 10-30 m water depth, a 'warm' temperature plus low sedimentation rate with periodic winnowing to concentrate the pellets. Although most of these conditions for glaucony formation occurred in the Selsey Formation and Barton Group, a factor or factors mitigated against glauconitization. We suggest that this was lowering of the water temperature. The London Clay and Wittering Formations were deposited relatively rapidly (50-60 m Ma(-1)) and include intervals of estuarine sedimentation, both factors that we believe inhibited glaucony formation.
   Glaucony maturity reflects the minimum length of time spent in surface sediments, close to the oxic/sub-oxic interface. Point count data and chemical data for glaucony indicate widespread reworking and an overall increase in reworking with time, possibly due to uplift on the Isle of Wight monocline. The apparently wide range of conditions in which glaucony will form, and the frequency with which it is reworked, suggest that it is a less useful indicator palaeo-environmental indicator than is commonly supposed.

AB  - Elevated air pollution levels adjacent to major highways are an ongoing topic of public health concern worldwide. Black carbon (BC), a component of particulate matter (PM) emitted by diesel and gasoline vehicles, was measured continuously via a filter-based light absorption technique over similar to 16 months at four different stations positioned on a perpendicular trajectory to a major highway in Las Vegas, NV. During downwind conditions (winds from the west), BC at 20 m from the highway was 32 and 60% higher than concentrations at 100 and 300 m from the roadway, respectively. Overall highest roadside (20-m site) BC concentrations were observed during the time period of 4 a.m.-8 a.m. under low-speed variable winds (3.02 mu g/m(3)) or downwind conditions (2.84 mu g/m(3)). The 20-m site BC concentrations under downwind conditions are 85% higher on weekday periods compared to weekends during the time period of 4 a.m.-8 a.m. Whereas total traffic volume was higher on weekdays versus weekends and differed by approximately 3% on weekdays versus weekends, similarly, the detected heavy-duty fraction was higher on weekdays versus weekends and differed by approximately 21% on weekdays versus weekend. Low wind speeds predominated during early morning hours, leading to higher BC concentrations during early morning hours despite the maximum traffic volume occurring later in the day. No noticeable impact from the airport or nearby arterial roadways was observed, with the 300-m site remaining the lowest of the four-site network when winds were from the east. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that heavy-duty traffic volume, light-duty traffic volume, wind speed, weekday versus weekend, surface friction velocity, ambient temperature, and the background BC concentration were significant predictors of roadside BC concentrations. Comparison of BC and PM2.5 downwind concentration gradients indicates that the BC component contributes substantially to the PM2.5 increase in roadside environments. These results suggest that BC is an important indicator to assess the contribution of primary traffic emissions to near-road PM2.5 concentrations, providing opportunities to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of mitigation strategies.

AB  - The Southern Ocean plays a major role in the glacial/interglacial global carbon cycle. However, there is a substantial lack of information from its Antarctic Zone south of the Polar Front (PF) to understand key climate processes (e.g., sea ice variability, productivity changes, CO2 source region, shifts of the Southern Westerly Wind) active in this region during the glacial/interglacial transition, due to the limited high resolution sediment records from this area. To close this gap, we investigated high resolution diatom records from a series of sediment cores from the Atlantic and Western Indian sectors of the Southern Ocean between the modern PF and the Winter Sea Ice (WSI) edge. Summer Sea Surface Temperature (SSST) and sea ice information spanning the past 30 thousand years were derived from diatom transfer functions and indicators, which augment comprehensive information on past surface ocean conditions and related ocean and atmospheric circulation, as well as opal deposition. These complementary lines of evidences also provide important environmental boundary conditions for climate simulations understanding the past climate development in the high latitudes Southern Ocean.
   Our reconstructions show that the Last Glacial (LG) SSST5 south of the modern PF are 1-3 degrees C colder than modern conditions, WSI expanded to the modern PF. Our data suggests effective carbon export in the Antarctic Zone during the LG. Deglacial two steps of warming support the bipolar seesaw mechanism. Antarctic Zone is an important source region for the CO2 deglacial increase. The warming was more suppressed towards south, due to continuous ice discharge from Antarctica. The SSSTs exceeded modern values during the early Holocene optimum, when WSI extent probably retreated south of its modern position. The southern boundary of maximum opal deposition zone may have shifted to south of 55 degrees S in the Bouvet Island area at this time. The mid-late Holocene cooling with WSI re-expanding to the Bouvet Island area, probably related to enhanced cold-water export by the Weddell Gyre from the developing cavity under the West Antarctic Ice Shelf. The cooling also suggests a northward shift of the Southern Westerly Wind, at least its southern boundary. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Ogaki Dam Reservoir is one of the principal irrigation dam reservoirs in the Fukushima Prefecture and its upstream river basin was heavily contaminated by radioactivity from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. For the purpose of environmental assessment, it is important to determine the present condition of the water in the reservoir and to understand the behavior of sediment-sorbed radioactive cesium under differentmodes of operation of the dam, as these factors affect further contamination of arable farmlands downstream of the reservoir through sediment migration. This paper addresses this issue with numerical simulations of fluvial processes in the reservoir using the two-dimensional Nays2Dcode. Wedistinguish three grades of sediment (clay, silt, and sand), as cesium adherence depends on sediment grain size and surface area. Boundary conditions for the simulations were informed bymonitoring data of the upstreamcatchment and by the results froma separate watershed simulation for sediment transport into the reservoir. The performance of the simulationmethod was checked by comparing the results for a typhoon flood in September 2013 against fieldmonitoring data. We present results for sediment deposition on the reservoir bed and the discharge via the dam under typical yearly flood conditions, forwhich the bulk of annual sedimentmigration fromthe reservoir occurs. The simulations showthat almost all the sand and silt that enter into the reservoir deposit onto the reservoir bed. However, the locationswhere they tend to deposit differ, with sand tending to deposit close to the entrance of the reservoir, whereas silt deposits throughout the reservoir. Both sand and silt settlewithin a fewhours of entering the reservoir. In contrast, clay remains suspended in the reservoirwater for a period as long as several days, thus increasing the amount that is discharged downstreamfromthe reservoir. Under the current operatingmode of the dam, about three- quarters of clay that enters the reservoir during the flood is discharged downstreamduring and in the days following the flood. By raising the height of the damexit, theamount of clay exiting the reservoir can be reduced by a factor of three. The results indicate that the damcan be operated to buffer radioactive cesiumand limit the contamination spreading into lowland areas of theUkedoRiver basin. These results should be a factor in considerations for the future operation of theOgakiDam, and will be of interest for other operators of damreservoirs in areas contaminated by radioactive fallout.

AB  - This paper reports on the basic characteristics of agricultural activity in the Republic of Serbia, which to a great extent determines the diet of the population of the country. Fertile soil and suitable climate provide conditions for the development of rural areas, both by farming and by animal breeding. The amount of cultivable soil in Serbia is higher than the European average (0.56 hectares per capita). The northern province of the Republic of Serbia Vojvodina, which stands for the great granary of Serbia, has the potential to produce so much as to also export to other European countries, while animal breeding is more developed in the southern part of Serbia. This paper also identifies the key-properties of the main agricultural products of this country which are more relevant for the nutrition of the population. The empirical part of the paper deals with the analysis of the results of a survey carried out in the 10 largest towns of Serbia (5 in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, and 5 in Central Serbia). The survey involved 200 inhabitants in Serbia, of different socio-demographic structures. It was a random sample survey. There was observed 20 subjects in each town. The results reveal the foodstuff which is mainly used by the population of Serbia, what kinds of meat and dairy products are the most common options and how important bread and other grain products are. Significant indicators in this paper are that the inhabitants in Vojvodina (a flat area) opt for quite different foods in their diet from those that are consumed by the population in the southern part of the country which has mountainous conditions for agriculture. One part of this paper is refers to analyses showing to which extent to which different socio-demographic structures of the country (gender, age, religion, education) affect the selection of food. Equally important are the analyses which confirm that the population in Vojvodina, which is multi-confessional, decided on different foods compared with the population in the southern part of the Republic, which is more homogeneous in terms of relegion. The paper represents a complex survey and analysis of the diet of the population in Serbia determined by numerous natural and demographic conditions, whilst also demonstrating the importance of agriculture for this country.

AB  - Intersex occurrence in freshwater fishes was evaluated for nine river basins in the United States. Testicular oocytes (predominantly male testes containing female germ cells) were the most pervasive form of intersex observed, even though similar numbers of male (n = 1477) and female (n = 1633) fish were examined. Intersex was found in 3% of the fish collected. The intersex condition was observed in four of the 16 species examined (25%) and in fish from 34 of 111 sites (31%). Intersex was not found in multiple species from the same site but was most prevalent in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides; 18% of males) and smallmouth bass (M. dolomieu; 33% of males). The percentage of intersex fish per site was 8-91% for largemouth bass and 14-73% for smallmouth bass. The incidence of intersex was greatest in the southeastern United States, with intersex largemouth bass present at all sites in the Apalachicola, Savannah, and Pee Dee River Basins. Total mercury, trans-nonachlor, p,p'-DDE, pp'-DDD, and total PCBs were the most commonly detected chemical contaminants at all sites, regardless of whether intersex was observed. Although the genotype of the intersex fish was not determined, the microscopic appearance of the gonads, the presence of mature sperm, and the concentrations of sex steroid hormones and vitellogenin indicate the intersex bass were males. Few reproductive endpoints differed significantly among male and intersex bass; plasma vitellogenin concentration in males was not a good indicator of intersex presence. Hierarchical linkages of the intersex condition to reproductive function will require a more quantitative measure of intersex (e.g. severity index) rather than presence or absence of the condition. The baseline incidence of intersex gonadal tissue in black basses and other freshwater fishes is unknown, but intersex prevalence may be related to collection season, age, and endocrine active compounds in the environment. Intersex was not found in largemouth bass older than five years and was most common in 1-3-year-old male largemouth bass. The cause(s) of intersex in these species is also unknown, and it remains to be determined whether the intersex we observed in largemouth and smallmouth bass developed during sex differentiation in early life stages, during exposure to environmental factors during adult life stages, or both.

AB  - Biochar can reduce salinity stress and metal toxicity to soil microbial community and enzymatic activity, hence would improve soil biological fertility and quality. However, the effects of sugarcane bagasse biochar (SCB) on microbial and biochemical responses to salinity stress in metal co-contaminated soils still remain unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of SCB application on microbial activity, biomass and enzymatic activities in a soil co-contaminated with cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) when simultaneously exposed to NaCl salinity stress during an incubation experiment. Soil samples were initially co-contaminated with cadmium (10 mg Cd kg(-1)) and lead (150 mg Pb kg(-1)) solutions, then pre-incubated for 30 days and finally salinized with three levels of NaCl solution (0, 20 and 40 mM NaCl). Two slow pyrolysis SCBs prepared at 400 and 600 degrees C were applied to the saline polluted soils at 1% (w/w) and the mixtures were incubated for 120 days under laboratory conditions. Soils amended with raw bagasse and without amendment were also used in the experiment. Results showed that soil amendment with SCBs decreased the availability of Cd by 17-19% and Pb by 11-18%, and increased the content of soil organic carbon (SOC) by 96-104% and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by 14-164% under saline conditions. High-temperature SCB decreased metal availability and enhanced SOM content in the soil more than low-temperature SCB. Application of SCBs increased soil microbial and biochemical properties from 27 to 180%, depending on the pyrolysis temperature, salinity level and the assay itself. Biochar reduced the adverse influences of metal toxicity and salinity stresses on soil microbial and biochemical functions, most largely through immobilizing metals and improving SOC and DOC. Low-temperature SCB promoted soil microbial quality more than high-temperature SCB. This study indicated that low-temperature SCB could be used as an amendment in metal co-contaminated soils to alleviate the potential risks associated with the combined effects of metal pollution and salinity stresses on microbial and biochemical indicators of soil quality/health under arid and semi-arid conditions. The findings would have some useful implications for the soils co-contaminated with toxic metals under the stress of salinity and for rehabilitation of salt-affected soils using SCB as a cost-effective source of organic matter.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The present study investigated whether the temperature-humidity index (THI) influences the production parameters and physiology of laying hens. Two environmental conditions combining high temperature with low relative humidity (T(L)H(H)75) or vice versa (T(H)H(L)75), with the same THI value (75), were considered. The same THI value indicated equal thermal stress for laying hens. Neither T(L)H(H)75 nor T(H)H(L)75 affected laying performance, including egg production, egg weight, and egg mass, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, plasma biochemical parameters, and stress indicators. Our study suggests that laying hens exposed to the same THI values will receive similar thermal stresses. The results of this study will serve as a scientific basis for management decisions and handling laying hens under thermally challenging conditions.
   We investigated the effect of different ambient temperatures and relative humidity (RH) with the same temperature-humidity indices (THI) on laying performance, egg quality, heterophil to lymphocyte ratio (H/L ratio), corticosterone (CORT) concentration in blood, yolk, and albumen, and plasma biochemical parameters of laying hens. Commercial hens (Hy-Line Brown; n = 120), aged 60 weeks, were allocated to two environmental chambers. Laying hens were subjected to either one of two thermal treatments-26 degrees C and 70% RH (T(L)H(H)75) or 30 degrees C and 30% RH (T(H)H(L)75) for 28 days-with the same THI of 75. Neither T(L)H(H)75 nor T(H)H(L)75 affected laying performance, including egg production, egg weight, egg mass, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio (p > 0.05). Plasma biochemical parameters such as total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus were not altered by the environmental treatments (p > 0.05). As for stress indicators, both environmental regimes failed to affect blood H/L ratio and CORT levels in plasma, yolk, and albumen (p > 0.05), although albumen CORT levels were elevated (p < 0.05) in T(L)H(H)75 group at day 7. Hence, our study suggests that laying hens performed and responded similarly when exposed to either T(L)H(H)75 or T(H)H(L)75 characterized by the same THI. These results can serve as a scientific basis for management decisions and handling laying hens under thermally challenging conditions.

AB  - Global aquaculture production has increased rapidly over recent decades, playing an important role in serving an essential protein source for world population. Understanding and mitigating its resource use and environmental impacts are important for the sector to grow in a sustainable manner. As a renewable resource, solar energy has been considered to reduce energy burdens as well as environmental impacts of fish farming practices. This study aims to investigate the applicability of solar water heating systems under different geographical conditions (cold, moderate, and hot climates) with consideration of both environmental and economic impacts. In addition, different operational strategies and design factors were considered including water sources (groundwater and streamwater), heating amounts (0 to 100% heating), and solar system designs (horizontally or optimally oriented solar panels). Energy requirement was estimated based on a recirculating aquaculture system for Nile tilapia production under indoor and outdoor conditions. Instead of energy savings, the potential economic improvements due to the temperature effect on fish yields were considered as an economic benefit of using solar water heating systems for aquaculture. It was found that environmental impacts of solar water heaters under the cold climate decreased as heating increased from 20% to 80% due to the large improvement in fish production, while the impacts increased with increased heating in the hot and moderate climates. In life cycle costing, the use of solar water heater for aquaculture was economically favorable at any heating strategy as well as under any setting and climate, except for a 20% heating in the cold climate. When compared to electric water heaters, solar water heaters generally showed lower environmental impacts across all cases. However, economic benefits of solar water heaters over electric heaters were dependent upon heating strategy, setting and climate condition. Due to the variations of heating demand and efficiency of solar system, considerations of water source and solar system design could further mitigate environmental and economic impacts. The sensitivity analysis showed that life cycle environmental impact assessment results in this study were most sensitive to the choice of species, while life cycle costing results were most sensitive to the inputs associated with the annual incomes and the cultured fish. This study can provide insights to the optimal operational strategies of the solar water heating systems for aquaculture to seek environmentally and economically sustainable energy systems.

AB  - Farming in Serbia is traditionally rainfed. Analyses show that drought events of varying severity are frequent in this region, although there is no specific pattern. There is a distinct need for an objective assessment of the impact of drought on strategic field crops, to solve the dilemma whether irrigation is required or not. For this reason, and based on available field data, the FAO AquaCrop water driven model was selected to simulate yield and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) for three major field crops (maize, sunflower, and sugar beet), under two scenarios: (1) natural water supply and adequate supply of nutrients, and (2) supplementary irrigation and adequate supply of nutrients. The experiments presented here were conducted between 2000 and 2007 in northern Serbia, where chernozem soil is prevalent. Data of 2003 cropping seasons were used for local calibration, whereas the remaining years for validation. Results were such that local calibration resulted in very minor changes of AquaCrop coefficients (e.g.. maize basal crop coefficient, sunflower harvest index, etc.). Simulated maize yield levels exhibited the greatest departure from measured data under irrigation conditions (-3.6 and 3.3% during an extremely dry and an extremely wet year. respectively). Simulated sunflower yield levels varied by less than 10% in 8 out of 10 comparisons. The most extreme variation was noted during the extremely wet year. The difference between simulated and measured values in the case of sugar beet was from -10.2 to 12.2%. Large differences were noted only in two or three cases, under extreme climatic conditions. Statistical indicators - root mean square error (RMSE) and index of agreement (d) - for all three crops suggested that the model can be used to highly reliably assess yield and IWUE. This conclusion was derived based on low values of RMSE and high values of d (in the case of maize and sugar beet 0.999 for both yield and IWUE, and in the case of sunflower 0.999 for yield and 0.884 for IWUE). It is noteworthy that under wet conditions, the model suggested that sunflower and sugar beer do not require irrigation, as confirmed by experimental research. These data are significant because they show that the AquaCrop model can be used in impartial decision-making and in the selection of crops to be given irrigation priority in areas where water resources are limited.

AB  - The depth distribution of living (Rose Bengal-stained) benthic foraminifera in near-surface sediments was analyzed along 4 short cores from the western Iberian Margin and Gulf of Cadiz at water depths from 800 to 1920 m, Pore-water oxygen, Chloroplastic Pigment Equivalent (CPE), and total organic carbon (C-org) concentrations were measured in the same or adjacent cores. These values were used to constrain the limiting oxygen and nutrient levels that defined the ranges in sediment depth and abundance maxima of foraminiferal species. The population density showed a good correlation with pore-water oxygenation indicating that oxygen is a limiting factor for endobenthic foraminiferal assemblages at mid-depths between 800 and 1200 m, At the deep-water site, however, the fauna appeared nutrient limited, More than half of the benthic species occupied extended sediment depth habitats and a wide range of oxygen levels among the sites studied. Thirty-nine of 103 species occurred in two or more cores and showed distinct abundance maxima, 36 in the uppermost 2.0 cm where the CPE concentrations were high. Living foraminifers were not found at depths where the CPE-values were lower than 0.1 mug/g. This level indicates trophic conditions critical for the survival of endobenthic species. The frequency distribution of the lower oxygen range limits of all species showed maxima at the high oxic/low oxic (3 ml/l), low oxic/suboxic (1.5 ml/l), and suboxic/dysoxic (0.3 ml/l) boundaries and thus depicted the ecological significance of these previously recognized ecolimits, Only 30 % of the species display consistent patterns in relation to pore water oxygen. Dysoxic indicators were Globobulimina affinis, Chilostomella ovoidea and Bathysiphon capillare, Many species previously designated as suboxic indicators were ubiquitous or preferred microhabitats at oxic levels. Boundary conditions for the dysoxic indicator G. affinis were pelagic flux rates higher than 3.5 g C m(-2) yr(-1), a habitat depth below the homogeneously bioturbated layer in areas outside of high productivity zones, and CPE concentrations of 0.1 to 1,0, preferentially 0.7 to 0.8 mug/g. The distribution pattern suggested that G, affinis thrives mainly on dysoxic bacteria and actively seeks this nutrient resource.

AB  - Commercially farmed animals are frequently housed in conditions that impose a number of concurrent environmental stressors. For pigs housed indoors, elevated levels of mechanical noise, atmospheric ammonia and low light intensities are commonplace. This experiment examined the effects on growing pigs of chronic exposure to combinations of commercially relevant levels of these potential stressors. Four-week-old hybrid female pigs (n = 224) were housed under experimentally manipulated conditions of nominally either <5 or 20 ppm atmospheric concentration of ammonia (24h), a light intensity of 40 lux or 200 lux (12 h) and mechanical noise at either <= 60 or 80 dB(A) (24 h) for 15 weeks in a fully factorial arrangement (2(3)) of treatments. The response of pigs to these environmental factors was assessed using a suite of physiological, production and behavioural measures. These included indicators of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis activation such as salivary cortisol and adrenal morphometry, as well as body weight, food conversion efficiency and general health scores. Play behaviour was recorded as it is thought to be inversely related to stress. Chronic exposure to ammonia produced the strongest effect, shown by lower concentrations of salivary cortisol and larger adrenal cortices in the pigs reared under 20 ppm ammonia, which may have been indicative of a period of HPA activation leading to a downregulation of cortisol production. The pigs in the ammoniated rooms also performed less play behaviour than pigs in non-ammoniated rooms. There was evidence for an interaction between high noise and ammonia on the health scores of pigs and for brighter light to ameliorate the effect of ammonia on salivary cortisol. However, there was no measurable impact of these potential stressors on the productivity of the pigs or any of the other physiological parameters measured. We conclude that there should be little concern in terms of performance about the physical stressors tested here, within current European Union legal limits. However, 20 ppm ammonia may have had an adverse influence on the well-being of growing pigs. In this study, all other aspects of the pigs' husbandry were optimal; therefore, it is possible that under less favourable conditions, more pronounced effects of ammonia, noise and dim light would be observed.

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the degree to which organic feeding of dairy cows under the natural conditions of the Carpathian Foothills, compared to conventional feeding, will affect the yield, composition and fatty acid content of milk, some blood metabolites and reproductive indicators. The experiment was carried out with 24 Red-and-White x Holstein-Friesian Red cows (67.5% HF on average) during the period from 3 weeks before calving to 44 weeks of lactation. Cows-were assigned to two analogous groups (with 12 animals per group) subjected to different feeding regimes (O - organic, C - conventional). In group O, the basic roughage was meadow grass silage in winter and pasture forage in summer. In group C, it was maize silage all year round. In both groups, these feeds were supplemented with meadow hay, concentrate and mineral-vitamin mixture, and in the conventional feeding group additionally with wilted grass silage, brewers' grains and ensiled maize grain. The rations were formulated according to IZ-INRA standards (2001). Chemical composition and intake of feeds, body weight, body condition and milk yield, and. selected reproductive indicators were recorded. The milk was analysed for the content of basic nutrients, fatty acids and CLA. Blood serum was assayed for the concentration of free fatty acids, beta-hydroxybutyric acid, glucose, urea, albumins and aspartate aminotransferase. Average feed cost per production of 1 kg milk was determined in addition to the botanical composition, yield and intake of pasture sward in the organic herd. It was found that the organic feeding of cows with the lactation yield of about 7000 kg reduced the milk yield (by about 9-15%) compared to group C. Cows from group C also had a higher milk protein and casein content (by about 0.15 percentage units) compared to group O. Cows from group C were also characterized by higher maximum milk production at the peak of lactation and better lactation persistency as well as smaller body weight and body condition losses in the first period of lactation compared to animals from group O. No significant differences in the content of selected blood metabolites or reproductive indicators were found between the groups. The milk of cows from group O had a significantly higher content of n-6 and n-3 PUFA and CLA as well as a narrower ratio of n-6 to n-3 PUFA.

AB  - Organic-rich samples from the Holocene sedimentary sequence of Lake Sarbsko were investigated to reconstruct variations in the aquatic system in response to environmental change. The aims were to (i) identify organic matter (OM) sources, (ii) examine changes in soluble OM composition in relation to fluctuations in limnological conditions and (iii) validate the sensitivity of organic geochemical indicators in tracing environmental changes. Diatom frustules are abundant in all samples. Alginite macerals and terrigenous organic matter further contribute to the sedimentary OM. Organic petrography, total organic carbon (TOC/N ratio values and high content of biogenic silica (SiO(2bio-genic)) argue for a predominant algal source of OM. In contrast, the n-alkane distributions, high relative abundance of C(29) steroid hydrocarbons and high content of detrital quartz in the sediments provide evidence for the input of terrigenous material as a major OM source within the basin. The terpenoid biomarker composition indicates a contribution from conifers and angiosperms. From the diterpenoids in the samples a contribution from species of the coniferales family Pinaceae is concluded. TOC/S and Mg/Ca values, as well as steroid/hopanoid concentration ratios, reflect enhanced water salinity in this coastal lake due to ingression of brackish water from the Baltic Sea during the Atlantic and Sub-Atlantic periods. As indicated by the positive relationship between delta(13)C of TOC and Mg/Ca, delta(13)C values are influenced by changing contribution of marine vs. freshwater phytoplankton. Additional isotopic heterogeneity in delta(13)C may result from differences in terrigenous OM supply vs. autochthonous OM production in the lake. The isotopic composition of calcites supports the establishment of freshwater conditions in the lake during the SubBoreal period. Pristane/phytane and Fe/Mn ratios are interpreted to reflect differences in the redox conditions. Oxygenation of bottom waters was temporarily variable, with highest levels of oxygen availability during the Sub-Boreal (freshwater lake). High contents of hopanoid hydrocarbons argue for enhanced microbial activity in the water column and sediment. The occurrence of 2 beta-methyl-hopanes is related to the presence of cyanobacteria or methylo-trophic bacteria.
   The results demonstrate that in coastal basins of the Baltic Sea sedimentary OM content and composition are a function of the degree of isolation from the sea water. Therefore, organic geochemical data of coastal lake and lagoonal sediments are sensitive indicators for tracing environmental changes during the Holocene. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The very low-cost Nova particulate matter (PM) sensor SDS011 has recently drawn attention for its use for measuring PM mass concentration, which is frequently used as an indicator of air quality. However, this sensor has not been thoroughly evaluated in real-world conditions and its data quality is not well documented. In this study, three SDS011 sensors were evaluated by co-locating them at an official, air quality monitoring station equipped with reference-equivalent instrumentation in Oslo, Norway. The sensors' measurement results for PM2.5 were compared with data generated from the air quality monitoring station over almost a four-month period. Five performance aspects of the sensors were examined: operational data coverage, linearity of response and accuracy, inter-sensor variability, dependence on relative humidity (RH) and temperature (T), and potential improvement of sensor accuracy, by data calibration using a machine-learning method. The results of the study are: (i) the three sensors provide quite similar results, with inter-sensor correlations exhibiting R values higher than 0.97; (ii) all three sensors demonstrate quite high linearity against officially measured concentrations of PM2.5, with R-2 values ranging from 0.55 to 0.71; (iii) high RH (over 80%) negatively affected the sensor response; (iv) data calibration using only the RH and T recorded directly at the three sensors increased the R-2 value from 0.71 to 0.80, 068 to 0.79, and 0.55 to 0.76. The results demonstrate the general feasibility of using these low cost SDS011 sensors for indicative PM2.5 monitoring under certain environmental conditions. Within these constraints, they further indicate that there is potential for deploying large networks of such devices, due to the sensors' relative accuracy, size and cost. This opens up a wide variety of applications, such as high-resolution air quality mapping and personalized air quality information services. However, it should be noted that the sensors exhibit often very high relative errors for hourly values and that there is a high potential of abusing these types of sensors if they are applied outside the manufacturer-provided specifications particularly regarding relative humidity. Furthermore, our analysis covers only a relatively short time period and it is desirable to carry out longer-term studies covering a wider range of meteorological conditions.

TI  - Estimation of hydrogen sulfide emission rates at several wastewater treatment plants through experimental concentration measurements and dispersion modeling
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION
LA  - English
AB  - The management and operation of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) usually involve the release into the atmosphere of malodorous substances with the potential to reduce the quality of life of people living nearby. In this type of facility, anaerobic degradation processes contribute to the generation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), often at quite high concentrations; thus, the presence of this chemical compound in the atmosphere can be a good indicator of the occurrence and intensity of the olfactory impact in a specific area. The present paper describes the experimental and modelling work being carried out by CEAM-UMH in the surroundings of several wastewater treatment plants located in the Valencia Autonomous Community (Spain). This work has permitted the estimation of H2S emission rates at different WWTPs under different environmental and operating conditions. Our methodological approach for analyzing and describing the most relevant aspects of the olfactory impact consisted of several experimental campaigns involving intensive field measurements using passive samplers in the vicinity of several WWTPs, in combination with numerical simulation results from a diagnostic dispersion model. A meteorological tower at each WWTP provided the input values for the dispersion code, ensuring a good fit of the advective component and therefore more confidence in the modelled concentration field in response to environmental conditions. Then, comparisons between simulated and experimental H2S concentrations yielded estimates of the global emission rate for this substance at several WWTPs at different time periods. The results obtained show a certain degree of temporal and spatial (between-plant) variability (possibly due to both operational and environmental conditions). Nevertheless, and more importantly, the results show a high degree of uniformity in the estimates, which consistently stay within the same order of magnitude.
   Implications: Estimating emissions to the atmosphere is usually considered a complex task, especially when such discharge comes from diffuse or uncontrolled sources. In any approach to air quality control, just from the point of view of increasing knowledge or as a management problem in order to reduce present levels of pollution, accurate estimation of emission rates is revealed as a fundamental step. Evaluation from an indirect method provides a useful methodology in such cases. Combination of dispersion modeling with experimental air concentration measurements permits one to obtain a first estimation of H2S emission rates at several wastewater treatment plants. In a subsequent refinement of the process, the initial constant average emissions calculated were improved, leading to the formulation of a time-varying emission model, as a function of environmental quantities.

AB  - Aquatic species throughout the interior Columbia River basin are at risk. Evaluation of the potential effects of federal land management on aquatic ecosystems across this region is an important but challenging task. Issues include the size and complexity of the systems, uncertainty in important processes and existing states, flexibility and consistency in the analytical framework, and an ability to quantify results. We focused on salmonid fishes and their habitats as indicators of conditions in aquatic ecosystems and used Bayesian belief networks as a formal, quantitative framework to address the issues in our evaluation of land management alternatives proposed for the interior Columbia River basin. Because empirical information is limited at the scales relevant to our analysis, an ability to combine both empirical and more subjective information was key to the analysis. The representation of linkages through conditional probabilities made uncertainty explicit. We constructed two general networks. One represented the influence of landscape characteristics and existing and predicted management activities on aquatic habitats. A second represented the influence of habitat, existing biotic conditions, and for two anadromous species, ocean and migratory conditions, on the status of six widely distributed salmonid fishes. In the long term (100 years) all three land management alternatives were expected to produce positive changes in the status and distribution of the salmonids and their habitats. Trends were stronger for habitat than for the status of salmonids because of greater uncertainty in linking the fish and habitat networks and constraints outside spawning and rearing habitat on federal lands in the study area. Trends were stronger for resident salmonids than anadromous forms because of additional effects of the migratory corridor assumed for the latter. Alternative S2, which approached ecosystem restoration more conservatively, generally produced the strongest positive changes, and alternative S3, designed to promote more aggressive restoration, the weakest. Averaged across the basin, differences among the alternatives were small. Differences were greater at finer temporal and spatial scales. In the short term (10 years) alternative S3 was expected to lead to further degradation in some areas. By formalizing our understanding and assumptions in these networks, we provided a framework for exploring differences in the management alternatives that is more quantifiable, spatially explicit, and flexible than previous approaches.

AB  - Criteria and indicators (C&I) for sustainable forest management (SFM) are an important tool to monitor forest condition and assess forest management in individual countries, as well as an instrument to support forest policy making, public communication and international forest-related reporting. Many European countries have formulated and adopted their own sets of C&I based on guidelines developed under the Forest Europe process (formerly MCPFE). Despite effective sustainable forest management in Poland has been practiced for decades, no formal set of C&I has been adopted so far. The aim of this paper is to outline international processes of SFM monitoring and Poland's international obligations concerning forest management reporting, as well as the political and legal frameworks for formulating a set of adequate criteria and indicators for SFM. The paper reviews the most important documents and legal acts concerning the standardization of the principles of forest management in the international forum, as well as international conventions concerning - directly or indirectly - management and protection of forest resources. The review shows that for nearly three decades within the Forest Europe, intensive measures to develop, improve and disseminate C&I for sustainable forest management in individual countries have been taken. Poland has actively participated in the Forest Europe process from its very beginning, it is also a signatory to all declarations and resolutions developed within the process, as well as a party to most of the significant forest-related international conventions and agreements. Despite several attempts, Poland has not yet managed to develop and adopt a set of its own C&I for sustainable forest management that would allow to measure specific quantitative and qualitative characteristics and to support monitoring trends in sustainability of forest management over time. Although the annual report on the condition of forests in Poland contains information about the condition of forest resources and the health of forests and their changes, as well as about the functions performed and ecosystem services provided by forests, its content and the structure are not formally regulated and are not in line with the C&I recommended by Forest Europe. This lack of clearly established C&I may make it difficult to compare situation year-by-year and to clearly assess the degree of implementation of the principles of SFM in Poland.

AB  - Benthic diatoms are commonly used for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction in Arctic regions, but interpretation of their ecology remains challenging. We studied epilithic diatom assemblages from the shallow margins of 19 lakes from three areas (coast-inland-ice sheet margin) along a climate gradient in Kangerlussuaq, West Greenland during two periods; shortly after ice-off (spring) and in the middle of the growth season (summer). We aimed to understand the distribution of Arctic epilithic diatoms in relation to water chemistry gradients during the two seasons, to investigate their incorporation into lake sediments and to assess their applicability as palaeoenvironmental indicators. Diatoms were correlated with nutrients in the spring and alkalinity/major ions in the summer, when nutrients were depleted; approximately half of the variance explained was independent of spatial factors. When categorised by functional attributes, diatom seasonal succession differed among regions with the most obvious changes in inland lakes where summer temperatures are warmer, organic nutrient processing is prevalent and silicate is limiting. These conditions led to small, motile and adnate diatoms being abundant in inland lakes during the summer (Nitzschia spp., Encyonopsis microcephala), as these functional attributes are suited to living within complex mats of non-siliceous microbial biofilms. Seasonal succession in silica-rich lakes at the coast was less pronounced and assemblages included Tabellaria flocculosa (indicating more acidic conditions) and Hannaea arcus (indicating input from inflowing rivers). The nitrogen-fixing diatom Epithemia sorex increased from the coast to the ice sheet, negatively correlating with a gradient of reactive nitrogen. The presence of this diatom in Holocene sediment records alongside cyanobacterial carotenoids during arid periods of low nitrogen delivery, suggests that it is a useful indicator of nitrogen limitation. Nitzschia species appear to be associated with high concentrations of organic carbon and heterotrophy, but their poor representation in West Greenland lake sediments due to taphonomic processes limits their palaeoenvironmental application in this region. Proportions of epilithic taxa in lake sediment records of coastal lakes increased during some wetter periods of the Holocene, suggesting that snowpack-derived nutrient delivery may offer diatom taxa living at lake margins a competitive advantage over planktonic diatoms during the "moating" ice melt period. Thus, further research investigating linkages between epilithic diatoms, snowpack and nutrient delivery in seasonally frozen lakes is recommended as these taxa live on the 'front-line' during the spring and may be especially sensitive to changes in snowmelt conditions.

AB  - Water stress is arguably the most limiting factor affecting cereal productivity in the world and its effects are likely to increase due to climate change. It is therefore imperative to have a wide-ranging understanding of water stress effects on crop physiological processes so as to better manage, improve and adapt crops to future climates. A field study was carried out to investigate the influence of four moisture levels on the following: (1) flag leaf CO2 assimilation and flag leaf carbon content; (2) the utility of flag leaf spectral reflectance to monitor leaf water status and as an indicator of biomass and grain yield; and (3) biomass and grain yield performance of four spring triticale genotypes in a dry winter environment (steppe, arid climate). The experiment was carried out in a factorial arrangement of four moisture levels and four spring type triticale genotypes). Soil moisture level significantly influenced biomass accumulation, grain yield, CO2 assimilation, flag leaf carbon content and spectral reflectance. Grain yield levels ranged from 0.8 to 3.5 t ha(-1) in 2013 and 1.8 to 4.9 t ha(-1) in 2014. CO2 assimilation was significantly higher under well-watered (WW) conditions (9.92 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in 2013; 11.64 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in 2014) and decreased gradually with moisture level to 1.82 and 4.74 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) under severe stress (SS) in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Flag leaf carbon content was significantly higher under water limited conditions compared to WW. Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Water Index (WI) were significant and positively correlated to biomass and grain yield. WI was particularly strongly correlated to biomass (0.72***) and grain yield (0.55***). However, no clear varietal effects were detected. This study revealed that carbon tends to accumulate in flag leaves under water stress and that flag leaf carbon content is influenced more by the export capacity of the flag leaves than on CO2 assimilation rate. WI was found to be superior index in monitoring water stress in triticale compared to NDVI and NDWI. Above all, spring triticale proved to be adaptable to steppe (dry) climate of Limpopo and that livestock farmers in the province can successfully grow triticale for silage under MS conditions.

AB  - All or a part of a sequence of forest practices (i.e., salvage logging, site preparation, planting crop trees, and weeding) has been implemented after natural disturbances for the rapid re-establishment of tree cover. Forest policies in Japan have recently changed from monocultural planting of coniferous crop trees to planting native broadleaved trees to restore forests and nurture local biodiversity following large windthrows. However, the effects of this new practice on preserving biodiversity, as well as the effects of legacy retention, have never been verified in Asia. Thus, the objective of our research was to compare the effects of legacy retention with plantation after salvaging on the initial stage of vegetation recovery in a blowdown area, specifically focusing on plant species diversity, the occurrence of alien species, and the composition of plant species. Following the analysis of our results, we finally describe appropriate practices to alter disturbed coniferous plantations to bring the species composition closer to that of the original natural mixed forests.
   A control (A, legacy retention) and three experimental treatment sites (B, salvage logged, site prepared, and Quercus crispula seedlings planted; C, same as B, but weeded once during the summer; and D, residual rows that emerged after establishing sites for planting) were prepared, and quadrats were set. Eleven indicators of the ground condition and the number of vascular plant species, including ferns, were quantified, and the number and abundance of residual and newly colonized plants of the main woody species were estimated.
   Our main findings were as follows: (1) in unsalvaged sites and residual rows, the diversity of plant species was poor, but a variety of plant species compositions were observed due to the heterogeneous conditions of the ground and ample residual plants; (2) in the planting site, many species appeared, but little variety of the species composition was observed due to the homogeneous condition of the ground and the destruction of residual plants; (3) a large number of alien species emerged in broad, unvegetated areas; (4) the impact of site preparation overwhelmed the impact of salvage logging on the initial recovery of plant species; and (5) to restore a natural mixed forest, a combination of legacy retention and plantation after salvaging would be the most appropriate.

AB  - Simple Summary Gili Trawangan is one of three small islands comprising the Gili Islands, Indonesia, whose economy relies almost exclusively on tourism. With no motor vehicles on the Islands, working ponies transport locals and the one million tourists visiting annually, as well as all water, food, rubbish, and building supplies. The ponies work in hot, humid conditions, and the limited access to veterinary services and their remote location put animal welfare at risk. The aim of this pilot study was to provide an overview of pony health and welfare, and the related attitudes and knowledge of pony cart drivers on Gili Trawangan. Thirty-eight ponies were examined, and 33 cart drivers were interviewed in May 2017. Our results showed that, while most ponies were in good body condition, almost half were underweight. Most ponies had wounds and hoof lesions, and many were lame with possibly painful gaits. Importantly, many cart drivers stated they would work ponies regardless of injury or illness. This study can inform volunteer efforts that are carried out on the Islands. Further training of local workers is recommended to improve working pony health and welfare. Many working equids in developing countries experience poor health and welfare due to environmental and management factors. Collecting baseline data on these populations is essential to inform education projects to improve equid health and welfare. Gili Trawangan is an island in Indonesia that has no motor vehicles and a working pony population of approximately 200. This pilot study sought to determine baseline data on their health, welfare, and husbandry to inform future health and welfare strategies. A cross-sectional study was performed in May 2017 consisting of a pony cart driver questionnaire (n = 33) and a basic pony health examination (n = 38). The body condition scores of ponies were 3/5 (60.5%), 2/5 (31.6%), and 1/5 (7.9%), while 38% and 92% of ponies had lameness and foot pathology, respectively, and 31 ponies (86.1%) had at least one wound. Thirty percent of cart drivers stated they would work their ponies despite evidence of injury or illness. Limited education, poor access to veterinary services, and remoteness pose barriers to improving pony health and welfare. Our results indicate a need for, and can help inform, targeted education programmes to improve the lives of working ponies and protect livelihoods and tourism on Gili Trawangan.

AB  - Organic agriculture figures prominently in the policies adopted by the EU to improve the environmental impact of agriculture. It may also potentially provide other benefits such as high-quality, health-enhancing food products and advancements in rural development. Recent years have brought new research to assess the environmental and economic implications of organic conversion. Economic efficiency comparisons between organic and conventional farms have been extended to include environmental performance. The inclusion of this variable in efficiency analysis may be useful when assessing the potential impact of suggestions to improve environmental regulations and policies. This paper applies the environmental efficiency model to the analysis of different technologies and calculates productivity and efficiency with and without environmental impacts. In the empirical part of the paper Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and bootstrap techniques are applied to detect and measure differences between organic and conventional agriculture aggregate efficiency and productivity in a sample of vineyard farms operating in semiarid, non-irrigated conditions in Navarre (Spain), taking farms' nitrogen surplus and pesticide toxicity indicators to consideration. The results for these particular agronomic conditions suggest that organic agriculture is more environmentally efficient than conventional agriculture in dryland farming, in that it achieves a more favorable production to environmental impact ratio. Nevertheless, conversion to organic production methods for extensive vine cultivation under arid conditions does not guarantee substantial environmental gains, since the organic farms in our sample do not display inferior levels of pollution emissions per unit input as extensive conventional production. The overall environmental efficiency of organic farming is largely attributable to the fact that organic farms come closer to the frontier of their own technology. We find no significant technological differences in environmental productivity, however. In terms of policy implications, these findings suggest that the tightening of specific environmental restrictions in organic standards should involve consideration of technological differences in environmental productivity between organic and other alternative technologies. If organic technology is less productive, more restrictive regulation could undermine the economic viability of farms, and thus undermine the other benefits of organic farming. The results also indicate that, at the local level, it could be convenient to address part of organic subsidies to further improvements in the control of pollution from fertilizers and pesticides.

AB  - Photochemical rate constants (j values) are crucial indicators for evaluating the importance of photochemical reactions in environmental svstems. While measurement of aqueous j values via chemical actinometry is relatively straightforward under most conditions, problems arise with ambient conditions below freezing, such as at very high latitudes or altitudes. To address this problem. we have developed a new method for low temperature actinometry using solutions of acetonitrile (ACN) and water. which have freezing points down to -44 degrees C. In this method we measure the formation of phenol from the photolysis of an (OH)-O-center dot-generating chromophore in the presence of benzene. Using results from laboratory tests we correct our phenol field results in ACN/H2O to rate constants for chromophore photolysis expected for water-ice (i.e., in the quasi-liquid layer of snow grains) under the same conditions. In part I of this study, we use this method at Summit, Greenland on the surface snow and to depths of similar to 30cm using hydrogen peroxide (HOOH) and nitrite (NO2-) as the chromophores. While the method works well for determining the rate constant for HOOH photolysis (j(HOOH)), we encountered problems using the technique with nitrite. However, measured PhOH formation rate constants for nitrite in acetonitrile, j(NO2)(ACN)<-> PhOH, still provide an excellent means for calculating snowpack 2 e-folding depths for NO2- photolysis (i.e., the depth over which the rate constant decreases by a factor of e). Values of j(HOOH) 2 and j(NO2-) determined from measurements of actinic flux (above the snow) and irradiance (in snow) suggest that the value of j(HOOH) on the surface snow at midday was 8.6 x 10(-7)S(-1) in mid-March and increased by 300% by the start of May, while j(NO2--> PhOH) (ACN) midday surface values were consistently (1 -3) x 10(-7) S-1 throughout the season. Within the snowpack, average NO 2 PhOH e-folding depths determined from chemical actinometry were 13.3(+/- 0.88) cm for j(HOOH) and 16.3(+/- 4.2) cm for j(NO2-)-> PhOHACN; e-folding depths determined from in-snow spectral radiometer measurements of irradiance were similar. The larger e-folding depth for nitrite is because this chromophore absorbs at longer wavelengths where there is less light extinction in the snow. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Alteration of gene expression is a crucial component of adaptation by animals to hypoxic conditions and is mediated by specific transcription factors, hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), which are composed of a and subunits. In this study, we report the cloning and characterization of two HIF-alpha subunits, HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha, and their expression in various tissues of a hypoxia-tolerant marine teleost, Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). The full-length croaker HIF-1 alpha (2805 bp) and HIF-2 alpha (3205 bp) cDNAs contain open reading frames encoding proteins with 720 and 847 amino acids, respectively, which are highly homologous to the HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha proteins of other non-mammalian species. Croaker HIF-1 alpha shares only 43% sequence identity with the croaker HIF-2 alpha subunit. However, the basic helix-loop-helix/Per-ARNT-Sim regions appear to be relatively well conserved between the two proteins, with identities of 75-83%. The core oxygen-dependent degradation domain regions in croaker HIFs are well conserved, suggesting a similar mechanism of HIF degradation to that in other vertebrate species. Northern blot analysis showed that croaker HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha mRNAs (transcript sizes 3.0-3.8 kb) are highly expressed in the brain, heart, liver, and gonads under hypoxic conditions, whereas muscle tissues show lower levels of expression. Short-term (1.7 mg/L dissolved oxygen, DO for 3 days to I week) and longterm (1.7, 2.7 and 3.7 mg/L DO for 3 weeks) hypoxia exposure caused significant increases in HIF-1 alpha and HlF-2 alpha mRNA expression in croaker ovaries compared to mRNA levels in fish held in normoxic conditions (DO: 6.5 mg/L). However, HIF transcript levels in hypoxia-exposed fish had returned to control values 24 h after the DO in the tanks was restored to normoxic levels. The results suggest that the upregulation of both HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2a subunits at the transcriptional level is an important component of adaptation of croaker to chronic hypoxia and HIF-alpha s are potentially useful molecular indicators of environmental hypoxia exposure.

AB  - The purpose of the research is a set of theoretical and methodological, methodical and applied provisions concerning the analysis of economic development built on knowledge (KE) in the regions of Ukraine and also the determination of their integral estimation of KE development level. Methodology. The research methodology is based on a systematic approach, within which analysed KAM methodology (Knowledge Assessment Methodology) developed by the World Bank, identified key groups of indicators, such as the general condition of regional economies, economic stimulus and the characteristics of the institutional system, innovation, R&D sector and informational infrastructure. Considered the key factors that determine the position of knowledge in the regional development, namely: the business community, the scientific environment and the system of self-government, which forms regional policy in the light of specific conditions of areas. The possibility of this methodology's application in the regional aspect is determined. For the research are chosen all regions of Ukraine. Exceptions are temporarily occupied territory. Accordingly, histograms of each of the key indicators' groups are built that help to determine the level of development of a particular region. Results. Established that the symbiosis of innovative potential with the unique economic mechanisms is the catalysts that enhance the development of the regional knowledge economy. This analysis helps to see social and economic differences between the regions of Ukraine. Determined that the characteristic feature is an inadequate level of funding of science, which causes the slowdown of innovation activity in the regions because of links imbalance between industry and research industry sector. In most cases, the regions occupied similar positions in different groups of indicators. This allows us to conclude that the development of the knowledge economy components in the region is balanced. Noteworthy the fact that during analysing each of the indicators groups, the lion's share of regions was located around the median value, which points to the similarity of the condition of knowledge development in the economy of the regions. Highlighted powerful, competitive and potentially most perspective regions in terms of KE development in 2015. The practical implication of the results is findings and proposals for the formation of a regional knowledge economy development strategy. Found that the program support of the knowledge economy development should aim at the accelerated and harmonious growth of all triad elements "education - science - manufacturing" and their resulting components.

AB  - A total of 117 surface sediment samples from sites across the Pearl River Estuary, southern China, were collected to analyze relationships between foraminiferal distributions and environmental parameters such as salinity, depth, substrate, and water energy. A total of 123 species of foraminifera were identified. A Q-mode cluster analysis resulted in five clusters (relative abundance >= 5%), which each corresponded to a particular species association, reflecting different sub-environments: (A) the Ammonia tepida-Elphidium excavatum association, found in distributary channels and river mouths of the estuary, with low salinity, shallow water, strong currents, and comparatively coarse sediments; (B) the Ammobaculites formosensis-Cavarotalia annectens association, found in brackish waters near Lantau Island and southeastern Lingding Bay, characterizing turbid brackish-water conditions and sediment consisting of a mixture of sand-clay-silt; (C) the Haplophragmoides canariensis-Ammobaculites agglutinans var. association, found in the artificial harbor near Macao and greatly affected by human activities; (D) the Ammonia beccarii var. Cavarotalia annectens association, mainly found in the deep channels of two bays and representing euryhaline conditions; and (E) the Ammonia tepida-Elphidiunz advenum association, mainly found at depths >10 m, higher salinity, low energy, and fine-grained substrate, indicating relatively stable conditions. Agglutinated foraminiferal taxa are better indicators than calcareous taxa of littoral zone environments with a mixture of sand-clay-silt substrate. Benthic foraminiferal distributions in the surface sediments were strongly influenced by salinity. Consequently, a salinity transfer function was developed using weighted-averaging partial least-squares regression. The transfer function was tested on a sediment core collected near the Modaomen distributary, with the goal to reconstruct the palaeosalinity from similar to 10,100 to similar to 5960 cal yr BP, an interval with sufficient foraminiferal tests for analysis. At similar to 10,100 cal yr BP, marine waters flooded the Da'ao plain. Then, a semi-enclosed estuarine environment developed and persisted until similar to 5960 cal yr BP. Salinity at the core site increased gradually during the early Holocene (from similar to 10,100 to similar to 8200 cal yr BP), although a short-term decrease can be recognized. The peak salinity occurred between similar to 8520 and 8200 cal yr BP, when brackish-marine taxa reached their highest abundances. The core site experienced declining salinity from similar to 8200 cal yr BP onwards as a result of strong river discharge and a decrease of marine water influence at the core site.

AB  - Analyzing intraspecific variation in population dynamics in relation to environmental factors is crucial to understand the current and future distributions of plant species. Across ranges, peripheral populations are often expected to show lower and more temporally variable vital rates than central populations, although it remains unclear how much any differences in vital rates actually contribute to differences in population growth rates. Moreover, few demographic studies accounting for environmental stochasticity have been carried out both at continental and regional scales. In this study we calculated stochastic growth rates in five central and six northern peripheral populations of the widespread short-lived herb Plantago coronopus along the Atlantic Coast in Europe. To evaluate at two spatial scales how mean values and variability of vital rates (i.e., fecundity, recruitment, survival, growth, and shrinkage) contributed to the differences in stochastic growth rates, we performed Stochastic Life Table Response Experiment (SLTRE) analyses between and within central and peripheral regions. Additionally, we searched for correlations between vital rate contributions and local environmental conditions. Lower mean values and greater variability for some vital rates in peripheral than in central populations had an overall negative but nonsignificant effect on the stochastic growth rates in the periphery. Different life cycle components accounted for differences in population growth depending on spatial scale, although recruitment was the vital rate with the highest influence both between and within regions. Interestingly, the same pattern of differentiation among populations was found within central and peripheral areas: in both regions, one group of populations displayed positive contributions of growth and shrinkage and negative contributions of recruitment and survival; the opposite pattern was found in the remaining populations. These differences in vital rate contributions among populations within regions were correlated with precipitation regime, whereas at the continental scale, differences in contribution patterns were related to temperature. Altogether, our results show how populations of P. coronopus exhibit life cycle differences that may enable the species to persist in locations with widely varying environmental conditions. This demographic flexibility may help to explain the success of widespread plants across large and heterogeneous ranges.

AB  - Soil-crop models are widely used as valuable tools to assess the combined effects of cropping practices, soil management and climate on the agro-environmental indicators. They provide a wide range of predictive information that are useful to design and evaluate innovative cropping systems. However, intercropping modeling is still under development, especially for grain legumes-based intercropping system. We performed here the first calibration of the STICS (v 9.2) model on chickpea grown under contrasting nitrogen (N) levels during two copping seasons (2018/2019 and 2019/2020). This calibration allowed us to simulate a wide range of agronomic scenarios (climate, N-fertilization and cropping system) to optimize intercrops (durum wheat-chickpea) management. 37 parameters were estimated by using a sequential optimization method. Our results showed that STICS performs well in predicting Leaf Area Index (LAI), above ground biomass (AGB) and N uptake (AGPN) for both intercropped and sole cropped species, with satisfactory model efficiency (EF ranged from 0.62 to 0.93). In addition, grain yield was correctly predicted by the model with small error (NRMSE 13%) especially for wheat crop (EF 21%). STICS predicted well root depth under the conditions of our field study (EF 37%). For soil outputs variables, the model simulated adequately soil water content with a satisfactory model efficiency (EF 0.28) with high relative error (NRMSE 56%) in sole cropping system, while it was moderately adequately predicted (EF < 0.44) in intercropping. Under the two contrasted years and N-application conditions of this study, the temporal dynamic was well reproduced by the model for both plant and soil outputs with low simulation errors. RMSE values were lesser than 0.6 m2m-2 (9%), 0.2 t ha-1 (14%) and 30 kg ha-1 (12%), respectively for LAI, grain yield and AGPN of sole cropped chickpea. The dynamic of soil water content was also well reproduced among all N-application rate and during the two cropping year, with RMSE equal to 27 mm (<10%). The present work provides the first calibration for chickpea sole crop and an evaluation for durum wheat-chickpea intercrops, which will allow to use the STICS model to simulate scenarios of innovative cropping practices based on crop diversification (i.e. grain legumes and cereals) and N-fertilization management.

AB  - In the conditions of implementation of the European integration strategy of Ukraine, the issues of forming competitive environment, creating additional jobs and reducing unemployment, increasing social and economic protection of the population are of particular importance. That is why the promotion of small and mediumsized enterprises remains one of the priority directions of national and regional economic policy. SMEs are a form of organization of activities that takes into account the interests of an individual, and forms conditions for improving his (her) own well-being. The main criteria for assigning an enterprise to small and medium-sized businesses are the number of employees for the reporting period and annual income. In addition, other (additional) criteria, such as the balance sheet amount in Poland, may be used. The comparative analysis of the criteria for assigning enterprises to small and medium-sized businesses indicates that the current Ukrainian legislation complies with the legal norms and requirements of the legislation of European countries. The main sources of SME financing include the own funds of business entities, loans from banking and non-banking institutions, as well as budget funds and resources from international funds, organizations, etc. Summarizing and systematizing the experience of lending to small and medium-sized enterprises in Ukraine and Poland shows that the following problems can be attributed to the main ones that restrain banks: a high level of riskiness of SMEs (especially projects "from ground zero"), a low level of transparency of economic activity of SMEs; lack of reliable collateral; low level of state support. The main problems of SME-borrowers are the high cost of credit resources; complicated loan procedures; high requirements of banks for providing loans, etc. That is why creating a supportive business environment for SMEs requires effective partnerships between government, community and business, in particular, development and implementation of state support programs for SMEs, stimulating SMEs lending, attracting external investors, and using international SMEs support experience. Complex implementation of these measures will promote socio-economic development and increase the standard of living of the population.
   The purpose of the article is to study the experience of lending to SMEs in Ukraine and Poland and to determine the possibilities of using foreign experience in the development of state and regional programs for support of small and medium-sized enterprises in Ukraine.

AB  - Alternating bands of vegetation and bare soil, reported from many dryland regions, have been identified as indicators of rangeland deterioration triggered by overgrazing, cattle trampling or climatic change. Banded vegetation occurs at a range of scales and although it has been reported from a number of different environments, it is not characteristic of all degraded rangelands. It does appear particularly frequently on low angle, smooth slopes over soils of high erodibility but low permeability, where scant rainfall is sporadic or highly seasonal. It has been attributed both to wind and to water erosion, but few data on the processes active or their specific response to limiting environmental variables are available. Small-scale banded vegetation associated with small scour steps occurs on low angle alluvio-lacustrine flats surrounding Lake Baringo in semi-arid northern Kenya. In this area of strong moisture deficit, the dominant factor controlling the incidence of ground vegetation is variation in near-surface moisture storage. The regular spacing of the small-scale vegetation bands reflects preferential moisture storage in regularly-spaced sediment deposits. Field and laboratory runon and rainfall simulation experiments, previously reported, provided some data on the processes and conditions involved in formation of these deposits. This paper describes more closely-controlled laboratory rainfall simulation and runon experiments, carried out to identify the sequential scour and deposition processes involved, which are ultimately responsible for the regular variations in moisture storage capacity. These experiments, carried out in an 8.5 m long flume, show critical stream power (Omega) conditions in sheetwash and rain-impacted sheetflow required for sequential scour/deposition as 0.020-0.025 W m(-2) and between 0.043 and 0.055 W m(-2), respectively. Experimental results indicate that vegetation bands at the scale observed at Baringo are consistent with development by sequential scour and deposition, caused by some combination of sheetwash, rainsplash and rainflow. The vegetation bands are composed primarily of unpalatable low herbaceous plants, dominated by Trianthema triquetra. These plants colonize or survive better on deposition zones because of better soil moisture status. The vegetation bands can therefore indicate an initial stage in vegetation recovery rather than continuing rangeland deterioration, but at Baringo further development of vegetation appears to be restricted by high grazing intensities or by allelopathy.

AB  - Background: Fractures of the pubic ramus without involvement of the posterior pelvic ring represent a minority of fragility fractures of the pelvis (FFP). The natural history of patients suffering this FFP Type I has not been described so far. Material and methods: All patients, who were admitted with isolated pubic ramus fractures between 2007 and mid-2018, have been reviewed. Epidemiologic data, comorbidities, in-hospital complications, and one-year mortality were recorded. Of all surviving patients, living condition before the fracture and at follow-up was noted. Mobility was scored with the Parker Mobility Score, quality of life with the European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 3 Level (EQ-5D-3L), subjective sensation of pain with the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Results: A consecutive series of 138 patients was included in the study. There were 117 women (84.8%) and 21 men (15.2%). Mean age was 80.6 years (SD 8.6 years). 89.1% of patients presented with comorbidities, 81.2% of them had cardiovascular diseases. Five patients (4%) died during hospital-stay. Median in-hospital stay was eight days (2-45 days). There were in-hospital complications in 16.5%, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia being the most frequent. One-year mortality was 16.7%. Reference values for the normal population of the same age are 5.9% for men and 4.0% for women. One-year mortality rate was 22.2% in the patient group of 80 years or above and 8.8% in the patient group below the age of 80. The rate of surviving patients living at home with or without assistance dropped from 80.5% to 65.3%. The median EQ-5D-Index Value was 0.62 (0.04-1; IQR 0.5-0.78). Reference value for the normal population is 0.78. Average PMS was 4 and NRS 3. Within a two-year period, additional fragility fractures occurred in 21.2% and antiresorptive medication was taken by only 45.2% of patients. Conclusion. Pubic ramus fractures without involvement of the posterior pelvis (FFP Type I) are serious adverse events for elderly persons. During follow-up, there is an excess mortality, a loss of independence, a restricted mobility, and a decreased quality of life. Pubic ramus fractures are indicators for the need to optimize the patient's general condition.

AB  - Two rift-basin lacustrine successions (Cacheuta and Los Rastros Formations) in the Middle Triassic of Argentina were studied to test two different hypotheses: 1) fish taphonomy is useful as an indicator of environmental conditions for these two paleolakes; and 2) fish taphonomy is useful for understanding environmental effects on speciation. The fish fossils are found, in two lacustrine deposits, as isolated and disarticulated scales and cranial bones, clumps and stringers of scales, articulated body segments, and complete specimens. Four taphofacies are defined for Cacheuta specimens (Ca-A to Ca-D), and three taphofacies are defined for Los Rastros fish assemblages (LR-A to LR-C). A Principal Components Analysis was performed, with the taphonomic features supporting the seven taphofacies defined.
   A taphonomic model is proposed that characterizes a lacustrine-deltaic environment developed in the rift basin and identifies three sub-environments, each one with its particular fossil assemblages. The fish assemblages in the Los Rastros Formation suggest that the fishes preserved in delta-front and turbidity-current deposits (LR-B and LR-C taphofacies) were allochthonous to the lake and probably inhabited the delta plains and affluent fluvial system. In contrast, the isolated fish remains, preserved in open-lake deposits (LR-A taphofacies), likely represent both autochthonous and/or allochthonous specimens. In the Cacheuta Formation, articulated and isolated fish remains preserved in open lake deposits (Ca-A and Ca-D tafofacies), might represent autochthonous lacustrine specimens, based on the good preservation of the material. The fish remains preserved in underflow and turbidity current deposits (Ca-B and Ca-C taphofacies) were allochthonous to the lake and probably inhabited the delta plain and affluent fluvial system.
   The fish taphonomic study of two different rift-basin lacustrine successions allows test of the two proposed hypotheses. Fish taphonomy was useful as an indicator of environmental conditions beacuse the differences in fish preservation allowed differentiation of the sub-environments and reconstruction of the environmental conditions and dynamics of the rift lake basins. Also, fish taphonomy was useful for understanding environmental effects on speciation by characterizing the environments and dynamics that promote the development of new fish species, recognizing fish-inhabited environments, and identifying the generalist and specialist species.

AB  - Drought is usually defined as a significant, temporary reduction in water availability below the expected amount for a specified period and for a defined climatic zone. Drought episodes may be described by means of different characteristics, namely drought duration and intensity, considered as the two dimensions of this agro-climatic phenomenon. Among the several methods proposed for describing drought, the run method appears as suitable to provide an objective characterisation of drought events. A simple drought index, obtained from only two input variables (rainfall and reference evapotranspiration), able to describe different dimensions of drought phenomena (duration, intensity and severity), and to recognise "normal" conditions, both in statistical and ecological terms, is meaningful. Our interest is therefore to develop such a drought index, able to produce information on a detailed geographic and time scale.
   The procedure we have built up consists in calculating for each day, considered as dry or wet, the length of the present dry spell (LH) and water deficit (DF). The same variables were computed over a six-month period preceding the evaluation day (LH6 and DF6). For each day to be evaluated we associated each agro-climatological variable with the corresponding percentile value obtained from the climatology data set. Two partial indicators depicting drought duration (LHS) and intensity (DFS) were introduced. LHS and DFS were computed respectively as the maximum daily value between LH and LH6, and between DF and DF6. A synthetic index of drought severity (DSI) was finally obtained as the geometric mean of LHS and DHS indicators.
   Using dry spell climatology we estimated duration, intensity and severity of drought on a daily basis over the test period 1988-2003. The most and period in Italy was recorded during spring-summer 2003, when especially dry conditions occurred in northern and central Italy. DSI correctly indicates a significant increase of drought from March to July 2003 throughout Italy: drought severity reaches the 90 percentile in all the stations from Po plain, Apennines, and coastal areas of central Italy.
   In conclusion, DSI may be used to assess the agro-climatic conditions occurring in a certain location through only two input variables. It allows a synthetic description of drought episodes in terms of both dry spell length and water balance. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) is a key voluntary and aspirational target of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15 which urges countries to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss. A first and critical important step in the implementation of LDN is assessing the current land condition using not only active restoration of degraded land, but also targeting land degradation drivers behind the land degradation process. In a first step to achieve these goals, countries were provided a global dataset for three sub-indicators of land degradation: land cover (LC), land productivity dynamics (LPD) and soil organic carbon (SOC). Here, we report on trends in these sub-indicators for the Entity Republic of Srpska (RS) as a part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is a key analysis to inform the frame of reference or baseline conditions for the region to evaluate LDN across this region. Global data for LC for the RS indicates a 0.5% loss of forests (6400 ha) over the time period from 2000 to 2010. Of this area, 5000 ha were converted to cropland and an additional 1400 ha was converted to shrubs, grasslands and sparsely vegetated areas. LPD declined over 2.5% (63,500 ha) of the region. SOC declined on land use changed areas by 15.6% (74,609 Mg ha(-1)) over the same time period. Based on global data, we estimated that 3% of the country is in a degraded state. Based on interviews with local stakeholders in 31 local communities, the primary land degradation drivers were identified and validated by team experts. Depopulation and migration to urban centers were identified as the important underlying drivers of land degradation that most municipalities are facing. The most frequent direct drivers of land degradation across this region were land abandonment, floods, drought, erosion and urbanization. Land abandonment, more specifically, has resulted in conversion of agriculturally productive lands to lands dominated by a wide range of invasive species over the last 25 years. Continued land degradation is underpinned by the lack of understanding by stakeholders of the importance of land as a resource. In evaluating the status, trends and drivers of land degradation for this region, we have identified key areas or "hot spots" that may be targeted for restoration options and may be used to achieve LDN targets by 2030.

TI  - Anaerobic co-digestion of fruit and vegetable waste: Synergy and process stability analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION
LA  - English
AB  - Anaerobic mono- and co-digestion of fruits and vegetable waste (FVW), slaughterhouse waste (SHW), and cattle manure (CM) under mesophilic conditions (35 degrees C) were conducted through biochemical methane potential tests to investigate how the FVW in a co-substrate formulation improves the methane yield, the degradative synergy between substrates, and especially the stability of the process. The co-digestion of FVW:SHW and FVW:CM were evaluated with volatile solids (VS) ratios of 1:2, 1:1, and 2:1. The results indicated that the highest synergistic effect was found in the co-digestion FVW:CM at 1:1 VS ratio. However, the co-digestion FWV:SHW at 1:2 VS ratio increased the methane yield by 74.2% compared to the mono-digestion of FVW (776.3 mL CH4 g VSadded (-1)). As a critical condition in these processes, the stability was evaluated using the early warning indicator VFA/TA (volatile fatty acids/total alkalinity). The co-substrate SHW promotes greater stability in methane production as the soluble carbohydrate content in FVW increases. It was proposed that the high protein (49.04 +/- 0.96% VS) and ammonia content (693 +/- 3 mg L-1) of SHW leads to the formation of a dampening system known as a carbonate-acetic buffer. It was concluded that balanced distribution between carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids is crucial to increase methane yields, and the low methane productions were associated with low N-NH4 (+) concentrations (FVW:CM co-digestions). The results obtained in this study can serve as a basis to design full-scale digesters under similar operating conditions and with the same substrate:co-substrate relationships.
   Implications: The production of methane from the anaerobic digestion process of food, and lose waste presents a viable alternative of valorization and could help to mitigate environmental impacts. However, anaerobic digestion from these substrates carries high instabilities and low methane yields. The need to increase these yields and contribute to process stability must be considered in the selection of a co-substrate. In this context, this work aims to evaluate the best fruits and vegetable waste: co-substrateformulation, that promotes higher methane yield, a synergy between substrates, and to improve the AD process stability in the presence of perturbations in the substrate composition. We believe that our results could be helpful for the design processes for methane production from fruit and vegetable waste, to contribute to competitiveness with conventional energies and promote the sustainability of these processes.

AB  - Noroviruses (NoV) are responsible for many shellfish outbreaks. Purification processes may be applied to oysters before marketing to decrease potential fecal pollution. This step is rapidly highly effective in reducing Escherichia coli; nevertheless, the elimination of virus genomes has been described to be much slower. It is therefore important to identify (i) the purification conditions that optimize virus removal and (ii) the mechanism involved. To this end, the effects of oyster stress, nutrients, and the presence of a potential competitor to NoV adhesion during purification were investigated using naturally contaminated oysters. Concentrations of NoV (genomes) and of the viral indicator F-specific RNA bacteriophage (FRNAPH; genomes and infectious particles) were regularly monitored. No significant differences were observed under the test conditions. The decrease kinetics of both virus genomes were similar, again showing the potential of FRNAPH as an indicator of NoV behavior during purification. The T-90 (time to reduce 90% of the initial titer) values were 47.8 days for the genogroup I NoV genome, 26.7 days for the genogroup II NoV genome, and 43.9 days for the FRNAPH-II genome. Conversely, monitoring of the viral genomes could not be used to determine the behavior of infectious viruses because the T-90 values were more than two times lower for infectious FRNAPH (20.6 days) compared to their genomes (43.9 days). Finally, this study highlighted that viruses are primarily inactivated in oysters rather than released in the water during purification processes.
   IMPORTANCE This study provides new data about the behavior of viruses in oysters under purification processes and about their elimination mechanism. First, a high correlation has been observed between F-specific RNA bacteriophages of subgroup II (FRNAPH-II) and norovirus (NoV) in oysters impacted by fecal contamination when both are detected using molecular approaches. Second, when using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and culture to detect FRNAPH-II genomes and infectious FRNAPH in oysters, respectively, it appears that genome detection provides limited information about the presence of infectious particles. The comparison of both genomes and infectious particles highlights that the main mechanism of virus elimination in oysters is inactivation. Finally, this study shows that none of the conditions tested modify virus removal.

AB  - Environmental evolution of the Gulf of Carpentaria region, the world's largest tropical epicontinental seaway, through the last glacial cycle has been determined from a series of six sediment cores. These cores form the focus of a multi-disciplinary study to elucidate sea level, climate and environmental change in the region. The sedimentary record reveals a series of facies including open shallow marine marginal marine, estuarine, lacustrine and subaerial exposure, throughout the extent of the basin during this period.
   The partial or complete closure of the central basin from marine waters results from sea level falling below the height of one or both of the sills that border the Gulf-the Arafura Sill to the west (53 in below present sea level (bpsl)) and Torres Strait to the east (12 in bpsl). The extent and timing of these closures, and restriction of the shallow waterbody within, are intrinsic to local ocean circulation, available latent heat transport and the movement of people and animals between Australia and New Guinea.
   Whilst the occurrence of the palaeo-Lake Carpentaria has previously been identified, this study expands on the hydrological conditions of the lacustrine phases and extends the record through the Last Interglacial, detailing the previous sea-level highstand (MIS 5.5) and subsequent retreat.
   When sea levels were low during the MIS 6 glacial period, the Gulf was largely subaerially exposed and traversed by meandering rivers. The MIS 5 transgression (similar to 130 ka BP) led to marine then alternating marine/estuarine conditions through to MIS 4 (similar to 70ka BP) when a protracted lacustrine phase, of varying salinity and depth/area, and including periods of near desiccation, persisted until about 12.12cal ka BP. The lake expanded to near maximum size (similar to 190 000km(2)) following the intensification/restoration of the Australian monsoon at 14 ka BP. This lake-full phase was short-lived, as by 12.2cal ka BP, marine waters were entering the basin, coincident with the progressive sea-level rise. Fully marine conditions were restored by about 10.5 cal ka BP by westward connection to the Arafura Sea (Indian Ocean), whereas connections to the Pacific Ocean (Coral Sea) did not occur until about 8cal ka BP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Reducing fresh gas flow when using a circle anesthesia circuit is the most effective strategy for reducing both inhaled anesthetic vapor cost and waste. As fresh gas flow is reduced, the amount of exhaled gas rebreathed increases, but the utilization of carbon dioxide absorbent increases as well. Reducing fresh gas flow may not make economic sense if the increased cost of absorbent utilization exceeds the reduced cost of anesthetic vapor. The primary objective of this study was to determine the minimum fresh gas flow at which absorbent costs do not exceed vapor savings. Another objective is to provide a qualitative insight into the factors that influence absorbent performance as fresh gas flow is reduced. METHODS: A mathematical model was developed to compare the vapor savings with the cost of carbon dioxide absorbent as a function of fresh gas flow. Parameters of the model include patient size, unit cost of vapor and carbon dioxide absorbent, and absorbent capacity and efficiency. Boundaries for fresh gas flow were based on oxygen consumption or a closed-circuit condition at the low end and minute ventilation to approximate an open-circuit condition at the high end. Carbon dioxide production was estimated from oxygen consumption assuming a respiratory quotient of 0.8. RESULTS: For desflurane, the cost of carbon dioxide absorbent did not exceed vapor savings until fresh gas flow was almost equal to closed-circuit conditions. For sevoflurane, as fresh gas flow is reduced, absorbent costs increase more slowly than vapor costs decrease so that total costs are still minimized for a closed circuit. Due to the low cost of isoflurane, even with the most effective absorbent, the rate of absorbent costs increase more rapidly than vapor savings as fresh gas flow is reduced, so that an open circuit is least expensive. The total cost of vapor and absorbent is still lowest for isoflurane when compared with the other agents. CONCLUSIONS: The relative costs of anesthetic vapor and carbon dioxide absorbent as fresh gas flow is reduced are dependent on choice of anesthetic vapor and performance of the carbon dioxide absorbent. Absorbent performance is determined by the product selected and strategy for replacement. Clinicians can maximize the performance of absorbents by replacing them based on the appearance of inspired carbon dioxide rather than the indicator. Even though absorbent costs exceed vapor savings as fresh gas flow is reduced, isoflurane is still the lowest cost choice for the environmentally sound practice of closed-circuit anesthesia.

AB  - Group size (GS) and space allowance have major implications for the welfare of production species, however their effects are often confounded. In a previous study we investigated the impact of varying space allowance at constant GS. In the present work we report the consequences of varying GS on pregnant ewes while controlling space allowance. We housed ewes at 6 (GS6) or 12 ewes/enclosure (GS12), while controlling space allowance to 1.5 m(2) /ewe (3 enclosures/treatment), and necessarily varying enclosure size. Therefore, when indicating GS effects we implicitly reflect a confounding effect with that of enclosure size. Movement, use of space, behaviour, serum cortisol concentration and body condition score (BCS) were collected during the last 12 gestation weeks. Movement, use of space, and behaviour were collected every other week, during 2 days/week, using 10 minute continuous scan samplings. Blood was collected during weeks 10, 13, 17, and 21 of gestation, and BCS during weeks 15 and 21. Data were analysed using repeated measures, generalized linear mixed models, with GS, week, and their interaction as fixed effects, and enclosure as random effect. GS mainly affected movement and use of space. GS12 ewes walked longer distances using longer steps (P<0.001). An interaction GS by week was observed for angular dispersion (P<0.0001), which was smaller for GS12 from week 10 onwards. Initial restlessness levels were lower for GS12, as shown by the reduced frequency of location changes (P<0.0001). Furthest and mean neighbour distances increased with GS (P<0.0001). The effect of GS on behaviour was only evident for eating behaviour as an interaction with gestation week (P<0.05). Changes in behaviour, movement and use of space along the study indicated an activity peak during weeks 3 to 5. Cortisol changes during gestation (P<0.01) also reflected this activity peak, while BCS (P<0.001) reflected normal physical condition changes during pregnancy. Although the separate effects of GS and enclosure size cannot be disentangled, we conclude that if enough space/ewe is given during gestation, larger GS will result in larger effective space, and no major implications for the welfare of ewes should be expected as GS increases. Ewes will adapt their movement patterns and use of space to enclosure size, and no further behavioural, physiological and physical consequences should be expected.

AB  - Improvement of welfare of piglets is one of the key factors which underlie the effectiveness of producing pork and the profitability of pig farming. This article offers a solution to the main industrial problem - creation of comfortable maintenance conditions for pigs using toys which satisfy their ethological needs. Piglets used in the experiment were kept in the swine complex of agricultural production of Agrofirm Mig-Service-Agro Cooperative in Novoodesky district of Mykolaiv Oblast (Ukraine). The objective of the study was assessment of the effect of toys on the behaviour of piglets, level of concentration of hormone serotonin in blood plasma and their energy of growth. The experiment was performed on 120 weaned piglets aged 28 days, which were divided according to the principle of analogues with 60 individuals in each group: I - the control group, the animals were kept with no toys; II - the experimental group, where the animals had toys. During the experiment chronometric monitoring of the piglets' behavioural acts was carried out using video observation, we extracted blood samples for determination of the content of the hormone serotonin using the method of highly-efficient fluid chromatography and assessed the growth of the piglets. After the end of the experiment, we determined that the presence of toys reduced the intragroup aggression, which was accompanied by decrease in the duration of fights and almost three-fold increase in playing behaviour. Among piglets which had access to toys, the number of individuals observed to bite tails and ears decreased from 11 to 3. In the period of the study, the concentration of serotonin in the blood plasma of piglets who had free access to toys was 10 times higher compared with animals of the control group. Change in the behaviour patterns among the animals of the experimental group led to significant differences regarding the parameters of growth, where probable increase in the live weight at the age of 90 days was observed, which was associated with significant increase in their mean daily weight gain compared with the animals of the control group. This study confirms that use of toys for piglets during growth completion can prevent features of aggression and abnormal forms of stereopathy within groups, increase the live weight and mean daily weight gain and improve emotional condition, which affects the welfare of pigs.

AB  - Iron oxide minerals are widely present in soil and known to be closely associated with soil-forming environments. In this study, a detailed quantitative analysis of the iron oxide minerals in the Late Pleistocene hard clay of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) was conducted using new integrated methods of magnetism, selective chemical-dissolution, and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. A variety of established chemical weathering indexes and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) chronology were also applied in the investigations of the hard clay in the study area. These methods allowed for detailed examinations of the chemical weathering, sedimentary environmental conditions, and the post-depositional processes of the hard clay deposits in the YRD. This study's A-CN-K diagram revealed that the hard clay had entered an intermediate weathering stage. In addition, various chemical weathering indexes demonstrated that the hard clay had undergone three stages of chemical weathering from bottom to top as follows: 1) A relatively high stage of chemical weathering; 2) A low chemical weathering stage with a slightly increasing trend; and 3) A relatively high chemical weathering stage with a weakly decreasing trend. It was found that when chi, chi(fd), Fe-d/Fe-t, Gt, and Hm/Gt were not reliable indicators of chemical weathering for the hard clay, Fe-d could be a useful proxy. In the current study, based on the OSL ages and several paleoclimatic proxies, it was suggested that the climate conditions in the YRD had transitioned from a relatively weak to a strong East Asian summer monsoon phase during the periods between the marine oxygen isotope stages (MIS) 4 and MIS 3. Furthermore, the low values of chi and chi(fd) in the hard clay indicated an intense dissolution of fine-grained strong magnetic minerals. Meanwhile, the relatively high Fe-o/Fe-d ratios in the superficial horizon displayed the predominance of poorly crystalline forms of iron oxides. In summary, the analysis results implied that the hard clay had undergone post-burial processes of ferrolysis, as well as dissolved organic matter translocation from the overlying Holocene sediment. The aforementioned post-burial processes for the hard clay had occurred under reduction-oxidation cycles, which were mainly driven by the rise of the groundwater levels with the Holocene transgression.

AB  - In the maturation process of silage maize, the silage maize ripeness index is a valuable indicator of the phenology of maturation, stress and selection in the cultivation of maize for all purposes; it also provides summary information to characterise and quantify local maturation, cultivation and environmental conditions, the variety based on maturity, suitability for the location, as well as phenotypic stability of the performance of the variety and its resistance. The goal is to identify a selection of maize varieties out of a very narrow range that is based on technically sound information and which is exclusively suited to the efficient and sustainable cultivation in local conditions of premium environmentally stable varieties with different maturity times for all uses and which also takes into account the consequences of climate change.
   The requirements for maize varieties for all applications that are environmentally stable as a basic prerequisite for high quality and yields are similar to those for achieving the reference ripeness point (SRI of 2.8) as the interface between economics and ecology. The requirements are somewhat lower for biogas maize and are highest for the production of maize silage for milk production. Maize varieties for the production of grain and for fattening cattle impose equivalent requirements in terms of environmental stability and lie somewhere between those for gas and milk. Because the differences between the uses are only marginal, maize silage can be taken from a single silo even in operations with several production chains. In specialised operations, the SRI specification should be both helpful and recommendable.
   In every respect, too much is expected of the current maturation system, with DM content of the whole plant that is only of limited informational value, in order to make possible this previous classification and assessment of phenotypic stability of the performance of all maize varieties, uses and locations of maize cultivation. It remains to be seen whether intensive breeding activities in highly varying local RAU conditions will translate into highly differing breeding objectives for the individual uses taking into consideration the four key problems and main goals in maize cultivation and with respect to the climate change that is currently underway and to be expected in the future.

AB  - Farmers apply various agricultural inputs like seeds, fertilizers, weedicides, pesticides and water, based on recommendations emanating from research and field trials under specific agro-climatic conditions, which have been extrapolated to a regional level. Since soil types, soil nutrient status, weeds density, pests infestations and soil water vary not only between regions and between farms but also from plot to plot and within a field or plot, hence, there is a need to take into account such variability while going to cultivate a particular crop. The goal is to obtain more efficient use of applied inputs to improve economics to reduce any excess application that might cause environmental pollution. Agricultural technologies using the global positioning system (GPS) and geographic information systems (GIS) have started to change how farmers are managing crops. By utilizing these tools with an objective to manage existing field variability, variable-rate technology (VRT) has been evolved. VRT combines a variable-rate (VR) control system with application equipment to apply inputs at a precise time and/or location to achieve site-specific application rates of inputs. VR mounted on equipment, permits input application rates to be varied across fields in an attempt to site-specifically manage field variability. This type of strategy can reduce input usage and environmental impacts along with increasing efficiency and providing economic viability. A VRT essentially comprises of a locator (DGPS receiver), control computer and actuator (VRA software and controller) in an integrated manner to make VRT to work. Three different approaches exist to implement VRT viz: map-based, sensor-based and manual. The intra and inter field variability can be characterized by a number of factors like climatic conditions (hail, drought, rain, etc.), soils (texture, depth, nitrogen levels), cropping practices (no-till farming) and preventance of weeds and diseases. These factors can be assessed by two types of indicators (permanent indicators and point indicators). The permanent indicators are mainly soil indicators which provide the information about the main environmental constants. The point indicators helps to track a crop's status in terms of occurrence of water stress, nutrient stress, disease infestation, weed infestation, crop lodging etc. This information may derive from weather stations and other sensors (soil electrical resistivity, detection with the naked eye, satellite imagery etc.). Soil resistivity measurements combined with soil analysis make it possible to precisely map agro-pedological conditions. By catering to this variability, one can improve the productivity or reduce the cost of production and diminish the chance of environmental degradation caused by excess use of inputs

AB  - The process of torrefaction alters the physical properties of biomass, reducing its fibrous tenacious nature. This could allow increased rates of co-milling and therefore co-firing in coal fired power stations, which in turn would enable a reduction in the amount of coal used and an increase in the use of sustainable fuels, without the need for additional plant. This paper presents an experimental investigation of the pulverisation behaviour of two torrefied energy crops, namely: willow and Miscanthus. A multifactorial method approach was adopted to investigate the three process parameters of temperature, residence time and particle size, producing fuels treated using four different torrefaction conditions. The untreated and torrefied fuels were subjected to standard fuel analysis techniques including ultimate analysis, proximate analysis and calorific value determination. The grindability of these fuels was then determined using a laboratory ball mill and by adapting the Hardgrove Grindability Index (HGI) test for hard coals. After grinding, two sets of results were obtained. Firstly a determination similar to the HGI test was made, measuring the proportion of sample passing through a 75 mu m sieve and plotting this on a calibrated HGI chart determined using four standard reference coals of known HGI values. Secondly the particle size distributions of the entire ground sample were measured and compared with the four standard reference coals. The standard fuel tests revealed that temperature was the most significant parameter in terms of mass loss, changes in elemental composition and energy content increase. The first grindability test results found that the untreated fuels and fuels treated at low temperatures showed very poor grindability behaviour. However, more severe torrefaction conditions caused the fuels to exhibit similar pulverisation properties as coals with low HGI values. Miscanthus was found to have a higher HGI value than willow. On examining the particle size distributions it was found that the particle size distributions of torrefied Miscanthus differed significantly from the untreated biomass and had comparable profiles to those of the standard reference coals with which they had similar HGI values. However, only the torrefied willow produced at the most severe conditions investigated exhibited this behaviour, and the HGI of torrefied willow was not generally a reliable indicator of grindability performance for this energy crop. Overall it was concluded that torrefied biomass can be successfully pulverised and that torrefied Miscanthus was easier to grind than torrefied willow. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The metabolism of Trichinella spp. is primarily anoxybiotic in nature. Their main energy source is glycogen, which is stored in the stichocites at the muscular stage of the larval development. When subject to tow temperatures the Trichinella larvae consume glycogen and neutral fats to provide for basal metabolism until the energy supplies reach the critical level. The present study establishes the glycogen concentration as well the invasive activity of T. nativa when affected by low temperatures in natural conditions. The carcasses of infected laboratory rats were placed in containers beneath the snow cover, in the natural conditions of a game husbandry in Central Russia. The viability, invasive capacity and the glycogen level were monitored in the Trichinella larvae monthly. The invasive capacity of Trichinella larvae was established based on the presence of the larvae in the muscular tissue of laboratory mice after the peroral administration of the helminth larvae. On the 45 day of the experiment, the mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and if the Trichinella larvae could be discovered in the muscular tissue with the help of the trichinelloscopic compression method, the invasive capacity of the Trichinella larvae was viewed as positive. To establish the quantitative value of glycogen content in Trichinella larvae a modified method was used. In order to measure the glycogen level in the T. nativa larvae isolated by fermentation larvae were counted in one drop of the suspended sedimentation in the Migacheva-Kotelnikov chamber. To establish the quantitative value of glycogen content in Trichinella larvae a method based on the treatment of glycogen with iodine, optical density measurement with a refractometer MKM Phi-02 was used. For the purpose of measuring the concentration of glycogen in Trichinella larvae in the suspended sedimentation a calibration curve was used. The studies showed that the viability indicator of the Trichinella larvae which had been preserved in natural conditions in the four months of the winter-spring period, in the muscular tissue of laboratory rats remained high (over 90 %). The glycogen concentration in one helminth larva was 0.041 mu g in January, 0.033 mu g in February, 0.015 mu g in April. The invasive capability of the preserved Trichinella larvae was considerably reduced to 33.3 %. In the winter period, under temperatures below 0 degrees C, a decrease in the glycogen concentration in the Trichinella larvae was observed.

AB  - Aim
   We aim to: (1) explore thermal habitat preferences in alpine plant species across mosaics of topographically controlled micro-habitats; (2) test the predictive value of so-called 'indicator values'; and (3) quantify the shift in micro-habitat conditions under the influence of climate warming.
   Location
   Alpine vegetation 2200-2800 m a.s.l., Swiss central Alps.
   Methods
   High-resolution infra-red thermometry and large numbers of small data loggers were used to assess the spatial and temporal variation of plant-surface and ground temperatures as well as snow-melt patterns for 889 plots distributed across three alpine slopes of contrasting exposure. These environmental data were then correlated with Landolt indicator values for temperature preferences of different plant species and vegetation units. By simulating a uniform 2 K warming we estimated the changes in abundance of micro-habitat temperatures within the study area.
   Results
   Within the study area we observed a substantial variation between micro-habitats in seasonal mean soil temperature (Delta T = 7.2 K), surface temperature (Delta T = 10.5 K) and season length (> 32 days). Plant species with low indicator values for temperature (plants commonly found in cool habitats) grew in significantly colder micro-habitats than plants with higher indicator values found on the same slope. A 2 K warming will lead to the loss of the coldest habitats (3% of current area), 75% of the current thermal micro-habitats will be reduced in abundance (crowding effect) and 22% will become more abundant.
   Main conclusions
   Our results demonstrate that the topographically induced mosaics of micro-climatic conditions in an alpine landscape are associated with local plant species distribution. Semi-quantitative plant species indicator values based on expert knowledge and aggregated to community means match measured thermal habitat conditions. Metre-scale thermal contrasts significantly exceed IPCC warming projections for the next 100 years. The data presented here thus indicate a great risk of overestimating alpine habitat losses in isotherm-based model scenarios. While all but the species depending on the very coldest micro-habitats will find thermally suitable 'escape' habitats within short distances, there will be enhanced competition for those cooler places on a given slope in an alpine climate that is 2 K warmer. Yet, due to their topographic variability, alpine landscapes are likely to be safer places for most species than lowland terrain in a warming world.

AB  - The allelic polymorphism of the serotonin transporter's gene 5-HTTLPR is considered as one of the factors determining an individual genetic predisposition to the development of a wide range of affective disorders, including depression. Many studies have shown that the climatic and social conditions of people's life can have a significant impact on the connections of 5-HTTLPR with the risk of depression. The stop-signal paradigm (SSP) is an experimental method allowing evaluating an individual ability to the self-control of behavior in a changing environment. In the SSP experiment, a subject should either press one of several buttons quickly after the appearance of the target stimuli or suppress the already started movement if an inhibitory signal follows the target stimulus. The aim of this study is a research of associations between the allelic the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and the individual scores of the personal anxiety level, as well as the behavioral and neurophysiological indicators of the ability to self-control over motor reactions in the SSP. The study was conducted among people from three ethno-regional groups: healthy Caucasoids from Novosibirsk, the Mongoloid groups of the indigenous population of the Tuva Republic and Sakha Republic (Yakutia). Genetic, ethnographic, and psychological influences on an individual's ability to control motor responses were compared. The amplitude of the premotor peak of the evoked brain potential was used as a neurophysiological marker of the person's readiness to the execution of target-directed activity. It was revealed that the frequency of the S-allele polymorphism 5-HTTLPR was significantly higher for both mongoloid groups compared to the Caucasoids. The S/S genotype was associated with an increased level of personal anxiety and at the same time with a better ability to the self-control of behavior in the SSP experiment. Anxiety level, participants' sex, ethnicity, and allelic polymorphism 5-HTTLPR had a statistically significant effect on the amplitude of the premotor readiness potential recorded under the SSP conditions in the frontal and parietal-occipital cortical regions. Our data support the hypothesis that the S/S genotype of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism may be associated with more success in adapting to the climatic conditions connected with high life risk in comparison to L/L and L/S genotypes.

AB  - Background: The working conditions at universities and hospitals are reported to be stressful. Several national and international studies have investigated occupational stress in hospitals. However, scientific studies at colleges and universities addressing psycho-social stress factors and their potential consequences are scarce. In this context, the consequences and correlations of the factor of work-family conflict, in particular, are currently uninvestigated. The aim of our study was to assess data on psychosocial stress in the context of the compatibility of work and family.
   Methods: Data were gathered through a cross-sectional-study, N = 844 (55% female, 41% male), on university staff (42.3% scientists, 14.3% physicians, 19.4% employees in administration, and 19.3% employees in service). Participants filled out questionnaires to provide their personal data and details of their work and private life conditions. For this purpose, we used the Work-Family and Family-Work Conflict Scales, Effort-Reward Inventory and Overcommitment Scale (ERI, OC), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4), short-form Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), and questions on their subjective health. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22.
   Results: We found high levels of stress parameters in the total sample: extra work (83%), fixed-term work contracts (53%), overcommitment (OC, 26%), Effort-Reward Imbalance (18%, ERI Ratio > cut-off 0.715), work-family conflict (WFC, 35%), and family-work conflict (FWC, 39%). As hypothesized, we found significant correlations of both WFC and FWC with psychosocial work strain (ERI Ratio) as well as overcommitment (OC). Mental and somatic health parameters also had a significant positive correlation with WFC and FWC. Using a regression analysis (N = 844), we identified WFC as a predictor of burnout, while emotional exhaustion, extra work, and overcommitment could be identified as predictors of WFC and FWC.
   Discussion: The results of our study point toward deficits in the compatibility of work life and private life in the work fields of science, colleges, and universities. Furthermore, we found indicators that work-family conflicts (interrole conflicts) have an impact on mental and somatic health. These work-family conflicts should be targets for preventions and interventions with the aim of improving the work-life balance and mental and somatic wellbeing of employees.

AB  - The European eel (Anguilla anguilla) is drastically declining in all its distribution area and listed in the red list of the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature). A rebuilding plan was adopted at European level in 2007, Regulation R(CE) 100/2007, to restore eel abundance to the level observed during the seventies. Its implementation started on the 1(st) of January 2009. This species is heavily threatened by numerous activities including fishing, and its management can only be effective through a systemic approach minimizing the whole range of human-induced impacts on the resource and its habitat. In the framework of the European interregional programme INTERREG IIIB-Atlantic Area-the INDICANG project aimed at elaborating abundance indicators of the European eel in the central part of its distribution area (http://www.ifremer/fr/indicang/). A methodological guide was elaborated by this project to define the indicators needed for this resource assessment. In this framework, Ifremer (Institut Francais pour l'Exploitation de la Mer) and the UPPA University (Universite de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour) have developed a method to estimate the daily and seasonal biomass of glass eels with the view to evaluate the fishery's impact on the estuarine eel recruitment to the Adour catchment. The estimation method uses observations from nightly scientific surveys to estimate glass eels' densities in the water column during various flood tides characterized by different hydrodynamic conditions. Information on these conditions allows the estimation of the glass eels biomass migrating during the night. From these estimates and reported catches made by the fishery during the same night, the exploitation rate applied by the fishery on the flow of glass eels progressing upstream during night flood tides is estimated. The relationship between the exploitation rate, fishery catches and hydrodynamic conditions allowed the estimation of the exploitation rate and nocturnal biomass fluctuations during the fishing season, from November 1(st) to March 31(st) of the following year. Finally, from the chronological series of biomass migrating at night, the total biomass migrating every day and the total recruitment into the estuary, during the main glass eel migration period, are estimated. Estimations made between 1998 and 2005 indicate that the overall rate of exploitation of the marine and continental fisheries, on average, is of 15.7%, ranging between 8 and 25% according to fishing seasons.

AB  - The relative and absolute abundances and accumulation rates of forarninifera and calcareous nannofossils were quantified in a box core containing sapropel S I from the Florence Rise area (SE of Cyprus; 2302 m water depth). The main objective of this study was to reconstruct in detail variations in paleoecological conditions of water masses during the deposition of this sapropel. In particular, we qualitatively evaluated the importance of carbonate dissolution on planktonic assemblages to better interpret the abundance profiles obtained from the two investigated taxa.
   Selective carbonate corrosion in the core is shown by (1) the decrease in shell mass weight of selected species of planktonic foraminifera, (2) the decrease in accumulation rate of dissolution-susceptible holococcoliths and coccolith species, and (3) the absence of pteropods. However, the presence of other relatively dissolution-susceptible coccolith species throughout all of the S I interval suggests moderate dissolution.
   Florisphaera profunda shows a marked increase in paleofluxes within the sapropel coupled with a decrease in the accumulation rate of the upper-middle photic zone coccoliths, suggesting an ecological depth-separation of the water column, probably characterised by higher nutrient availability at depth and nutrient-depleted surface waters between similar to 10 and 6.5 kyr BR In the same interval Turborotalita quinqueloba and Globigerina bulloides, two formaniniferal species frequently occurring during periods of high fertility, increase in relative abundance. The maximum increase in relative abundance of Globigerinoides ruber (var. alba and rosea) marks the climatic optimum phase and the maximum stratification in surface water that occurred at the beginning of sapropel S1 deposition when the bottom waters were anoxic. An important change in foraminiferal assemblages occurs at similar to 8 kyr BP and corresponds with a negative shift in CaCO3, Ba and C-org contents. This short interval marks the establishment of relatively less anoxic conditions in the bottom water, introducing the last phase of sapropel formation.
   After similar to 6.5 kyr BP, a progressive re-establishment of normal oceanographic conditions occurred before the real end of the sapropel S1. This transition is well recorded by the reoccurrence and major accumulation rate of the mixing indicator foraminiferal species Globorotalia inflata and by the gradual decrease in abundance of F profunda.

AB  - Cortisol is often used as a stress indicator in animal behaviour research. Cortisol is commonly measured in plasma and can also be measured in saliva. Saliva contains only the free form of cortisol, which is biologically active, and saliva sampling is not invasive and may therefore be less stressful. Our study aims to guide the choice between the measurements of cortisol in plasmav. saliva depending on experimental conditions. We analysed the effect of the level of cortisol in plasma on the concentration of cortisol in saliva compared to plasma and the effect of saliva samplingv. jugular venepuncture on the cortisol response. In Experiment 1, blood and saliva were collected simultaneously under conditions in which the expected cortisol release in blood varied: in an undisturbed situation or after the isolation of lambs from their pens or the administration of exogenous ACTH (six animals per treatment). In Experiment 2, we subjected lambs to saliva sampling, venepuncture or neither of these for 8 days to evaluate how stressful the sampling method was and whether the animals habituated to it by comparing the responses between the first and last days (four animals per treatment). All animals were equipped with jugular catheters to allow regular blood sampling without disturbance. Samples were collected 15 min before any treatment was applied, then at various time points up to 135 min in Experiment 1 and 45 min in Experiment 2. In Experiment 1, we observed a strong correlation between salivary and plasma cortisol concentrations (r= 0.81,P< 0.001). The ratio between salivary and plasma cortisol concentrations was 0.106 on average. This ratio was higher and more variable when the cortisol concentration in plasma was below 55 nmol/l. In Experiment 2, venepuncture induced a larger cortisol response than saliva sampling or no intervention on day 1 (P< 0.02); this difference was not observed on day 8, suggesting that sheep habituated to venepuncture. We recommend the measurement of cortisol in saliva to avoid stressing animals. However, when the expected concentration in plasma is below 55 nmol/l, the cortisol in saliva will reflect only the free fraction of the cortisol, which may be a limitation if the focus of the experiment is on total cortisol. In addition, if cortisol is measured in plasma and blood is collected by venepuncture, we recommend that sheep be habituated to venepuncture, at least to the handling required for a venepuncture.

AB  - Present and past permafrost distribution in the Pyrenees is still under discussion. As in other mid-latitude mountain regions, rock glaciers and protalus lobes are the main indicators of permafrost conditions. In this paper we examine the distribution of these landforms in Aran and Boi valleys, formerly glaciated U-shaped valleys ranging from 600 to 3000 m in the southern and northern sides of the Central Pyrenees, respectively. The spatial distribution of these landforms and their chronostratigraphic position within the valley allow a better understanding of the climatic and environmental conditions necessary for their development. Up to 151 permafrost-related landforms were identified in the Boi valley, including 56 rock glaciers and 95 protalus lobes. In the case of the northern Aran valley, 76 rock glaciers and 89 protalus lobes were cataloged corresponding to 165 landforms. Most of the landforms (93% for rock glaciers and 95% for protalus lobes) are located inside the glacial cirques, with a few distributed in the slopes of the formerly glaciated valleys. The lowest elevation of rock glaciers is situated at 1744 m (Aran) and 2007 m (Boi), whereas the lowest protalus lobes are located at 1740 m and 2033 m, respectively. Therefore, this altitude may be indicative of the lowest level recording permafrost conditions during the period in which these landforms formed, with paleotemperatures ca. 7-8 degrees C lower than present-day. Between 60 and 70% of the protalus lobes and rock glaciers are located between 2300 and 2600 m in Boi valley and 2100 and 2400 m in Aran valley. The aspect shows a prevailing orientation of NW, N and NE for both cases of rock glaciers and protalus lobes, being almost absent in the S, SE and SW aspects. The average slope of both landforms lies between 11 and 27 degrees, with a maximum of 35 degrees for rock glaciers and 29 degrees for protalus lobes. The amplitude/length ratio reveals that rock glaciers placed at lower altitudes are more elongated. The chronostratigraphic position of these landforms within the valley and with respect to the moraine complexes suggests the existence of three generations of permafrost-related landforms which are associated to the massive deglaciation process between the maximum glacial advance of the Last Glaciation and the Holocene.

AB  - In the last decades, the very fast improvement of the analytical instrumentation has led to the possibility of quickly and easily getting a lot of data; in turn, the need of advanced statistical methods suitable to extract the full information furnished by instruments has increased. Such kind of data treatments is particularly important in any case of continuous monitoring of one or more parameters, so the microclimate monitoring is a typical example for this application. Microclimate control is essential in the conservation of Cultural Heritage (CH), but decisions on optimal conservation parameters cannot base only on existing norms that do not take into account the environment's history. Often CH has survived for many centuries in conditions that must be considered risky but also a stable state (equilibrium) resulting from a long adaptation process during which a more or less heavy damage occurred to the materials. Any successive change of microclimate parameters has interrupted this equilibrium conditions and has induced further damage to material until a new equilibrium is reached; dimension and frequency of changes are proportional to the expected damage. This thermodynamic consideration provides the background for a CH conservation project based on microclimate control and highlights the importance of environmental monitoring for the identification of equilibrium parameters to be maintained. In 2010, we monitored the microclimate of an important historical building in Rome, the Mamertino Carcer, before its opening to visitors. One year later, we repeated the monitoring in the presence of visitors, and here, we present a careful choice of multivariate data treatments adopted for an enough, simple and immediate evaluation of the microclimatic changes; this allows an easier understanding also for persons with not too deep scientific background, such as Superintendents and, in turn, really useful information to provide suggestions for a conservation project. Results evidenced the expected loss of isolation of the site that occurred by opening to visitors; this led to wider excursions of both temperature and relative humidity and, in turn, to a worsening of the conservative conditions. Surely, a monitoring of particulate matter, correlated to air fluxes and, in turn, to microclimate, is of fundamental importance for the conservation of frescoes and will be object of one of our future diagnostic interventions in the site.

AB  - Sedimentary rocks from the saline formation of the Lopare Basin were investigated. Sediments contain a moderate amount of immature to marginally mature algal organic matter deposited under slightly reducing to anoxic and slightly saline to hypersaline conditions. Almost all of the samples contain beta-carotane in a relatively high quantity, and in some, it represents the most abundant compound in the total distribution of hydrocarbons. The objective of the study was to determine the conditions that are favourable to precursors of beta-carotene and/or the preservation of the carotenoid hydrocarbon skeleton. Moreover, the dominant transformation pathways of beta-carotene under different redox and salinity conditions, which lead to the formation of aromatic carotenoids were defined.
   Based on the content of beta-carotane, the examined sedimentary rocks are divided into groups A, B and C. Group A does not contain or contains up to 1% of beta-carotane, group B contains between 1 and 5% of beta-carotane, while group C contains more than 5% of 13-carotane in the overall distribution of hydrocarbons.
   The organic matter (OM) of the sediments of group A is characterized by a higher contribution of prokaryotic precursor organisms, in comparison with the other samples. The OM was deposited in a slightly saline reductive environment, with an increased erosion activity. This environment was unfavourable for the precursors of beta-carotene and/or for preservation of its hydrocarbon skeleton. Evidence for the degradation of the poliene chain in beta-carotene is the domination of monoaromatic compounds in the aromatic carotenoids distribution.
   The OM of sediments of groups B and C is similar, predominantly of algal origin deposited in a reducing to anoxic calm carbonate environment with salinity changes from hypersaline to saline. Such reduced to anoxic saline, but not hypersaline environments are most appropriate for precursors of beta-carotene and for the preservation of carotenoid skeleton.
   Cyclization and aromatization of polyene isoprenoid chain, whereby terminal groups remain the main pattern, is the main pathway of beta-carotene aromatization in anoxic hypersaline environments, whereas aromatization of terminal 1,1,5-trimethylcyclohexen-5-enyl groups and expulsion of toluene and m-xylene are typical for the reduced to anoxic saline environments.

AB  - Early to middle Pleistocene boulder deposits are common features on southern Nevada hillslopes. These darkly varnished, ancient colluvial deposits stand out in stark contrast to the underlying light-colored bedrock of volcanic tuffs, and they serve as minor divides between drainage channels on modern hillslopes. To demonstrate the antiquity of these stable hillslope features, six colluvial boulder deposits from Yucca Mountain, Nye County, Nevada, were dated by cation-ratio dating of rock varnish accreted on boulder surfaces. Estimated minimum ages of these boulder deposits range from 760 to 170 ka. Five additional older deposits on nearby Skull and Little Skull Mountains and Buckboard Mesa yielded cation-ratio minimum-age estimates of 1.38 Ma to 800 ka. An independent cosmogenic chlorine-36 surface exposure date was obtained on one deposit, which confirms an estimated early to middle Quaternary age. These deposits have provided the oldest age estimates for unconsolidated hillslope deposits in the southwestern United States.
   We suggest that the colluvial boulder deposits were produced during early and middle Pleistocene glacial/pluvial episodes and were stabilized during the transition to drier interglacial climates. By comparison to modern periglacial environments, winter minimum monthly temperatures of -3 to -5-degrees-C were necessary to initiate freeze-thaw conditions of such vigor to physically weather relatively large volumes of large boulders from the upper hillslopes of the Yucca Mountain area. These conditions imply that early and middle Pleistocene glacial winter temperatures were at least 1 to 3-degrees-C colder than existed during the last Pleistocene glacial episode and 7 to 9-degrees-C colder than present. We conclude that at least several early and middle Pleistocene glacial episodes were colder, and perhaps wetter, than glacial episodes of the late Pleistocene in the southern Great Basin.
   Geomorphic processes necessary to form these colluvial boulder deposits are not active on modern hillslopes in the southern Great Basin. In addition, the lack of young, relatively unvarnished colluvial boulder deposits on these hillslopes suggests that boulder-forming conditions did not exist during the late Pleistocene in this region.
   Modern semiarid hillslope processes primarily erode colluvium during infrequent high-intensity storms. The preservation of old, thin hillslope deposits and the less-than-2-m incision by hillslope runoff adjacent to these deposits, however, indicate that extremely low denudation rates have occurred on resistant volcanic hillslopes in the southern Great Basin during Quaternary time.

AB  - Simple Summary: Factors, such as ambient conditions, travel duration and vehicle design/compartment location have an impact on the welfare of pigs during transport, carcass bruises and meat quality. Based on this, we aimed to assess the effects of these factors on blood creatine kinase, lactate and cortisol concentrations in 384 pigs and assess their relationships with trailer temperature, and pigs' heart rate and gastrointestinal tract temperature, behavior, carcass damage scores and meat quality. Although increased blood cortisol and creatine-kinase levels appear to indicate a physical stress condition in transported pigs, the weak to moderate correlations with environmental and other animal welfare indicators suggest that blood stress parameters can only be used as a complementary measurement in the assessment of the pigs' response to transport stress.
   Abstract: The objective of this study was to assess the effects of the season, travel duration and trailer compartment location on blood creatine-kinase (CK), lactate and cortisol concentrations in 384 pigs and assess their relationships with trailer temperature, heart rate and gastrointestinal tract temperature (GTT), behavior, carcass damage scores and meat quality. Blood CK was greater in pigs transported in summer (p = 0.02), after 18 h transportation (p < 0.001) and in pigs located in C4, C5 and C10 (p = 0.002). In winter, the concentration of blood lactate was higher (p = 0.04) in pigs transported for 6 h in C5. Pigs located in C10 showed higher (p = 0.01) concentration of cortisol than those transported for 18h in C4 in summer. The highest correlations were between blood cortisol and GTT (r = 0.53; p < 0.001), and between blood CK and GTT (r = 0.41; p < 0.001), truck temperature (r = 0.42; p < 0.001), and pH(u) in the longissimus muscle (r = 0.41; p < 0.001). In conclusion, although increased blood cortisol and CK levels appear to indicate a physical stress condition in transported pigs, the weak to moderate correlations with environmental and other animal welfare indicators suggest that blood stress parameters can only be used as a complementary measurement in the assessment of the pigs' response to transport stress.

AB  - Linear Tape Open (LTO) and Travan5 heads were tested against the exactly similar formulation metal particles tape loaded into appropriate cartridges at a range of controlled environmental conditions. These tape cartridges were produced specifically for this study by the Imation Corp. Optical Microscopy was used to identify the head stains and debris distribution. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to analyse the changes in surface topography of the heads and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) was employed to analyse the chemical changes on the surface of the heads after up to 5000 passes of tapes. Conventional Fe based stain was seen to form on the heads of each tape format for all conditions with the exception of Travan5 heads at 40 degrees C and 80% relative humidity (RH) which were covered with much thicker and more extensive polymer based stain. The Travan5 heads showed a much greater propensity to stain than LTO heads.
   Pole tip recession (PTR) of the LTO heads was lower than Travan5 heads after cycling for the same distance and in the same environment condition. Higher temperature and higher humidity lead to higher PTR in each system. The contact pressure between the LTO head and tape is much lower than the Travan5 system (around one-third) and this the major factor for the reduced stains and lesser PTR value in the LTO system. The reduced contact pressure not only reduces the number of the three-body particles production, but also reduces chemical effects responsible for PTR and stain.
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to identify the chemical changes that occurred at the media surface. This showed that in all areas of the tape, the amount of detected Fe had slightly increased, whilst the N signal (an indicator of polymeric binder) had decreased. No significant tape wear occurred in either the LTO or Travan5 systems. The roughness (RMS measured by AFM) of the tape did not change significantly after cycling in either system, with the exception of Travan5 tapes cycled at the 40 degrees C, 80% RH which showed an increase. The more tape debris present on the Travan5 heads comparing with LTO heads.
   The results indicate conclusively that reduced contact pressure is responsible for the reduction in both stain and PTR. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human beings manage ecosystems to obtain ecosystem services. Through selected interventions they modify ecosystem condition to increase the provisioning services of interest to people. We analyzed the effect of livestock management regime components (duration, grazing period, number of burns and slashes and stocking density) on ecosystem services (provisioning, regulating and supporting) in seeded pastures in a tropical dry region. Our main questions were: (1) How is livestock management duration related to the magnitude of service supply?: (2) How are the different components of the livestock management regime and site conditions related to the magnitude of ecosystem service supply?: and (3) How do the components of management regime, the site conditions and the magnitude of ecosystem service supply interact? We quantified 15 service indicators within 24 plots (20 x 50 m) chosen along a 40-year gradient of livestock management duration. Livestock management regime was documented with semi-structured interviews to landowners. Simple linear regressions showed that increasing livestock management duration was related to increasing forage amount (p = 0.03) and to decreasing forage quality (p = 0.05), soil structure (p = 0.002), and several biodiversity indicators (p = 0.002-0.03). Stepwise multiple regression analyses showed that the increase in the total number of burns was related to decreases in foliar and soil nitrogen (p < 0.05), carbon stock (p < 0.001), as well as woody, herbaceous, and seedling richness or evenness (p < 0.001). Increased frequency of slashes and of the grazing period also decreased soil fertility regulation and biodiversity. The canonical correspondence analysis showed a prominent role of the number of burns (which is correlated with duration, slashing frequency and grazing period) in promoting forage production, but in reducing most indicators of regulating and supporting services. Increased shallow soil moisture was related to increasing regulating and supporting services. Canopy covers inside the plot and in the surrounding forest were positively related to woody and seedling richness or evenness, but were independent of the effects of other management regime components. Our study suggests a conflict between the short-term management decisions such as burning to foster forage production and the long term sustainability of the management regime of these seeded pastures.

AB  - Corridor disease (CD) is a fatal condition of cattle caused by buffalo-derived Theileria parva. Unlike the related condition, East Coast fever, which results from infection with cattle-derived T. parva, CD has not been extensively studied. We describe in detail the clinical and laboratory findings in cattle naturally infected with buffalo-derived T. parva. Forty-six cattle were exposed to buffalo-derived T. parva under field conditions at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy, Kenya, between 2013 and 2018. The first signs of disease observed in all animals were nasal discharge (mean day of onset was 9 days post-exposure), enlarged lymph nodes (10 days post-exposure), and pyrexia (13.7 days post-exposure). Coughing and labored breathing were observed in more than 50% of animals (14 days post-exposure). Less commonly observed signs, corneal edema (22%) and diarrhea (11%), were observed later in the disease progression (19 days post-exposure). All infections were considered clinically severe, and 42 animals succumbed to infection. The mean time to death across all studies was 18.4 days. The mean time from onset of clinical signs to death was 9 days and from pyrexia to death was 4.8 days, indicating a relatively short duration of clinical illness. There were significant relationships between days to death and the days to first temperature (chi(2) = 4.00, p = 0.046), and days to peak temperature (chi(2) = 25.81, p = 0.001), animals with earlier onset pyrexia died sooner. These clinical indicators may be useful for assessing the severity of disease in the future. All infections were confirmed by the presence of macroschizonts in lymph node biopsies (mean time to parasitosis was 11 days). Piroplasms were detected in the blood of two animals (4%) and 20 (43%) animals seroconverted. In this study, we demonstrate the successful approach to an experimental field study for CD in cattle. We also describe the clinical progression of CD in naturally infected cattle, including the onset and severity of clinical signs and pathology. Laboratory diagnoses based on examination of blood samples are unreliable, and alternatives may not be available to cattle keepers. The rapid development of CD requires recognition of the clinical signs, which may be useful for early diagnosis of the disease and effective intervention for affected animals.

AB  - The metabolism of Trichinella spp. is primarily anoxybiotic in nature. Their main energy source is glycogen, which is stored in the stichocites at the muscular stage of the larval development. When subject to tow temperatures the Trichinella larvae consume glycogen and neutral fats to provide for basal metabolism until the energy supplies reach the critical level. The present study establishes the glycogen concentration as well the invasive activity of T. nativa when affected by low temperatures in natural conditions. The carcasses of infected laboratory rats were placed in containers beneath the snow cover, in the natural conditions of a game husbandry in Central Russia. The viability, invasive capacity and the glycogen level were monitored in the Trichinella larvae monthly. The invasive capacity of Trichinella larvae was established based on the presence of the larvae in the muscular tissue of laboratory mice after the peroral administration of the helminth larvae. On the 45 day of the experiment, the mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and if the Trichinella larvae could be discovered in the muscular tissue with the help of the trichinelloscopic compression method, the invasive capacity of the Trichinella larvae was viewed as positive. To establish the quantitative value of glycogen content in Trichinella larvae a modified method was used. In order to measure the glycogen level in the T. nativa larvae isolated by fermentation larvae were counted in one drop of the suspended sedimentation in the Migacheva-Kotelnikov chamber. To establish the quantitative value of glycogen content in Trichinella larvae a method based on the treatment of glycogen with iodine, optical density measurement with a refractometer MKM Phi-02 was used. For the purpose of measuring the concentration of glycogen in Trichinella larvae in the suspended sedimentation a calibration curve was used. The studies showed that the viability indicator of the Trichinella larvae which had been preserved in natural conditions in the four months of the winter-spring period, in the muscular tissue of laboratory rats remained high (over 90 %). The glycogen concentration in one helminth larva was 0.041 mu g in January, 0.033 mu g in February, 0.015 mu g in April. The invasive capability of the preserved Trichinella larvae was considerably reduced to 33.3 %. In the winter period, under temperatures below 0 degrees C, a decrease in the glycogen concentration in the Trichinella larvae was observed.

AB  - The Kale-Tavas sub-basin, which is the south-western part of the Lycian Molasse Basin, SW Turkey, hosts several coal seams of Late Oligocene, Early and Middle Miocene age within, respectively, the Mortuma, Yenidere, and Sekkoy Formations. This study aims to determine coal rank, mineralogical, and geochemical features of the coal seams, and to ascertain factors controlling the mineralogical distribution and elemental enrichment. The distinct differences among the studied coal seams refer to mean random huminite/vitrinite reflectance (Rr). The highest Rr values (0.63-0.69%) are measured on the Late Oligocene Tavas coal, whereas the lowest Rr values (0.26-0.27%) were recorded in the Middle Miocene Narli coal. Similar mineralogical assemblages were found in all the studied coal seams; however, aluminosilicate minerals are dominant to abundant phases in the coal from the Mortuma and Yenidere Formations, while carbonate minerals are the dominant phases in the coal from the Sekkoy Formation. Accordingly, aluminosilicate-related elements (e.g. Al, K, Ti, and Li) display relatively higher concentrations in the studied coal seams from the Mortuma and Yenidere Formations, whereas relatively high-Ca concentrations and depletion of aluminosilicate-affiliated elements were recorded in the coal of the Sekkoy Formation. Furthermore, Ni, Mo, and U are relatively enriched in all the studied seams, while relative B-enrichment is identified in the coal seams of the Mortuma and Yenidere Formations, and these seem to be related to possible marine influence of the palaeomires during Late Oligocene and Early Miocene and/or the occurrence of specific B-bearing aluminosilicate minerals. Also, U and Mo enrichments in the Narli coal may be related with the development of anoxic conditions within the palaeomires during the Middle Miocene. Other indicators for anoxic conditions are framboidal pyrite grains and accessory Ni-bearing iron sulphides in all the studied samples. Although coal-bearing formations in the Kale-Tavas sub-basin deposited under different sedimentary environment, as the source areas for sediment supply of the coal seams remained the same during the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene, the mineralogical composition and elemental enrichment of the coal were mainly controlled by elastic inputs and redox conditions within the palaeomires; to a lesser extent a possible marine influence might have contributed to elemental enrichment.

AB  - The objective of the study was to estimate genetic correlations between skin lesions and aggressive behavior postmixing and under more stable social conditions as a potential means of selecting against pig aggressiveness. Postmixing aggression in commercial pig production is common, compromises welfare and profitability, and cannot be significantly reduced by low-cost changes to the environment. A genetic component to individual aggressiveness has been described in pigs and other species. Selective breeding against aggressiveness ought to be possible if an easily measured indicator trait can be shown to be genetically associated with aggressive behavior. Aggressive behavior was recorded continuously for 24 h after mixing, and a count of skin lesions (lesion count, LC) was recorded at 24 h and 3 wk postmixing on 1,663 pigs. Two behavioral traits were found to have a moderate to high heritability similar to that of growth traits; duration of involvement in reciprocal fighting (0.43 +/- 0.04) and delivery of nonreciprocal aggression (NRA; 0.31 +/- 0.04), whereas receipt of NRA had a lower heritability (0.08 +/- 0.03). Genetic correlations (r(g)) suggested that lesions to the anterior region of the body 24 h after mixing were associated with reciprocal fighting (r(g) = 0.67 +/- 0.04), receipt of NRA (r(g) = 0.70 +/- 0.11), and to a lesser extent, delivery of NRA (r(g) = 0.31 +/- 0.06). Lesions to the center and rear were primarily genetically associated with receipt of NRA (r(g) = 0.80 +/- 0.05, 0.79 +/- 0.05). Genetic correlations indicated that pigs that engaged in reciprocal fighting delivered NRA to other animals (r(g) = 0.84 +/- 0.04) but were less likely to receive NRA themselves (r(g) = -0.41 +/- 0.14). A genetic merit index using lesions to the anterior region as one trait and those to the center or rear or both as a second trait should allow selection against animals involved in reciprocal fighting and the delivery of NRA. Positive correlations between LC 24 h and 3 wk after mixing were found, especially for lesions to the center and rear of the body, indicating that postmixing lesions are predictive of those received under more stable group conditions. As well as reducing immediate aggression at mixing, selection on postmixing LC is expected to have a long-term impact on injuries from aggression, even after dominance relationships are established.

AB  - In this paper we describe a biological indicator which can be used to study the behavior of Vibrio vulnificus, an important molluscan shellfish-associated human pathogen. A V. vulnificus ATCC 27562 derivative that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) and kanamycin resistance was constructed using conjugation. Strain validation was performed by comparing the GFP-expressing strain (Vv-GFP) and the wild-type strain (Vv-WT) with respect to growth characteristics, heat tolerance (45 degrees C), freeze-thaw tolerance (-20 degrees and -80 degrees), acid tolerance (pH 5.0, 4.0, and 3.5), cold storage tolerance (5 degrees C), cold adaptation (15 degrees C), and response to starvation. Levels of recovery were evaluated using nonselective medium (tryptic soy agar containing 2% NaCI) with and without sodium pyruvate. The indicator strain was subsequently used to evaluate the survival of V. vulnificus in oysters exposed to organic acids (citric and acetic acids) and various cooling regimens. In most cases, Vv-GFP was comparable to Vv-WT with respect to growth and survival upon exposure to various biological stressors; when differences between the GFP-expressing and parent strains occurred, they usually disappeared when sodium pyruvate was added to media. When V. vulnificus was inoculated into shellstock oysters, the counts dropped 2 log(10) after 11 to 12 days of refrigerated storage, regardless of the way in which the oysters were initially cooled. Steeper population declines after 12 days of refrigerated storage were observed for both iced and refrigerated products than for slowly cooled product and product held under conservative harvest conditions. By the end of the refrigeration storage study (22 days), the counts of Vv-GFP in iced and refrigerated oysters had reached the limit of detection (10(2) CFU/oyster), but slowly cooled oysters and oysters stored under conservative harvest conditions still contained approximately 10(3) and > 10(4) CFU V. vulnificus/ oyster by day 22, respectively. The Vv-GFP levels in the oyster meat remained stable for up to 24 h when the meat was exposed to acidic conditions at various pH values. Ease of detection and comparability to the wild-type parent make Vv-GFP a good candidate for use in studying the behavior of V. vulnificus upon exposure to sublethal stressors that might be encountered during postharvest handling of molluscan shellfish.

AB  - Culturable cells and non-culturable cells of fecal coliforms, obtained by irradiation at 312 nm were submitted to the combined stress conditions of salinity and starvation. After 14 days, beta-galactosidase activity of UV-irradiated cells was at least twice the value of non-irradiated cells. UV-irradiated cells thus contribute more than non-irradiated cells to the enzyme assay after incubation in saline water. This finding is essential for the interpretation of quantitative investigations into the environment using enzymatic methods.

AB  - The results of soil-ecological assessment of gray forest-steppe soils in the Kuban region are presented. It was found that the most favorable ecological conditions for agriculture on these soils are recorded in the western and central subzones of the southern-piedmont zone of Krasnodar krai. The structure of land use in the forest-steppe zone was studied, and the reasons for intensive soil erosion were revealed. Soil-protection features of different land use types were determined. The optimal slope length at which the erosion of forest-steppe-soils would be minimal was determined for growing various crops.

AB  - An indicator system is constructed and applied for comprehensive measurement of rural vulnerability in China's counties. Through the selection of five representative transects we explore regional differences in, and driving forces of, China's rural vulnerability. The results show that (1) The rural vulnerability of counties in China is generally within the threshold range of low to medium, and exhibits obvious spatial differences. Along the "Bole-Taipei Line", there is a spatial pattern of north-south differentiation. Villages in the northeast part of the counties have low vulnerability, while those in the southwest are relatively vulnerable (2) External environmental phenomena are the leading factors that induce rural vulnerability. Specifically, the rural ecological subsystem composed of ecological exposure, ecological sensitivity, and ecological adaptation is the principal determinant of rural vulnerability. The rural economic subsystem composed of economic exposure, economic sensitivity, and economic adaptation is also a core determinant of rural vulnerability. The social subsystem composed of social exposure, social sensitivity, and social adaptation is also an important determinant of rural vulnerability. (3) According to the principle of adapting measures to local conditions, different regions should seek to reduce regional embeddedness and path dependence. We should strengthen the prediction and monitoring of sources of disturbance in rural areas, and scientifically control the sensitivity of the system itself. Then the adaptive capacity of the rural system can be improved pursuant of promoting sustainable development.

AB  - This study examines the impacts of non-renewable energy (NRE) on quality of life (QOL) through the conditioning role of technology on a panel of 43 Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries over the period spanning 1990-2019. For easy traceability of the channel through which NRE affects QOL, the aggregate measure of Human Development Index (HDI) was decomposed into three namely life expectancy, education, and per capita GDP (GDPPC). Four indicators such as coal, natural gas, petroleum oil (disaggregated), and fossil fuel (aggregated) capture NRE while ICT service exports are used to proxy technology. The empirical analyses are deployed on a two-step system generalized method of moments (SYS-GMM) with forward orthogonal and the Panel Fixed Effects. Similarly, the empirical analyses also consider four regions (viz: South, West, East, and Central) in SSA. The following findings are established. First, the indicators of non-renewable energy (NRE) are statistically significant and negatively signed when HDI, life expectancy, and GDPPC are the outcome variables but positive for education. Second, the role of technology is examined from two angles: unconditional (single) and conditional (interaction with NRE variables). Across all models, technology proves to be QOL enhancing. Third, while the test of nonlinearity in the NRE-QOL nexus is confirmed, the findings are also consistent with the sub-regional analyses.

AB  - Suspected detrimental health effects associated with ultrafine particles (UFPs) are impressive. However, epidemiological evidence is still limited. This is potentially due to challenges related to UFP exposure assessment and the lack of consensus on a standard methodology for UFPs. It is imperative to focus future health studies on those UFP metrics more likely to represent health effects. This is the purpose of this paper, where we extend the results obtained during the CARE ("Carbonaceous Aerosol in Rome and Environs") experiment started in 2017 in Rome. The major purpose is to investigate features of airborne UFPs associated with pro-inflammatory and oxidative responses. Aerosol chemical, microphysical, and optical properties were measured, together with the oxidative potential, at temporal scales relevant for UFPs (minutes to hours). The biological responses were obtained using both in-vivo and in-vitro tests carried out directly under environmental conditions. Findings indicate that caution should be taken when assessing health-relevant exposure to UFPs through the conventional metrics like total particle number concentration and PM2.5 and Black Carbon (BC) mass concentration. Conversely, we recommend adding to these, a UFP source apportionment analysis and indicators for both ultrafine black carbon and the size of particles providing most of the total surface area to available toxic molecules.

AB  - Wildfires, a key socio-environmental challenge in Mediterranean regions, are influenced by anthropogenic factors shaping land-use and socioeconomic spatial structures. By assuming that the dominant socioeconomic structure of local districts exerts a variable impact on wildfire spatial regimes, the present study investigates 174 indicators on a municipal scale in Italy, identifying a multidimensional relationship between wildfire characteristics and socioeconomic contexts. An exploratory statistical approach was adopted to identify linear and nonlinear relationships among variables assessing socioeconomic contexts and wildfire patterns. Empirical results demonstrate that characteristic wildfire attributes (frequency, intensity and severity) are systematically higher in socioeconomic contexts characterized by rural poverty, unemployment and deregulated urban expansion, especially in southern Italy. A higher fire frequency was typically observed in (i) peri-urban districts with a dynamic socio-demographic profile and (ii) in rural districts with intensive cropping systems. Joint information on socioeconomic structure/dynamics and environmental change, is crucial for a better understanding of local-scale spatial patterns of wildfires in the Mediterranean region. Integrated socio-environmental information provides a better understanding of the local communities' role in the management of wildfire-prone land, contributing to implement more effective strategies aimed at minimizing wildfire impact on land resources.

AB  - This study analyzed the relationships between environmental parameters and benthic macroinvertebrate faunas. Invertebrate richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity, functional-group and CCA were used to evaluate conditions of waterbodies of the Hu-lan Estuary Natural Wetland Reserve and its hinterlands. We measured 10 physicochemical variables and collected 165 species belonging to 6 functional feeding groups (FFGs) during spring, summer and autumn. Some of the physicochemical factors changed with seasons. Nitrate nitrogen, total nitrogen and total phosphate significantly varied with seasons (p < 0.05), unlike water temperature, depth, pH, dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand, Ammonia nitrogen and electronic conductivity (p > 0.05). The taxa richness of benthic macroinvertebrates did not vary significantly within the sites (p = 0.508); while the Shannon-Wiener diversity showed significantly difference (p < 0.01) within the sites over these three seasons. Gathering-collectors were the most abundant macroinvertebrate FFG assemblages all over the sites, though there's no significant difference in the total abundance of 6 functional feeding groups identified among the sites during spring, summer and autumn (p = 0.677, p = 0.681, p = 0.302, respectively). Our CCA results indicated positive correlations of macroinvertebrate community compositions with environmental variables in the Hu-lan Estuary Natural Wetland Reserve and its surrounding waters.

AB  - For the past 15 years, there has been tremendous interest and technological development concerning biocomposites. Plant fibres can be derived from a multitude of natural agro-sources, with the preferred choice as a composite reinforcement often being driven by abundance, geographical location, and historical use. While from a product designer's or engineer's point of view, all plant cell walls are 'similar', they have indeed substantial morphological and mechanical diversity linked to their structure, biochemical composition and the plant growing conditions. Here, we provide a holistic overview of the main types of plant cell walls used as polymer reinforcements. The relationship between their structures and properties, in constant link with potential associated composite, is specifically discussed. Then, the fibre extraction and cultivation modes are compared, through an environmental assessment. We also show how a scientists point of view on cell wall structure and associated experimental approach lead to distinct results; following a critical review, we make recommendations on appropriate characterisation. A final discussion highlights the pertinent parameters that accurately define a composite reinforcement fibre. The review will serve as a handbook reference for researchers and designers in the field of biomaterials for appropriate selection of plant cell walls for specific composite applications.

AB  - Twenty-four sediment samples were collected from six coastal areas along the Nile Delta coast, including Abu Qir Bay, Rosetta estuary, Abu Khashaba, El Burullus fishing port, El Gamil inlet and Damietta Harbor. Environmental parameters such as grain size, total organic matter, calcium carbonate and seven heavy metals concentration have been investigated. Seventy-two foraminiferal species were identified and counted. The study area has low foraminiferal density but diversified foraminiferal assemblages. Q-mode and R-mode cluster analyses have been applied to assess the relationship between foraminiferal assemblages and the measured environmental factors. Different diversity indices [e.g., species richness (S), Shannon index, Simpson index, Fisher alpha index, and Dominance] have been examined. The statistical results allowed the recognition of different species assemblages corresponding to different sub-environments, which reflected the prevalent ecological and pollution conditions. There are two main recognized clusters dividing the sampling stations into less polluted cluster (A) at El Burullus fishing port, El Gamil inlet and Abu Khashaba and highly polluted cluster (B) at Abu Qir Bay and Damietta Harbor. Ammonia tepida, Ammonia beccarii, Triloculina trigonula, Quinqueloculina lata, and Quinqueloculina spp. are recognized as pollution tolerant species, while Ammonia parkinsoniana, Porosononion spp., Buccella spp., Ammonia spp., and Ammonia sp1 are recognized as pollution-sensitive species. A high percentage of deformed specimens was recorded in the polluted areas especially in Damietta Harbor.

AB  - The cork oak forest is an ecosystem playing a major role in Moroccan socio-economy and biodiversity conservation. However, this ecosystem is negatively impacted by extensive human-and climate-driven pressures, causing a strong decrease in its distribution and a worsening of the desertification processes. This study aims at characterising the impact of cork oak forest management on a major actor of its functioning, the ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungal community associated with Quercus suber, and the determination of EcM bio-indicators. The EcM fungal community has been monitored during spring and winter seasons in two sites of the Moroccan Maamora forest, corresponding to a forest site either impacted by human activities or protected. A significant impact of cork oak forest management on the EcM fungal community has been revealed, with major differences during the summer season. The results confirmed the potential ecological significance of several EcM fungi (e.g., Cenococcum) in the sustainability of the cork oak forest functioning, but also the significant association of certain EcM fungi (Pachyphloeus, Russula, Tomentella) with a perturbation or a season, and consequently to the cork oak forest status or to climatic conditions, respectively. The development of study at the Mediterranean scale may improve the robustness of ecological models to predict the impact of global changes on this emblematic ecosystem of Mediterranean basin.

AB  - It is essential to remediate or amend soils contaminated with various heavy metals or pollutants so that the soils may be used again safely. Verifying that the remediated or amended soils meet soil quality standards is an important part of the process. We estimated the activity levels of eight soil exoenzymes (acid phosphatase, arylsulfatase, catalase, dehydrogenase, fluorescein diacetate hydrolase, protease, urease, and B-glucosidase) in contaminated and remediated soils from two sites near a non-ferrous metal smelter, using colorimetric and titrimetric determination methods. Our results provided the levels of activity of soil exoenzymes that indicate soil health. Most enzymes showed lower activity levels in remediated soils than in contaminated soils, with the exception of protease and urease, which showed higher activity after remediation in some soils, perhaps due to the limited nutrients available in remediated soils. Soil exoenzymes showed significantly higher activity in soils from one of the sites than from the other, due to improper conditions at the second site, including high pH, poor nutrient levels, and a high proportion of sand in the latter soil. Principal component analysis revealed that Bglucosidase was the best indicator of soil ecosystem health, among the enzymes evaluated.

AB  - The ecological conditions of urban areas have been deteriorating in some aspects due to population growth and increasing expansion, with significant effects on human health. Impervious surface areas are an important indicator of urban ecological environmental change, therefore quickly and accurately estimating impervious surface areas is essential to monitoring the urban dynamics of change and human activities and their effects on urban environmental quality. Currently, few methods that are applied in estimating urban impervious surfaces are capable of providing results quickly and accurately. Accordingly, this study proposes a new index, named the normalized difference impervious index (NDII), based on Landsat TM images, which uses the visible (red, green, and blue) and thermal bands. The index was used to extract the impervious surface areas of Nanjing city, Jiangsu Province, China, and we assume that the average value of five times strict supervised classification is the true value of impervious surfaces. A combination of red and thermal bands extracted the impervious surfaces with a producer's accuracy of 86.9%, a user's accuracy of 84.6%, an overall accuracy of 91.4%, and a kappa coefficient of 0.8. The accuracy is 87.7% validated by high-resolution images. This method can rapidly extract urban impervious surface areas with promising accuracy.

AB  - Soil enzyme activities play key roles in soil biochemical processes. Enzymes are sensitive to environmental changes. To investigate the effects of vegetation and permafrost on the soil quality in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, this study examined the enzyme activities of invertase, amylase, catalase, polyphenol oxidase, urease, and alkaline phosphatase in the soils under different vegetation and permafrost conditions of the northern fringe of the permafrost regions in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. In addition, 19 soil physio-chemical variables including moisture, bulk density, organic matter, total nitrogen (TN), phosphorus (P), total potassium (TK), and pH, were investigated. The results showed that the environmental variables and enzyme activities varied in the soils from the wet meadow to the meadow where permafrost exists. The soil from the alpine desert showed the lowest enzyme activity and the lowest organic matter content, whereas the soils from the alpine steppe showed some similarities with the meadow and the steppe. meadow. The statistical analyses demonstrated that the soil properties were greatly affected by the vegetation and the permafrost, and the enzyme activities were good indicators of soil quality. There were no obvious differences between the soils from the meadow and the wet meadow, which may indicate that the wet meadow ecosystems in this fringe area are more vulnerable than those of the continuous permafrost regions.

AB  - Ostracod assemblages from the upper part of the mini-core Ash-2009-08 that were retrieved from the inner shallow-water shelf of the northeastern Black Sea off the town of Gelendzhik were analyzed. The studied part of the core recovered sediments of the previous similar to 70 years. A proposed new ecologo-ethological method for the analysis of fossil biotic assemblages takes behavioral features of animals, along with their ecological preferences, into account. Particular attention is paid to the juvenile/adult ratio of each species; ostracod species are grouped depending on the biotopes that they prefer. This allows one to distinguish autochthonous species, represented mainly by adult specimens, from the species that penetrate from nearby biotopes, which are represented mainly or exclusively by instars. Five groups were differentiated according to their preferred biotopes: pelobionts, aleurobionts, psammobionts, suprabionts, and stygobionts. The findings of stygobionts in marine sediments are discussed. Only aleurobionts characterize the environment in situ, whereas the other groups, being stochastic elements, reflect a general diversity of the local fauna. The ostracod assemblages (number of species and their ratio) remained stable during the period of studies. Only two intervals of an increase in the total ostracod abundance were recorded. The maximum abundance in the 1940s-1960s results from eutrophication, whereas the high abundance values in the 1990s are probably associated with high bottom-water dynamics.

AB  - Within natural floodplains, flood disturbances are one of the major events that control ecosystem development and functioning. Our objectives were to better understand the effect of alternate flooding-draining due to tides and/or flooding river regime on riparian soils in terms of bacterial community and nitrate removal. The effect of the frequency and duration of alternate flooding-draining events on redox potential, N removal and soil bacterial community composition was investigated under flooded soils mesocosms for 3, 7 and 14 days, using redox electrode, acetylene inhibition and quantitative realtime PCR techniques. We investigated the dynamics of total, denitrifying and sulfate-reducing bacteria by targeting bacterial 16S rRNA, nosZ and dsrB genes. Alternate flooding-draining conditions increased N removal efficiency compared to the permanently flooded soil and the non-flooded control soil. The redox potential decreased more slowly under alternate flooding-draining than under permanent flooding soils. We evidenced a significant response of the denitrification process to soil type and flood duration. Moreover, alternate flooding-draining had the greatest impact on the soil bacterial and functional groups abundance (nosZ and dsrB genes). This approach by molecular microbial ecology can be performed in addition to the usual soil descriptors and can be considered as a useful indicator. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the current scenario of global climate change, desiccation is considered as one of the major environmental stressors for the biota exposed to altered levels of ambient temperature and humidity. Drosophila melanogaster, a cosmopolitan terrestrial insect has been chosen as a humidity-sensitive bioindicator model for the present study since its habitat undergoes frequent stochastic and/or seasonally aggravated dehydration regimes. We report here for the first time the occurrence of anhydrobiosis in D. melanogaster larvae by subjecting them to desiccation stress under laboratory conditions. Larvae desiccated for ten hours at <5% relative humidity could enter anhydrobiosis and could revive upon rehydration followed by resumption of active metabolism. As revealed by FIR and HPLC analyzes, our findings strongly indicated the synthesis and accumulation of trehalose in the desiccating larvae. Biochemical measurements pointed out the desiccation-responsive trehalose metabolic pathway that was found to be coordinated in concert with the enzymes trehalose 6-phosphate synthase and trehalase. Further, an inhibitor-based experimental approach using deoxynojirimycin, a specific trehalase inhibitor, demonstrated the pivotal role of trehalose in larval anhydrobiosis of D. melanogaster. We therefore propose trehalose as a potential marker for the assessment of anhydrobiosis in Drosophila. The present findings thus add to the growing list of novel biochemical markers in specific bioindicator organisms for fulfilling the urgent need of environmental biomonitoring of climate change.

AB  - Various artificial soil mixtures were prepared by mixing two different toxic metals containing sewage sludge from Ljubljana and Maribor wastewater treatment plants with natural mineral soil. The plots with mixtures were exposed to field environmental conditions for a period of 1 year, after which we assessed soil toxicity (germination test with Lactuca sativa), potential metal phyto-accessibility (diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid - DTPA extraction test), soil functioning (by soil enzymes activity) and conducted a field growth test with Lollium perenne L as a metal bio-indicator plant. The metal phyto-accessibility extraction test (DTPA) showed lower values than the metal accumulation test with L. perenne L, which also showed higher metal concentrations in roots compared to leaves. With the exception of the mixture containing 30% (w/w) of sludge from the Ljubljana wastewater treatment plant, all mixtures containing more than 20% of sludge negatively affected root elongation of L. sativa seeds, indicating an increase in artificial soils toxicity. Increasing the ratio of sludge from the Ljubljana plant increased dehydrogenase and decreased phosphomonoesterase, while the addition of sludge from the Maribor plant increased phosphomonoesterase activity. Overall, the effect of sludge addition on artificial soil properties, toxicity and functioning not only depended on dosage but was also sensitive to the source and pre-treatment of the sewage sludge.

AB  - Chlorophyll a fluorescence has been extensively studied over the last few years. As demonstrated, this phenomenon is closely related to the state of photosystem II, which plays a leading role in the photosynthetic process, and therefore it has become a powerful tool to investigate this complex and any damage occurring in it as a result of physical or chemical stresses. This means that by using photosynthetic organisms as biological probes, one can consider chlorophyll a fluorescence as one of the techniques of choice to reveal the presence of some hazardous toxicants widely spread in the environment. Herbicides, pesticides, and heavy metals, whose concentration in water and food products is generally subject to extremely severe restrictions, are a concrete example of compounds detectable by chlorophyll a fluorescence. These dangerous substances react with the photosystem II, modifying the fluorescence emitted and giving responses which vary in a concentration-dependent manner. The possibility of performing easy, fast, and direct measurements of the fluorescence, even under light conditions, has opened new frontiers for the analysis in situ of pollutants. The aim of this review is to give an overview of the different techniques based on chlorophyll a fluorescence spectrometry, focusing in particular on those which represented the starting point for applications addressed to the assessment of toxic compounds in environmental samples.

AB  - Centennial-millennial dynamics of tropical salt marsh vegetation are documented in the pollen record from marine core MD03-2622, Cariaco Basin, Venezuela, which spans the glacial period between 63 and 29 ka. Five rapid and abrupt expansions of salt marsh vegetation are linked with North Atlantic Heinrich events (HEs). Within each event, a recurrent pattern - starting with species of Chenopodiaceae, followed by grasses, and subsequently by Cyperaceae species - suggests a successional process that is determined by the close relationship between sea-level and community dynamics. The salt tolerant Chenopodiaceae, at the base of each sequence, indicate hypersaline intertidal environments, which were most likely promoted by extremely dry atmospheric conditions. Rapid sea-level rise characterizes the onset of HE staidials, causing erosion of marsh sediments, and continued recruitment of pioneer species (Chenopodiaceae), which are the only ones capable of tolerating the rapid rate of disturbance. Once, as sea-level drops or as rise decelerates, marsh plants are able to trap and stabilize sediments, favouring the establishment of more competitive species (graminoids). The increment of marsh height as a result of autochthonous sediment accumulation reduces the extent of hypersaline environments, and allows the establishment of mesohaline species. These results add to the scarce knowledge on tropical salt marsh ecosystems, and provide independent paleoclimatic evidence on sea-level changes occurring simultaneously with Antarctica climate variations.

AB  - Measurements of freshwater mussel tissue are potentially very useful for determining base-level isotopic values for food web studies in aquatic environments. As long-lived, filter-feeding organisms, mussels have the potential to spatially and temporally average the isotopic baseline signal. Following from earlier studies that focused on lake environments, this study investigates the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in tissue of the river dwelling freshwater mussel, Margaritifera falcata, in two extensively studied northern California coast range rivers, the South Fork Eel and Navarro. We highlight advantages and challenges for using riverine mussel isotopes as indicators of baselines. delta C-13 of primary producers is known to vary with habitat along the South Fork Eel channel, but our measurements show no such variations, demonstrating that riverine mussels do preserve a spatially averaged measure of instream derived food sources. Mean delta C-13 and delta N-15 are shown to be markedly different in the two rivers, reflecting differences in food sources and possibly watershed land use. We also found that delta N-15 of mussel tissue increased by approximately 2 parts per thousand with mussel age in both rivers. This suggests it is important to consider age and size effects when estimating baseline values from mussel tissues.

AB  - A previous laboratory investigation showed that the Antarctic gammarid amphipod Paramorea walkeri is more sensitive to heavy metals when exposed to UV-B radiation. The question addressed in this study is whether this effect is also observed when the species is exposed to combined solar UV radiation and heavy-metal contamination under field conditions. In situ bioassays using P. walkeri showed that exposure to field contamination resulted in a significant decrease of survival. The effects observed were stronger than expected according to the characteristics of the contamination. The hypothesis that solar UV radiation can increase the sensitivity of organisms to metal contaminants was thus tested in an outdoor test system. This revealed that the mortality recorded under exposure to both parameters was increased compared to mortalities resulting from exposure to each single parameter. This increased sensitivity of amphipods to heavy metals in the presence of UV-radiation is discussed as an explanation for the absence of this species in contaminated shallow waters. The effects observed at the individual level would thus be reflected at a population level. This work highlights the necessity to consider environmental parameters such as UV radiation in Antarctica to improve the predictive power in ecological risk assessment.

AB  - Growth rates of pedogenic carbonate coatings on clasts can be used as a simple quantitative index of soil and sediment age, as well as a chronological framework for palaeoecological reconstructions. They are also probably connected with general intensity of formation of Bk horizons in soils. Previously, data on coating growth rates were restricted ecologically and geographically to desert regions of North America. This paper presents growth rates of Holocene pedogenic carbonate coatings on clasts within an extended range of environments, calculated on the basis of archaeological and radiocarbon dating. The rates, in this study, are higher than in earlier reports. Carbonate coatings can thicken with rates up to 1 mm/1000 years or higher in semi-arid and semi-humid climates.
   At least five factors are likely to control growth rates: (1) climate, (2) lithology of carbonate parent material, (3) depth under the soil surface, (4) clast size, (5) bulk density and composition of cutans. Favorable factors for comparatively rapid coating thickening seems to be climatic conditions, ranging from semi-arid to semi-humid, high carbonate content of parent material and large size of clasts. There is also an optimal depth of carbonate coating growth in a soil profile. Little information on bulk density and composition of cutans is available, but they appear to play an important role as one of the factors governing growth rates of pedogenic carbonate coatings on clasts.

AB  - The aim of this study was to obtain data about the contamination of different environmental compartments (102 surface water samples, 59 sediment samples and 165 eel samples) by polycyclic musks (HHCB, AHTN, ADBI, AHMI, and ATII) within the framework of an exposure monitoring program.
   Results for HHCB (Galaxolide") gave the following mean values in areas strongly polluted with sewage: surface water 1.59 mug l(-1); sediment 0.92 mg kg(-1) d.w. and eel 1513 mug kg(-1) f.w. (in the edible portion) (6471 mug kg(-1) lipid). The following average concentrations were found in waters hardly contaminated with sewage: surface water 0.07 mug l(-1), sediment <0.02 mg kg(-1) and eel 52 <mu>g kg(-1) f.w. (445 mug kg(-1) lipid). Mean concentrations of 6.85 mug l(-1) (maximum: 13.3 mug/l) could be measured at sewage treatment plants' outlets.
   It could be shown that these polycyclics are highly suited to use as indicators of the degree of contamination of waters with organic substances originating from sewage. A mean bioconcentration factor (BCF) on wet weight of 862 (HHCB) and 1069 (AHTN) for the transfer from water to eel under natural conditions could be calculated. The corresponding BCF-values based on the lipid content of eel were 3504 (HHCB) and 5017 (AHTN). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The methodology described in this paper provides land evaluators and land use planners with a tool to predict the land production potential for irrigated and rainfed winter wheat in Pinan County (China), taking into account environmental conditions and management practices of the local farmers.
   The correlation between predicted yields and actual reported yields by local farmers suggests a close resemblance between the simulated production environment and the situation in which the farmers operate.
   Incorporation in the model of quantified effects of limiting factors on crop performance allows estimation of inputs necessary to improve the actual yield level.

AB  - To indicate the potential role of Gmelinoides fasciatus, an invasive species of Lake Onego, in the inclusion of microplastics into food webs, several indicators were evaluated: its ability to ingest microplastics, the preferred size ranges, and the ingestion intensity. For this purpose, irregularly shaped polystyrene copolymer particles (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastics, artificially crushed) of four size classes (<50, 50-100, 100-250, >250 mu m) were used. Gmelinoides fasciatus actively ingested microplastic particles, and in treatment with particles of 100-250 mu m in size, the consumption rate was the highest. The crustaceans that survived the experiment ingested smaller particles than the deceased ones. Based on the size-frequency distributions of the ingested particles and the same in the suspension, crustaceans preferred smaller particles than those in suspension. The mean size of the ingested particles was 100 +/- 5 mu m. However, considering the actual concentration of microplastic fragments in the sediments of Lake Onego, in natural conditions, a negative effect of microplastic fragments on the G. fasciatus population is unlikely. At the same time, the ability of the invasive species G. fasciatus to consume microplastics and their active integration into the food webs of Lake Onego through consumption by fish can be considered reliable factors of the entry of microplastics in the fish of Lake Onego.

AB  - Understanding carbon allocation in plants is essential for explaining their growth strategies during environmental adaptation. However, the role of mobile carbon in plant growth and its response to habitat conditions is still disputed. In degraded meadow (alpine sandy grassland) and non-degraded meadow (typical alpine meadow and swamp meadow) on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, we measured the monthly averages of above-ground biomass (AGB) and below-ground biomass (BGB) of the investigated species in each meadow and the average concentration of non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs), an indicator of carbon storage. Below-ground organs had higher concentrations and showed more seasonal variation in NSCs than above-ground organs. BGB had a positive correlation with below-ground NSCs levels. However, AGB had no clear relationship with above-ground NSCs levels. Plants in sandy grasslands had higher total NSC, soluble sugars, fructose, and sucrose concentrations and lower starch concentrations in below-ground organs than plants in alpine or swamp meadows. Overall, NSCs storage, particularly soluble sugars, is a major process underlying the pattern of below-ground growth, but not above-ground growth, in the meadow ecosystem of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, and degraded meadow strengthens this process. These results suggest that the extent of carbon storage in non-photosynthetic organs of alpine herbs impacts their growth and habitat adaptation.

AB  - Diatoms, unicellular siliceous microalgae, are one of the most known groups of eukaryotic algae, commonly used as bioindicators for assessing water quality in aquatic ecosystems. Conversely, studies on terrestrial diatoms as potential bioindicators of soil quality are rather scarce. This study aims to assess the arid suburban soils quality of Marrakesh disturbed by various anthropogenic activities using diatom communities as bioindicators. The sampling of soil and physicochemical measurements were carried out at six sites with different land use. A total of 26 diatom taxa has been identified with 13 genera. The highest species richness and algal biomass were recorded in agricultural irrigated soils with treated wastewater dominated by pollution-tolerant species of Nitzschia (71.43%). In canonical correspondence analysis, suburban soils were subdivided into three groups depending on the chemical properties and diatom composition. The diatom diversity was significantly correlated with the total organic carbon (TOC), P-PO4, and N-NH4+ contents. While diversity and biomass were significantly lower in the soils affected by municipal and mining solid wastes, the input of organic matter and nutrients from treated wastewater appears to have a positive impact on the soil microflora and its richness. This first exploratory survey showed that diatom communities were more sensitive to the anthropic disturbances on urban soil and could be used as bioindicators of the quality and soils conditions.

AB  - A major focus in community ecology is understanding how biological interactions and environmental conditions shape horizontal communities. However, few studies have explored whether cross-community interactions are consistent or non-stationary across environmental gradients. Using the relative abundance of birds, aquatic macroinvertebrates and plants, we examined how cross-community congruence varied between short and long-hydroperiod prairie pothole wetlands in southern Alberta. These wetlands are structured by their hydroperiod: the length of time that ponded water is present in the wetland. We compared the strength of cross-community congruence and the strength of congruence between each horizontal community and wetland hydroperiod in wetlands that typically contain ponded water throughout the year to wetlands that dry up every summer. The strength of cross-community relationships was similar between more permanent and more ephemeral wetland classes, suggesting that biological interactions have a near equivalent role in shaping community composition, regardless of hydroperiod. However, because cross-community congruence, measured as the Procrustes pseudo-R value, was, on average, 77%+/- SE 12% greater than that between each horizontal community and measures of wetland hydroperiod, we concluded that community structure is not shaped by hydroperiod alone. We attribute the observed cross-community congruence to (1) plants and aquatic macroinvertebrates influence birds through habitat and food provisioning, and (2) birds influence plants and aquatic macroinvertebrates by dispersing their propagules.

AB  - Vector-borne disease control relies on efficient vector surveillance, mostly carried out using traps whose number and locations are often determined by expert opinion rather than a rigorous quantitative sampling design. In this work we propose a framework for ecological sampling design which in its preliminary stages can take into account environmental conditions obtained from open data (i. e. remote sensing and meteorological stations) not necessarily designed for ecological analysis. These environmental data are used to delimit the area into ecologically homogeneous strata. By employing Bayesian statistics within a model-based sampling design, the traps are deployed among the strata using a mixture of random and grid locations which allows balancing predictions and model-fitting accuracies. Sample sizes and the effect of ecological strata on sample sizes are estimated from previous mosquito sampling campaigns open data. Notably, we found that a configuration of 30 locations with four households each (120 samples) will have a similar accuracy in the predictions of mosquito abundance as 200 random samples. In addition, we show that random sampling independently from ecological strata, produces biased estimates of the mosquito abundance. Finally, we propose standardizing reporting of sampling designs to allow transparency and repetition/re-use in subsequent sampling campaigns.

AB  - This research investigates the influence of place of residence and diabetic patient's socioeconomic position on their use of health services in a universal health care system. This retrospective cross-sectional population-based study is based on the joint use of the Health Insurance information systems, an ecological indicator of social deprivation and an indicator of potential spatial accessibility of healthcare provision in the Midi-Pyrenees region. Using French healthcare insurance population-based data on reimbursement of out-of-hospital care during the year 2012, we study the use of health services among patients aged 50 and over (n = 90,136). We built logistic regression models linking health services use to socioeconomic position by geographic area, adjusted for age, gender, healthcare provision, information regarding patients precariousness, and long-term condition, used as proxy for the state of health. After adjustment for healthcare provision, the lower population density in the geographical area of concern, the lower the access to specialised care, independent of the patients' SEP. General practitioner attendance was higher among the patients with the lowest SEP without being clearly influenced by their living place. We found no clear influence of either patients' SEP or their living place on their access to biological follow-up. This study is an attempt to account for the geographical context and to go further in studying the social determinants of health among diabetes patients.

AB  - As a result of the gas pressure drop in natural grid pipelines in the cold seasons, the feedstock of steam power plant is changed from the natural gas into the heavy fuel oil. Sometimes this change happens for the whole winter and causes lots of environmental problems for the cities near the big power plant. Gasification is a technologically advanced and environmentally friendly process of disposing the heavy fuel oil and the coal by converting them into the usable gas products named Syngas which mainly consists of CO and H-2. In this article, the feasibility study of gasification process application in the available steam power plant is considered. The 1000 MW steam power cycle is simulated and the natural gas, heavy oil, and generated syngas from gasification process of heavy fuel oil are selected as the feedstock. Results of economic analysis illustrate that in current economic conditions, the application of gasification process is not feasible in the available steam power cycle. It also shows that in the higher market prices of electrical energy, the revenue of system is much more than the emission penalty cost. So the difference between two types of calculation (considering emission penalty cost) is not noticeable. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although chironomids are popular model organisms in ecological research and indicators of bioassessment, the relative role of dispersal and environmental filtering in their community assembly is still poorly known, especially at fine spatial scales. In this study, we applied a metacommunity framework and used various statistical tools to examine the relative role of spatial and local environmental factors in distribution of benthic chironomid taxa and their assemblages in large and shallow Lake Balaton, Hungary. Contrary to present predictions on the metacommunity organisation of aquatic insects with winged terrestrial adults, we found that dispersal limitation can considerably affect distribution of chironomids even at lake scale. However, we also revealed the predominant influence of environmental filtering, and strong taxa-environment relationships were observed especially along sediment type, sediment organic matter content and macrophyte coverage gradients. We account that identified reference conditions and assemblages along with specified optima and tolerances of the abundant taxa can contribute to our understanding of chironomid ecology and be utilised in shallow lake bioassessment. Further, we propose that predictive models of species-environment relationships should better take into account pure spatial structuring of local communities and species-specific variability of spatial processes and environmental control even at small spatial scales.

AB  - Many engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) are functionalized with different types of surface coatings to suit specific applications. The functionalization affects the fate and behavior of these ENPs in aquatic environments. In this study, gold nanoparticles (GNPs) coated with either citrate or 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) are used as examples of functionalized ENPs. A method has been developed to assess the colloidal stability of functionalized ENPs under complex hydrochemical conditions, using their aggregation rates as indicators. The spatial distributions of stream-water chemistry data from across Europe were combined with the results of in-vitro colloidal stability testing. Aggregation rates were extracted for each stream-water sample and stability maps for Europe were plotted. The tendency of the tested GNPs to be dispersed or aggregated is described for water bodies of the respective region. Natural organic matter was identified as the predominant factor controlling the stability of the GNPs tested. The properties of surface coatings also affect aggregation rates as a result of differences in their hydrochemical parameters. The developed method can be used as a template for a stability assessment, and the results of this study provide a basis for exposure modeling and precautionary decision making.

AB  - This work is an analysis of crude oil samples from thirty wells in the Alturitas Field (Lake Maracaibo Basin, western Venezuela). Different biomarkers, ten trace elements, and porphyrins were analysed using GC-MS, ICP-OES and UV-visible techniques, respectively. The characterization of these crude oils leads us to conclude that they all fall into a single non-biodegraded oil family derived from a single pulse of hydrocarbon generation, migration and accumulation from the thermally mature calcareous La Luna source rock deposited in an anoxic marine palaeoenvironment under reducing conditions. The main objective of this work is to present a secondary oil migration model for the Marcelina reservoir of the Alturitas Field. The multivariate statistical study of trace-element concentrations, porphyrin contents, and polar compound proportions shows that these parameters can be split into two groups. The first group (Cd, Cu, Mo, Fe, P, Zn, Ca, and Mg) indicates a chalcophic association (Cd, Cu, Mo, and Zn) or colloidal complexes with naphthenic acids (Ca, Mg, and Fe). The other two trace elements (V and Ni), together with porphyrins and polar compounds, reveal that oil compositions has been affected by geochromatography, indicating a highly probable secondary migration pathway along a preferential axis orientated southeast to northwest.

KW  - CHOICE
AB  - Maintaining appropriate beliefs about variables needed for effective decision making can be difficult in a dynamic environment. One key issue is the amount of influence that unexpected outcomes should have on existing beliefs. In general, outcomes that are unexpected because of a fundamental change in the environment should carry more influence than outcomes that are unexpected because of persistent environmental stochasticity. Here we use a novel task to characterize how well human subjects follow these principles under a range of conditions. We show that the influence of an outcome depends on both the error made in predicting that outcome and the number of similar outcomes experienced previously. We also show that the exact nature of these tendencies varies considerably across subjects. Finally, we show that these patterns of behavior are consistent with a computationally simple reduction of an ideal-observer model. The model adjusts the influence of newly experienced outcomes according to ongoing estimates of uncertainty and the probability of a fundamental change in the process by which outcomes are generated. A prior that quantifies the expected frequency of such environmental changes accounts for individual variability, including a positive relationship between subjective certainty and the degree to which new information influences existing beliefs. The results suggest that the brain adaptively regulates the influence of decision outcomes on existing beliefs using straightforward updating rules that take into account both recent outcomes and prior expectations about higher-order environmental structure.

AB  - Diatom analyses of sediment cores extracted from three lakes in coastal southeastern South Australia reveal that, for most of the mid-late Holocene, they were shallow, brackish to saline systems with limited flow of water from continental sources. The construction of a substantial network of drains in the early years of settlement, to maximise transportation and agricultural production through wet winters, lead to abrupt freshening of the lakes. Interestingly, despite substantial nutrient loads to Lake Bonney SE (there are two Lakes Bonney and Frome in South Australia, which is why the lakes in the southeast of the state are differentiated with 'SE') associated with the commissioning and expansion of pulp and paper mills, a wastewater treatment plant discharge and agricultural runoff, there is only moderate evidence of nutrient enrichment in the lake, possibly because the post-impact assemblages are dominated by taxa with broad ecological preferences. Despite being preserved within a conservation park, eutrophication associated with agriculture is evident in the diatom assemblages of Lake Frome SE, which has a catchment more than twice that of Lake Bonney SE. Mullins Swamp, on the other hand, supports few indicators of eutrophic conditions. The freshening of these lakes is against the tide of salinisation from rising saline groundwaters in most wetlands across southeastern Australia.

AB  - 1. A method has been developed for assessing the degree of human alteration of river flow regimes relative to near-natural or reference conditions.
   2. The Dundee Hydrological Regime Alteration Method (DHRAM) utilizes the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration approach of the US Nature Conservancy to classify the risk of damage to in-stream ecology using a five-class scheme compatible with the requirements of the EC Water Framework Directive.
   3. Separate methods have been developed for rivers and lakes, though only the former are considered in this paper.
   4. DHRAM uses daily mean flow time-series data, representing un-impacted and impacted situations for the site of interest, in relation to any type of anthropogenic hydrological impact such as impoundments, abstractions or flow augmentation.
   5. Procedures for coping with different levels of data availability are outlined, utilizing the Micro Low Flows computer package to generate synthetic series of daily mean flows, supplemented by flow alteration data as appropriate.
   6. The utility of DHRAM is demonstrated through a pair of Scottish case studies illustrating its ability in classifying regime alteration and supporting mapping, which will be of value to river basin managers.
   7. Finally, present and future issues relating to the calibration of DHRAM scores to levels of ecological damage are discussed. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Airflows sustain the infection spread, and in densely urbanized areas airborne particulate matters (PMs) are deemed to aggravate the viral transmission. Apis mellifera colonies are used as bioindicators as they allow environmental sampling of different nature, PMs included. This experiment demonstrates for the first time the possible use of honey bee colonies in the SARS-CoV-2 monitoring. The trial was conducted in Bologna on 18 March 2021, when the third wave of the Italian pandemic was at its peak and environmental conditions allowed high PM concentrations in the air. Sterile swabs were lined up at the hive entrance to sample the dusty material on the body of returning foragers. All of them resulted positive for the target genes of viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Likewise, internal samples were taken, but they resulted in no amplification of the target sequences. This experiment does not support speculations about the role of honey bees or their products in SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

AB  - Environmental management and monitoring must reconcile social and cultural objectives with biodiversity stewardship to overcome political barriers to conservation. Suitability modelling offers a powerful tool for such "biocultural" approaches, but examples remain rare. Led by the Stewardship Authority of the Kitasoo/Xai'xais First Nation in coastal British Columbia, Canada, we developed a locally informed suitability model for a key biocultural indicator, culturally modified trees (CMTs). CMTs are trees bearing evidence of past cultural use that are valued as tangible markers of Indigenous heritage and protected under provincial law. Using a spatial multi-criteria evaluation framework to predict CMT suitability, we developed two cultural predictor variables informed by Kitasoo/Xai'xais cultural expertise and ethnographic data in addition to six biophysical variables derived from LiDAR and photo interpretation data. Both cultural predictor variables were highly influential in our model, revealing that proximity to known habitation sites and accessibility to harvesters (by canoe and foot) more strongly influenced suitability for CMTs compared with site-level conditions. Applying our model to commercial forestry governance, we found that high CMT suitability areas are 51% greater inside the timber harvesting land base than outside. This work highlights how locally led suitability modelling can improve the social and evidentiary dimensions of environmental management.

AB  - Since 2014, China's photovoltaic poverty alleviation projects (PPAPs) have developed rapidly with the strong support of the Chinese government. Nevertheless, empirical evidence on the contribution of PPAPs in improving the livelihoods of poor rural families is lacking. In order to overcome this knowledge gap, this study adopted a quasi-experimental research method based on a sample dataset of 735 poor families in Chinese rural areas before and after the project. Using five types of livelihood capital values for poor families as poverty proxy indicators, we quantified the net contribution of PPAPs to poverty reduction in rural low-income families through probability distribution comparative analysis, mean comparison analysis, and difference-in-difference regression model. Results demonstrated that the PPAPs were able to precisely target rural families requiring relief and significantly reduced poverty in China, with the net effect on livelihood capital increases for rural families determined as 31.9%. PPAPs have effectively enhanced the economic conditions and social capital of poor families, yet increases in human and natural capital performed poorly. Differences existed in the anti-poverty effect of PPAPs across the three types of solar photovoltaic resource areas. The rural socioeconomic development and access to roads were undoubtedly important factors affecting the livelihoods of rural families. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - IoT E-Waste Monitoring System to Support Smart City Initiatives
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED ENGINEERING
LA  - English
AB  - This project introduces the design and development of IoT E-waste monitoring system to support Green City initiatives in real-time. The main objective of this system is to design an IoT-based recycle e-waste monitoring system that will provide an efficient solution to electronics waste collection and generation data. The hazardous chemical components of e-waste have potentially adverse impacts on ecosystems and human health if not managed and monitored properly. Hence, the importance to constantly monitor the condition of the e-waste bin. The system measures and delivers up-to-date information to the system's administrator on the waste level and bin's current temperature in real-time. In case of fire, the system will give notification via its flame indicator. Agile Model is used as the research methodology as it offers an adaptive approach in respect to what features need to be developed. The proposed system consists of HC SR04 Ultrasonic sensor which measures the waste level, a DS18B20 temperature sensor that detects the temperature in the bin, KY026 flame sensor, a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ as a microcontroller and ThingSpeak as an IoT web platform. ThingSpeak concurrently stores data for future use and analysis, such as prediction of the peak level of waste bin. This system is expected to increase the usage of e-waste recycle bin, hence supporting the Green City initiatives and creating a greener environment by monitoring and controlling the collection of e-waste smartly through the concept of Internet-of-Things (IoT).

AB  - Comets contain abundant amounts of organic and inorganic species. Many of the volatile molecules in comets have also been observed in the interstellar medium and some of them even with similar relative abundances, indicating formation under similar conditions or even sharing a common chemical pathway. There is a growing amount of evidence that suggests comets inherit and preserve substantial fractions of materials inherited from previous evolutionary phases, potentially indicating that commonplace processes occurred throughout comet-forming regions. Through impacts, part of this material has also been transported to the inner planetary system, including the terrestrial planets. While comets have been ruled out as a major contributor to terrestrial ocean water, substantial delivery of volatile species to the Earth's atmosphere, and as a consequence also organic molecules to its biomass, appears more likely. Comets contain many species of prebiotic relevance and molecules that are related to biological processes on Earth, and have hence been proposed as potential indicators for the presence of biological processes in the search of extraterrestrial life. Although the delivery of cometary material to Earth may have played a crucial role in the emergence of life, the presence of such alleged biosignature molecules in the abiotical environment of comets complicates the detection of life elsewhere in the universe.

AB  - Ecological security has been proposed in recent years based on the grim reality that the serious damage to ecosystems is difficult to repair and increasingly threatens human survival and economic development. This paper proposes a method for analyzing the commercial dispute resolution mechanism of the free trade zone based on the multi-label dispute handling classification model to improve the effectiveness of the analysis of the commercial dispute resolution mechanism in the Free Trade Zone. Firstly, we can establish an index system consisting of first-level indicators such as effect, efficiency and cost, and several second-level indicators according to the actual national conditions and laws, which can be used as the basis for evaluating the commercial dispute settlement mechanism of Free Trade Zone. The secondary indicators in the index system are analyzed quantitatively or qualitatively by collecting data, and the first-level indicators of "effect" are evaluated comprehensively. Secondly, it is applied to the classification of commercial dispute resolution mechanism in Free Trade Zone referring to the soft fuzzy rough set model for dealing with uncertainties. At the same time, soft fuzzy rough set model is adopted based on rough set theory and improved, it has the ability to deal with multi-label disputes. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by simulation experiments.

AB  - Developing local soil health (SH) benchmarks for different ecosystems is important for supporting locally appropriate management decisions and correct interpretation of soil health results. This study was conducted to develop SH scoring functions as benchmarks specific to coffee production in Cauca, Colombia. A total of 223 soil samples were collected from coffee farms in six municipalities and were analyzed for 13 SH indicators including wet aggregate stability (WAS), available water capacity (AWC), respiration rate, pH, contents of active carbon (AC), organic matter (OM), protein, phosphorus (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn). A scoring function for each indicator was developed using the cumulative normal distribution (CND) function with parameters based on either the average local conditions for a given indicator (physical and biological indicators), or thresholds found in the literature for coffee systems (chemical indicators). Separate scoring functions by textural group (fine, medium) were necessary for AWC, OM, AC, and respiration. A best subsets regression (BSR) using the overall soil health index as the response variable was executed to determine the indicators with highest predictive power of overall soil health. AC was the best single predictor of soil health, and AC combined with protein, P and pH offer additional predictability, suggesting them for a simplified SH test. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Estuary sediment is a major pollutant enrichment medium and is an important biological habitat. This sediment has attracted the attention of the marine environmental scientists because it is a more stable and effective medium than water for monitoring regional environmental quality conditions and trends. Based on a large amount of measurement data, we analyzed the concentrations, distribution, and sources of seven heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, and Zn) in the surface sediment of typical estuaries that empty into the sea in eastern China: the Liaohe River Estuary, Yellow River Estuary, Yangtze River Estuary, Minjiang River Estuary, and Pearl River Estuary. The heavy metal concentrations in the sediments vary considerably from one estuary to the next. The Liaohe River Estuary sediment contains elevated levels of Cd, Hg, and Zn. The Yellow River Estuary sediment contains elevated levels of As. The sediments in the Yangtze River and Minjiang River estuaries contain elevated levels of Cd and Cu and of Pb and Zn, respectively. The sediment in the Pearl River Estuary contains elevated levels of all seven heavy metals. We used the Nemerow index method to assess the environment quality. The heavy metal pollution in the Liaohe River and Pearl River estuaries is more severe than that in the other estuaries. Additional work indicates that the heavy metal pollution in the Liaohe River and Pearl River estuaries is caused mainly by human activity.

AB  - The environmental assessment and management of historical mining sites contaminated with various inorganic species require a better knowledge of pollutantbearing phases. Among elements present in mining soils, arsenic is a toxic metalloid with potential high content and high mobility capacity into the environment. The objective of this paper was to investigate the mobility and fractionation of arsenic (As) in a highly As contaminated soil (ca. 3 wt%). The soil was collected from an old gold mining site in France, where mining activities and smelting processes of gold ores took place. Single and sequential chemical extraction procedures were firstly conducted. These leaching tests were used to assess the potential mobility of As depending on its fractionation in the contaminated soil, and also on the portion of As sorbed onto soil particles. Additionally numerical simulations were performed using the USGS software PHREEQC-3 in order to evaluate the role of adsorption on As mobilization. This multidisciplinary approach provided information on the nature of As fixation in this mining soil. Moreover the role of adsorption in the control of dissolved As was evidenced by geochemical modeling. Results showed that As appeared to be mainly (ca. 72 wt%) reversibly sorbed to iron (Fe) compounds in the soil, in particular Fe oxyhydroxides. Consequently a potential risk of As mobilization exists especially under acidic and/ or reducing conditions, which frequently occurs in mining environments.

AB  - Debris flows represent dangerous occurrences in many parts of the world. Several disasters are documented due to this type of fast-moving landslides; therefore, natural-hazard assessment of debris flows is crucial for safety of life and property. To this aim, much current work is being directed toward developing geotechnical-hydraulic models for the evaluation of debris flow susceptibility. A common base for such current models is parameterization of background predisposing and triggering factors such as inherent characteristics of geo-materials, topography, landscape and vegetation cover, rainfall regime, human activities, etc. which influence the occurrence of these processes on slopes. The same factors are also taken into account in soil erosion prediction models. Consequently, it seems worth investigating the effectiveness of the soil erosion index as debris flows susceptibility indicator. To this aim, a logistic regression analysis was carried out between the erosion index assessed by means of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model and the inventory of debris flows that have occurred in an area in Sicily (Southern Italy). Model assumptions were verified and validated by means of a series of statistical tools. Different possible scenarios were also evaluated by considering hypothetical changes in soil erosion rate under different rain erosivity conditions. Notwithstanding the rough approximations in model data collection, the outcomes appear encouraging.

AB  - River morphological quality assessment, derived from quantification of human pressures as well as river channel alteration, is a demand of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) in terms of integrating hydromorphological elements in defining ecological status. Our study's aim is to contribute to the hydromorphological evaluation by proposing indicators and separating classes, based on a revisited Morphological Quality Index (rMQI) protocol. The rMQI is based on 12 indicators of human pressures, 10 indicators of channel form adjustments, and 11 indicators of functionality. The rMQI scoring system allows for the quantification of changes when compared to reference conditions, be they undisturbed or nearly undisturbed by human interventions, with absent channel adjustments and a functioning natural river style. We used the lower, meandering sector of the Prahova River to demonstrate our assessment methodology. The Lower Prahova River suffers from a minor local intervention and a diminishing intensity of fluvial processes specific to a meandering style. Meanders geometry was affected by significant changes that included a decrease in the radius of curvature, width and width-to-mean-depth ratio. We concluded that the Lower Prahova River has a good morphological quality, which is rated as second class on a scale of five levels, from natural to severely modified. We recommend an improvement in the hydromorphological evaluation protocol in Romania by additional indicators for morphological alterations specific to each channel pattern.

AB  - We identified 185 diatom species in 87 samples collected from 17 Arctic lakes of the Kostyanoi Nos Cape in July 2003. Species richness varies from 9 to 97 per lake with Aulacoseira islandica (O.F. Muller) Simonsen, Fragilariamesolepta Rabenhorst, Psammothidium subatomoides (Hustedt) L. Bukhtiyarova and Round as dominant species. Bioindication attests to preponderance of temperate, moderately oxygenated, low-to-moderate organic-enriched alkaline, and circumneutral low saline water. Oligotrophic to mesotrophic state correlates with the type of sediments and low organic pollution (saprobity index 0.81-1.73 and Classes 2-3 of water quality). The diatom assemblages contain cosmopolitan species accompanied by the large group of 45 boreal species including 28 Arctic-alpine taxa. Canonical correspondence analysis shows conductivity and the type of sediments being the most important variables. Multivariate regression testifies to importance of depth and area of the lake. The community level analysis reveals four groups correlated with species richness, type of sediments, pH, and salinity. Potential species richness is estimated as 800 species square kilometer based on species-area relationships. Since the diatom assemblages of Arctic lakes are sensitive to climate warming and associated changes of salinity and trophic conditions, they are under high risk of extinction, the diversity losses being scarcely compensated by the rise of tolerant species.

AB  - We generate a multi-proxy sub-centennial-scale reconstruction of environmental change during the past two millennia from Itilliq Lake, Baffin Island, Arctic Canada. Our reconstruction arises from a finely subsectioned Pb-210- and C-14-dated surface sediment core and includes measures of organic matter (e.g., chlorophyll a; carbon-nitrogen ratio) and insect (Diptera: Chironomidae) assemblages. Within the past millennium, the least productive, and by inference coldest, conditions occurred ca. AD 1700-1850, late in the Little Ice Age. The 2000-yr sediment record also reveals an episode of reduced organic matter deposition during the 6th-7th century AD: combined with the few other records comparable in resolution that span this time interval from Baffin Island, we suggest that this cold episode was experienced regionally. A comparable cold climatic episode occurred in Alaska and western Canada at this time, suggesting that the first millennium AD cold climate anomaly may have occurred throughout the Arctic. Dramatic increases in aquatic biological productivity at multiple trophic levels are indicated by increased chlorophyll a concentrations since AD 1800 and chironomid concentrations since AD 1900, both of which have risen to levels unprecedented over the past 2000 yr.

AB  - The abundance of Orchidaceae on three calcareous grasslands is studied in relation to floristic composition, environmental and vegetational factors and plant traits (ecological and life forms). The aims are: (i) to identify a group of species that is significantly correlated with the abundance of Orchidaceae or with individual species of orchids on calcareous grasslands; (ii) to study the relationship between traits associated with habitat specialisation, community life forms and the abundance of orchids; (iii) to identify the main environmental and vegetational predictors of the abundance of orchids. A shortlist of species is found to be significantly correlated with the abundance of total orchids, Orchis pauciflora and O. morio. The life forms of the community species do not show any correlation with the orchids, with the exception of Orchis pauciflora, which tends to increase in communities rich in hemicryptophytes and poor in annual species. Analyses of Orchis morio seem to suggest that it has a high level of ecological tolerance. The most important predictors of the abundance of orchids are the substrate reaction (basic) and arid grassland with low herbaceous vegetation cover (i.e. high soil reaction and luminosity values, positive correlation with the cover of lichens and rockiness, negative correlation with tree cover and herbaceous layer). The least favourable sites were the least basic and most superficial and arid sites.

AB  - Gammarus minus is an important component of surface spring and cave ecosystems throughout Appalachia, and is a useful indicator of the hydrology and gene flow in freshwater communities. Gammarus minus populations occupying large cave passages (> 2 km) are usually troglomorphic, having reduced eyes, fewer ommatidia, larger body size, longer antennae, and reduced pigmentation relative to surface populations. We surveyed five cave stream and 10 surface spring populations for DNA sequence variation in the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS-1) genes with an aim towards characterizing phylogeographical structure and comparing the nature of genetic variation in cave vs. surface populations. Although standing variation at both loci was rather low within populations, a significant degree of divergence and spatial structuring of populations was observed. Levels of genetic variation within cave and spring populations differed substantially, with caves harbouring significantly less variation at the COI locus than surface springs. Codon usage bias was significantly lower in caves, indicating that cave streams harbour smaller and/or more recently colonized populations. Overall these data indicate limited gene flow among populations and suggest that the cave populations sampled in this study are prone to bottlenecks, possibly due to larger temperature fluctuations and more frequent incidence of drought conditions associated with these particular cave habitats.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) are ecologically mutualistic associations between Glorneromycota Phyllum fungi and the majority of plants, and could be very useful to achieve a sustainable agriculture. Among the benefits obtained are: increase in absorption of nutrients that are sparingly mobile in soils, such as P, Cu and Zn; better resistance to pathogens; water shortage endurance; and contribution to the formation of soil structure. Preliminary results of a project on commercial production of AM inocula to be used in acidic soils are presented, and the potential of AM for their application in tropical areas, particularly in Venezuela, is discussed. Some crucial steps in the AM-inoculum production are shown, as well as advantages of their application for lettuce and cassava production. Inocula of Glomus manihotis, Acaulospora lacunosa, Entrophospora colombiana, Scutellospora fulgida and S. heterogama were produced, and their effect tested both in the greenhouse and field. Higher values of lettuce dry weight were obtained with G. manihotis and S. fulgida, while S. heterogama led to poor results. With cassava the highest tuber production was obtained with G. manihotis, and with A. lacunosa it was indistinguishable from controls. Results indicate that although mycorrhizal symbiosis lacks taxonomic specificity, not all the AM are equivalent. An ethical and responsible management of AM, that takes into account the ecological conditions of the crop to be inoculated, is necessary for a successful application of this technology, so as to increase crop productivity with minimal environmental damage.

AB  - The structure dynamics of Mya arenaria beds in the Kandalaksha Bay of the White Sea was observed for 7-35 years. We aimed to identify the patterns of the spatial-temporal organization of the clam beds by studying recruitment, growth, and mortality. Gaps between successful bed recruitment could exceed 10 years. The results of our investigations mostly support the hypothesis that the fluctuations in the recruitment level were determined both by the intensity of intraspecific relations and by the spat survival during the first year of life. Group growth rate and average annual mortality rate of soft-shell clams were sensitive to environmental conditions, which means they can be used as an indicator of their changes. M. arenaria in the most silted biotopes was characterized by the slowest growth and the highest mortality. However, the internal heterogeneity of the beds in terms of the ecological properties of individuals was high. The variation of the individual growth rate within the beds was comparable with that of the group growth rate between the studied locations. M. arenaria mortality rate varied with age. It is assumed the clam survival depends mostly on the degree of protection, intraspecific relationships, and aging.

AB  - Kuroshio Current intrusion (KCI) has significant impacts on the oceanographic conditions and ecological processes of the Pacific-Asian marginal seas. Little is known to which extent and how, specifically, the microzooplankton community can be influenced through the intrusion. Here, we focused on ciliates that often dominated the microzooplankton community and investigated their communities using high-throughput sequencing of 18S rRNA gene transcripts in the northern South China Sea (NSCS), where the Kuroshio Current (KC) intrudes frequently. We first applied an isopycnal mixing model to assess the fractional contribution of the KC to the NSCS. The ciliate community presented a provincial distribution pattern corresponding to more and less Kuroshio-influenced stations. Structural equation modeling revealed a significant impact of the KCI on the community, while environmental variables had a marginal impact. KCI-sensitive OTUs were taxonomically diverse but mainly belonged to classes Spirotrichea and Phyllopharyngea, suggesting the existence of core ciliates responding to the KCI. KCI-sensitive OTUs were grouped into two network modules that showed contrasting abundance behavior with the KC fraction gradient, reflecting differential niches (i.e., winner and loser) in the ciliate community during the Kuroshio intrusion scenarios. Our study showed that the Kuroshio intrusion, rather than environmental control, was particularly detrimental to the oligotrophic microzooplankton community.

For this study, we assessed the ecological conditions and conservation value of upland habitats on six Wisconsin potato farms participating in an ecolabel program that requires the implementation of ecological management plans on non-crop lands. Our objective was to determine how natural and restorable-to-natural elements of the landscape related to adjacent intensively managed agricultural fields, in order to prioritize restoration targets and activities. We compared the plant species richness, floristic quality, and vegetation structure between three dominant upland habitats: woodlands, pine plantations, and weedy fields. We recorded 205 native plant species across all sites (approximately 25% of the regional native flora), indicating that habitat patches surrounding agricultural lands can offer substantial conservation value. Woodlands had the highest average conservation value (mean of 43.8 native species per site) and weedy fields the lowest (mean of 6.3 native species per site). Habitat edges were characterized by a higher frequency of both exotic and prairie-savanna indicator species, representing a unique assemblage of species warranting special consideration for conservation and restoration. We recommend that restoration efforts on this and similar agroecological systems prioritize woodland edges and weedy corners, where prescribed fire, native plant seeding, and invasive species removal could produce significant conservation gains while reducing agricultural weed colonization of cultivated fields.

AB  - There is growing interest in monitoring the level of pyrophosphate (PPi) in biological processes due to its significant roles in live organisms. In this paper, we described a Cu2+ ensemble based chemosensor (GN-Cu2+) for highly selective detection of PPi in an aqueous medium and live cells. The fluorescence silent ensemble, GN-Cu2+, was facilely prepared by complexing of the glucosamine-1,8-naphthalimide fluorescent ligand (GN) with paramagnetic Cu2+. The structure of GN was confirmed using H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR and high-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS) assays. The spectroscopic characteristics of GN-Cu2+ were verified in detail through fluorescence emission and UV-vis spectra titration. The decomplexation of GN-Cu2+ by PPi led to the liberation of the fluorescent ligand, GN, and thus the fluorescence was switched on. Spectroscopic studies revealed that GN-Cu2+ possesses excellent tolerance to various anions and even other phosphate series, such as AMP, ADP, ATP, and inorganic phosphate (Pi). The detection limit for PPi was calculated to be 1.0 mM. GN-Cu2+ features several advantages, such as high selectivity, reliability at physiological pH and low cytotoxicity. Intracellular fluorescence imaging measurements indicated that GN-Cu2+ is cell membrane permeable and has been successfully used for the detection of PPi in live MD-AMB-231 cells.

AB  - There is increasing interest in community-based environmental monitoring (CBEM) in Canada's North in response to the rising impacts of resource exploitation and climate change, and with increased recognition of indigenous knowledge. IMALIRIJIIT, meaning those who study water in Inuktitut, is a CBEM program involving science land camps, capacity-building workshops, and scientific data collection with the participation of youth, elders, local experts, and researchers. It was coinitiated by the Inuit community of Kangiqsualujjuaq (Nunavik, Quebec) and university researchers. This hands-on and landbased program aims to establish a sustainable environmental monitoring program of the George River, before the start of a rare earth elements (REEs) mining project in its upper watershed. The community was concerned about potential impacts on the river, as it is crucial to fishing, hunting, and gathering. The community therefore wanted its own independent and long-term environmental monitoring program to collect baseline data and promote local capacity-building. IMALIRIJIIT includes water-quality measurements, bio-indicators, contaminant and REE biomonitoring in traditional food, remote-sensing analysis of water-quality parameters and vegetation change at the watershed scale, as well as interactive mapping of traditional ecological. IMALIRIJIIT outcomes and challenges are discussed to identify conditions for successful implementation of CBEM and environmental stewardship.

AB  - Bryophytes have been used as indicators to evaluate atmospheric conditions in urban areas. However, further research is needed for their effective application. In this study, we focused on four metrics related to atmospheric problems in urban areas (nitrogen concentration [%N], isotope ratio of nitrogen [delta N-15], index of atmospheric purity [IAP], and richness of hygrophilic life-forms [RHL]). Then, using linear and generalized linear models, we examined the influence of land use on these four metrics in urban atmospheric environments, and evaluated the usefulness and limitation of them. The % N and delta N-15 models were well explained by the influence of nitrogen sources and/or sinks. The RHL models were significantly affected by urban and forest areas, reflecting urban heat islands. Surprisingly, TAP was higher in urban areas, but comparisons of TAP are not informative in areas with narrow pollution gradients. Land use strongly affected %N and delta N-15 models in smaller areas because of a point-source influence of nitrogen pollution, whereas RHL was strongly influenced by land use at larger scales owing to drought stress in urban settings. Correlations among the metrics revealed that severe drought stress tended to occur in areas with high nitrogen pollution. The nitrogen pollution sources were diverse, with no significant correlation of delta N-15 values with % N.

AB  - Understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic plasticity is crucial for predicting and managing climate change effects on wild plants and crops. Here, we combined crop modelling and quantitative genetics to study the genetic control of oil yield plasticity for multiple abiotic stresses in sunflower.
   First, we developed stress indicators to characterize 14 environments for three abiotic stresses (cold, drought and nitrogen) using the SUNFLO crop model and phenotypic variations of three commercial varieties. The computed plant stress indicators better explain yield variation than descriptors at the climatic or crop levels. In those environments, we observed oil yield of 317 sunflower hybrids and regressed it with three selected stress indicators. The slopes of cold stress norm reaction were used as plasticity phenotypes in the following genome-wide association study.
   Among the 65534 tested Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), we identified nine quantitative trait loci controlling oil yield plasticity to cold stress. Associated single nucleotide polymorphisms are localized in genes previously shown to be involved in cold stress responses: oligopeptide transporters, lipid transfer protein, cystatin, alternative oxidase or root development. This novel approach opens new perspectives to identify genomic regions involved in genotype-by-environment interaction of a complex traits to multiple stresses in realistic natural or agronomical conditions.

AB  - Knowledge regarding Ecosystem Services (ES) delivery and the socio-ecological factors that influence their proficiency is essential to allow cities to adopt policies that lead to resource-efficient planning and greater resilience. As one of the matrix elements of urban ecological structure, vegetation may play a major role in promoting ES proficiency through planting design. This research addresses the heterogeneity of ES delivered by the urban vegetation of Porto, a Portuguese city. A methodology is proposed to investigate associations between socioeconomic indicators and structural variables of the urban forest, and also which structural variables of the urban forest, if any, differ along a socioeconomic gradient. Our results reveal that before setting planning and management goals, it is crucial to understand local patterns of ES and their relationships with socioeconomic patterns, which can be affected by variables such as building age. This should be followed by the identification of structural variables of the urban forest that better explain the differences, in order to target these through planning and management goals. The conceptual framework adopted in this research can guide adaptation of our methodology to other cities, providing insights for planning and management suitable to site-specific conditions and directly usable by stakeholders.

AB  - The modeling of forecasting of the firm financial indicators performance by means of extrapolation method on the basis of polynomial function is carried out in the article. The authors empirically prove that the polynomial trend accurately reflects the dynamics of the firm's revenue with the seasonal nature of sales. For forecasting revenue, characterized by seasonal dynamics, the article developed an algorithm for constructing a model. For the purpose of approbation of the author's forecasting algorithm, the revenue forecast was modeled according to quarterly reports of Plant of Electrical Installation Products (PEIP) TatelectromontazhJSC for the period 2014 - 2016. Based on the obtained modeling results, the authors proved that modeling with the use of a polynomial trend provides a high-quality forecast of the dynamics of the firm's revenue in the conditions of a dynamically changing external environment. The proposed method for forecasting the revenue of PEIP TatelectromontazhJS Callows you taking into account the impact of changes in the macroeconomic environment. The results of logical modeling also confirm the reliability of the results of the constructed forecast model. Practical implementation of the proposed modeling methodology revealed the following features. First, to compile a forecast, it is necessary to accurately identify the duration of the season; Secondly, if there is enough data, the method gives a good approximation and can be effectively used in forecasting the sales volume with the seasonal component.

AB  - The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is one of the world's biodiversity hotspots, and is currently highly fragmented and disturbed due to human activities. Variation in environmental conditions in the Atlantic Forest can influence the distribution of species, which may show associations with some environmental features. Dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeinae) are insects that act in nutrient cycling via organic matter decomposition and have been used for monitoring environmental changes. The aim of this study is to identify associations between the spatial distribution of dung beetle species and Atlantic Forest structure. The spatial distribution of some dung beetle species was associated with structural forest features. The number of species among the sampling sites ranged widely, and few species were found in all remnant areas. Principal coordinates analysis indicated that species composition, abundance and biomass showed a spatially structured distribution, and these results were corroborated by permutational multivariate analysis of variance. The indicator value index and redundancy analysis showed an association of several dung beetle species with some explanatory environmental variables related to Atlantic Forest structure. This work demonstrated the existence of a spatially structured distribution of dung beetles, with significant associations between several species and forest structure in Atlantic Forest remnants from Southern Brazil.

AB  - The main aim of monitoring wells is to assess the conditions of groundwater quality in the aquifer system. An inappropriate distribution of sampling wells could produce insufficient or redundant data concerning groundwater quality. An optimal selection of representative monitoring well locations can be obtained by considering the natural and anthropogenic potential of pollution sources; the hydrogeological setting; and assessment of any existing data regarding monitoring networks. The main objective of this paper was to develop a new approach to identifying areas with a high risk of nitrate pollution for the Amol-Babol Plain, Iran. The indicator kriging method was applied to identify regions with a high probability of nitrate contamination using data obtained from 147 monitoring wells. The US-EPA DRASTIC method was then used in a GIS environment to assess groundwater vulnerability to nitrate contamination, and combined with data concerning the distribution of sources to produce a risk map. In the study area, around 3% of the total area has a strong probability of exceeding the nitrate threshold and a high-moderate risk of pollution, but is not covered adequately by sampling wells. However, the number of monitoring wells could be reduced in most parts of the study area to minimize redundant data and the cost of monitoring.

AB  - The aim of this research was to evaluate changes in soil quality associated with the tillage system applied with chosen parameters of soil biological properties. The long-term field experiments were located at a private farm in Rogow (Zamosc region, E Poland) on a silt soil and at the Experimental Station in Laskowice (Wroclaw region, S-W Poland) on a sandy loam soil. Soil samples were collected from 0-15 and 15-30 cm layers. Winter wheat was grown under traditional, reduced and no-tillage systems. The analyses included estimations of microbial biomass C and N content, microbial respiration rate, activity of dehydrogenase and arylsulfatase, and fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis. After eight years the effects of tillage on both soils were clearly noticed. In general, the less disturbing tillage systems enhanced the increase of soil biological activity by 15-40%, on average, than conventional tillage system. The significant correlations between microbial biomass, and/or enzyme activities with total organic C content indicate that concentration of organic C in soil environment plays an extremely important role in enhancing the stabilization and activity of soil microorganisms, and protection of an extracellular enzymes. The studied parameters of soil biological activity showed their sensitivity to tillage applied and may be considered as an useful indicators of soil quality in monitoring all conditions alter soil environment.

AB  - The objective of this study was to analyze variability, linear and spatial correlations of forage dry mass yield (FDM) and dry matter percentage (DM%) of Brachiaria decumbens with the bulk density (BD), gravimetric (GM) and volumetric (VM) moisture, mechanical resistance to penetration (RP) and organic matter content (OM), at depths 1 (0-0.10 m) and 2 (0.10-0.20 m), in a Red Latosol (Oxisol), in order to select an indicator of soil physical quality and identify possible causes of pasture degradation. The geostatistical grid was installed to collect soil and plant data, with 121 sampling points, over an area of 2.56 ha. The linear correlation between FDM x DM% and FDM x BD2 was low, but highly significant. Spatial correlations varied inversely and positively, respectively. Except for DM% and BD, at both depths, the other attributes showed average to high variability, indicating a heterogeneous environment. Thus, geostatistics emerges as an important tool in understanding the interactions in pasture ecosystems, in order to minimize possible causes of degradation and indicate better alternatives for soil-plant-animal management. The decrease in FDM and increased BD1 are indicators of physical degradation (compaction) of Red Latosol (Oxisol), particularly in the places with the highest concentration of animals and excessive trampling, in Cerrado conditions, in the municipality of Selviria, Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil.

AB  - In this study, the toxic effects of PCZ, a triazole fungicide present in aquatic environment, were studied in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, by an acute toxicity test. Compared to the control group, fish exposed to PCZ (96-h-LC50, 5.04 mg/l) showed significantly higher (P < 0.05) plasma NH3 and GLU concentration and the activities of plasma enzymes including CK, ALT, AST, LDH, but the TP content was not significantly different (P > 0.05). The oxidative stress indices (levels of LPO and CP) of brain and muscle in the experimental group were higher compared to the control group, especially for a significant change (P < 0.05) in the brain. SOD, CAT, GPx and GR activity in the brain of experimental groups was significantly lower (P < 0.05), however, an opposite tendency was found out in muscle. In addition, there are significant correlations between TBARS and CAT, TBARS and GPx, CP, and CAT, GR, and GPx in the fish brain. Thus, PCZ exposure changed the oxidative stress indices and plasma characteristics, and these changes may be used as potential bioindicators of the exposure and effect of PCZ in the controlled experiment. The use in monitoring of PCZ exposure under natural field conditions is possible, but it needs further investigations.

AB  - The Everglades Depth Estimation Network (EDEN) is an integrated network of real-time water-level monitoring gages and modeling methods that provides scientists and managers with current (2000-present) online water surface and water depth information for the freshwater domain of the Greater Everglades. This integrated system presents data on a 400-m square grid to assist in (1) large-scale field operations; (2) integration of hydrologic and ecologic responses; (3) supporting biological and ecological assessment of the implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP); and (4) assessing trophic-level responses to hydrodynamic changes in the Everglades.
   This paper investigates the radial basis function multiquadric method of interpolation to obtain a continuous freshwater surface across the entire Everglades using radio-transmitted data from a network of water-level gages managed by the US Geological Survey (USGS), the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD), and the Everglades National Park (ENP). Since the hydrological connection is interrupted by canals and levees across the study area, boundary conditions were simulated by linearly interpolating along those features and integrating the results together with the data from marsh stations to obtain a continuous water surface through multiquadric interpolation. The absolute cross-validation errors greater than 5 cm correlate well with the local outliers and the minimum distance between the closest stations within 2000-m radius, but seem to be independent of vegetation or season.

AB  - The influence of policies and education on fostering landscape-ecological awareness and environmental impact assessment among the population is being increasingly accepted by ecologists and scientists in general. A successful legislation to protect sustainable global, regional, and local climatic conditions largely depends on a well-balanced and transparent information policy, implementation strategy and a sound educational basis: Being aware of the fact that policy as decision making authority on its various administrative levels to a large extent influences and controls shaping and reshaping of our cultural landscapes and physical environment the main aim of this contribution is to analyse the (real) attitude of mind of communal politicians as to climate protection since through deliberately joining Climate Alliance in Austria they bound themselves to attribute actively to reaching the above goal.
   The method chosen for getting the necessary information is that of an open standardized interview because it, normally, allows a clear reality-related insight into the mental attitudes, political feelings and personal preferences of the 63 interviewees (mayors or responsible community officials) out of 74 Climate Alliance Communities in Styria, (i.e. appr. 12% of all communes). The analysis of the questionnaires reveals the general discrepancy between political declaration of intention and reality of everyday political life resulting from the fact that politicians are subject to reelection within relative short periods, too short for a far-sighted implementation of environmental goals.

AB  - Investigations carried out by us earlier in radiation-polluted ecosystems in the IO-km zone around the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (CNPP) and in various ecosystems of other regions of Ukraine allowed the assumption to be made that pink facultative methylotrophic bacteria (PFMB) of the genus Methylobacterium can be used as an indicator group to monitor radioactive pollution in the environment. In this connection, some of their peculiarities were studied in this work. It was established that mutants resistant to formaldehyde spontaneously occur in PFMB strains at a high rate. It was demonstrated that formaldehyde is not mutagenic for PFMB, The high occurrence rate of mutations in PFMB suggests the potentially high variability of these bacteria, and, therefore, their ability to adapt to extreme environmental conditions, It was shown that PFMB are resistant to UV irradiation. The sublethal dose for the strains tested was 200 J/m(2); the dose-survival curves had a shoulder not far from the origin, indicating rather efficient protection of DNA in these bacteria against UV rays. Doses of ionizing radiation of less than 0.6 kGy had no effect on the viability of the PFMB strains studied. For some of the strains, the sublethal dose was as high as 5-10 kGy. The obtained data testify to the presence in PFMB of active DNA reparation systems, which evidently promote their survival in radiation-polluted ecosystems near CNPP.

AB  - Dreissenid mussels, well-known invaders of the northern hemisphere, also constitute good biomonitors for freshwater quality assessment. Whereas the oldest, Dreissena polymorpha, is relatively well-known, the new invasive, Dreissena rostriformis bugensis, has been very little characterized. The aim of this study was to compare subcellular biomarker responses within these species, by taking into account inter- and intra-specific variability in biomarker responses during a multi-stress assessment. Indeed, due to local environmental conditions and genetic background, biomarker responses can be different between populations of a given species, not only between species. To evaluate these differential responses, we sampled mussels on two sites where they are both present in sympatry (plus another D. r. bugensis population), and we exposed these populations in laboratory to different stressors: thermal stress (12 or 17 degrees C), dietary stress (fed or unfed), contamination (nickel at 0, 20 and 500 mu g L-1) and exposure duration (0, 4 or 8 days). Results mainly evidenced strong inter-species and inter-population differences, underlining the need to discriminate correctly between the two species and to know well the populations used in biomonitoring. Results also evidenced thermal and food stress-related effects. The numerous data obtained during this multi-stress experiment also highlight the complexity of working on several stressors and analysing the associated results.

AB  - Host-associated bacterial communities on the skin act as the first line of defence against invading pathogens. Yet, for most natural systems, we lack a clear understanding of how temperature variability affects structure and composition of skin bacterial communities and, in turn, promotes or limits the colonization of opportunistic pathogens. Here, we examine how natural temperature fluctuations might be related to changes in skin bacterial diversity over time in three amphibian populations infected by the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Our focal host species (Eleutherodactylus coqui) is a direct-developing frog that has suffered declines at some populations in the last 20 years, while others have not experienced any changes. We quantified skin bacterial alpha-and beta-diversity at four sampling time points, a period encompassing two seasons and ample variation in natural infections and environmental conditions. Despite the different patterns of infection across populations, we detected an overall increase in bacterial diversity through time, characterized by the replacement of bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Increased frog body temperatures possibly allowed the colonization of bacteria as well as the recruitment of a subset of indicator OTUs, which could have promoted the observed changes in diversity patterns. Our results suggest that natural environmental fluctuations might be involved in creating opportunities for bacterial replacement, potentially attenuating pathogen transmission and thus contributing to host persistence in E. coqui populations.

AB  - This paper presents a typology of oak forest communities in SW Poland. Numerical classification and ordination methods were applied to distinguish the main vegetation units and to identify the environmental gradients affecting their composition. The ecological preferences of the studied communities were analysed using both measured variables and Ellenberg indicator values combined with a modified permutation test. Six vegetation units were distinguished: the association Viscario vulgaris-Quercetum petraeae mainly occurs on shallow, skeletal soils on nutrient-poor substrates in dry habitats, the association Luzulo luzuloidis-Quercetum petraeae in oligotrophic, dry-mesic habitats on moderately steep slopes and plateaux, the association Calamagrostio arundinaceae-Quercetum petraeae in mesic, oligo- and mesotrophic habitats on gentle slopes and plateaux, the community Galium verum-Quercus petraea on ultrabasic substrates of serpentine monadnocks, the association Sorbo torminalis-Quercetum in dry-mesic, mesotrophic habitats on steep, sunny slopes with initial, but relatively mineral-rich soils, and the association Melico pictae-Quercetum roboris in mesic, mesotrophic habitats with deep soils and mineral-rich substrates on gentle slopes and plateaux. The species composition of the syntaxa identified here is mainly influenced by the type of bedrock (particularly its base-richness), soil reaction and nutrients. If there are no differences in base-richness, the second most important factors are those associated with land relief (especially slope inclination) affecting light availability and moisture.

AB  - Protists in high-latitude lakes are constrained by cold temperatures, low inorganic nutrient supply and low light availability for much of the year due to ice cover and polar darkness. The lengthening ice-free periods in these freshwater ecosystems due to a warming climate results in increased light availability, but the overall impacts on phytoplankton and other protists are unknown. We experimentally investigated protist community responses to changes in light and prey availability in a dilution series in Ward Hunt Lake (latitude 83 degrees 05N), in the Canadian High Arctic. The communities at the end of the experiment were characterized using high-throughput pyrosequencing of the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene as a measure of taxonomic presence, and of 18S rRNA (from RNA converted to cDNA) as a taxon-specific indicator of community response. At the end of the experiment under low irradiance, cDNA reads were dominated by photosynthetic dinoflagellate genera, except at the greatest dilution where Cercozoa were most abundant. In contrast, the cDNA reads in the high light treatments were dominated by chrysophytes. Given the known trophic differences among dinoflagellates, cercozoans and chrysophytes, this apparent environmental selection implies that the rise in underwater irradiance associated with increasing ice-free conditions may affect microbial food web structure and function in polar lakes.

AB  - This paper describes the condition of forest ecosystems subjected to smelter pollution in the Kola peninsula. This assessment is based on the parameters of the biogeochemical cycle. The defoliation index was used to delimit three basic forest states: background, defoliating, sparse. Close to the smelter, due to expansion of the area not covered by vegetation, a fourth type of state, so-called "industrial deserts", has been observed. The concentrations of sulphur, copper and nickel in the precipitation in the forests generally declined with distance from the smelter. The defoliating forests are noted for the highest Ca, Mg, K concentrations in the summer precipitation. In sparse forests and industrial deserts a decrease in the Ca, Mg, K concentrations in the summer precipitation in comparison with the defoliating forests, despite the particle emissions, could be attributed to the reduction in forest biomass. The higher levels of soil and soil leachate carbon and acidity in the defoliating forests was due to higher litterfall and to the higher dissolution of fulvic acids by the acidic precipitation. This increase in organic matter levels affects soil cation exchange capacity and cation saturation. The pine trees demonstrated significant changes in the uptake of elements in all types of forests under pollution. Elevated levels of S, Ni, Cu and K and reduced levels of Mg, Mn and Zn were found in the needles of different age classes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

This leads to the determination of alternative choices in uncertainty conditions. In this paper the problem of an energetic and environmental requalification is analyzed. This kind of problem emphasizes the need for integration of economics and environment so a multicriteria approach is required; in particular the analytic hierarchy process is applied and a detailed sensitivity analysis is performed by using a software package, Expert Choice.

AB  - The present study was carried out in order to evaluate coliphage survival and their ability to replicate in tropical aquatic environments. Results showed that coliphages survived for extended periods of time, however, neither sewage isolates nor laboratory phage strains replicated in the environment, Neither one of the bacterial strains tested were permissive to phage replication under environmental; conditions, These observations indicate that replication of ''fecal coliphages'' does not occur in the tropical aquatic environment and suggest that either somatic or male-specific coliphages may be considered as potential indicators of fecal contamination in tropical aquatic environments.

AB  - Grindelia squarrosa (Pursh) Dunal. (Asteraceae) is a species with high invasiveness capacity in Ukraine, especially in the Steppe zone. The first data on the finding of escaped plants in Europe were recorded in the 40's of the last century. There were three naturalization centres in Ukraine, from where the species began to spread. In the secondary range in Ukraine, G. squarrosa is characterized by high levels of seed productivity and germination, variable modes of dispersal, wide ecological and coenotic amplitudes and CSR-strategy. The trend continues with the spread of the species in western, north-western and northern directions, and today more than 300 localities confirming this trend are already known. In the past 20 years, 92 new localities have been recorded. G. squarrosa is a transformer, widespread in the southern regions of the Steppe zone. As a result, new plant communities are formed. In general, this species is recorded in communities of five vegetation classes. In terms of ecological indicators, the optimum of the species is in the Steppe zone. It can be predicted that, due to the potential ability of the species to adapt and under the influence of climatic change, there is a higher probability that the species will spread in the future in northern and western directions. The condition for such an expansion is disturbance of meadow-steppe fringe xeromesic communities, with decreased coenotic competition.

AB  - An integrated ecosystem assessment (IEA) is a framework that organizes science to aid in the transition from traditional single-species management towards ecosystem-based management. Within the Gulf of Alaska, we started a small-scale IEA framework with active engagement of local stakeholders in the fishing community of Sitka. The initial step of this framework was the development of conceptual models. Here, we present a coproduced conceptual model using data gathered from participatory focus groups and a literature review of ecosystem attributes driving the abundance of sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria). We then assembled a qualitative network model (QNM), a mathematical representation of a conceptual system in which perturbations of individual components can be assessed for their qualitative effect. Simulations were conducted to test different biophysical scenarios, while evaluating tradeoffs across ecological and human dimension components. In contrast to large adult sablefish, juvenile and small adults responded similarly to most biophysical conditions. In general, human dimension components responded negatively to the tested scenarios. These results highlight the potential need for management strategies that differentiate between small and large adults, particularly if current sablefish stock assessment trends persist, such as the lack of older fish contributing to spawning biomass and uncertainties in estimates of year-class strength.

AB  - The compost obtained from sludge from wastewater treatment being an important source of macro and micronutrients, can be used in agriculture, because it reduces the production costs and improves the soil quality by providing nutrients and organic matter necessary for modern, ecological agriculture, in the conditions to improve the capacity to retain moisture in the soil, reducing the pressure on the environment generated by the storage of this waste. The compost used in the experiments is suitable for the use in agriculture without risks of environmental and soil pollution, in compliance with the rules in force. The obtained results show that by applying the compost produced at SEAU Mioveni, even in the variants where the highest doses (60 t/ ha) were applied, there are no significant changes in the chemical properties of the soil, especially the content of heavy metals. The values determined in the soil after applying the compost to all the experienced variants are far below the maximum allowed values for the concentrations of heavy metals in the soils. Also, analyzing the results regarding the risk of translocation of different chemical elements in the maize grains, it can be seen that, in general, all indicators register values well below the limits from which zootoxicity phenomena can occur. No increases in heavy metal contents in the maize grains are observed as the doses of compost used increase.

AB  - Herein, the development of biobased colorimetric pH porous indicators composed of a polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and microcrystalline cellulose functionalized with anthocyanins deriving from red cabbage, is presented. As revealed, the presence of 62.5%wt. of microcrystalline cellulose in the composite improves the stability of the porous system in aqueous environments, enhances the porosity, the pores' interconnectivity and reduces the pores' size that in turn significantly improves the responsiveness of the porous indicator to acidic or basic vapors. Specifically, the developed material shows distinct color change when subjected to acidic or basic vapors with a response 6 times faster compared to the indicator without any microcrystalline cellulose content. The color changes are reversible, making possible the use of the same indicator for several times. When the developed material was introduced in a package containing fresh prawns or chicken, its color was efficiently modified after one day of storage at ambient conditions demonstrating the possibility to be used as a food spoilage indicator. We prove by CIELab analysis that all color changes can be easily perceived visually, as the differences between the initial and the final color of the indicator after its interaction with the modified environment are well above the limit for visual perception. Therefore, the presented colorimetric porous indicator is suitable for multiple applications dealing with environmental protection and intelligent food packaging.

AB  - The economy of Singapore is characterised by a stable political environment, favourable business conditions and very well-developed infrastructure attracting foreign direct investment, being the driving force of the economy. It is highly dependent on export, as well as on the dynamic sectors of transport, business and financial services. Singapore's natural deep-sea ports and the geographical location at the crossroads of important shipping channels makes its trade a major economic sector, next to production and services. There are currently more than 5,000 maritime companies operating in Singapore, including over 130 international shipping groups, which constitute an important pillar for the international maritime transport hub. This article discusses Singapore's economic situation by analysing the dynamic GDP growth over the years 1960-2016 as well as other economic indicators achieved in 2004-2017, including the dynamics of foreign trade. This research covers the port's ownership and organisational structure, and its terminals have been reviewed in terms of their location, infrastructure and functions by taking into account the new generation terminal of the port of Tuas, currently under development. Over the years, the port has seen a steady increase in revenue from transhipment, which is confirmed by the dynamics of the container volume growth over the years 1972-2017, the transhipment volume over the years 2007-2018 and the number of container ships calling at the port along with their total capacity over the years 2007-2017, as elaborated in the article.

AB  - The removal of pathogens in irrigation water is of great importance in developing countries. Indeed, wastewater generally reused for agriculture in countries such as Cameroon is associated with health and environmental concerns. Recent studies have shown a strong disinfectant action of the natural coagulant from the seeds of Moringa oleifera. These findings have raised the question whether or not they can be used to polish effluents from natural systems treating faecal sludge. This paper deals with trials carried out to investigate the effect of these extracts in reducing faecal indicators from initially treated faecal sludge leachate. Bacteriological and physico-chemical parameters were used to determine the optimum conditions and assess treatment efficacy. Settling time of 3 h at a concentration of extracts between 267 and 333 mg/L permitted to reduce Escherichia coli and faecal coliforms from 4.85 to 3.92 ulog (86.74%) and from 5.75 to 4.87 ulog (86.39%) respectively with 1 ulog equal to 90%. For the same settling time and at a concentration of 333 mg/L, faecal streptococci were removed from 6.40 to 5.67 ulog (81.33%). This level of removal suggests that this natural coagulant cannot be used alone for disinfection of heavily loaded effluent. Further investigations are therefore still needed to fulfil the Cameroon and WHO guidelines for safe reuse in agriculture.

AB  - The Brazilian high altitude grasslands are important biodiversity centers that contribute to human well-being far outside their boundaries. They host many vulnerable species that may go locally extinct as a result of small changes in the environment. Performing studies on local species distribution is important to guide biodiversity conservation in these areas. This study aimed to characterize a high altitude grassland plant community along an elevation gradient in southeastern Brazil. Simple logistic regression, chi-squared tests and indicator species analysis were performed to investigate respectively whether: 1) the occurrence of botanical families was related to the altitude; 2) the richness and abundance of life forms varied along the gradient and 3) there were populations associated with specific altitudinal belts. Rubiaceae and Polygalaceae had higher occurrence probability at higher altitudes. Hemicryptophytes and chamaephytes seem to be the most favored life forms under local extreme conditions such as low temperatures and drought. The vegetation spectra varied significantly along the gradient, highlighting the major role of the turnover of habitats on a local scale for the underlying patterns of species distribution. Upper elevations encompassed a high number of indicator species, and further analyses of indicator species of high altitude grasslands will provide clues about adaptability of local species, important to consider in ecosystem management and conservation.

AB  - Theory of sexual selection states that males often develop showy signals, which reduce their survival but increase their reproductive success. During mate choice, these conspicuous signals can be honest indicators of individual quality conveying information about the signaler's physiological state. Sexually selected signals are influenced by many environmental factors; however, whether signals and physiological state are affected together is rarely studied. The ultraviolet-blue throat color of male Lacerta viridis is an intra- and intersexually selected signal connected to blood parasite infection and influenced by environmental factors. The aim of this study was to experimentally investigate how ecologically relevant environmental factors affect color signal intensity and key physiological traits parallel. During the mating season, we exposed 40 adult male lizards infected with blood parasites to food and basking time treatments in a full factorial design. We measured color, amount of reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs), hematocrit, immunocompetence, and blood parasite intensity before and after treatments. High basking time resulted in elevated immunocompetence coupled with increased ROMs. The high food treatment increased nuptial color brightness, but also increased ROMs and decreased immunocompetence. In summary, our study provides experimental evidence about environmentally induced parallel changes in an honest sexual signal and several quality-indicator physiological traits. We showed that available energy and time for high metabolism have independent and sometimes opposite effects on individual state.

AB  - The compositional properties of water-extractable organic nitrogen (WEON) affect its behavior in lake ecosystems. This work is the first comprehensive study using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) for the characterization of the molecular composition of WEON in lake sediment. In sediments of Erhai Lake in China, this study found complex WEON species, with N-containing compounds in the northern, central, and southern regions contributing 34.47%, 42.44%, and 40.6%, respectively, of total compounds. Additionally, a van Krevelen diagram revealed that lignin components were dominant in sediment WEON structures (68% of the total), suggesting terrestrial sources. Furthermore, this study applied ESI-FT-ICR-MS to the examination of the environmental processes of lake sediment WEON on a molecular level. The results indicated that sediment depth impacted WEON composition and geochemical processes. Compared with other ecosystems, the double bond equivalent (DBE) value was apparently lower in Erhai sediment, indicating the presence of relatively fewer and smaller aromatic compounds. In addition, the presence of a large number of N-containing species and abundant oxidized nitrogen functional compounds that were likely to biodegrade may have further increased the potential releasing risk of WEON from Erhai sediment under certain environmental conditions.

AB  - Characterization of biodiversity has been extensively used to confidently monitor and assess environmental status. Yet, visual morphology, traditionally and widely used for species identification in coastal and marine ecosystem communities, is tedious and entails limitations. Metabarcoding coupled with high-throughput sequencing (HTS) represents an alternative to rapidly, accurately, and cost-effectively analyze thousands of environmental samples simultaneously, and this method is increasingly used to characterize the metazoan taxonomic composition of a wide variety of environments. However, a comprehensive study benchmarking visual and metabarcoding-based taxonomic inferences that validates this technique for environmental monitoring is still lacking. Here, we compare taxonomic inferences of benthic macroinvertebrate samples of known taxonomic composition obtained using alternative metabarcoding protocols based on a combination of different DNA sources, barcodes of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene and amplification conditions. Our results highlight the influence of the metabarcoding protocol in the obtained taxonomic composition and suggest the better performance of an alternative 313 bp length barcode to the traditionally 658 bp length one used for metazoan metabarcoding. Additionally, we show that a biotic index inferred from the list of macroinvertebrate taxa obtained using DNA-based taxonomic assignments is comparable to that inferred using morphological identification. Thus, our analyses prove metabarcoding valid for environmental status assessment and will contribute to accelerating the implementation of this technique to regular monitoring programs.

AB  - Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is a ubiquitous flame retardant. A high-throughput immunoassay would allow for monitoring of human and environmental exposures as a part of risk assessment. Naturally occurring antibodies in camelids that are devoid of light chain, show great promise as an efficient tool in monitoring environmental contaminants, but they have been rarely used for small molecules. An alpaca was immunized with a TBBPA hapten coupled to thyroglobulin and a variable domain of heavy chain antibody (VHH) T3-15 highly selective for TBBPA was isolated from a phage displayed VHH library using heterologous coating antigens. Compared to the VHHs isolated using homologous antigens, VHH T3-15 had about a 10-fold improvement in sensitivity in an immunoassay. This assay, under the optimized conditions of 10% methanol in the assay buffer (pH 7.4), had an IC50 for TBBPA of 0.40 ng mL(-1) and negligible cross reactivity (<0.1%) with other tested analogues. After heating the VHH at 90 degrees C for 90 min about 20% of the affinity for coating antigen T3-BSA remained. The recoveries of TBBPA from spiked soil and fetal bovine serum samples ranged from 90.3% to 110.7% by ELISA and agreed well with a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method. We conclude the many advantages of VHH make them attractive for the development of immunoassays to small molecules.

AB  - Significant changes in plant phenology have been observed in response to increases in mean global temperatures. There are concerns that accelerated phenologies can negatively impact plant populations. However, the fitness consequence of changes in phenology in response to elevated temperature is not well understood, particularly under field conditions. We address this issue by exposing a set of recombinant inbred lines of Arabidopsis thaliana to a simulated global warming treatment in the field. We find that plants exposed to elevated temperatures flower earlier, as predicted by photothermal models. However, contrary to life-history trade-off expectations, they also flower at a larger vegetative size, suggesting that warming probably causes acceleration in vegetative development. Although warming increases mean fitness (fruit production) by ca. 25%, there is a significant genotype-by-environment interaction. Changes in fitness rank indicate that imminent climate change can cause populations to be maladapted in their new environment, if adaptive evolution is limited. Thus, changes in the genetic composition of populations are likely, depending on the species' generation time and the speed of temperature change. Interestingly, genotypes that show stronger phenological responses have higher fitness under elevated temperatures, suggesting that phenological sensitivity might be a good indicator of success under elevated temperature at the genotypic level as well as at the species level.

AB  - Individual variation in nutritional status has direct implications for fitness and thus is crucial in shaping patterns of life-history variation. Nevertheless, it is difficult to measure in natural populations, especially in humans. Here, we used longitudinal data on individual life-histories and annual crop yield variation collected from pre-industrial Finnish populations experiencing natural mortality and fertility to test the validity of first birth interval (FBI; time between marriage and first birth) as a surrogate measure of nutritional status. We evaluated whether women with different socio-economic groups differ in length of FBI, whether women of poorer socio-economic status and experiencing lower crop yields conceive slower following marriage, and whether shorter FBI is associated with higher lifetime breeding success. We found that poorer women had longer FBI and reduced probability of giving birth in months with low food availability, while the FBI of richer women was not affected by variation in food availability. Women with shorter FBI achieved higher lifetime breeding success and a faster reproductive rate. This is, to our knowledge, the first study to show a direct relationship between environmental conditions and speed of childbirth following marriage, highlighting the value of FBI as an indicator of nutritional status when direct data are lacking.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe the horizontal and vertical distributions of the zooplankton community structure in Karakaya Dam Lake. Rotifers were numerically dominant (81.89%) in the community during the study period; they were followed by Copepoda (10.32%) and Cladocera (7.79%). In the metalimnetic maximum oxygen zone between 5 and 10 m, cladocerans made up 70.1% of the total number of zooplankton in June and 27.3% of the total number of zooplankton in November. Oxygen values decreased at 10 and 15 m in September and November. While the abundance of rotifers and cladocerans decreased as well, cyclopoids increased (60% of total zooplankton at 10 m). Nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphate were at low concentrations. Relationships among zooplankton, abundance, and environmental factors were analyzed using the unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages (UPGMA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). UPGMA cluster analysis was used to illustrate unimodal species distribution by classification into 2 groups. Eigenvalues of axes clarified 42.7% of the cumulative variance in species data and 62.9% of the relationship between species and environmental data in the CCA. Many zooplankton species, rather tolerant to different environmental conditions, are good indicators for water quality and can be used for the biomonitoring of water ecosystems.

AB  - Unlike the global trend, the area of mangrove forest increased in the estuaries of Low Casamance and Sine-Saloum, Senegal, between 1986 and 2006. We collected multisource data (social and spatial) and applied a mix of qualitative and quantitative analytical methods to investigate the human-mangrove interactions during this period and to understand the causes of the observed increase. Our research demonstrates that, after several decades of drought, the wetter conditions of recent years were the main determinant for the increase in mangrove area. Results, however, suggest that the increase in mangrove forest is not per se an indicator of sustainability and that the increase likely masked a decline in the capacity of these mangrove forests to provide key ecosystem goods and services. The surveyed communities clearly perceived a diverging trend between the increase in area and the decline in the productivity of mangrove forests. The increasing and unregulated pressure on mangrove-based fisheries and unsustainable practices such as the extensive use of mangrove wood for fish smoking heavily contributed to the perception of the qualitative degradation in these mangroves. As local livelihoods are intimately linked to the productivity of these mangrove ecosystems, policy interventions should integrate the social and environmental components of mangroves to ensure the sustainability of these human-mangrove coupled systems.

AB  - The effects of 17 beta-estradiol (E-2) on fish became a matter of concern, since significant levels of this hormone were detected in the aquatic environment released mainly by domestic sewage treatment plants. In this perspective, the current study was focused on E, effects upon biotransformation, stress and genotoxic responses of juvenile Dicentrarchus labrax L. (sea bass). Fish were exposed to E, during 10 days in two different ways: water diluted (200 ng/L or 2000 ng/L) and i.p. injected (0.5 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg). A battery of biological responses was evaluated: liver ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and alanine transaminase (ALT) activities, liver somatic index (LSI), plasma cortisol, glucose and lactate concentrations, as well as erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA).
   All the exposure conditions induced endocrine disruption, measured as plasma cortisol decrease, and genotoxicity, measured as ENA increase. Thus, no differences were detected either between different exposure routes or tested concentrations. Concerning liver EROD and ALT activities, as well as plasma glucose and lactate concentrations no differences were found between treated and control groups. LSI was the only parameter to respond differently in the two exposure routes, as cnly E-2 water diluted induced a significant increase in this hepatic indicator. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Toxic dinoflagellates are important in natural ecosystems and are of global economic significance because of the impact of toxic blooms on aquaculture and human health. Both the organisms and the toxins they produce have potential for biotechnology applications. We investigated autotrophic growth of a toxic dinoflagellate, Alexandrium minutum, in three different high biomass culture systems, assessing growth, productivity and toxin production. The systems used were: aerated and non-aerated 2-L Erlenmeyer flasks; 0.5-L glass aerated tubes; and a 4-L laboratory scale alveolar panel photobioreactor. A range of indicators was used to assess growth in these systems. Alexandrium minutum grew well in all culture conditions investigated, with a marked increase in both biomass and productivity in response to aeration. The highest cell concentration (4.9 x 10(5) cells mL(-1)) and productivity (2.6 x 10(4) cells mL(-1) d(-1)) was achieved in the aerated glass culture tubes. Stable growth of A. minutum in the laboratory scale alveolar panel photobioreactor was maintained over a period of five months, with a maximum cell concentration of 3.3 x 10(5) cells mL(-1), a mean productivity of 1.4 x 10(4) cells mL(-1) d(-1), and toxin production of approximately 20 mug L(-1) d(-1) with weekly harvesting.

AB  - Periodic low-intensity fire (hazard-reduction burning) is a conspicuous management strategy in virtually all of Australia's dry forest communities where it is primarily used to reduce fuel levels with the intention of minimising the extent and severity of wildfires. Little is known, however, about the effects of its repeated use on natural ecosystems over long periods of time. This study investigated the long-term effects of frequent low-intensity fire on forest ant communities by comparing frequently burnt sites with long-unburnt control sites. While the richness of ant communities remained largely unchanged, the composition of assemblages differed substantially between treatments. Although frequent burning apparently resulted in the loss of a substantial number of species, the overall richness of frequently burnt areas was maintained by the addition of species not present on unburnt sites. These changes in species composition were accompanied by major changes in community organisation (structure) and were considered to be a response to altered habitat conditions, particularly litter biomass, vegetation structure and patterns of insolation at ground level. Appropriate fire prescriptions could therefore be applied to manipulate these habitat elements at a landscape scale to meet both management and conservation goals. A comparison of pitfall trapping and litter extraction techniques revealed the importance of a composite sampling strategy, with 22% of ant species detected only by litter extraction.

We discuss the predominance of Pinus halepensis in relation to the other woody species. Taking into account the environmental conditions (availability of materials) and the bio-geographical context, the Villena Corridor is a frontier territory where floral and climatic influences of the Spanish Meseta and of the Iberian Southeast converge. Comparison with other anthracological and palynological studies allow its to propose some thoughts on palaeoecological changes in the Iberian Southeast.

AB  - Phenanthrene is one of the most common Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the marine environment. It has high lipoafinity and environmental persistence and tends to accumulate in benthic ecosystems. Exposure to phenanthrene can have severe impacts on a wide range of marine organisms, from nematodes to fish. These effects can be exacerbated with concurrent warming associated with climate change. In this study we in-vestigated the response of free-living nematode populations of the species Diplolaimelloides delyi following exposure to different phenanthrene concentrations under normal and increased temperature conditions (from 25 degrees C up to 35 degrees C). Phenanthrene was toxic to D. delyi, causing a decrease in population growth (at concentrations >_1 mu g ml(-1)) and negatively affecting their development times and reproduction (at concentrations >_2.5 mu g ml(-1)). The observed effects intensified with increasing temperature, leading to further reduced development and population growth rate, arrested reproduction, and even mortality in 100% of the populations exposed to phenanthrene concentrations over 5 mu g ml(-1) at the highest temperature used (30 degrees C). Thermal induced toxicity effects on marine populations can be significant, and current climate change and warming may have substantial implications for marine food webs and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Microbial biomass is a driving force in the dynamics of soil organic matter, and microbial activity is an indicator of soil quality in agroecosystems, reflecting changes in management practices and environmental conditions. We evaluated the effect of monoculture and intercropped winter cover crops on soil chemical attributes, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), basal respiration (BR), metabolic quotient (qCO(2)), urease, beta-glucosidase, and fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis activity, as well as onion yield in a no-tillage system. Soil is a Typic Humudept, and treatments were control with spontaneous vegetation, barley, rye, oilseed radish (OR), OR + rye, and OR + barley. The soil was sampled (0-10 cm) five times between June and Deceinber. There were no differences among treatments for MBC and BR, and the highest values for those attributes occurred in June, when cover plants were in their initial stage. Although, qCO(2) was not affected by any treatment, it varied among sampling periods, ranging from 0.62 to 10 mu g C-CO2 mg(-1) MBC h(-1), indicating a low- or no stress environment. Cover crops had little influence on enzyme activity, but FDA was lowered in areas with single crops of barley and rye. Average onion yield in cover crops treatments was 13.01 (Mg ha(-1)), 30-40% higher than in the control treatment.

AB  - The concentration of copper ion (Cu2+) in drinking water is closely related to the water quality and human health. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a novel, efficient and selective method for the detection of Cu2+ in drinking water. In this work, natural food pigment-red beet pigment was selected as a colorimetric indicator for the detection of Cu2+, which possessed a bright color, excellent water solubility and safety. Under alkaline condition, red beet pigment reacted selectively with Cu2+ by redox reaction and chelation, resulting in a color change from purple to orange-red. After analyzing the blue (B) value of the red beet pigment solution, it could be found that there was a good linear relationship between B value and the concentration of Cu2+ in the range of 4-20 mu M, with a detection limit of 0.84 mu M. In addition, a smart phone application based on Android system was developed for visual detection of Cu2+ by identifying B value of the colorimetric probe solution. The feasibility of this method was successfully verified in the detection of Cu2+ in drinking water by the standard-addition method, reflecting its great potential of practical application in environment monitoring and food security controlling. The method provides a new insight for rapid detection of heavy metal ions using nature pigments.

AB  - A key challenge of landscape planning and management is coping with multiple ecosystem service (ES) potentials and needs in complex social-ecological systems such as urban regions. However, few studies have analyzed both the supply and demand sides of ES bundles, i.e., sets of associated ES that repeatedly appear together across time or space. This paper advances a framework to identify, map and assess ES bundles from a supply-demand approach to informlandscape planning and management. The framework is applied to the Barcelona metropolitan region, Spain, covering five ES and using eleven spatial indicators. Each indicator was quantified and mapped at the municipal level (n = 164) combining different proxy-and process-based models. Our results show significant associations among ES, both at the supply and demand sides. Further, we identified five distinct ES supply-demand bundle types and characterized them based on their specific ES relationships and their main underlying social-ecological conditions. From our findings, we contend that land sharing strategies should be prioritized in urban and agricultural areas to increase landscape multifunctionality while assuring the conservation of large periurban forest areas that are critical for delivering a wide range of local ES highly demanded by the urban population.

AB  - Since the discovery of major reserves in the Israeli exclusive economic zone (EEZ) 6 years ago, exploration and drilling for natural gas and oil have proceeded at an accelerated pace. As part of the licensing procedure for drilling, an environmental impact assessment and an emergency response plan must be presented to the authorities, which include several prespecified oil spill simulations. In this study, the MEDSLIK oil spill model has been applied for this purpose. The model accounts for time-dependent advection, dispersion, and physiochemical weathering of the surface slick. It is driven by currents produced by high-resolution dynamic downscaling of ocean reanalysis data and winds extracted from global atmospheric analyses. Worst case scenarios based on 30-day well blowouts under four sets of environmental conditions were simulated for wells located at 140, 70, and 20 km off the coast of central Israel. For the well furthest from the coast, the amount of oil remaining in the surface slick always exceeds the amount deposited on the coast. For the mid-distance well, the cases were evenly split. For the well closest to the coast, coastal deposition always exceeds the oil remaining in the slick. Additional simulations with the wind switched off helped highlight the importance of the wind in evaporation of the oil and in transporting the slick toward the southeastern coast.

AB  - As concern about resource conservation has grown, research efforts have increased to develop materials out of rapidly renewable constituents, to assess their life cycle environmental impacts, and to predict their service-life performance. Assessing time-dependent material property deterioration, often a concern for polymers and their composites, is essential to evaluating the viability of novel materials to serve as lower environmental impact replacements for conventional materials. However, research in methods to combine environmental impacts from production and material deterioration is limited. In this research, a durability-based service-life model was used to assess and incorporate composite deterioration into life cycle environmental impact analyses. The inclusion of composite deterioration under differing temperature and moisture conditions in these analyses typically resulted in higher volumes of material needed to serve the desired function compared to volumes needed to satisfy initial design requirements, leading to a change in environmental impact. While this concept falls in line with the classic definition of material efficiency, namely improving mass yield for materials, the results of the life cycle impact assessment showed with certain process modifications lower environmental impacts could be achieved even in cases where more material was being used. These findings indicate that design decisions must account for application-specific requirements and consider environmental impacts concurrently with material deterioration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Arctic sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis is considered to be a potential indicator species for assessing aquatic environmental conditions in the polar region. To develop a gene resource for the Arctic sea urchin, we sequenced S. droebachiensis cDNAs using a GS-20 sequencer and obtained expressed sequence tags information. In the assembly stage, 31,526 transcripts were obtained and showed a 32 % hit rate in the GenBank non-redundant database with 9,995 unigenes. Of the transcripts obtained in this species, we found several stress- and cellular defense-related genes (antioxidant-related genes and genes from the heat shock protein family) that are useful for the monitoring of pollutant-triggered stress responses at the molecular level. To validate the usefulness of these potential biomarker genes, we analyzed the transcript profiles of selected genes in response to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) mixtures (Aroclor 1254) for 48 h. PCB contamination is a present-day threat to the health of individual organisms and ecosystems in the polar region. We showed that 11 of 14 genes responded to PCB treatment at transcriptional levels, with the most dramatic upregulation observed in the hsp70.5 gene. In this paper, we summarize the expressed cDNA information and discuss its potential use in ecotoxicological genomic studies on PCB exposure.

AB  - Protected areas in the Alps are dissected by high-traffic roads for tourist access and transit. Road construction leaves disturbed areas with open soil, which may serve as starting points for the invasion of alien plants or ruderal lowland plants into the protected mountain habitats. In the 1960s, a transit road was widened in the Swiss National Park (SNP) and disturbed roadsides were sown with mixtures of grassland species. Roadside development and vegetation dynamics in the adjacent subalpine pine (Pinus mugo) forest were monitored in permanent plots from 1969 till 2010. Over the 42-year monitoring period, the sown species disappeared progressively and were replaced by species from naturally disturbed areas as well as by forest species. A standard seed mixture and native seeds introduced with local hay developed similarly. Sown species did not expand into the natural habitats and no alien species colonized the roadsides, despite the long-term persistence of open soil. The impact of roadsides on the local flora was therefore minimal. Ecological indicator values suggest that the development of roadsides in the SNP was determined by harsh conditions resulting from a continental subalpine climate and poorly developed soils on dolomite. Therefore, the developments observed in the SNP and the proposed low impact of roadsides on the natural vegetation may not hold for other Alpine regions with different geology and a more oceanic climate.

AB  - The recognition of Mesolithic impacts in mid Holocene pollen diagrams of the British Isles has led to the development of models describing sophisticated woodland management, particularly through the use of fire, by Mesolithic populations. However, the significance of human agency in creating mid Holocene woodland disturbances is unclear, with natural and human-induced clearings arguably indistinguishable in the pollen record. Analysis of non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs) should aid the identification of events and processes occurring within these woodland disturbances and provide more precise palaeoecological data. In this paper we present pollen, charcoal and NPP analyses from a potentially critical location in the Mesolithic impacts debate. NPP types aid significantly in the reconstructions, suggesting periods of dead wood, grazing, local burning and wetter ground conditions. The results indicate that between 7700 and 6800 cal b.p., a predominantly wooded environment periodically gave way to phases of more open woodland, with inconsistent evidence for animal grazing. From 6800 cal b.p., a phase of open woodland associated with high charcoal concentrations and indicators of grazing was observed. This probably represents the deliberate firing of vegetation to improve grazing and browse resources, although it remains unclear whether fire was responsible for initially creating the woodland opening, or if it was part of an opportunistic use of naturally occurring woodland clearings.

AB  - In many vertebrates and invertebrates, individuals reared in isolation show biological modifications compared with those reared in groups of two of more. The spider mite Tetranychus urticae is characterised by a communal organization and displays some forms of cooperative behaviour (aggregation and common web spinning). To evaluate the potential fitness cost or gain of group living, we investigated the effect of being in group on life history parameters (silk production, fecundity, death rate, feeding rate). In this respect, virgin single females and grouped females (two to six individuals) were compared every day for 5 days. Grouped mites produced significantly more web/mite per day (since the second day of experiment) and more eggs/mite per day (since the fourth day of experiment) than single mites. Moreover, single mites had a higher death rate than mites living in groups. However, no difference was found concerning feeding rate. We assume that mites could benefit from the web production of other individuals and invested resources in other activities such as egg production. We showed that these group effects already exist in small groups. In natural conditions with a higher group size, the impact of group living might be stronger for the dynamics of T. urticae populations and the colony foundation.

AB  - Densely populated cities can experience high concentrations of traffic-derived pollutants, with oxides of nitrogen and ammonia contributing significantly to the overall nitrogen (N) budget of urban ecosystems. This study investigated changes in the biochemistry of in situ Calluna vulgaris plants to detect signals of N deposition across an urban rural gradient from central London to rural Surrey, UK. Foliar N concentrations and delta(15)N signatures were higher, and C/N ratios lower, in urban areas receiving the highest rates of N deposition. Plant phosphorus (P) concentrations were also highest in these areas, suggesting that elevated rates of N deposition are unlikely to result in progressive P-limitation in urban habitats. Free amino acid concentrations were positively related to N deposition for asparagine, glutamine, glycine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, leucine and lysine. Overall, relationships between tissue chemistry and N deposition were similar for oxidised, reduced and total N. although the strength of relationships varied with the different biochemical indicators. The results of this study indicate that current rates of N deposition are having substantial effects on plant biochemistry in urban areas, with likely implications for the biodiversity and functioning of urban ecosystems.

AB  - The integrated analysis for physical, chemical and biological parameters in soil management systems is an important tool to check the sustainability of agroecosystems, allowing to identify the main critical constraints that impair the best management conditions. This approach has been used to evaluate production of tomato in organic and conventional systems in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, comparing greenhouse and field cultivation. In both cases, native forest or permanent pasture was taken as basal reference in each of the evaluated rural establishments. The results from organic systems in Serra Negra showed higher water holding capacity (CC) and lower clay dispersion (microaggregation increase) than the conventional system, indicating more stabilized soil aggregates. In conventional systems higher electrical conductivity was observed, which can be indicative of high soluble salt availability for the plants. The principal component analysis (PCA) for the data collected in Serra Negra allowed to conclude that there is greater similarity between organic systems and basal references, considering most of the biological and chemical indicators. It was also observed that organic C, total N, polysaccharides, fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis (FDA) and dehydrogenase activity were positively related to organic systems, natural forest (M 1) and pasture (P 1), whereas V%, pH, Mn, Mg, Ca and soil particle dispersion ratio were inversely related to those systems. The model of PCA for the data collected in Araraquara efficiently separated the cultivated areas from their respective native forests, based on biological indicators.

AB  - To better understand past aquatic ecosystems and their development, a 99-cm sediment core was extracted from a shrubtundra lake in northern Quebec. Fossil chironomids, diatoms and pollen were analysed at 1.0-cm intervals. Several inference models based on chironomids and diatoms were used to reconstruct lake water conditions (surface water temperature, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), alkalinity, and water colour) for the last 6700 cal. yr. Reconstructed water temperatures varied between 10.3 and 17.6 degreesC, with a cooling trend since at least 1500 cal. yr BP. DOC concentrations increased with the establishment of terrestrial vegetation in the lake's catchment and decreased with the onset of the late Holocene cooling trend. Lake water alkalinity was higher during the lake's early history and decreased throughout its postglacial development, whereas water colour remained at fairly low levels throughout the entire record. Our results suggest that aquatic organisms directly influenced by temperature (chironomids) reacted most rapidly to climatic changes, whereas terrestrial vegetation (pollen) reacted with a slight lag. The vegetation succession in the catchment had subsequent impacts on the composition of runoff waters, and hence on other aquatic organisms (diatoms). (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A growing number of studies point to the depletion of flora and fauna along rivers of the Brazilian Amazon but the status of wild resources over large areas in Western Amazonia remains poorly known. In this paper we report on findings from the Peruvian Amazon based on the first large-scale community survey that uses local ecological knowledge to assess the presence of indicator species and expected harvest yields of game, fish and timber along four major rivers. Our findings from nearly 700 communities suggest that the forest and lakes near riverine communities have been impoverished over the past 50 years, especially of vulnerable species of high commercial value. A zone of species depletion is detected around the two major regional cities of Iquitos and Pucallpa as well as around an important oil town. Local extirpations are common though some recovery is noted for specific fish and timber species. Expected yields are falling and evidence is found for harvesting of previously non-preferred species. Newer communities face lower initial availability of wild resources and forest impoverishment is driven by market demand over subsistence needs. Our findings illustrate the value of drawing on local ecological knowledge and the importance of considering historical baseline conditions in assessments of the fate of wild resources in tropical forests.

AB  - The status of fisheries requires establishing and evaluating benchmarks derived from unfished ecosystems. Habitats, environmental conditions, properties of the fish communities and management systems could potentially influence the variability surrounding benchmarks. Consequently, eighteen variables including habitat, number of species, life histories, thermal and productivity environments were tested for influences on reef fish biomass in 62 reefs within old high compliance closures along the east African coastline. Biomass and weighted life history characteristics were classified and described for total, fishable, target and non-target groups. Benchmark biomass fell within a 95% confidence interval of similar to 1,030-1,250kg/ha and equally distributed among target and non-target groups. While some relationships were statistically significant, most were weak, poorly sampled (ocean exposed reefs), had uncertain relationships with biomass (number of species), or the explained variation was bounded within the above confidence intervals (habitat and environment). Therefore, a regional unfished biomass benchmark (B-0) of 1,150 and 560kg/ha is recommended for total and target biomasses, respectively. Weighted life history metrics indicate that the target had slower life histories than the non-target fish communities. Consequently, they will be fished unsustainably if yield recommendations are derived from the total, resilient or non-target fish life history metrics. The intrinsic rates of increase (r) and target categorization of biomass were the most influential metrics in estimating yields.

AB  - The integration of ecosystem services and human well-being into local management and planning remains a challenge in mountain-basin areas. We described the spatial distribution of 8 ecosystem services and analyzed tradeoffs and synergies among them in 2005-2015 based on spatial data and statistical data. Using data from a questionnaire survey, we identified the perception of ecosystem services and assessed subjective well-being. We integrated ecosystem services and subjective well-being using a cluster analysis across townships in the Huailai mountain-basin area, located in a farming-pastoral area of China. Within the mountain-basin area, regulating services (carbon sequestration and soil retention), habitat quality and forest recreation were most represented in mountain areas, which had low levels of well-being. High provisioning services generally coincided with high well-being. From the perspectives of stakeholders, two provisioning services (crop and fruit) were perceived as important to well-being but not vulnerable, and four services (soil fertility, nature appreciation, carbon sequestration and fresh water) were critical. Five indicators in well-being (housing conditions, the public health system, natural hazard control, educational freedom and job freedom) were identified as important but not satisfied. Based on our findings, we developed a framework for integrating ecosystem services and human well-being into management practices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many water bodies, especially those adjacent to aquaculture and livestock breeding areas, are contaminated by both antibiotics and transition metals. However, the effects of the interaction between antibiotics and transition metals on the environmental behavior and the ecotoxicology of antibiotics are largely unknown. We hypothesized that antibiotics may coordinately bind with metal ions, and this complexation may affect the environmental photochemical behavior of antibiotics. We took ciprofloxacin (CIP) and Cu(II) as a case, and employed simulated sunlight experiments and density functional theory calculations to investigate the underlying reaction mechanisms. The results showed that monovalent cationic ciprofloxacin (H2CIP+) that is predominant in the normal pH range (6-9) of surface waters can chelate with hydrated Cu(II) to form [Cu(H2CIP)(H2O)(4)](3+). Compared with H2CIP+, [Cu(H2CIP)(H2O)(4)](3+) has different molecular orbitals, and atomic charge distribution. As a result, [Cu(H2CIP)(H2O)(4)](3+) showed dissimilar light absorption properties, slower direct photolytic rates, lower O-1(2) generation ability and weaker reactivity towards O-1(2). Due to the Cu(II) complexation, the apparent photodegradation of H2CIP+ was inhibited, and the photolytic pathways and product distribution were altered. This study implies that for an accurate ecological risk assessment of antibiotics under transition metal co-contamination conditions, the effects of metal complexation should be considered.

AB  - The ecosystems of alpine snowbed habitats are reviewed with emphasis on ecosystem functioning and capability to adapt to current and predicted global change. Snowbeds form in topographic depressions that accumulate large amounts of snow during the winter months, and the final snowmelt does not occur until late in the growing season. Many species preferentially grow in snowbed habitats and some of these are even restricted to these habitats. In this review we identify several ecosystem services which snowbeds provide to the alpine landscape. For instance, snowbeds provide a steady water and nutrient supply to adjacent plant communities and offer newly emerged high-quality food for herbivores late in the growing season. We also propose that alpine snowbeds are much more productive than earlier thought, especially when the very short growing season and often high grazing pressure are taken fully into account. Furthermore, we propose that bryophytes and graminoids (grasses, sedges, and rushes) probably will be most negatively impacted by global change, and the snowbed plant communities will be invaded by species from adjacent plant communities, especially by shrubs and boreal species. As snowbed plants have special growth conditions, their sensitivity and ability to respond rapidly to changes in annual snowfall patterns make snowbed communities particularly vulnerable in a warmer climate, and thereby sensitive indicators of global change.

AB  - The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) defines a framework for assessing water bodies in Europe in the future. The conditions in the Directive impose a strong demand for "new" assessment systems. The AQEM project developed an assessment system for European streams using macroinvertebrates. Almost 900 samples were taken in about 400 streams covering 29 stream types distributed over eight countries. The role of the Oligochaeta within this European database was analysed. Almost half a million specimens of oligochaetes were collected in 772 samples. Eight families, 41 genera and 69 species were recorded, although identification emphasised the families Tubificidae and Naididae. Three countries identified oligochaetes to species level, most others restricted their identifications to easy identifiable taxa. Numbers of specimens, species, genera and families differed strongly between the countries due to method, although standardised, and taxonomic knowledge. About 50% of all collected oligochaete taxa had assigned biological and ecological indicator values for metric calculation in the AQEM assessment system. A further refinement of this indication list as well as increased coverage of oligochaete taxa was advised. Weighted averaging was used to evaluate the relation between oligochaete distribution and ecological quality class. It was concluded that when higher taxonomic levels are used in assessment, the quality evaluation results become biased. Furthermore, oligochaetes can tell us much more about the ecological status of streams than is commonly assumed. Differences in ecological optima among Limnodrilus udekemianus, Ilyodrilus templetoni, Aulodrilus pluriseta, Nais communis, and Spirosperma ferox are shown.

AB  - This study investigated the distribution of phytolith assemblages in China from surface soil samples at 243 sites along significant ecological and climatic gradients to develop transfer functions for quantitative reconstruction of palaeoenvironment. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) were used to determine the main environmental variables influencing phytolith distributions. The results reveal that mean annual precipitation (MAP) is the dominant variable controlling the spatial distribution of phytoliths, which accounts for 39% of the total variance. Mean annual temperature (MAT), relative humidity (Humi), and annual evaporation (VAP) are another three significant variables, accounting for 6%, 10%, and 5%, respectively, of the total variance in phytolith distributions. Transfer functions,. based on weighted averaging plus partial least squares (WA-PLS), were developed for MAP (R--boot(2) = 0.90, root-mean-square-error of prediction (RMSEP) = 148 mm), MAT (R--boot(2) = 0.84, RMSEP = 2.52 degrees C), Humi (R--boot(2) = 0.75, RMSEP = 6.36%) and VAP (R--boot(2) =0.59, RMSEP=327mm). Overall, our results confirm that phytoliths can provide reliable and robust estimates of MAP, MAT, Humi and VAP Thus, WA-PLS is a robust calibration method for quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstruction based on phytolith data.

AB  - Monitoring biodiversity presents the challenge of informing complex aspects of biological systems with consistent, repeatable, data-based indicators. The present paper does not address directly the selection of indicators for rangeland biodiversity, but rather presents essential aspects and examples of monitoring systems that address natural resource questions at comparable scales. In general, concepts of landscape quality, such as range condition, conservation value, health and biodiversity, are descriptive rather than quantitative and are either ill-defined or multiply defined. Assessment of the status of such indicators involves value systems, as well as process understanding at a range of scales for which data are often unavailable. Effective monitoring systems, in contrast, require repeated quantitative data at suitable temporal density and spatial scale, as well as appropriate methods and a conceptual framework to simplify and interpret these data. In recent years, broad-scale operational monitoring systems for land and vegetation have been developed in Australia based on sequences of satellite data, digital elevation models, ground information and appropriate statistical methods. These same datasets have been used to inform landscape qualities over broad areas; examples are given of the production of salinity risk maps and conservation management zones based on fragmentation patterns. These results have been achieved as a partnership between ecologists, resource scientists and statisticians and illustrate how surrogates for integrated concepts such as biodiversity can be derived from available data.

AB  - A toxicant-dosed metapopulation model was used to explore the range of possible dynamics of populations in contaminated field sites. A single species metapopulation model was developed that is discrete, deterministic, and incorporates dose-response curves and biotic growth rates to describe the effects of contamination on a metapopulation. The distribution of the chemical contamination is assumed limited to one patch and contagious within that patch. Both persistent and degradable toxicants were modeled. Five principal conclusions resulted from our simulation studies. (1)Mortality in one subpopulation has ecologically significant effects on nondosed subpopulations. This hypothesis we term "action at a distance" because no direct contact with a toxicant has occurred except in the dosed patch. (2) Because uncontaminated sites connected to the contaminated site by migration of the biota are affected, these uncontaminated sites cannot be reference sites. (3) The arrangement of the patches is critical to the dynamics of the system and the overall impact of a toxicant. (4) Due to the contagious distribution of the toxicant and the stochastic function describing exposure effect, multiple discrete outcomes often are possible from the same initial conditions. These outcomes can range from extinction to the reaching of the carrying capacity for a patch. (5) If sufficient cleanup is not possible, it may be necessary to isolate the contaminated patch, allowing the formerly connected patches to regain more typical population dynamics.

Changes in the composition of the aquatic fauna (i.e. rotifers, nematodes and tardigrades) were correlated with SO2 concentrations in a fumigation experiment and to the air quality of 12 sites in the exposure experiments. Moss-growing tiles were transferred in groups of four either to fumigation chambers or to exposure sites. Three levels of SO2 (0.025, 0.075 and 0.225 ppm) plus untreated control mosses were used in the fumigation experiments that lasted IX months. The highest SO2 level caused significant reduction in the numbers of several nematode and tardigrade species. At intermediate concentrations of SO2, both positive and negative responses to fumigation were observed by individual species. Fumigation with SO2 significantly decreased pH in the moss cushions. The final response of the transplanted fauna in the exposure experiments resulted from an interaction of air pollutants and various environmental variables. Some exposure sites were ''without'' any observed effects whereas others had severe effects, which include the disappearance of many species. Large differences in susceptibility to the different exposure conditions were observed. Populations of Chiloplectus cf. andrassyi and Paratripyla intermedia decreased with increasing pollution, whereas populations of Macrobiotus pel similis increased. These species are considered suitable indicators of air pollution.

AB  - Subsurface agricultural irrigation drainage is a wastewater with the potential to severely impact wetlands and wildlife populations. Widespread poisoning of migratory birds by drainwater contaminants has occurred in the western United States and waterfowl populations are threatened in the Pacific and Central flyways. Irrigated agriculture could produce subsurface drainage and wildlife problems in other countries because several. of the factors contributing to toxic drainwater in the western U.S.A. (e.g. marine sedimentary basins with soils containing elevated concentrations of trace elements such as selenium and molybdenum; alkaline conditions that favor the formation of water-soluble forms of trace elements; soil salinization problems that require the use of irrigation to hush away excess salts), also occur in other arid regions of the world.
   Proposed agricultural irrigation projects should undergo a technical review to assess water demand and supply relationships, and to determine the potential for drainage problems. Environmental assessments should be made at existing irrigation projects to determine if subsurface drainage is present or could occur in the future. Anticipating and evaluating potential problems will allow changes to be made in irrigation practices for the benefit of agriculture and wildlife.
   The agricultural demands on water have reduced freshwater flows and affected the quantity and quality of wetlands throughout the world for decades. Subsurface irrigation drainage is yet another threat to the precarious existence of many wildlife populations.

AB  - Seventy-five types of ichnofossils documented during a four-year reconnaissance study in the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation demonstrate that highly diverse and abundant plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates occur throughout most of the Morrison or equivalent strata. Invertebrate ichnofossils, preserving the most environmentally and climatically sensitive in situ behavior of Morrison organisms, are in nearly all outcrops. Terrestrial ichnofossils record biotic processes in soil formation, indicating soil moisture and water-table levels. Freshwater ichnofossils preserve evidence of water depth, salinity, and seasonality of water bodies. Ichnofossils, categorized as epiterraphilic, terraphilic, hygrophilic, and hydrophilic (new terms), reflect the moisture regime where they were constructed. The ichnofossils are vertically zoned with respect to physical, chemical, and biological factors in the environment that controlled their distribution and abundance, and are expressed as surficial, shallow, intermediate, and deep.
   The sedimentologic, stratigraphic, and geographic distribution of Morrison ichnofossils reflects the environmental and climatic variations across the basin through time. Marginal-marine, tidal to brackish-water ichnofossils are mainly restricted to the Windy Hill Member. Very large to small termite nests dominate the Salt Wash Member. Similar size ranges of ant nests dominate the Brushy Basin Member. Soil bee nests dominate in the Salt Wash, decreasing in abundance through the Brushy Basin. Deeper and larger insect nests indicate more seasonal distribution of precipitation and rainfall. Shallower and smaller insect nests indicate either dry or wet substrate conditions depending on the nest architecture and paleopedogenic and sedimentologic character of the substrate. Trace-fossil indicators of flowing or standing water conditions are dominant in the Tidwell Member and in fluvial sandstones of the Salt Wash and Brushy Basin Members. Large communities of perennial, freshwater bivalve traces are abundant in the Tidwell and Brushy Basin Members but to a lesser extent in the Salt Wash Member. Shallow crayfish burrows, indicating a water-table level close to the surface (< 1 m), are restricted to channel bank and proximal alluvial deposits in the Salt Wash, Recapture, and Brushy Basin Members. Sauropod, theropod, pterosaur, and other vertebrate tracks occur throughout the Morrison Formation associated with alluvial, lacustrine, and transitional-marine shoreline deposits.
   Ichnofossils and co-occurring paleosols in the Morrison reflect the local and regional paleohydrologic settings, which record the annual soil moisture budget and were largely controlled by the climate in the basin. Contributions to near-surface biologic systems by groundwater from distant sources were minor, except where the water table perennially, seasonally, or ephemerally intersected the ground-surface. The Jurassic Morrison Formation in the southern portion of the basin experienced a mosaic of seasonal climates that varied from a drier (Tidwell/Windy Hill deposition) to a wetter (lower and middle Salt Wash deposition) and slightly drier (upper Salt Wash deposition) tropical wet-dry climate, returning to a wetter tropical wet-dry climate near the end of Morrison deposition (Brushy Basin deposition). The northern part of the basin experienced similar trends across a mosaic of Mediterranean climate types. The range and mosaic pattern of wet-dry Morrison climates is analogous to the range of climates (and their seasonal variability) that dominates the African savanna today. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - International policies promote renewable forms of energy to mitigate climate change. In Europe, the production of electricity using wood biomass represents one of the most popular energy alternatives. In 2012, France initiated a large-scale strategy to develop wood biomass energy. The biggest wood biomass power-plant project has been developed in the French Mediterranean area and its huge size raises several issues for the short- and long-term sustainability of local forests and associated economic sectors. The French Mediterranean forests provide four types of economic goods (private, club, common, and public goods) and multiple ecosystem services, which makes them complex to manage under an energy transition policy. In this paper, we applied three qualitative methods, namely interviews, participative workshops, and observant participation, and three conceptual models, namely (i) Ostrom's (2010) self-organization key conditions, (ii) the types of economic goods classified according to their excludability and rivalry properties, and (iii) the ecosystem service categorization system of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005). With our methods, we show that the renewable strategy chosen in France replicates the current centralized production model based on fossil and nuclear fuels. Thus, we demonstrate that European, national, and local authorities fail to consider the multiple ecosystem services that forest management strategies should include to face the energy transition, climate change, and the other ecological challenges of the 21st century.

AB  - BackgroundMicroorganisms in urban sanitary sewers exhibit community properties that suggest sewers are a novel ecosystem. Sewer microorganisms present both an opportunity as a control point for wastewater treatment and a risk to human health. If treatment processes are to be improved and health risks quantified, then it is necessary to understand microbial distributions and dynamics within this community. Here, we use 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize raw influent wastewater bacterial communities in a 5-year time series from two wastewater treatment plants in Milwaukee, WI; influent wastewater from 77 treatment plants across the USA; and wastewater in 12 Milwaukee residential sewers.ResultsIn Milwaukee, we find that in transit from residences to treatment plants, the human bacterial component of wastewater decreases in proportion and exhibits stochastic temporal variation. In contrast, the resident sewer community increases in abundance during transit and cycles seasonally according to changes in wastewater temperature. The result is a bacterial community that assembles into two distinct community states each year according to the extremes in wastewater temperature. Wastewater bacterial communities from other northern US cities follow temporal trends that mirror those in Milwaukee, but southern US cities have distinct community compositions and differ in their seasonal patterns.ConclusionsOur findings provide evidence that environmental conditions associated with seasonal change and climatic differences related to geography predictably structure the bacterial communities residing in below-ground sewer pipes.

AB  - Mercury, particularly methylmercury, can accumulate through food webs and generate high risks for species at higher trophic levels. Inorganic mercury can be methylated into the organic species methylmercury if suitable reducing conditions exist, for example, in hotspots like oilfields. We developed a conceptual model to conduct an ecological risk assessment based on the food web structure of the Shengli oilfield area, China. The model can identify species at risk and elucidate the sources of risks according to their diet. A risk rating criteria was developed based on the food web structure to categorize the different levels of risks for different species. As expected, the results indicate increasing risks for the biota higher in the food web hierarchy. Grasshoppers were mostly at no risk throughout the study area, whereas grubs at southwest were at minimal risks due to local high Hg concentration in the soil. Mantises, which are insect predators, were also at minimal risk. Herbivorous birds with similar feeding habits than grasshoppers were at no risk, but omnivorous and carnivorous birds were at moderate risk. The conceptual model is a useful tool to improve pollution remediation and establish risk control strategies based on ecological risks of the food web rather than just Hg concentrations in the environment.

AB  - Microorganisms with high tetracycline (TC) degradation efficiencies are required for biological processes for TC-containing wastewater treatment. With multiple enrichment cultures, a TC-degrading strain TR5 was isolated from chicken manure mixture in a large broiler farm, which was identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and biochemical properties. Strain TR5 could degrade TC quickly (similar to 90% within 36 h) with the initial TC concentration of 200 mg/L under optimized conditions via single-factor experiment coupled with RSM. Strain TR5 could detoxify TC and generate much less toxic products as long as cultured more than one day. Three TC-degrading pathways were proposed based on 8 possible products. A transformant containing a plasmid from TR5 acquired TC-degrading ability, indicating that TC-degrading genes were located on this plasmid. Complete sequencing of pYK5 showed that isomerase-, oxidoreductase-, and transferases-encoding genes were found and were inferred to be involved in TC degradation. TR5 may not degrade TC completely and it can utilize some carboncontaining compounds derived from TC via the effect of formylglutathione hydrolase-encoding gene. Our findings showed that strain TR5 could be a promising agent for wastewater treatment, and genes involved in TC degradation are worthy of further investigations for enzyme preparations development.

AB  - Bisphenol S (BPS) and 4-hydroxyphenyl 4-isoprooxyphenylsulfone (BPSIP) have been used as substitutes for bisphenol A (BPA) owing to increased regulation of BPA in plastics. In this study, long-term toxicity tests of BPS and BPSIP were performed using Daphnia magna and Moina macrocopa. The predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) of BPA, BPS, and BPSIP were derived by the assessment factor (AF) method and the species sensitivity distribution (SSD) method. An ecological risk assessment was performed based on the measured environmental concentrations of BPA in surface water worldwide and the derived PNECs. The chronic NOEC of D. magna was 2.5 mg/L for BPS and 0.5 mg/L for BPSIP, and that of M. macrocopa was 0.03 mg/L for BPS and 0.1 mg/L for BPSIP. The PNECAF was generally one order of magnitude less than the PNECSSD, and the PNEC of BPS was 10 times lower than that of BPA. The hazard quotients of BPA and BPS exceeded 1, indicating that concentrations in ambient water conditions could pose a potential risk to aquatic organisms. Since the use of alternative compounds is increasing, further monitoring data of the water environment and chronic toxicity in various aquatic organisms appears to be necessary.

AB  - The aim of this study is to determine the effects of microclimatic factors and tree size on epiphytic lichen diversity in different parts of Quercus petraea. The microclimatic factors used were tree size, the base and trunk of the tree. bark surface moisture, and environmental factors such as the amount of relative humidity and light in the environment. A total of 35 epiphytic lichen species was found in the Quercus petraea forest in the Uludag Mountains. Parmelia sulcata was the most common species. The highest species diversity was found in small trees. Shannon diversity on the trunk of the tree decreased with the increase in the tree size. The relationship between tree size and species richness on the trunk of the tree was found to be more significant than that found on the base. It has been determined that the frequency of some species on the base and trunk of the tree was increased as a result of an increase in the amount of relative humidity and light in the environment and an increase in the bark surface moisture. At the same time the frequency decreased when the amount of relative humidity and light in the environment and bark surface moisture decreased.

AB  - Despite the growing need to produce energy crops, information on comprehensive feasibility of growing short-rotation woody crops (SRWCs) on non-contentious and less-utilized lands and lands transitioning from previous uses in the southeastern USA is limited. An assessment model (SRWC-PEAM) was developed and tested for assessing the feasibility of SRWCs on lands targeted for ecosystem-service enhancements based on land conditions, species, and stand and economic variables in the southeastern USA. Productivity and economic returns of sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.), sycamore (Platanus occidentalis L.), and poplar (Populus) stand differed due to land types, species' adaptability and biomass potential, and optimal land-type-based management schemes. Poplar stands had the greatest biomass and the highest returns on all land types although returns from the three species on most land types were poor using current reported regional delivered prices. Irrigating stands increased yields but returns were poorer than from non-irrigated stands due to high costs of irrigation. Longer rotations resulted in greater biomass and returns and were more crucial for irrigated stands. Significantly higher feedstock prices and productivities are requisite for SRWC viability in the southeastern USA. SRWC-PEAM is a web-based tool and can accommodate other SRWC species and assessment of environmental services associated with SRWCs.

AB  - The present paper describes a research that, based on the evolutionary data of the urban settlement over a period of half a century, shows the changes undergone by the various landscape categories of Southern Italy. The regions involved are four (Campania, Basilicata, Puglia and Calabria) and share renowned urban, economic and social issues such as unauthorised development, low income per capita and organised crime. All this has produced profound transformations on some of the most important and rare Italian landscapes, such as coastal plains and coastal carbonate slabs. Uncontrolled urban sprawl has further provoked an environmental crisis and eco-friendly insularisation of the yet numerous and valuable protected areas of this geographical area, thus leading to a high density of buildings and infrastructures even in national parks, breaking European records in this respect. Through finalised indicators, the characteristics of the evolution occurred have been analytically highlighted, and by using the latest generation satellite data, it is shown how such phenomena have continued to take place with significant energy over the last few years. The result is a picture of environmental threats still very prominent in this southern extremity of the peninsula, above all towards those naturalistic qualities and landscapes that are the main attractions of an intense national and international tourism whose income, however, has not been conveyed in a correct and inclusive way to allow high-level socio-economic conditions of the resident population.

AB  - Ectotherms are sensitive to temperature change, and predictions about a species' vulnerability to thermal change require an understanding of its thermal responses. The preferred temperature in laboratory assays is a widely used measure commonly taken as an indicator of the temperature at which ectotherms' physiological functions are optimised. The ecological relevance of laboratory-measured temperature preference has been evaluated for vertebrate ectotherms but to our knowledge not for Drosophila. Here, we assessed the links between laboratory thermal preference and habitat temperature in the alpine fly Drosophila nigrosparsa. We found that (i) in the laboratory, D. nigrosparsa preferred a temperature of about 10 degrees C. In the field, (ii) macrohabitat temperatures ranged from 17 to 22 degrees C, and (iii) microhabitat temperatures exceeded those of the macrohabitat with up to 35 degrees C at full sun exposure. (iv) Isotope-tracked flies were localised, among others, at nearly the maximum temperature conditions measured in the microhabitats. (v) Operative environmental temperature models revealed that air temperature has the highest impact on the flies' experienced temperature, followed by global solar radiation and wind. These findings highlight that the preferred temperature in the laboratory differed strongly from that in the field and that different approaches lead to different conclusions about the preferred and experienced temperatures.

AB  - Reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a reliable technique commonly used in molecular biology to analyze RNA expression. The selection of suitable reference genes for data normalization is a precondition for credible measurements of gene expression levels using RT-qPCR. Propylea japonica is one of the most common pests of many crop systems throughout East Asia, and has often been used in the testing of non-target impacts during environmental risk assessments of genetically engineered plants. The present study assessed the suitability of nine frequently used reference genes for comparisons of P. japonica gene expression. Expression stability was compared across developmental stages, sex, a range of tissues, and following exposure to different temperatures. Data were analyzed using RefFinder, which integrated the results obtained using NormFinder, geNorm, BestKeeper, and the Delta Ct method. This led to the identification of unique sets of reference genes for each experimental condition: ribosomal protein S18 (RPS18) and elongation factor 1 a (EF1A) for developmental stage comparisons, RPS18 and EF1A for sex comparisons, EF1A and ribosomal protein L4 for tissue comparisons, and RPS18 and EF1A for analyses of temperature-mediated effects. These reference genes will help to enhance the accuracy of RT-qPCR analyses of P. japonica gene expression. This work represents an initial move towards building a standardized system for RT-qPCR analysis of P. japonica, providing a basis for the ecological risk assessment of RNAi-based insect control products.

AB  - One of the hallmarks of human agglomeration is an increase in the division of labour, but the exact nature of this relationship has been debated among anthropologists, sociologists, economists, and historians and archaeologists. Over the last decade, researchers investigating contemporary urban systems have suggested a novel explanation for the links between the numbers of inhabitants in settlements and many of their most important characteristics, which is grounded in a view of settlements as social networks embedded in built environments. One of the remarkable aspects of this approach is that it is not based on the specific conditions of the modern world (such as capitalism or industrialization), which raises the issue of whether the relationships observed in contemporary urban systems can also be detected in pre-modern urban or even non-urban systems. Here, we present a general model for the relationship between the population and functional diversity of settlements, where the latter is viewed as an indicator of the division of labour. We then explore the applicability of this model to pre-modern contexts, focusing on cities in the Roman Empire, using estimates of their numbers of inhabitants, numbers of documented professional associations, and numbers of recorded inscriptions to develop an index of functional diversity. Our results are consistent with theoretical expectations, adding further support to the view that urban systems in both contemporary and pre-modern contexts reflect a common set of generative processes.

AB  - The Amara Lake is located at the south-eastern part of Romania. It is a shallow lake with an average depth of 3m and average extent of 1.32 km(2), having a particular importance for the area in which is situated. This importance derives from its main functions in the ecosystem, namely: source of food, shelter and breeding place for almost 54 bird, balneary tourism attraction and jobs for the residents of Amara who live in the northern part of the lake. Under these conditions, the sustainable development of this area is required, and this can be attained by proposing and implementing practices which will protect and harmonize the area from economic, social and ecological point of view. In this study, a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis of Amara Lake ecosystem was performed in order to found the most adequate management solution, whose implementation would allow the sustainable development of area. The proposed management solution considers the forestation of southern shore of the lake with Acer campestre tree species. The effects of this solution on Amara Lake ecosystem were evaluated by monitoring three water quality indicators (total nitrogen, total phosphorus and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5)) during of six years (2010- 2015). These indicators are strictly related to the eutrophication process of lake water, and their variations during the monitoring period indicated that the forestation of southern shore of the lake can be considered a viable management solution.

AB  - Public open spaces today are considered important urban environmental elements that offer a positive contribution to quality of life. They are vital ingredients of successful cities that can help to build a sense of community, civic identity and culture, and facilitate social capital, economic development and community revitalization. Accordingly, the perceived values and qualities of successful public places are acknowledged as crucial. Efforts have been made to evaluate public space conditions (i.e., physical, spatial, visual, social, functional, and etc.) for users and a series of indicators - physical-environmental qualities (i.e., scenic beauty, seating, lighting, paths, amenities, etc.) and subjective qualities (i.e., being comfortable, passive and active engagement, and etc.) - have been demonstrated. Using the case of historical Persian gardens, this paper examines how and why these gardens as the first examples of Iranian green spaces are still being actively used by contemporary urban dwellers. Accordingly, the research investigated the popularity, diversity, distinctiveness, attractiveness and comfort of the gardens as success indicators through applying mixed method approaches. Obtained results suggested that historical Persian gardens could be categorized as successful public places due to their historical, natural, functional (social and recreational) and emotional related aspects. The results have direct implications for urban planners and policy makers, landscape architects and environmental designers and provide guidance for planning, improving and designing successful public places.

AB  - We explore an under-appreciated side effect of semi-closed greenhouses: the ability to recover transpired water, thereby increasing water use efficiency. Semi-closed greenhouses are fit with cooling equipment, to limit natural ventilation requirements for temperature and humidity control. We assess the effect of cooling system capacity on ventilation needs of semi-closed greenhouses under different climate conditions and provide a general framework to evaluate potential water savings using the semi-closed greenhouse concept in different regions. We simulate greenhouse climate and crop yields for various cooling system capacities in Central Europe (The Netherlands) and Mediterranean (Greece and Algeria) by implementing a "cooling module" into an existing greenhouse model (KASPRO) and validating it using concurrent experimental data. Increasing the capacity of the cooling system has a double effect on water use efficiency (WUE): increase of fruit yield due to improved microclimate and lower water use, due to collection and reuse of vapour condensed in the heat exchanger and, to a lesser extent, lower crop transpiration. Thus WUE is strongly associated to the capacity of the cooling system. Finally, we show that there is a unique relationship between water use efficiency and the coupling of greenhouse environment to the outside air (an indicator of ventilation requirements), for all regions studied.

AB  - In the Mediterranean area, different post-fire management strategies are used for coppices of resprouting species to promote a more regular forest structure, enhance plant growth, and reduce fire risk. However, the effects of these management treatments on forest-associated fauna are unknown, which in turn could be limiting their beneficial effects.
   The aim of this work was to determine whether forest management of a recently burned area dominated by a vigorous resprouting tree species (Arbutus unedo L.) affects ant communities.
   Ant communities, sampled using pitfall traps, were examined from unmanaged and selective thinning coppices of A. unedo. Ants are here used as bioindicators of ecosystem health and surrogates for other animal groups.
   Very limited effects of these post-fire management strategies on the structure and composition of ant communities were found. The lack of effects could be due to the reported small changes in physical conditions among treatments; or either, the most sensitive ant species to these post-fire management treatments might be the same ones affected by fire and, consequently, the ant species that would potentially be affected most were no longer in the study area.
   The lack of any significant effects caused by these post-fire management practices on the associated fauna of A. unedo coppices points out the suitability of these treatments in these circumstances.

AB  - In this study four shallow lakes, situated in the Bulgarian Danube River floodplains were tested for the assessment of their ecological status. According to the Bulgarian legislation, the ecological classification of lakes and reservoirs is based mainly on physical parameters and on two biological quality elements, and namely phytoplankton and macrophytes. The other three widely used biological quality elements, macrozoobenthos, fish and zooplankton communities, are not adopted yet. An integrated method designed for the ecological assessment of shallow lakes called ECOFRAME approach was tested. This system had been developed for the implementation of the Water Framework Directive and included the application of other biotic variables. Our investigation was conducted in the summer of 2012. Most of the samples were collected and processed as described in the ECOFRAME methodology, or by the state-of-the-art methods. According to the analysed biotic variables, only the Srebarna Lake was assessed as a lake with Moderate ecological quality, while the other three sites were assessed as with Poor ecological quality. The ecological assessment based on abiotc variables determined Poor ecological quality for all of the studied lakes and it was accepted as being the final assessment of the ecological status. The results obtained suggest that the ECOFRAME method for ecological assessment needs further verification for the specific conditions in the shallow oxbow lakes on the Lower Danube River floodplain.

AB  - Marine ecosystems are diverse and complex, providing significant challenges to the development of generalizable metrics of ecosystem health. Of particular concern is the varied form of change caused by multiple human activities, which limits the capacity to generate a single measure to encapsulate the overall condition of the ecosystem. Here we consider how successional theory can help to simplify our understanding of marine community structure, especially when viewed in context of human disturbance. During succession, the emergent properties of communities change in predictable ways. As communities mature, there is an increase in total production and biomass, the mean size of organisms, the level of internal recycling of food and nutrients, and the mean trophic level. Using a set of multi-species trophic models, we explore the changes in community structure that are likely to occur during succession. These changes include increases in biomass within trophic levels due to decreased rates of energy and food loss through trophic and production inefficiencies, and potential shifts from top-down control early in succession to bottom-up later. Because human activities disproportionately favor early-successional species, we can gain insights by considering community degradation in the context of succession being played in reverse. Indicators of health based on ecological succession thus provide a mechanistic view to measure the impact of human activities (both positive and negative) on marine ecosystems.

KW  - DISCRIMINATION
AB  - This study examined the use of satellite sensor imagery for chronosequential assessment of land use and ecosystem carbon stock in slash-and-burn (S/B) regions of Laos. The segmentation approach was useful because the boundaries of S/B patches are subject to change due to natural or anthropogenic factors. Polygon-based classification using six optical bands of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery showed that S/B patches could be discriminated with high accuracy (0.98). Normalized difference spectral indices, NDSI[i, j] = [R-j - R-i]/[R-j + R-i], using reflectances R-j and R-i at j and i nm wavelengths for S/B polygons during four consecutive years (1999 - 2002) showed that NDSI[2215, 830], NDSI[1650, 830] and NDSI[660, 830] (= the normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) values decreased significantly in S/B years compared to those under fallow conditions (by 0.21 +/- 0.04, 0.20 +/- 0.04 and 0.17 +/- 0.03, respectively). Only slight differences were found before and after the S/B year, regardless of fallow length or biomass estimated by the allometry method. Relating reflectance signatures directly to fallow biomass was unsuitable, but these NDSIs were also useful for distinguishing S/B patches. Land-use history, including the community age of fallow vegetation, can be traced on a pixel basis using a superimposed set of segmented classified images.

AB  - Cumulative relative biomass trophic, level spectra (BTLS) are constructed for the fish community of a tropical coastal lagoon in Mexico to analyse spatio-temporal patterns as a potential ecosystem indicator of multifactor impacts. Data were based on monthly trawl surveys over a single year carried out eighteen years apart. The spectra show significant differences between the two periods, indicating major shifts in the trophic structure of the system. Specifically, biomass of the omnivorous, estuarine species in the middle of the foodweb (originally dominating) has been replaced by carnivorous and herbivorous-detritivorous species. As a consequence, the initial sigmoid shape of the BTLS has tended to become more linear. However, interpretation of the causes involved remains unclear. It is suggested that this potential indicator of trophic status of the fish community reflects a combination of interacting driving forces acting simultaneously in the lagoon: (i) increased marine conditions as well as artificial reefs constructed in adjacent zones may enhance biomass of marine predators and detritivorous species; (ii) attenuation of estuarine influences may lead to decreasing biomass of estuarine generalist species; and (iii) the establishment of a marine protected area may increase predator biomass, causing a decline in prey biomass.

AB  - In-sewer stability of biomarkers is a critical factor for wastewater-based epidemiology, as it could affect the accuracy of the estimated prevalence of substances in the community. The spatiotemporal variations of environmental and biological conditions in sewers can influence the transformation of biomarkers. To date, the relationship between environmental variables and biomarker stability in sewers is poorly understood. Therefore, this study evaluated the transformation of common illicit drug and pharmaceutical biomarkers in laboratory sewer reactors with different levels of pH, temperature, and suspended solids. The correlations between degradation rates of 14 biomarkers, 3 controlled environmental variables (pH, temperature, and suspended solids concentration), and 3 biological activity indicators (sulfide production rate, methane production rate, and the removal rate of soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD)) were assessed using correlation matrix, stepwise regression method, and principal component analysis. The consistent results affirmed the dominant effects of biological activities and pH on biomarker transformation in sewers, particularly for labile compounds, whereas the impact of temperature or suspended solids was less significant. This study enhances the understanding of factors affecting the fate of micropollutants in sewer systems and facilitates the interpretation of WBE results for assessing drug use and public health in communities.

AB  - Confluences are nodes in riverine networks characterized by complex three-dimensional changes in flow hydrodynamics and riverbed morphology, and are valued for important ecological functions. This physical complexity is often investigated within the water column or riverbed, while few studies have focused on hyporheic fluxes, which is the mixing of surface water and groundwater across the riverbed. This study aims to understand how hyporheic flux across the riverbed is organized by confluence physical drivers. Field investigations were carried out at a low gradient, headwater confluence between Baltimore Brook and Cold Brook in Marcellus, New York, USA. The study measured channel bathymetry, hydraulic permeability, and vertical temperature profiles, as indicators of the hyporheic exchange due to temperature gradients. Confluence geometry, hydrodynamics, and morphodynamics were found to significantly affect hyporheic exchange rate and patterns. Local scale bed morphology, such as the confluence scour hole and minor topographic irregularities, influenced the distribution of bed pressure head and the related patterns of downwelling/upwelling. Furthermore, classical back-to-back bend planform and the related secondary circulation probably affected hyporheic exchange patterns around the confluence shear layer. Finally, even variations in the hydrological conditions played a role on hyporheic fluxes modifying confluence planform, and, in turn, flow circulation patterns.

AB  - Plant root-associated microbial symbionts comprise the plant rhizobiome. These microbes function in provisioning nutrients and water to their hosts, impacting plant health and disease. The plant microbiome is shaped by plant species, plant genotype, soil and environmental conditions, but the contributions of these variables are hard to disentangle from each other in natural systems. We used bioassay common garden experiments to decouple plant genotype and soil property impacts on fungal and bacterial community structure in the Populus rhizobiome. High throughput amplification and sequencing of 16S, ITS, 28S and 18S rDNA was accomplished through 454 pyrosequencing. Co-association patterns of fungal and bacterial taxa were assessed with 16S and ITS datasets. Community bipartite fungal-bacterial networks and PERMANOVA results attribute significant difference in fungal or bacterial communities to soil origin, soil chemical properties and plant genotype. Indicator species analysis identified a common set of root bacteria as well as endophytic and ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with Populus in different soils. However, no single taxon, or consortium of microbes, was indicative of a particular Populus genotype. Fungal-bacterial networks were over-represented in arbuscular mycorrhizal, endophytic, and ectomycorrhizal fungi, as well as bacteria belonging to the orders Rhizobiales, Chitinophagales, Cytophagales, and Burkholderiales. These results demonstrate the importance of soil and plant genotype on fungal-bacterial networks in the belowground plant microbiome.

AB  - The remarkable transition of early angiosperms from a small to a dominant group characterized the terrestrial ecosystem of the Cretaceous. This transition was instigated and promoted by environmental changes. Mid-Cretaceous is characterized by major geological events that affected the global environment. O-18, palaeothermometer TEX86, and other climatic indices from marine sediments suggest rapid temperature increase during mid-Cretaceous despite occasional short cooling events. Simultaneously, terrestrial deposits in East Asia changed from coal-bearing to shale, then to red beds and evaporites. Plant assemblages and other paleoclimate indicators point to rapid aridification for mid-Cretaceous terrestrial environments. In addition, the wildfires were frequently spread all over the earth by the numerous charcoal evidence during the Mid-Cretaceous. Thus, we speculate that the seasonally dry and hot conditions of mid-Cretaceous created a fiery hothouse world. Early angiosperms increased in abundance and diversity and evolved from a few aquatic species to terrestrial herbaceous and then to the diversified flora of today. Angiosperms showed rapid physiological evolution in vein density and leaf area that improved photosynthesis and water absorption. These ecophysiological changes made early angiosperms well adapted to the hot and dry environment in mid-Cretaceous. Moreover, these physiological changes facilitated the fire-angiosperm cycles in mid-Cretaceous that likely further stimulated the early angiosperm evolution.

AB  - Spectrophotometric pH measurements were first introduced for oceanic environments and they facilitated the determination of the marine CO2 system, including the direct observation of Ocean Acidification. Extended characterizations of the indicator dye m-Cresol purple over the past two decades enabled the application of this method to natural waters ranging from brines to freshwaters. However, the required determination of the dye's dissociation constants and absorbance properties were exclusively performed in buffer solutions prepared with artificial seawater. Potential perturbations by substances that occur in natural waters, but are not included in the buffer solutions, have never been tested. Therefore, we studied the impact of elevated amounts of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on spectrophotometric pH measurements. We did not observe an impact on spectrophotometric pH measurements by H2S concentrations up to 400 mol kg(-1), which reflect high levels such as those reported from the Black Sea. Likewise, natural DOM did not interfere with the spectrophotometric measurements at concentrations typical for oceanic environments and large estuarine systems. However, strongly colored river waters can cause spectral disturbances resulting in calculated pH values that are up to tenths of pH units too low. To circumvent such disturbances, we recommend using intense light sources, a shorter cuvette length or spectrophotometrically calibrated glass electrodes when performing spectrophotometric measurements under critical conditions.

AB  - Long wavelengths of sunlight spectrum (UVA and visible light), as well as natural organic matter (NOM) are important environmental factors affecting survival of viruses in aquatic environment through direct and indirect inactivation. In order to understand the virus inactivation kinetics under such conditions, this study investigated the effects of Suwannee River natural organic matter (NOM) on the inactivation of a somatic coliphage, phiX174, by UVA and visible light. Experiments were carried out to examine the virucidal effects of UVA/visible light, assess the influence of SRNOM at different concentrations, and identify the effective ROS in virus inactivation. The results from this study showed that the presence of NOM could either enhance virus inactivation or reduce virus inactivation depending on the concentration, where the inactivation rate followed a parabolic relationship against NOMconcentration. The results indicated that moderate levels ofNOM(11 ppm) had the strongest antiviral activity, while very lowor very highNOMconcentrations prolonged virus survival. The results also showed that OH square was the primary ROS in causing phiX174 (ssDNA virus) inactivation, unlike previous findings where O-1(2) was the primary ROS causing MS2 (ssRNA virus) inactivation. The phiX174 inactivation by OH center dot could be described as k = 3.7 x 10(13)[OH center dot] + 1.404 (R-2 = 0.8527). (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change poses many challenges for the future management and development of the coastal zone. Uncertainties in the rate of future sea-level rise reduce our ability to project potential future impacts. This study seeks to further develop the past-present-future methodology proposed in Baker and McGowan and apply it to an additional case study, the Macleay River estuary, New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The past-present-future methodology uses evidence from the past, the Holocene and Pleistocene, to formulate a response function that can be used to project future sea-level heights. Three scenarios for 2100 were developed to emphasise the uncertainties surrounding future sea levels and the need to consider multiple sea-level rise scenarios when planning for the future: a best case (90cm rise), mid-case (2.6m rise) and worst case (5m rise). Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data were used to project each of the three scenarios onto the case study area of South West Rocks. The methodology was tested by using shell samples extracted from cores which were AMS dated to determine whether or not Holocene estuarine conditions correlated with the proposed future sea-level rise inundation scenarios. We also conducted an audit of potentially affected infrastructure and land uses, and proposed possible future adaptation strategies for the case study area.

AB  - The aggregation kinetics of two types of ZnO nanoparticles were investigated under various conditions. Distinct differences in aggregation kinetics were observed between the two ZnO particles. The aggregation of the nearly spherical ZnO (denoted as Me ZnO) exhibited strong dependence on the ionic strength (IS) of the solution; while minimal influence of Is was seen on the irregularly shaped ZnO (mixture of slab-like and rod-shaped particles, denoted as Mk ZnO) in the IS ranged tested. It is postulated that Mk ZnO possesses a critical coagulation concentration (CCC) below the lowest electrolyte concentration tested (1 mM NaCl) due to the interactions between various surfaces. The CCC of ZnO was found to be a function of pH; the CCC increased significantly as the pH was further away from the point of zero charge. Natural organic matter (NOM) was found to substantially hinder the aggregation of both types of ZnO particles (above 10 mg/L for Me ZnO and above 1 mg/L for Mk ZnO). A Langmuir adsorption model was used to describe the NOM to ZnO nanoparticle adsorption isotherms. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the effect of particle morphology on nanoparticle aggregation, which outlines the importance of accounting morphology into environmental transport assessment of nanoparticles.

AB  - Grapevine yellows (GYs) are mainly spread in European viticultural areas. Phytosanitary measures worldwide are based on data obtained on classical pathosystems, but the latest findings suggest that the epidemiological pattern of these diseases is evolving and adapting to different ecological conditions. Risk assessment of introduction in GY-free areas has to be reconsidered in view of the broadening of the range of pathways of entry and means of diffusion in the field. The purpose of this review is to make available an update on findings of recent years to provide useful tools to prevent further spread of these serious diseases of grapevine.

AB  - The distillation process was periodically monitored, on Campo Largo-PR, in "CHAMEL Ind. e Com. de Produtos Naturais LTDA.", in the 2005 harvest. The hydrodistillation and GC-MS analyses were done in the UFPR Laboratories. The obtained data indicate that the chamomile essential oil extracted through the distiller model used presented low quality. Great part of the essential oil, besides their main components, it was being lost with the hidrolato. In the distillation process the periodic evaluation of quality and efficiency indicators is indispensable to establish appropriate operational conditions.

AB  - Geometric morphometric methods are powerful tools to discriminate between closely related ostracods taxa as well as to study the relationship between their morphological variations, taxonomy and paleoecology. In this study, valve outline analysis allows the discrimination between the non-marine ostracod C. silvestrii and R. whatleyi juveniles, pointing out differences in the posterior valve area and surface ornamentation. Modern female specimens of C. silvestrii from 23 sites located in a spatial transect (41 to 51 degrees S) exhibited extensive morphological variability, on the basis of which three morphotypes (acuminated, transitional, subtruncated) were determined. Multivariate analyses showed that acuminated and transitional shapes are not arranged in groups but the subtruncated morphotype, previously described as E. cecryphalium, seems to be associated with low water conductivity (372 mu S cm(-1)), dominant cold (5 degrees C) and windy (8.6 m s(1)) climatic conditions. The fossil cluster which included nine cores spanning the last 15.6 kyr, only covered acuminated and transitional shapes, which may indicate that these lineages might be older than the subtruncated morphotype. In addition, morphological differences between reproduction modes suggested that parthenogenetic females exhibit de posterior margin more acuminate than sexual females. These results set the ground for more precise ecological and paleoenvironmental studies in Patagonia.

AB  - Transportation system infrastructure often experiences severe flood-related disruptions such as overtopping, erosion, and scour. The ensuing damages can result in enormous direct and indirect economic losses to the traffic network and consequently the individuals through conditions like inaccessibility to commuters and reduction in traffic safety. Many studies have claimed that a robust transportation system could significantly prevent such consequences from natural hazards such as floods, highlighting the importance of robustness measures that could be used by decision-makers to properly manage flooded transportation system. Most available measures related to network robustness assessment are qualitative, and while some recent studies have focused on such evaluation using quantitative assessment approaches related to environmental or social-economic operations, they lack the holistic view towards robustness under flood events. This study develops a composite multi-scale transportation-system robustness model considering flood hazards by synthesizing geographical damage recognition, topological functionality analysis, network operation evaluation, and traffic-user loss estimation. This integrated model has been applied in a real-world highway network, mainly revealing that a given intensive flood occurrence at different locations may result in a variety of after-flood disruptions in the transportation network. To assist the asset owners with developing more reasonable prevention and recovery plans, the developed multi-scale robustness index presents both visible multi-denominational flood consequences and an overall post-event transportation-system robustness indicator.

AB  - As tends to be the case in other large, developing countries, Mexico is a nation of strong meteorological, hydrographic and social contrasts throughout its territory, which impact the various strata of the population in different ways. The current paper seeks to show how these contrasts create different water-security scenarios using pertinent indices. While some of the impact factors, such as precipitation, drought and floods, are of intrinsically probabilistic nature, others are related to population vulnerability. There have been a small number of studies on water security at global or regional scale that include Mexico, or at local level in Mexico, but none of them consider probabilistic aspects and population vulnerability, neither extend to municipal level. A probabilistic methodology was defined in this paper, and applied at municipal scale in Mexico, to obtain a water security index, which considers the concepts of risk, hazard and social vulnerability. Hazard comes in the form of water supply and drainage shortage, flooding, pollution, water quality, groundwater depletion and drought indicators. Vulnerability considers factors such as the educational level of the population, access to health services, illiteracy, housing conditions, unemployment and the proportion of indigenous language population. All these indicators are very heterogeneous throughout the Mexican territory. The proposed probabilistic methodology was applied in a geographic information system environment, and it was used to obtain water security indices for all municipalities in Mexico (2456 municipalities).

AB  - As a tool for stock identification the body morphology and the free amino acid (FAA) profile variability were determined among farmed rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum 1792) from different geographical areas throughout Greece, using geometric morphometrics and Reversed Phase-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography. Significant intraspecific body shape variation was detected among the fish stocks of different origin. Canonical Variate Analysis distinguished populations into two groups being consistent to a great extent with a previous population genetics study. General linear models did not support an association of haplotypes and diet with shape. However, shape was significantly correlated with origin, water temperature, geological-chemical-climatic zones, histidine and arginine. Therefore, morphological variation was primarily driven by environmentally induced differences among these zones being the result of phenotypic plasticity. Environmental cues and rearing conditions played the pivotal role in comparison to broodstock origin. Specimens presented different FAA profiles depending on their geographical origin. Principal Component Analysis showed a division between eastern and western Greece which might be owed to the existence of climatic fluctuations affecting the abiotic factors. This combined approach offers an important tool for stock identification thus assisting environmental risk assessments in evaluation of potential ecological effects and fostering research excellence in sustainable aquaculture management.

AB  - The uncertainty of ecological risks and the effects of growing transgenic Bt rice on the environment hamper its commercial production. Here, soil nematode communities were used as an indicator of soil health and soil food web structure to evaluate the potential effects of growing Bt rice without chemical insecticides for 3 years in the paddy field. The nematodes and soil physicochemical properties of Bt rice fields were compared to the near-isogenic control, non-Bt rice fields. A total of 108,363 specimens belonging to 28 different genera were enumerated. The Hirschmanniella, Tobrilus, Dorylaimus and Filenchus were dominant genera. A three-year paddy rice cultivation of Bt rice (Huahui 1) negatively affected the abundance of phytoparasitic nematodes but did not affect the total number of nematodes, the abundance and relative abundance of free-living nematodes, genera richness, diversity indices, soil food web conditions, or community compositions. However, apparent seasonal and inter-annual changes in these variables were observed, indicating that the impact of environmental factors was more stronger than that of the Bt toxin. In conclusion, the potential ecological risks of Bt rice on soil health and sustainability warrant further research to disentangle the impacts from various confounding environmental factors.

AB  - Genotoxic and hematological parameters in tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum), a native freshwater fish, were used as biomarkers to assess exposure to environmental stressors within the Maracana Protected Area of Maranhao State, Brazil. Fish were sampled at two sites-Serena Lagoon (control) and Ambude River-on four occasions (dry and rainy season), and biometric data (length and weight) recorded and blood collected from all fish for analysis. Erythrocyte indices-mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration- were calculated. Blood samples were stained with Giemsa and acridine orange, and microscopically examined for micronuclei and morphological nuclear abnormalities. Micronuclei were observed in fish from both sites, although the frequency was significantly higher in fish from the Ambude River and morphological nuclear abnormalities were only observed in fish from the Ambude River. More morphological nuclear abnormalities and a larger number of micronuclei were observed in erythrocytes stained with acridine orange compared with those stained with Giemsa. On average, erythrocyte indices were lower in fish from the Ambude River than from the Serena Lagoon. The results confirm that genotoxic and hematological parameters in C. macropomum can be used as indicators of environmental health and could be valuable tools for monitoring environmental conditions within protected areas.

AB  - Periphyton constitutes an important community that is useful for assessment of ecological conditions in lotic systems. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of different mixtures of Cd and Pb on periphyton growth as well as Cd and Pb mixtures toxicity to diatom assemblages in laboratory mesocosm experiments. A natural periphyton community sampled from the Monjolinho River (South of Brazil) was inoculated into five experimental systems containing clean glass substrates for periphyton colonization. The communities were exposed to mixtures of dissolved Cd and Pb concentrations of 0.01 and 0.1 mg l(-1) Cd and 0.033 and 0.1 mg l(-1) Pb. Periphyton ash-free dry weight, growth rate, diatom cell density and diatom community composition were analyzed on samples collected after 1, 2 and 3 weeks of colonization. High Cd concentration (0.1 mg l(-1)) has negative effects on periphyton growth while high concentration of Pb (0.1 mg l(-1)) decreased the toxic effects of Cd on periphyton growth. Shifts in species composition (development of more resistant species like Achnanthidium minutissimum and reduction of sensitive ones like Cymbopleura naviculiformis, Fragilaria capucina, Navicula cryptocephala, Encyonema silesiacum, Eunotia bilunaris, and Gomphonema parvulum), decreases in species diversity of diatom communities with increasing Cd and Pb concentrations and exposure duration have been demonstrated in this study making diatom communities appropriate monitors of metal mixtures in aquatic systems.

AB  - Heavy metal (HM) pollution has become one of the most important environmental problems of the present day, as a result of the developing industrial activities. Accordingly, it is important to understand microorganism activities in soil ecosystems that have been exposed to HMs for a long time. The aim of this study was to show the potential effects of ores on soil carbon and nitrogen mineralizations which were taken from copper (Cu) and lead (Pb) mines in Balikesir-Balya and Kastamonu-Kure districts in Turkey. The carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) mineralizations were determined by using the CO2 respiration method (30 days) and the Parnas Wagner method (42 days) under the controlled laboratory conditions (28 degrees C, 80% of field capacity), respectively. It was observed that carbon mineralization decreased depending on the dose increase. 250 mg kg(-1) treatment with Pb was lower than the control and there was a significant difference between them (P < 0.001). In terms of nitrogen mineralization rate (%), there was no significant difference among all treatments. According to the results, Pb affected microorganisms more negatively; however, the presence of Cu slightly decreased its negative effect. It is possible to conclude that carbon mineralization can be indicator for HM pollution in the soil. However, nitrogen mineralization was not a determining factor at HM pollution in this study.

TI  - The effects of the record-setting drought from 2018 to 2020 on ground water tables in Central Germany
T2  - WASSERWIRTSCHAFT
LA  - German
AB  - A record-setting drought from 2018-2020 occurred in Germany! Severe adverse consequences affected not only anthropogenic purposes like agriculture, forestry, or water supply but also the corresponding natural systems, in particular aquatic ecosystems or wetlands. A key indicator of water availability at the landscape scale is the groundwater table, whose depth is influencing the access of terrestrial vegetation to water, the baseflow of rivers and the water level in groundwater-fed lakes and ponds. This study therefore studies the effects of the 2018-2020 drought on long-term dynamics of groundwater tables by analysing 30 years of groundwater dynamics in more than 220 gauges in central Germany. This region is particularly susceptible to droughts because it receives comparatively low annual precipitation and harbours the lowest groundwater recharge rates in whole Germany. We found severe reductions of groundwater tables down to historically low levels with more than 50 % of the gauges showing water tables below the 5% quantile based in the 30 years reference period. The decrease in groundwater was spatially consistent over the whole region though magnitude differed regionally. A strong trend of decreasing groundwater tables is already visible for 10 years in this region and the water deficit is estimated to be between 300 and 400 mm indicating a long recovery time, if ever recovering is realistic given the ongoing change in climatic conditions leading to higher water losses.

AB  - Regulatory environmental risk assessment, applied to establish a protection limit for all bacterial diversity in surface waters, relies on a growth inhibition test performed on a single species of cyanobacteria and the activated sludge respiration inhibition test. Recently, the ability of this approach to protect adequately for bacteria that provide important ecosystem services has been questioned, and empirical data on additional species to further investigate the effectiveness of the environmental risk assessment are urgently required. We present the development and validation of a cost-effective and time-efficient microplate assay that is comparable to the traditional shake flask test for measurement of cyanobacteria growth rate after chemical exposure. The assay has been optimized to ensure that comparisons of cyanobacteria sensitivity under exponential growth are assessed across equivalent experimental conditions using phycocyanin fluorescence as a surrogate for cell density. The test system is validated using potassium dichromate, and the results are compared with those obtained in an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2011) test guideline 201 shake flask test system. This assay is suitable for the screening of new and legacy chemicals (including antibiotics) for which ecotoxicology data are lacking across a wide range of cyanobacteria, with the aim of developing more comprehensive environmental risk assessment.

AB  - Ecosystem conductance, which describes ecosystem regulation of water and carbon exchange and links plant functions with the environment, is a critical component in ecosystem and earth system models. However, the behaviors of ecosystem conductance at the ecosystem level and its responses to environmental conditions are still largely unclear. In this study, half-hourly data of 77 eddy-covariance sites from the FLUXNET2015 dataset were used to compare four ecosystem conductance models at the ecosystem level and determine the most consistent vapor pressure deficit (VPD) dependence across plant functional types for varying soil moisture stress levels at the subdaily time scale. We used leaf-level VPD (VPDl), a better indicator of atmospheric dryness at the leaf level, for canopy-level analysis instead of measured atmospheric VPD. Detection of the best-fitted exponent of VPDl indicates that ecosystem conductance responds to VPD between optimality-theory (i.e., VPD-0.5 dependence) and Leuning's (i.e., VPD-1 dependence) models. Accounting for different soil moisture stress levels only affected minimum ecosystem conductance and did not affect the exponent and factor of VPDl indicating limited diurnal soil moisture-VPDl interactions. These results indicate limited interaction between xylem and stomata at subdaily time scales and that soil moisture effects can be simplified as a regulation of minimum (soil plus canopy) conductance.

AB  - Biological indicators allow to define early changes in soil environment due to the impacts in land management over time. This study investigated the effects of long-term (2006-2015) two conventional (CT-1 and CT-2), three reduced (RT-1, RT-2 and RT-3) and a no-till (NT) on soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and beta-glucosidase enzyme activity (BGA) in eastern Mediterranean region, Turkey. Experimental design was randomized complete block with three replications. Results indicated that SOC, MBC and BGA significantly differed among tillage treatments. Non-disturbed soils under NT had nearly 75% higher SOC (8.80 gkg(-1)), 359% higher BGA (207.66 mg PNP kg(-1)h(-1)) and 68% higher MBC (185.9 mg C kg(-1) soil) compared with highly disturbed soils under CT-1 system. The BGA and MBC concentrations under NT were also significantly higher than the three RT treatments. In contrast to BGA and MBC, the SOC contents under RT systems did not differ from that of NT treatment. Higher concentrations of BGA and MBC under NT and partially under RT compared to CT treatments were most likely related to the increased organic matter contents and non-disturbed environmental conditions.

AB  - The primary clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is mainly based on medical history and neuropsychiatric inventory. It is urgent to seek biological indicators with better sensitivity and higher specificity to clinically diagnose and evaluate Alzheimer's disease. In this work, an electrophoretic method based on 2-thiobarbituric acid derivatization and amperometric detection was developed to determine formaldehyde as a urinary biomarker of Alzheimer's disease. Under the optimum conditions, the formaldehyde derivative was well separated from the coexisting interferences in urine sample. The limit of detection for formaldehyde was 80.0nM (2.4ng/mL) based on an electrophoretic stacking technology. The average recovery values were in the range of 91.7-110%, and the relative standard deviation values were less than 4.1%. This method has been applied to analyze human urine samples from healthy volunteers and patients with different degrees of Alzheimer's disease. The assay results showed that the content of urinary formaldehyde in patients suffering Alzheimer's disease was significantly higher than that in healthy subjects (P<0.01), suggesting that urinary formaldehyde may be speculated to be an auxiliary noninvasive biomarker for the preliminary diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. High separation efficiency, simple sample preparation, environmental friendliness, and low cost are the main advantages of this proposed method.

AB  - The authors recently demonstrated that naturalised strains of Escherichia coli exist in municipal waste water, characterised by (a) biomarker patterns in intergenic regions distinct from human and animal E. co/i strains and (b) an insertion element (IS30) located in the uspC-fIhDC intergenic region of the genome. Remarkably, these strains are naturally adapted to survival and growth in waste water and differentially survive the treatment process. The authors sought to explore the adaptive mechanisms used by these strains for survival. A serial stress experiment (nutrient deprivation and osmotic stress followed by chlorine treatment) was performed and survival was measured using culture. Waste water strains were shown to be approximately 100 times more resistant to chlorine treatment than a wild-type human faecal strain. Naturalised waste water strains were also more robust at producing biofilms - an adaptive strategy for surviving environmental stressors. Since biofilm formation has been linked to increased motility, the authors examined the expression of the flagellar regulator gene, flhDC, under serial stress conditions. Chlorine was a potent inducer of flhDC expression in waste water strains. The results demonstrate that waste water strains possess adaptive genotypic/phenotypic properties related to their survival in waste water and challenge the understanding of treatment reduction based on E. coli as an indicator of treatment performance.

AB  - A rapid and reliable method was developed for analysis of ethephon residues in maize, in combination with the investigation of its dissipation in field condition and stabilities during the sample storage. The residue analytical method in maize plant, maize kernel and soil was developed based on the quantification of ethylene produced from the derivatization of ethephon residue by adding the saturated potassium hydroxide solution to the sample. The determination was carried out by using the head space gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (HS-GC-FID). The limit of quantification (LOQ) of the method for maize plant was 0.05, 0.02 mg kg(-1) for maize kernel and 0.05 mg kg(-1) for soil, respectively. The fortified. recoveries of the method were from 84.6-102.6%, with relative standard deviations of 7.9-3.8%. Using the methods, the dissipation of ephethon in maize plant or soil was investigated. The half life of ethephon degradation was from 0.6 to 3.3 d for plant and 0.7 to 5.7 d for soil, respectively. The storage stabilities of ethephon residues were determined in fresh and dry kernels with homogenization and without homogenization process. And the result showed that ethephon residues in maize kernels were stable under -18 degrees C for 6 mon. The results were helpful to monitor the residue dissipation of ethephon in the maize ecosystem for further ecological risk assessment.

AB  - Sites contaminated with hazardous material are a topical and urgent problem all over the world. In accordance with recent Italian regulations, appropriate risk assessment is required in order to determine health risks associated with contaminated sites. The paper presents a case study regarding a disused industrial plant contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heavy hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls. The site is characterized by three different topographical levels. Therefore both the characterization and the conceptual model had to be adapted to the site conditions: we divided the site into three discrete areas and we developed a separate risk assessment for each area. Besides health risk assessment, we performed ecological risk assessment for both groundwater and surface water targets, as required by Italian regulations. The future reuse scenario has not yet been defined and, consequently, risk assessment results will be useful for the remediation program. Risk assessment was supported by leaching tests and hydrocarbon "finger printing". Leaching tests allowed us to determine site-specific soil-water partition coefficient. Hydrocarbon "finger printing" allowed us to differentiate the mobility of the different hydrocarbon groups in migration analyses. We found the site required remediation based on Italian standard. We propose a simple risk-based remediation action consisting in the replacement of the upper 1 m with "clean" soil and the placement of a barrier to vapors. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We investigated the response of lacustrine testate amoeba communities to 20(th) century environmental changes in Lake Zhangdu, China. The lake and surrounding region have undergone dramatic changes in the past century, including the expansion of agricultural and industrial activities, and associated hydrological modifications that led to the isolation of the lake from Yangtze River. We assessed the potential effects of these activities on testate amoeba communities of the lake by examining subfossil assemblages in contiguous samples along a 35-cm long, Pb-210 dated sediment core. A total of 25 testate amoeba taxa belonging to 4 genera (Difflugia, Centropyxis, Neztelia, and Pentagonia) were encountered in the core. The largest change in the composition of testate amoeba communities occurred in the 1960s, coincident with the expansion of human activities in the watershed. Testate amoeba communities shifted from species characteristic of relatively oligotrophic lakes (e.g. Difflugia biwae, D. tuberspinifera and D. pristis) to species more common to mesotrophic and eutrophic systems (e.g. Difflugia oblonga, D. corona, D. smilion and D. lanceolata). Our results provide valuable baseline data on testate amoebae and water conditions before and after major 20(th) century human impact on the lake ecosystem. Lake Zhangdu was recently reconnected with the Yangtze River as part of ongoing conservation efforts, and future monitoring of testate amoeba communities could be used to inform management and assess restoration success.

AB  - A mineral deposit is a natural resource whose exergy can be calculated from a defined reference environment (RE). This RE can be compared to a thermodynamically dead planet, where all materials have reacted, dispersed and mixed. Like any substance, a mine is characterized by its quantity, chemical composition and concentration (ore grade). The mine's exergy measures the minimum (reversible) energy to extract and concentrate the materials from the RE to the conditions in the mine. And the mine's exergy replacement cost accounts for the actual exergy required to accomplish this, with available technologies. The exergy assessment of the natural resource wealth of the Earth defined from a RE is named as exergoecology. The aim of this paper is to prove the usefulness of these two indicators for assessing the degradation of mineral deposits over history. As an example, the exergy decrease of US copper mines due to copper extraction throughout the 20th century has been determined. The results indicate that the exergy decrease was 65.4 Mtoe, while the exergy replacement cost 889.9 Mtoe. During the past century, the US extracted the equivalent of 2.5 and 1.2 times of its current national exergy reserves and base reserve of copper, respectively. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We investigated palaeoclimatic change in the Turkana Basin during the Pliocene climatic shift toward increased aridity in Africa. We analyzed the palaeoecology of this area using mammal faunas as environmental indicators. Twenty Plio-Pleistocene fossil assemblages and a comparative dataset of 16 modem localities covering a wide range of climatic and ecological conditions across Africa were analyzed. We constructed community profiles using taxonomic variables which reflect ecological information. Principal component analysis and bivariate correlation were used to study changes in the community structure of these mammalian faunas and to draw palaeoenvironmental inferences. Subsequently, least-squares regressions yielded climatic estimates (annual rainfall and drought length) for the studied period. An additional set of 8 modem faunas was used to validate these regression models. The climatic estimates showed a drying trend throughout the sequence. The biomes in the Turkana Basin changed from semi-evergreen rain forest to deciduous woodland and savanna during the middle-late Pliocene. This was the most important climatic shift detected in our study. Evidence suggests a continuous presence of savannas from 2.5 million years ago onwards. This pattern of climatic change is consistent with isotopic evidence on global climate, and with independently derived regional palaeoenvironmental evidence (i.e., micromammals, palaeovegetation, soil carbonates and palaeosols).

AB  - An integrated biological-chemical survey of organotin compounds was carried out in Guanabara Bay, the second most important Brazilian harbor complex. The biological survey revealed high levels of imposex in Stramonita haemastoma populations. Inside the bay values of relative penis length index from 42.7 to 107.6 and vas deferens sequence index from III to VI were found, while organisms collected outside the bay had values ranging from < 0.1 to 35.2 and from 0 to II. None of the females sampled inside the bay were normal and imposex was found in all stations. Surface sediments in the bay are contaminated by tributyltin (10-522 ng/ g d.w.) and triphenyltin (< 3.9 - 39.4 ng/g d.w.) with greater concentrations close to shipyards and marinas. The observed predominance of parent compounds (TBT and TPT) is commonly found when recent inputs occur, but may also indicate slow degradation processes in the anoxic conditions of these sediments. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a combined imposex-sediment approach to evaluate organotin contamination in marine environments of South America, and also the first report of TPT detection in environmental matrices in this region.

AB  - This study evaluated clams as bioindicators of fecal protozoan contamination using three approaches: (i) clam tissue spiking experiments to compare several detection techniques; (ii) clam tank exposure experiments to evaluate clams that had filtered Cryptosporidium oocysts from inoculated water under a range of simulated environmental conditions; (iii) sentinel clam outplanting to assess the distribution and magnitude of fecal contamination in three riverine systems in California. Our spiking and tank experiments showed that direct fluorescent antibody (DFA), immunomagnetic separation (IMS) in combination with DFA, and PCR techniques could be used to detect Cryptosporidium in clam tissues. The most analytically sensitive technique was IMS concentration with DFA detection of oocysts in clam digestive gland tissues, which detected 10 oocysts spiked into a clam digestive gland 83% of the time. In the tank experiment, oocyst dose and clam collection time were significant predictors for detecting Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts in clams. In the wild clam study, Cryptosporidium and Giardia were detected in clams from all three study regions by IMS-DFA analysis of clam digestive glands, with significant variation by sampling year and season. The presence of C parvum DNA in clams from riverine ecosystems was confirmed with PCR and DNA sequence analysis. (C) 2005 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - 1 Coleomegilla maculata DeGeer feeds on corn pollen in the field, but the degree to which this predator relies on corn pollen as part of its diet is not well understood. We quantified the amount of pollen consumed by C. maculata second, third and fourth instars and adults in the field.
   2 Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the digestion rate and duration of different stadia or stages using temperature regimens that reflected field conditions during anthesis. Coleomegilla maculata larvae and adults were collected from the field and the amount of pollen in their digestive tracts was determined gravimetrically. The rate of digestion, duration of each life stage and the field observations were used to estimate the amount of pollen consumed by second, third and fourth instars and adults.
   3 Our models estimate that larvae consume 0.66, 1.67 and 3.30 mg of pollen during the second, third and fourth stadia, respectively. Adults consumed an estimated 13.15 mg during anthesis.
   4 The relevance of our results to ecological risk assessment of transgenic insecticidal corn and predator life history strategies is discussed. The results presented here are a first attempt to quantify pollen consumption by a predator, and future areas of research are suggested.

AB  - Developmental stability reflects the ability of a genotype to undergo stable development of a phenotype under given environmental conditions. Deviations from developmental stability arise from the disruptive effects of a wide range of environmental and genetic stresses, and such deviations are usually measured in terms of fluctuating asymmetry and phenodeviants. Fluctuating asymmetry is the most sensitive indicator of the ability to cope with stresses during ontogeny. There is considerable evidence that developmental stability, and especially fluctuating asymmetry, is a useful measure of phenotypic and genetic quality, because it covaries negatively with performance in multiple fitness domains in many species, including humans. It is proposed that developmental stability is an important marker of human health. Our goal is to initiate formally the integration of the sciences of evolutionary biology, developmental biology and medicine. We believe that this integrative framework provides a significant addition to the growing field of Darwinian medicine. The literature linking developmental stability and disease in humans is reviewed. Recent biological theoretical treatments pertaining to developmental stability are applied to a range of human health issues such as genetic diseases, ageing and survival, subfertility, abortion, child maltreatment by parents, cancer, infectious diseases, physiological and mental health, and physical attractiveness as a health certification.

AB  - This study assessed the environmental and socioeconomic conditions of the La Cortadera moor in order to identify the environmental impacts to be considered in the provision of the carbon capture service. Using the methodology of the Secretaria Distrital de Medio Ambiente (2013) for environmental assessment and evaluation, two scenarios were proposed, the current and one with carbon credits, in order to compare how the provision of the capture service contributes to the recovery and conservation of the environment. Among the results, 82 impacts were identified in the current scenario, where significant, temporary and mitigable adverse impacts related to the anthropic activities carried out in the moor predominate; while in the scenario with carbon credits, 30 environmental impacts associated with the biotic, abiotic and socioeconomic environments were identified, of which 25 are positive and are classified mostly as significant and of high importance, linked to activities of administration of the protected area, institutionalism, research, generation of knowledge and strengthening of the socioeconomic and cultural component. According to the negative impacts of the current scenario (90%), the moor has been affected and fragmented to a considerable degree, mainly due to the expansion of the agricultural frontier. For this reason, as shown by the results in the scenario with carbon credits (83% positive impacts), the structuring of a protocol for the provision of the capture service in the ecosystem and the environmental management plan to

AB  - Generally, dinoflagellate cyst morphology is species specific. Their variability due to environmental factors (temperature and salinity) makes them potential proxies for such factors. However, there is a dearth of information on the variability of cystmorphology from monsoon-influenced coastal ecosystems. This study on distribution and variability in the dinocyst morphometry of Pyrophacus steinii and Protoperidinium pentagonum from estuarine (Cochin port and Zuari estuary) and marine (New Mangalore port) ecosystems along the Indian west coast revealed that both are common and euryhaline species. However, variability in cyst morphometry was observed and correlated salinity values between the ecosystems. Other parameters (i.e. the prevalence of narrow temperature ranges and nutrient-rich conditions) may not be dominant in influencing cysts morphometry. Cyst length, breadth and processes length (only in P. steinii) of both were relatively larger and smaller at salinity ranges higher and lower than 25 psu, respectively. The data presented for different ecosystems are comparable in most parameters except salinity variations. This study extends the ranges of records for both species. Pyrophacus steinii cysts were significantly larger (up to 120 mu m in Zuari estuary) than literature reports on cysts from higher salinity systems and salinity-related variability in P. pentagonum cyst size indicates notable potential proxy indicator of salinity.

AB  - The investigations of groundwater hydrograph reasonably reflect the aquifer response to recharge-discharge phenomenon and its characteristics. A better understanding of aquifer characteristics such as regional aquifer classification, recharge and discharge patterns, aquifer geology and flow patterns are the surface indicators that may be more effective and less costly for interpreting basic regional hydrogeological conditions and assessments. This study deals with the application of Hierarchical Clustering Analysis to understand the groundwater spatio-temporal patterns and to visualize/classify the nature of the aquifer in the regional area of Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. Groundwater level fluctuation patterns and slopes of rising and recession limbs are used to identify the pumping effects and classify aquifers. The results of clustering analysis show that the groundwater observation wells in the study area can be divided into five major characteristics along with the upstream to downstream of Kaoping River. The clusters are consistent with basic lithology distribution and age of sedimentary, which represents the characteristics of groundwater level fluctuation. The identified groundwater hydrographs patterns provide newer insights related to aquifer response to recharge-discharge phenomenon, types of aquifers and their behaviors. The knowledge of water level fluctuations in the observation wells provides a piece of prior information about the abstraction of groundwater. The proposed aquifer classification and pumping effect have great potential for applied use in groundwater management e.g., save drilling cost.

AB  - Benthic species and communities are linked to pelagic zooplankton through life-stages encompassing both benthic and pelagic habitats and through a mutual dependency on primary producers as a food source. Many zooplankton taxa contribute to the sedimentary system as benthic eggs. Our main aim was to investigate the nature of the population level biotic interactions between and within these two seemingly independent communities, both dependent on the pelagic primary production, while simultaneously accounting for environmental drivers (salinity, temperature, and oxygen conditions). To this end, we applied multivariate autoregressive state-space models to long (1966-2007) time series of annual abundance data, comparing models with and without interspecific interactions, and models with and without environmental variables included. We were not able to detect any direct coupling between sediment-dwelling benthic taxa and pelagic copepods and cladocerans on the annual scale, but the most parsimonious model indicated that interactions within the benthic community are important. There were also positive residual correlations between the copepods and cladocerans potentially reflecting the availability of a shared resource or similar seasonal dependence, whereas both groups tended to correlate negatively with the zoobenthic taxa. The most notable single interaction within the benthic community was a tendency for a negative effect of Limecola balthica on the amphipods Monoporeia affinis and Pontoporeia femorata which can help explain the observed decrease in amphipods due to increased competitive interference.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate physical-chemical and microbial indicators of indoor air quality in three nursing houses (NHs) located in rural areas of the northeast of Portugal. The parameters were measured during two campaigns (winter and summer), twice a day, and in four distinct spaces for spatial variability assessment: dining room, living room, double bedroom and outdoor of the NHs. Physical-chemical indicators were assessed by using a Graywolf IQ 610 probe. Airborne microbial levels were evaluated by direct impaction to the culture media, and subsequently, the microorganisms were identified molecularly. Mean concentrations of physical-chemical (with the exception of total volatile organic compounds, TVOCs) and microbial indicators did not exceed the legal limits. Overall, in all NHs, the indoor-to-outdoor (I/O) concentration ratios of chemical and biological pollutants were <= 1 in the summer, while in the winter were > 1. Bacillus, Micrococcus and Staphylococcus were the dominant bacterial genera, and Aspergillus, Cladosporium and Penicillium were the dominant fungal genera. The diversity of species was higher in summer. The main results suggest that a good air quality prevails in all studied spaces, although conditions less desirable have been identified in winter, indicating the need to deepen the study of air quality in these places, since these are occupied by elderly people who are more susceptible to infections.

AB  - In this study, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology was combined with the agro-ecosystem model DNDC to assess the climate and eutrophication impacts of perennial grass cultivation at five different sites in Sweden. The system was evaluated for two fertilisation rates, 140 and 200 kg N ha(-1). The climate impact showed large variation between the investigated sites. The largest contribution to the climate impact was through soil N2O emissions and emissions associated with mineral fertiliser manufacturing. The highest climate impact was predicted for the site with the highest clay and initial organic carbon content, while lower impacts were predicted for the sandy loam soils, due to low N2O emissions, and for the silty clay loam, due to high carbon sequestration rate. The highest eutrophication potential was estimated for the sandy loam soils, while the sites with finer soil texture had lower eutrophication potential. According to the results, soil properties and weather conditions were more important than fertilisation rate for the climate impact of the system assessed. It was concluded that agro-ecosystem models can add a spatial and temporal dimension to environmental impact assessment in agricultural LCA studies. The results could be used to assist policymakers in optimising use of agricultural land.

AB  - Natural grasslands are being progressively degraded around the world due to human-induced action (e.g., overgrazing), but there is neither a widely accepted conceptual framework to approach degradation studies nor a clear definition of what grassland degradation is. Most of the drivers, processes, and consequences related to grassland degradation are widespread and are usually separately quoted in the literature. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework with different conceptual categories, for monitoring grassland degradation, and a new definition based on current ones. We provide a conceptual update of grassland degradation based on a literature review and an expert survey, focused on the Rio de la Plata grasslands (RPG). We identified drivers as external forces or changes that cause degradation; processes as measurable changes in grasslands conditions that can be evaluated using indicators; and consequences as the impacts or results of the process of grassland degradation. We expect that this conceptual framework will contribute to monitoring programs, to support management decisions, to design conservation measures, and to communicate the importance of grasslands conservation and the different concepts involved. Particularly for RPG, we expect that this paper will contribute to promote sustainable management practices in this important and often neglected ecosystem.

AB  - Characterization of long-term processes occurring during alteration of aluminoborosilicate glasses is relevant for natural as well as man-made materials. Static dissolution tests are a common setup for such studies, but the obtained results and related errors are impacted by the frequency and protocol of samplings performed to determine release via solution analysis, e.g., ICP-OES. A noninvasive method was developed to continuously monitor glass alteration based on in situ Raman spectrometry of the solution contained in the alteration vessel. The alteration of a benchmark glass, the environment assessment (EA) glass, for 7 days at 90 degrees C showed that the pH and boron concentration results obtained from solution monitoring and ICP-OES quantification were similar to the pH and boron results obtained from chemometric modeling of the Raman spectra and within error of previously published results in similar conditions. The errors on altered amounts of glass based on B release were similar for both in situ Raman and ICP-OES. The new Raman method provides a more detailed picture of real time monitoring of an alteration experiment, with intervals between monitoring times as short as dozens of seconds. The in situ Raman method also helps to reduce perturbation to experiments caused by the physical sampling of aliquots (including temperature excursions, re equilibration with atmosphere, volume variation, and potential chemical contamination) by limiting their number and frequency.

AB  - The Passauna catchment is part of the Upper Iguacu watershed and includes a water supply reservoir for over 500,000 inhabitants of Curitiba metropolitan region. The aim of this study was to establish the state of reservoir water quality, and whether it has undergone any recent medium-and long-term variations. A physical-chemical-biological assessment was undertaken using nine indicators and three indexes: Water Quality Index (WQI), Trophic State Index (TSI) and Shannon-Weaver Index (H') for macroinvertebrate diversity. Compliance with the prescribed quality standards for the water body was verified using frequency curves. Two WQI calculation approaches were contrasted to test for conditions of partial data unavailability. Temporal trends in key parameters were assessed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. WQI results from 1991-2014 indicated that the water quality may be classified as good and improved in the final decade of such period, while most TSI results were in the oligotrophic/mesotrophic range, but with no significant temporal trend. The biodiversity result of H'=1.6 obtained with data acquired in 2014 indicated a moderately degraded ecosystem that is typically associated with flow regulation and a degree of water quality impairment. Such a multi-indicator integrated physical-chemical-biological monitoring approach comprised a robust framework for assessments of medium-long term aquatic health.

AB  - Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) System, which embodies the "prevention principle" of the environmental law, is an important tool for environmental protection. This tool has a special importance for Turkey due to its extremely distinctive ecological conditions. Turkish Environmental Law was first accepted by Turkish Parliament in 1983. In order to assign the EIA procedure to the concrete principles, and determine the application rules, the first version of the EIA Regulation was introduced in 1993. It was then revised in 1997 to eliminate the problems arising during practice and provide an efficient application. Later, the EIA Regulation was rearranged again in 2002 within the scope of the compliance studies with the European Union (EU) acquisition. After one year of this arrangement, the regulation was rearranged again but in 2004 and 2008 one more arrangement was made to the regulation. Among the EU harmonization process, one more revision was required and the final version of the regulation became valid in 2014 because of the cancelation of some articles by the Constitutional Court. While all the revisions are useful for the investors, the environmental issues are overlooked. Recently the increasing number of hydropower projects in Turkey further has proved the role and importance of EIA. In this article, the contradictions among EIA and environmental problems in hydropower projects of Turkey especially and developing countries generally are discussed. Moreover, this article aims to reveal the obvious irregularities in EIA applications of hydro projects.

AB  - The paper reports a technique used to construct a reference time series for the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically-active radiation (FAPAR) based on remotely-sensed data in the largest Russian arid wetland territory. For the arid Volga-Akhtuba wetlands, FAPAR appears to be an informative spectral index for estimating plant cover health and its seasonal and annual dynamics. Since FAPAR algorithms are developed for multiple satellite sensors, all FAPAR-based models are suggested to be universal and useful for future studies and long-term monitoring of plant cover, particularly in wetlands. The model developed in the present work for FAPAR temporal dynamics clearly reflects the field-observed seasonal and annual changes of plant cover in the Volga-Akhtuba floodplain wetlands. Various types of wetland plant communities were categorized by the specific parameters of the model seasonal vegetation curve. In addition, the values derived from the model function allow quantitative estimation of wetland plant cover health. This information is particularly important for the Volga-Akhtuba floodplain, because its hydrological regime is regulated by the Volzhskaya hydropower plant. The ecosystem is extremely fragile and sensitive to human impact, and wetland plant cover health is a key indicator of regulatory efficiency. The present study is another step towards developing a methodology focused on arid wetland vegetation monitoring and conservation of its biodiversity and natural conditions.

AB  - Spatio-temporal changes in macrozoobenthic assemblage structure were monitored at 8 stations in a river-affected temperate lagoon (Idoura Lagoon, Japan) from May 1997 to May 1998 to assess animal environment relationships in estuarine soft-bottom habitats. A total of 29 taxa occurred with a predominance of a few polychaete species including Heteromastus cf. similis, Hediste spp., Pseudopolydora cf. kempi and Prionospio japonica. The community structure differed significantly among four habitat types that were characterized by different salinity, sediment characteristics, and/or bottom elevation. For each habitat, macrozoobenthic community structure changed significantly with time, which was discriminated mostly by the lower density of polyhaline opportunistic species such as P. cf. kempi in warmer period. The salinity in the study area was much lower from May to September, mainly due to irrigation discharge from paddy fields, which seemed to be a lethal factor for the polyhaline species. C/N ratio and delta(13)C value of the sediment implied the accumulation of river-derived organic matters during the high river flow period. Present results showed the significant effects of fluctuating river discharge on the estuarine soft-bottom habitats, suggesting a linkage among terrestrial, riverine and estuarine ecosystems.

AB  - A new annual bottom-up emission inventory of criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases from on-road mobile sources was developed for 2006 for the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires, Argentina, within a four-year regional project aimed at providing tools for chemical weather forecast in South America. Under the scarcity of local emission factors, we collected data from measuring campaigns performed in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Colombia and compiled a data set of regional emission factors representative of Latin American fleets and driving conditions. The estimated emissions were validated with respect to downscaled national estimates and the EDGAR global emission database. Our results highlight the role of older technologies accounting in average for almost 80% of the emissions of all species. he area exhibits higher specific emissions than developed countries, with figures two times higher for criteria pollutants. We analyzed the effect on emissions of replacing gasoline by compressed natural gas, occurring in Argentina since 1995. We identified (i) a relationship between number of vehicles and a compound socioeconomic indicator, and (ii) time-lags in vehicle technologies between developed and developing countries, which can be respectively applied for spatial disaggregation and the development of projections for other Latin American cities. The results may also be employed to complement global emission inventories and by local policy makers as an environmental management tool. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Existing models of local damage in a beam element are usually formulated its a damage in a single element, and the coupling effect between adjacent damages is simply ignored. This coupling effect is larger in the case of a fine mesh of finite elements or when there is a high density of damage in the structure. This paper studies such effect from multiple cracks in a finite element in the dynamic analysis and local damage identification. The finite beam element is formulated using the composite element method [P. Zeng, Composite element method for vibration analysis of structure, Journal of Sound and Vibration 218 (1999) 619-696] with a one-member-one-element configuration with cracks where the interaction effect between cracks in the same element is automatically included. The accuracy and convergence speed of the proposed model in computation are compared with existing models and experimental results. The parameter of the Christides and Barr [One dimensional theory of cracked Bernoulli-Euler beams, International Journal of Mechanical Science 26 (1984) 639-648] crack model is found needing adjustment with the use of the proposed model. The response sensitivity-based approach of damage identification is then applied in the identification of single and multiple crack damages with both Simulated and experimental data. Results obtained are found very accurate even under noisy environment. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Surficial sediments of three northern Egyptian lakes (Manzala, Burullus and Edku) show differences in diatom assemblages deposited in different sites of these lakes. A total of 172 species and varieties belonging to 58 genera were identified and counted from 62 samples. Of these, 163 diatom taxa were recorded from Manzala Lake sediments, 147 taxa were found in Burullus Lake sediments, and 117 taxa were identified in Edku Lake sediments. The considerable variation in the composition and distribution of the diatom assemblages among these lakes was mainly related to differences in the water quality, salinity, the concentration of nutrients and climatic changes. The planktonic diatom Cyclotella meneghiniana was dominant in the majority of the samples from Manzala Lake, but dominant in only a few samples from the middle parts of Burullus and Edku lakes. The non-planktonic epiphytic taxa Cocconeis placentula and Epithemia sorex were the subdominant species in the surface sediments, especially in shallow and marginal parts of the lakes. Multivariate statistical techniques (hierarchical ascending clustering and canonical correspondence analysis) were used to identify ecological groups of diatoms and to investigate which environmental variables were important in explaining the variation between these groups. Eight ecological groups containing distinctive diatom assemblages reflect current environmental conditions; especially saltwater intrusion in the north and nutrient-rich freshwater in the south.

AB  - An investigation into phytoplankton and periphyton algal communities of two recently constructed stormwater management ponds suggests that stormwater impacts on biological communities are reduced during passage through the ponds, providing a degree of protection for biological communities in their receiving waters. In both ponds, disturbance effects from the incoming stormwater on algal community richness and evenness appear to be greatest in the sediment forebay and are reduced in the main pond. However, the nature of the disturbance in the two systems can be seen to be fundamentally different from a biological perspective, with Rouge Pond functioning primarily to reduce toxins harmful to algal communities (e.g, heavy metals), and Harding Pond acting to reduce nutrients. The taxonomic composition of the two sites provides an indication of the quality of the incoming stormwater. Rouge Pond, which contains many marine and brackish water species, receives stormwater runoff from a major highway, while Harding Pond, containing more nutrient rich species, receives stormwater primarily from residential properties. Despite the nutrient-rich conditions present in both ponds, nuisance blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) are conspicuously absent, and the ponds appear to have little potential for developing harmful algal blooms. The lack of blue-green algae can be linked to the hydraulic functioning of the ponds, suggesting that stormwater facilities may be engineered to inhibit undesirable algal communities.

AB  - Testate amoebae are widely used in palaeoecological studies as indicators (proxies) of environmental conditions in mires and freshwater ecosystems. The goal of this work was to identify patterns in the dynamics of the species composition of testate amoeba assemblages during a "waterbody-mire" succession. This study was performed using multiproxy analysis of the deposits in Mochulya Bog, Kaluga oblast, European Russia. To explain changes in the species composition of testate amoebae, we used data on the plant macrofossil composition, peat humification, and the loss on ignition, together with the results of radiocarbon dating and pollen analysis. The deposit was formed by the sediments of the waterbody, with rich fen and poor fen. The age at the base of the deposits was 4100 cal. yr. BP. Changes in the species composition of testate amoeba assemblages were largely determined by local vegetation, especially Sphagnum mosses, which significantly transform the environment. The transformation of the waterbody into a rich fen may have most likely occurred as a result of climatic (allogeneic) factors: short-term drying and wildfires that might have led to the overgrowth of the shore. The transformation of the rich fen to a poor fen could have been related to the effects of both autogenic (accumulation of the deposits) and allogeneic factors (decrease in human activity in the adjacent area).

AB  - Understanding the distribution of natural and artificial oases is essential for effective management of desert oases and water resources in arid regions. In order to explore characterization of Oases, we developed an ensemble method for the identification of factors influencing the distribution of oases in the upper reaches of the Tarim River Basin (TRB), China. To determine the affected elements of artificial and natural oases in arid lands through multi-function choices from 1990 to 2020, the Oases Integrated Analysis Model (OIAM) was used. The following input data was included in the OIAM: meteorological conditions, salinity, depth of groundwater, time sequence of Landsat images, and environmental chemicals such as calcium, bicarbonate, potassium, sodium, sulfate, and fluoride ions. Several functional methods were used to assess the efficiency of the OIAM. The results indicated that the OIAM consistently outperformed stable Wi (spatial contribution rate to Oases' indicators). Moreover, the results from OIAM indicated that salinity and meteorological indicators influenced the spatial distribution of artificial and natural oases. For environmental chemical, Na and Mg ions were strongly associated with the distribution of artificial and natural oases, respectively. This indicates that the OIAM model effectively identifies factors influencing the distribution of artificial and natural oases in arid regions, and thus can be applied to other similar regions.

AB  - Permafrost distribution maps are of importance for environmental assessment, climate system modeling, and practical engineering applications. The scarcity of forcing data and parameters often limits the uses of permafrost models over large areas. However, detailed data are often available in a few subregions through field investigations. In this study, we propose a novel approach for mapping permafrost distribution in a large and data-scarce area using an empirical model with subregion permafrost maps and satellite data as inputs. The surface frost number model (FROSTNUM) was re-inferred to include an extra soil parameter to represent the thermal and moisture conditions in soils. The optimal soil parameters were determined from the subregion maps of permafrost distribution through spatial clustering, parameter optimization, and the decision tree method. FROSTNUM was fed with satellite-derived ground surface freezing and thawing indices to map the permafrost distribution over the study area. The proposed approach was evaluated in the Gaize area on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, where intensive field studies have been done. The simulated permafrost distribution is consistent with a map of permafrost distribution made from borehole observations and field surveys in Gaize. Due to excellent accuracy, the approach is effective and can be used in large areas with limited data.

AB  - Regional development is a complex process that can be analysed in various contexts, including environmental, social and economic factors. Variations in the levels of development are naturally observed across countries and regions, but they play a special role in trans-border regions. The aim of this study is to investigate differences in the level of development of two Polish voivodships (Warmia and Mazury, and Podlasie) and two Lithuanian counties (Marijampole and Alytus) which are trans-border regions (NUTS 4 level). The study was conducted by analysing three subordinate criteria, namely environmental, social and economic factors, as well as the overall development of the evaluated regions with the use of the analytical hierarchy process and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution methods. The evaluated trans-border regions are characterised by a predominance of rural areas and considerable variations in development. The entire area is characterised by high natural value. This is an important observation because the condition of the natural environment is a key determinant of well-being, and it directly influences the quality of life. The analysis revealed considerable demographic problems, mainly in Lithuanian regions, resulting from low population growth and a negative net migration rate which influence population structure. Disproportions in regional development call for regional policies that are adapted to local needs and resources.

AB  - The work uses the statistical analysis methods for selecting the parent components for winter wheat hybridization. The research was performed in 2005-2016 in the conditions of the Central Chernozem Region. The research object included the varieties of soft winter wheat of various ecological and geographical origins; in different years, with 200-350 varieties. To assess the morpho-biological diversity of genotypes, the authors have tested various methods of statistical data analysis using Statistica (R) 6.1, i.e. cluster analysis (sequential dichotomy, k-means clustering, and hierarchical classification) and neural network data processing (Cohen network). It is found that the k-means method (without limiting the number of groups) provides the most satisfactory results for forming the clusters of genotypes characterized by similar morphological and biological characteristics and used as parent material for selection of soft winter wheat. In this respect, the clustering of varieties is affected by three attributes, i.e., the length of seedling-earing period, plant height, and weight per 1,000 grains. For hybridization crosses, the parent components are selected with the account of their belonging to different clusters. The crossing is performed between the varieties with contrasting characteristics. The k-means method to plan crosses allows obtaining valuable winter wheat hybrids characterized by polymorphism, favorable transgressions, high productivity, winter hardiness, and lodging resistance.

AB  - Odonata species are sensitive to environmental changes, particularly those caused by humans, and provide valuable ecosystem services as intermediate predators in food webs. We aimed: (i) to investigate the distribution patterns of Odonata in streams on a nationwide scale across South Korea; (ii) to evaluate the relationships between the distribution patterns of odonates and their environmental conditions; and (iii) to identify indicator species and the most significant environmental factors affecting their distributions. Samples were collected from 965 sampling sites in streams across South Korea. We also measured 34 environmental variables grouped into six categories: geography, meteorology, land use, substrate composition, hydrology, and physicochemistry. A total of 83 taxa belonging to 10 families of Odonata were recorded in the dataset. Among them, eight species displayed high abundances and incidences. Self-organizing map (SOM) classified sampling sites into seven clusters (A-G) which could be divided into two distinct groups (A-C and D-G) according to the similarities of their odonate assemblages. Clusters A-C were characterized by members of the suborder Anisoptera, whereas clusters D-G were characterized by the suborder Zygoptera. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) identified forest (%), altitude, and cobble (%) in substrata as the most influential environmental factors determining odonate assemblage compositions. Our results emphasize the importance of habitat heterogeneity by demonstrating its effect on odonate assemblages.

AB  - The response of phytoplankton assemblages to the closure of urban sewage outfalls (USOs) was examined for the Mar Piccolo of Taranto (Mediterranean Sea), a productive semi-enclosed coastal marine ecosystem devoted to shellfish farming. Phytoplankton dynamics were investigated in relation to environmental variables, with a particular emphasis on harmful algal blooms (HABs). Recent analyses evidenced a general reduction of the inorganic nutrient loads, except for nitrates and silicates. Also phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) and abundances were characterized by a decrease of the values, except for the inner area of the basin (second inlet). The phytoplankton composition changed, with nano-sized species, indicators of oligotrophic conditions, becoming dominant over micro-sized species. If the closure of the USOs affected phytoplankton dynamics, however, it did not preserve the Mar Piccolo from HABs and anoxia crises. About 25 harmful species have been detected throughout the years, such as the potentially domoic acid producers Pseudo-nitzschia ef. galaxiae and Pseudo-nitzschia ef. multistriata, identified for the first time in these waters. The presence of HABs represents a threat for human health and aquaculture. Urgent initiatives are needed to improve the communication with authorities responsible for environmental protection, economic development, and public health for a sustainable mussel culture in the Mar Piccolo.

AB  - This contribution characterises the sources and distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in sediments of the Basque coast (Bay of Biscay). Different source characterisation approaches (i.e. GIS assisted-chemometrics, PAH diagnostic ratios and analyses of composition profiles) were used in combination to successfully identify the factors determining the origin and distribution of PAHs. Urban/industrial combustion processes were identified as the main PAH source. However, the analysis of PAH composition patterns and diagnostic ratios identified secondary natural and petrogenic PAH sources on small spatial scales. The median n-ary sumation 18PAH concentration ranged from 66 mu gkg(-1) (d.w.) to 7021 mu gkg(-1) (d.w.). The Ibaizabal estuary, which supports most of the anthropogenic pressure in the region (i.e. urban development, industrialisation, commercial and recreational harbours), also showed the highest PAH concentrations. On the shelf, human activities, hydrodynamic conditions and geomorphological features led to spatial differences in the PAH concentrations among sectors: the offshore and west sectors were characterised by higher concentrations, while the lowest values were found in the mid and east sectors. The results enhance the knowledge on PAH-related contamination processes and could be used to support the environmental assessment process required under current European marine legislation.

AB  - The mangrove's sediments from the coastal areas under human activities may contain significant contaminations by hydrocarbons, even when there are no visual evidences of it. The microorganisms are essential to these ecosystems, especially in the control of their chemical environment. Sediment samples were collected in two regions under different environment conditions (pristine and contaminated) of the Paranagua Estuarine Complex (Paranagua Bay and Laranjeiras Bay), Brazil. Aliphatic hydrocarbons were determined by the GC-FID to assess the status of contamination of the studied areas. The total DNA was extracted from these samples. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified by the PCR reactions with the pair of primers 21F and 958R for the archaeal domain, and 27F and 1492R for the bacterial domain. Comparisons of communities were made by the ARDRA technique, using the HinfI restriction enzyme. The phosphate concentration showed significant differences between the two regions. The aliphatic hydrocarbons analysis showed the presence of unresolved complex mixture (UCM), an indicator of oil contamination, in the samples from the Paranagua Bay, which was corroborated by the concentration of total aliphatic hydrocarbons. The ARDRA profile indicated that the structure of archaeal and bacterial communities of the sampled areas was very similar. Therefore, the anthropogenic influences in the Paranagua Bay showed to be not sufficient to produce disturbances in the prokaryotic dominant groups.

AB  - In accordance with the Water Framework Directive guidelines (WFD, 2000, European Communities Official Journal L327 2000/60/EC), classification schemes and ecological evaluation tools (based on benthic invertebrate fauna data sets from 1990 to 2002) were applied in the lower Mondego estuary. Two distinct scenarios could be tested due to the implementation of mitigation practices in 1999, following a long eutrophication process, which started by the early 1980s. Some discrepancies in the results were found by the application of the different indices. The AMBI index (accounting for taxonomic composition) and the ABC method (accounting for abundance and biomass k-dominance patterns) classifications often disagreed with those based on species diversity (Margalef and Shannon-Wiener). The ambiguous results made the classification a complex task to achieve, contrary to the Directive's objective of maintaining it simple and clear. Our results suggest the necessity of adjusting some of the indices and their ranges to estuarine characteristics, namely to account the typical dominance and abundance of some particular species. These aspects are not taken into consideration by some of the indices proposed, which are more adapted to typical marine conditions. Based on our results, these widely applied indices might still improve their efficiency in estuarine systems allowing their use in the resembling types already established within the new Directive agenda.

AB  - An understanding of microbial biomass and microbial activity as part of belowground processes as affected by elevated CO2 is crucial in order to predict the long-term response of ecosystems to climatic changes. The ratio of biomass C to soil organic C (Cmic:Corg), the metabolic quotient (the specific soil respiration of the microbial biomass, qCO(2)), the C mineralization quotient (the fraction of total organic C mineralized throughout the incubation, qM), the microbial biomass change rate quotient (qC) and soil inorganic nitrogen content were determined on soil samples taken during 3 years (Fall 2000-Fall 2003) in a poplar plantation exposed to increased atmospheric CO, by means of FACE (Free Air CO2 Enrichment) technique and nitrogen fertilization. A competition for nitrogen between plants and microrganisms, stronger in FACE plots, induced a stress condition within microbial community. FACE treatment provided C for microbial growth (Cmic:Corg), but reducing nitrogen availability, led to a higher microbial loss over time (qC). Nitrogen fertilization decreased microbial mortality lowering energetic maintenance requirements (qCO(2)) and induced a short-term shift in favour of microrganisms more rapid in the use of the resources. The C mineralization quotient (qM) was not affected by either FACE nor fertilization treatment meaning that the fraction of total organic carbon mineralized during the incubation period did not vary significantly.

AB  - There is an increasing call for tools that provide insight into the complex nature of agricultural systems and that deal with a broad range of sustainability issues related to policy intervention, technological innovations, and changes in environmental conditions (e.g., climate change). Sustainability indicators are useful, but only if their number is limited and the interactions between indicators are taken into consideration. In this context, we propose a methodology for an integrated analysis of tradeoffs between economic and environmental indicators. The analysis to quantify these relationships should be based on a multi-disciplinary approach and as such requires the usage of bio-physical as well as econometric-process simulation models. The communication between these very different models is based on explicit definitions of spatial and temporal scales and model integration software. The methodology is based on spatially explicit econometric simulation models linked to spatially referenced bio-physical simulation models to simulate land use and input use decisions. The methodology has been applied for the potato-pasture production system in the Ecuadorian Andes. Results of the analysis are presented in the form of tradeoff curves between different indicators, but also as maps, and risks diagrams. Besides an analysis of the current status, the approach allows for the analysis of alternative scenarios showing the effect of those scenarios on the position and slope of the tradeoff curve.

AB  - Evaluation of arable land ecosystem services capacity and arable land-use intensity (ALUI) is important for recognising key regional factors that impact arable land attributes changes, which is crucial for planning sustainable patterns of arable land use. The chronic lack of coordination between these two types of evaluation studies has made it hard to provide enough information for developing arable land-use management and control policies. Here, we generated a 1-km-grid map of arable land potential yield and county-level arable land productive-capacity. The impact of land-use and land-cover change on county-level total arable land productive-capacity during 1990-2010 had been estimated. Then we determined the aggregation-distribution characteristics of four indexes (i.e. average arable land potential yield, average ALUI, total arable land area and arable land productive-capacity reserves) at the county-level by the k-means algorithm to assess the regional coordination between arable land productive-capacity protection and arable land use. The results show that during 1990-2010, land-use change led to arable land productive-capacity decreases in 2007 of China's 2733 counties (nearly 73.5% of the total counties' count). Most of these counties are in central and southern China, and their corresponding arable land productive-capacity decrement rates are generally < 6.15%. Counties with decrement rates > 6.15% are mainly in the Yangtze and Pearl River delta regions. The geographical detector shows that county-level arable land-area change is a primary factor that drives county-level arable land productive-capacity increase. Its determinant power can be quantified as 74.154%. In contrast, its determinant power to county-level arable land productive-capacity decrease is only 38.542%, which demonstrates that occupy high-capacity arable land and supplement low-capacity arable land have a greater role in causing reduction of county arable land productive-capacity. Total arable land productive-capacity and use intensity show only slight determinant power to county-level arable land productive-capacity decrease. It indicates that insufficient attention has been paid to the protection of arable land productive-capacity and the farmers' willingness in the implementation of China requisition-compensation balance policy. The aggregation-distribution characteristics show that arable land productive-capacity protection is in coordination with arable land use for most of the provinces in China. Arable land with high or medium potential yield tends to be used at high or medium intensity. A lack of coordination is most evident in the insufficient ALUI, particularly in seven of the thirteen major grain-producing provinces. Other evidence of weak coordination is in the low potential yield versus high farming conditions and willingness, where unsuited planting modes should be prevented. Lastly, challenges for exploring sustainable arable land use path have been discussed. This study is greatly instructive for recognising interrelations between natural conditions and arable land-use patterns and for exploring shortcomings that impede regionally sustainable arable land use.

TI  - The effect of wind on pressure correction of the SANAE neutron monitor counting rate
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - The cosmic ray intensity as recorded by a neutron monitor varies with atmospheric pressure, and this effect must be corrected for before the observations can be used for astrophysical studies. These atmospheric-pressure corrections can be done quite accurately, except in windy conditions, when atmospheric pressure is no longer a good indicator of atmospheric thickness. The SANAE neutron monitor at Vesleskarvet is built in an extreme meteorological environment, with wind speeds regularly exceeding 160 km/h, and atmospheric pressure variations of almost 7% around the long-term average. This paper describes this wind problem and suggests a possible future way to circumvent it.

AB  - In order to define more clearly their role as water quality indicators in an area with marked trophic gradients, the occurrence of periphytic macroalgae and microalgae in some dutch polder ditches was examined. Analysis of data revealed a strong correlation between parameters related with trophic levels, e.g. phosphates, and species composition. It is argued that the ecological valuation of the filamentous macroalgae needs reconsideration. In moderately eutrophic conditions macroalgae can constitute a richly diversified component with many species, co-occurring with submersed macrophytes.

AB  - The scarcity of middle Holocene radiocarbon dates in different regions of the Andes has been interpreted as an indicator of discontinuity in human occupations in response to adverse environmental conditions due to marked aridity. In the subtropical Andes of north-central Chile and adjacent areas, this paucity has been detected in radiocarbon ages between 8000 and 6000 cal BP. A systematic programme of cave excavations with detailed chronologies in the Combarbala area in the Andean western foothills at 31 degrees S allows questioning the role these spaces and ecosystems played for hunter-gatherers throughout the Holocene. The elusive record of dateable material has been addressed by excavating deposits under rock-shelters which tend to trap sedimentary material. This dataset has been compared with the available climate records and shows a collation between the onset of various site chronologies during the early-to-middle Holocene and periods of extreme aridity. The organization of mobility and the role of Andean foothills for hunter-gatherer settlements is reviewed. Resource availability in the area, namely fresh water supply, good-quality toolstones, faunal resources, and shelters, attracted mobile populations to these environments as indicated by our records as well as others in the broader region.

AB  - The presence of urban green spaces (UGS) increases the human's contact with nature and provides numerous benefits to the society and the local environment. In this way, analyzing, planning and stimulating the implementation of UGS in cities is a fundamental action to improve the life quality of urban society. In this context, the aim was to analyze the situation and distribution of the green spaces of the universities cities of Lavras, Minas Gerais State (Brazil) and Newark, Delaware (USA). For data collection, researches performed field visits and used aerial photography to survey and analysis before calculating indicators including green area index (GAI) and green space ratio (GSR). The city of Lavras has a GAI of 0.54 m(2)inh(-1). The GSR value was 0.29%, not meeting the minimum of 5% required by local municipal law. Furthermore, there is a bad distribution of UGSs in the urban framework. However, in Newark, the distribution of UGSs is homogeneous and covers all regions of the city. The calculated GAI was 50.2 m(2)inh(-1) and the GSR has met the 7% minimum required by its Newark Municipal Law. When comparing the two cities, in different countries and conditions it is concluded that Newark (DE) presents UGS indicators, GAI (m(2)inh(-1)) and GSR (%), higher than the values obtained in Lavras (MG), indicating the need for Government actions to increase these values.

AB  - The economic importance of genetically improving feed efficiency has been recognized by cattle producers worldwide. It has the potential to considerably reduce costs, minimize environmental impact, optimize land and resource use efficiency, and improve the overall cattle industry's profitability. Feed efficiency is a genetically complex trait that can be described as units of product output (e.g., milk yield) per unit of feed input. The main objective of this review paper is to present an overview of the main genetic and physiological mechanisms underlying feed utilization in ruminants and the process towards implementation of genomic selection for feed efficiency in dairy cattle. In summary, feed efficiency can be improved via numerous metabolic pathways and biological mechanisms through genetic selection. Various studies have indicated that feed efficiency is heritable, and genomic selection can be successfully implemented in dairy cattle with a large enough training population. In this context, some organizations have worked collaboratively to do research and develop training populations for successful implementation of joint international genomic evaluations. The integration of "-omics" technologies, further investments in high-throughput phenotyping, and identification of novel indicator traits will also be paramount in maximizing the rates of genetic progress for feed efficiency in dairy cattle worldwide.

AB  - In planning for sustainable development of urban green space at the macro and regional levels, it is imperative to examine plant species of urban green spaces and to introduce new species considering climatic conditions, environmental pollution, industrial lifestyle, and resource limitations. The present study employs multi criteria decision making techniques to assess the existing and recommended plant species (trees, shrubs, and hedge plants) in downtown and marginal parks of Rasht City, Iran. Twenty seven indicators were defined in the context of six criteria, namely regional adaptation, urban environment, aesthetics, maintenance, growth characteristics, and specific advantages. Weights were assigned to the criteria using the entropy method. They were subsequently ranked by Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Combinative Distance-based Assessment (CODAS), Additive Ratio Assessment (ARAS), and Evaluation Based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) techniques. To provide a final ranking of the ornamental species, the results of these four techniques were integrated using average rank, Borda, and Copeland methods. Based on the results, Parrotia persica, Liquidambar styraciflua, Lagerstroemia indica, Pyracantha coccinea, and Ligustrum texanum were ranked highest and Aesculus hippocastanum, Koelreuteria paniculata, Crataegus microphylla, Viburnum opulus, and Berberis gagnepainii were ranked lowest. Based on the detailed results, the assessment of trees, shrubs, and hedge plants can help decision makers and planners of urban green space development.

AB  - Seasonal variation of structural, physiological and growth indicators and the metabolome of the seagrass Cymodocea nodosa, as well as biogeochemical conditions of underlying sediment were studied in two meadows growing at increasing distance downstream from a fish farm in the Aegean Sea in order to assess seagrass performance under stress. Horizontal rhizome production decreased significantly with proximity to the fish farm (0.67 and 1.57 g DW m(-2) d(-1) close and far from the fish-farm, respectively). This coincided with observed effects on ecophyiological indicators, such as rhizome nitrogen, leaf carbon and leaf delta C-13, which were elevated with proximity to the fish-farm. Seasonality was shown by some indicators being elevated in either in the warm (C of all tissues and leaf delta S-34) or the cold period (N of all tissues). Growth promoting metabolites (sucrose, fructose, myo-inositol, heptacosane, tetracosane, stigmasterol, catechin and alpha-tocopherol) were lower close to the zone, whereas metabolites involved with stress-response (alanine, serine, proline, putrescine, ornithine, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid and cinnamic acid) were higher. We found that growth-promoting metabolites were positively correlated with horizontal rhizome production, whereas the metabolites related to stress were negatively correlated. Metabolomic fingerprinting of seagrass provides opportunities for early detection of environmental degradation in marine ecological studies.

AB  - Calibration of complex, process-based ecosystem models is a timely task with modellers challenged by many parameters, multiple outputs of interest and often a scarcity of empirical data. Incorrect calibration can lead to unrealistic ecological and socio-economic predictions with the modeller's experience and available knowledge of the modelled system largely determining the success of model calibration. Here we provide an overview of best practices when calibrating an Atlantis marine ecosystem model, a widely adopted framework that includes the parameters and processes comprised in many different ecosystem models. We highlight the importance of understanding the model structure and data sources of the modelled system. We then focus on several model outputs (biomass trajectories, age distributions, condition at age, realised diet proportions, and spatial maps) and describe diagnostic routines that can assist modellers to identify likely erroneous parameter values. We detail strategies to fine tune values of four groups of core parameters: growth, predator-prey interactions, recruitment and mortality. Additionally, we provide a pedigree routine to evaluate the uncertainty of an Atlantis ecosystem model based on data sources used. Describing best and current practices will better equip future modellers of complex, processed-based ecosystem models to provide a more reliable means of explaining and predicting the dynamics of marine ecosystems. Moreover, it promotes greater transparency between modellers and end-users, including resource managers.

AB  - This study proposes an optimized procedure for the determination of inorganic antimony species in natural waters using hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry (HG AFS) and continuous flow system. The variables of the hydride generation system, such as pre-reduction time, hydrochloric acid concentration and sodium tetrahydroborate concentration, were evaluated using full factorial design at two levels and Doehlert design. After optimized experimental conditions, the method allowed the determination of antimony with limits of detection and quantification of 9 and 30 ng L-1, respectively. The precision (RSD) of the method was < 5% and the accuracy was confirmed by the analysis of certified reference material (SLRS-4, River water for trace metals). The method was successfully applied for inorganic antimony speciation in water samples collected in Salvador City, Bahia State, Brazil. In mineral water, total Sb concentrations ranged from 0.26 to 0.30 mu g L-1, whereas the concentrations of Sb-III were below 0.03 mu g L-1. On the other hand, in natural surface waters, the quantifiable concentration of total Sb and Sb-III ranged from 0.41 to 1.23 mu g L-1 and 0.23 to 1.04 mu g L-1, respectively. The highest average concentrations of Sb were obtained in regions with the largest urban influence, ratifying the anthropogenic impact in water bodies.

AB  - Natural waters serve as habitat for a wide range of microorganisms, a proportion of which may be derived from fecal material. A number of watershed models have been developed to understand and predict the fate and transport of fecal microorganisms within complex watersheds, as well as to determine whether microbial water quality standards can be satisfied under site-specific meteorological and/or management conditions. The aim of this review is to highlight and critically evaluate developments in the modeling of microbial water quality of surface waters over the last 10 years and to discuss the future of model development and application at the watershed scale, with a particular focus on fecal indicator organisms (FIOs). In doing so, an agenda of research opportunities is identified to help deliver improvements in the modeling of microbial water quality draining through complex landscape systems. This comprehensive review therefore provides a timely steer to help strengthen future modeling capability of FIOs in surface water environments and provides a useful resource to complement the development of risk management strategies to reduce microbial impairment of freshwater sources.

AB  - The production of thermal and electrical energy is related to the emission of greenhouse gases, which are believed to cause climatic changes. The activities of the international community show an increase of ecological awareness. In the Central European countries the share of renewable energy in overall energy production is relatively small. One sector where some progress can be made is agriculture. This paper presents simulation results of CO2 reduction potential by replacing conventional heating system for a poultry house with a hybrid solar-wind system. Heat requirement for 2400 birds was calculated. Simple models for solar collector, wind turbine and heat storage tank are presented. The system is modelled in a Matlab/Simulink environment and various system configurations are analysed for climatic conditions typical for Central Europe. The solar collector area was varied between 0 and 80 m(2), wind turbine diameter was varied in the range of 0-20 m and 1 to 4 heat storage tanks. Apart from percentage of CO2 emission reduction two other indicators are introduced: renewable energy utilisation ratio and weighted CO2 emission reduction renewable energy utilisation coefficient. The results show that larger systems provide higher CO2 reduction but the energy utilisation ratio decreases. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Urban public health is an important global issue, and receives extensive attention. It is necessary to compare urban public health status among different cities, so that each city can define its own health patterns and limiting factors. The following assessment indicators were established to evaluate urban public health status: living conditions, physical health, education and culture, environmental quality, and social security. A weighted-sum model was used in combination with these indicators to compare the urban public health status in four cities-Beijing, New York, London, and Tokyo-using data for 2000-2009. Although the urban public health level of Beijing was lower than that of the other cities, it showed the greatest increase in this level over the study period. Different patterns of urban public health were identified: London had the most balanced, steady pattern (almost all factors performed well and developed stably); New York and Tokyo showed balanced, but unsteady patterns (most factors remained high, though social security and environmental quality fluctuated); Beijing had the most unbalanced, unsteady pattern (the different factors were at different levels, and education and culture and social security fluctuated). For enhanced urban public health status, environmental quality and education and culture clearly need to be improved in Beijing. This study demonstrates that a comparison of different cities is helpful in identifying limiting factors for urban public health and providing an orientation for future urban development.

AB  - Scientific work on ecosystem services has been growing globally as well as in Africa. Human dependence on provisioning ecosystem services in particular is mostly acknowledged in developing countries like those in Africa, where many people are poor and reliant on natural resources. The reliance of communites on natural resources in Africa varies from place to place as aridity, vegetation and socio-economic conditions change. In the humid and forested areas in the west and central parts of Africa, food and raw materials coupled with agriculture are important ecosystem services while in the dryer arid and semi-arid countries in southern and northern Africa, tourism, water and grazing are priorities. Overexploitation of resources coupled with large scale agriculture threatens both ecosystem services and livelihoods. The need to safeguard ecosystem services is urgent. There are some efforts to safeguard ecosystem services in Africa. However, realizing benefits to livelihoods still faces serious challenges due to climata change, recent land grabbing and urbanization. The challenges are compounded by the land tenure situation in Africa. Whilst policy goals have been established at both the international and national levels the implementation of such polices and likelihood of them leading to sustainable land management for delivery of ecosystem services remains a key challenge.

AB  - A documentation system for environmental farm management: requirements and demands Farm-specific advice and a reliable documentation tool can provide clear advantages for the improvement of success-oriented remuneration and funding of farms' environmental achievements. In order to fully exploit the benefits of such a software-supported environmental advisory system (e.g. standardized/ automated assessment and flexible ways of presentation), it is necessary to investigate the requirements of potential addressees beforehand. In this study, farmers as potential users were surveyed with regard to their attitudes and demands in relation to such a system. The study examined potential benefits for farmers as well as possible obstacles. Results show that the documentation of environmental achievements can be of interest for farmers under certain conditions. While the use of advisory services is actually rather low, most farmers remain open to using such software. It is seen that most benefits are obtained by documentation that provides functions for the presentation of environmental achievements but also supports the farmer in meeting reporting requirements related to direct payments and cross compliance. The most sought-after functionalities include the consideration of standards of good farming practice and cross compliance, information on funding, cartographic visualization, options for the assessment of nature conservation measures and an automated report generation. Thus, the following advantages should be generated for the farmers: safeguarding or increasing sales, improved external communication and presentation of environmental achievements and improved preparation for, or even reduction of, official inspections.

AB  - Local conditions have important effects on strategy-making processes in natural resources management and also in forestry. From this viewpoint, the aim of the paper is to investigate how the strategic priorities differ among local forestry services. Thus, the research was conducted on a regional forest directorate as a sample case that has seven forestry enterprises that have close locations. On the other hand, as it is known that disciplines related to natural resources management must consider multiple factors in stages of decision making and also maintain their activities in a dynamic structure. Thus, there is a need for an easily applicable and flexible method for strategy prioritization in these disciplines. Therefore the paper also aims to introduce a decision model adaptable and simply applicable for provincial forestry organizations.
   For this purpose, first of all SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis is proposed for identifying the related strategies. Then, the usage of a multi-criteria decision model based on an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method is utilized for assigning priorities to these strategies. The findings of the case study showed that local scale planning is the key factor for effective strategic planning. Moreover the AHP method used in the study has both apparent and easily applied characteristics.

AB  - In arid rangelands soil seed bank characteristics vary with rainfall patterns livestock pressure and habitat heterogeneity We investigated this issue by assessing spatio-temporal patterns in soil seed bank density and richness in a degraded (heavy grazing) and non-degraded (light grazing) Nama Karoo ecosystem To account for variation in seed distribution different microsites were compared and the effect of diaspore size on the patterning analyzed Long-term heavy grazing increased seed densities and species richness of the soil seed bank by favoring small-seeded and tiny-seeded annual species The spatial patterning of the soil seed bank was however similar to that found under sustainable grazing The overall seed distribution was dictated by the small-scale environmental heterogeneity which Interacted with diaspore size Our results suggest that the degraded environment is still efficient in controlling secondary dispersal and retaining seeds This is through low stature barriers like surface rocks which replace the function of grazing-sensitive perennial grasses in trapping and storing small diaspores Soil seed banks were persistent and accumulated readily-germinable seeds over time Observed temporal pattern across the study sites indicates that both condition and sequence of preceding rainfall seasons are likely to have a profound effect on soil seed banks of subsequent years (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB  - Five assemblages of benthic foraminifers reflecting the changes in the properties of the intermediate water masses and the biological productivity during different periods of the last glacial-interglacial cycle are defined based on the abundances and relative contents of indicative species in the upper 9 m of giant Core MD02-2529 from the Cocos Ridge. High bioproductivity and low oxygen content in the bottom water layer and sediments are established for the interstadial period based on the high abundance of the species Uvigerina peregrina, U. hispida, and C. pachyderma (Assemblage I) and especially for the Last Glacial Maximum (Assemblage II) with the dominant role of the same species and E. smithi. The transition from the glaciation to the current interglacial (Termination I, Assemblage III) is characterized by a high share of the epifaunal species C. wuellerstorfi and H. subhaidingeri, which indicates enhanced hydrodynamic activity and ventilation of the intermediate water washing the bottom. The end of Termination I was marked by strengthened selective dissolution of carbonate microfossils due to the increased influx of fresh organic matter to the bottom and/or advection of more aggressive intermediate waters. The diverse Early Holocene assemblage (Assemblage IV) points to variable ecological niches, while the abundance of the infaunal U. hispida in Assemblage V indicates low productivity of the surface waters and a low oxygen concentration in the bottom sediments of the Late Holocene.

AB  - Aim Many species are currently expanding their ranges in response to climate change, but the mechanisms underlying these range expansions are in many cases poorly understood. In this paper we explore potential climatic factors governing the recent establishment of new palm populations far to the north of any other viable palm population in the world.
   Location Southern Switzerland, Europe, Asia and the world.
   Methods We identified ecological threshold values for the target species, Trachycarpus fortunei, based on gridded climate data, altitude and distributional records from the native range and applied them to the introduced range using local field monitoring and measured meteorological data as well as a bioclimatic model.
   Results We identified a strong relationship between minimum winter temperatures, influenced by growing season length and the distribution of the palm in its native range. Recent climate change strongly coincides with the palm's recent spread into southern Switzerland, which is in concert with the expansion of the global range of palms across various continents.
   Main conclusions Our results strongly suggest that the expansion of palms into (semi-)natural forests is driven by changes in winter temperature and growing season length and not by delayed population expansion. This implies that this rapid expansion is likely to continue in the future under a warming climate. Palms in general, and T. fortunei in particular, are significant bioindicators across continents for present-day climate change and reflect a global signal towards warmer conditions.

AB  - Organic geochemistry and petrology of Eocene Suzak bituminous marl outcrop samples from Madr village in north-central Afghanistan were characterized via an integrated analytical approach to evaluate depositional environment and source rock potential. Multiple proxies suggest the organic-rich (TOC similar to 6 wt.%) bituminous marls are 'immature' for oil generation (e.g., vitrinite R-o < 0.4%, T-max < 425 degrees C, PI <= 0.05, C-29 alpha alpha alpha S/S + R <= 0.12, C-29 beta beta S/beta beta S+alpha alpha R <= 0.10, others), yet oil seeps are present at outcrop and live oil and abundant solid bitumen were observed via optical microscopy. Whole rock sulfur content is similar to 23 wt.% whereas sulfur content is similar to 5.0-5.6 wt.% in whole rock extracts with high polar components, consistent with extraction from S-rich Type Its organic matter which could generate hydrocarbons at low thermal maturity. Low Fe-sulfide mineral abundance and comparison of Pr/Ph ratios between saturate and whole extracts suggest limited Fe concentration resulted in sulfurization of organic matter during early diagenesis. From these observations, we infer that a Type Its kerogen in 'immature' bituminous marl at Madr could be generating high sulfur viscous oil which is seeping from outcrop. However, oil-seep samples were not collected for correlation studies. Aluminum-normalized trace element concentrations indicate enrichment of redox sensitive trace elements Mo, U and V and suggest anoxic-euxinic conditions during sediment deposition. The bulk of organic matter observed via optical microscopy is strongly fluorescent amorphous bituminite grading to lamalginite, possibly representing microbial mat facies. Short chain n-alkanes peak at C-14-C-16 (n-C-17/n-C-29 > 1) indicating organic input from marine algae and/or bacterial biomass, and sterane/hopane ratios are low (0.12-0.14). Monoaromatic steroids are dominated by C-28 clearly indicating a marine setting. High gammacerane index values (similar to 0.9) are consistent with anoxia stratification and may indicate intermittent saline-hypersaline conditions. Stable C isotope ratios also suggest a marine depositional scenario for the Suzak samples, consistent with the presence of marine foraminifera including abundant planktic globigerinida(?) and rare benthic discocyclina(?) and nummulites(?). Biomarker 2 alpha-methylhopane for photosynthetic cyanobacteria implies shallow photic zone deposition of Madr marls and 3 beta-methylhopane indicates presence of methanotrophic archaea in the microbial consortium. The data presented herein are consistent with deposition of Suzak bituminous marls in shallow stratified waters of a restricted marine basin associated with the southeastern incipient or proto-Paratethys. Geochemical proxies from Suzak rock extracts (S content, high polar content, C isotopes, normal (alpha alpha alpha R) C27-29 steranes, and C-29/C-30 and C-26/C-25 hopane ratios) are similar to extant data from Paleogene oils produced to the north in the Afghan-Tajik Basin. This observation may indicate laterally equivalent strata are effective source rocks as suggested by previous workers; however, further work is needed to strengthen oil-source correlations.

AB  - An accurate determination of the soil organic matter (SOM) levels present in reclaimed mine soil is necessary to evaluate the success of the ecological reclamation of mines. Visible and near-infrared diffuse spectroscopy is a fast and efficient method for collecting data for soil management during the reclamation of soil removed from mines. In this work, we used spectroscopy to characterize and estimate the SOM of lands from different reclamation years after coal mining in semi-arid grasslands of North China. Our goals were: (1) to explore the SOM characteristics and the spectra of reclaimed mine soil with different reclamation ages, and (2) to establish a reliable and accurate SOM prediction model by comparing support vector machine (SVM), partial least-squares regression (PLSR), and random forest (RF) modeling methods by determining the optimal preprocessing method and input spectral region. The results showed that spectral characteristics are useful indicators for understanding progressive SOM changes in the topsoil at different reclamation ages. RF is a more appropriate method for assessing the performance of a selected spectral region and provides more accurate results with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.34 g center dot kg(-1) between predicted and observed SOM values. This study provides an alternative method that uses spectroscopy to estimate reclaimed soil conditions for the environmental monitoring of mining sites.

AB  - Exergoeconomic assessment with Specific Exergy Costing (SPECO) technique and an exergoenvironmental analysis for a cogeneration system have been implemented to show the relation among thermodynamics and economical data and environmental impact of each component on the system. Depending upon the outcomes of exergoeconomic analysis, the unitary exergy price and exergy price of the natural gas have been counted as 0.05 US$/GJ and 490.23 US$/h, respectively. The unitary exergetic price and exergetic price of the steam have been counted as 158.84 US$/GJ and 2958.17 US$/h, respectively. Furthermore, the capital investment price, operating and maintenance price, and total price of the cogeneration system have been calculated to be 2185.50, 2316.60, and 4502.08 US$ per hour, respectively. The unitary environmental impact rate and environmental impact rate of the electricity, which is produced in the turbine, have been reckoned as 0.22 mPts/GJ and 0.02 mPts/h, respectively. Moreover, the effects of various fuel loading conditions and steam pressures (from 4 bar to 12 bar) on exergy prices have been investigated. The amount of fuel loading decreases, the exergy price of fuel, steam, and electricity also decreases. As the steam pressure goes up, the price of exergy loss for the boiler goes up whilst the exergy price of steam decreases.

AB  - Land degradation due to anthropic factors is the reduction of its actual or potential productivity. Nowadays, this topic is a major concern, as it affects more than one third of the soil in the world. This work presents an empirical assessment of the anthropic disturbance level (ADL) for agricultural and livestock production systems. This assessment is obtained by mapping the characteristics of land use and management practices by using five specific indicators and integrating them into a global indicator (ADL score). Earthworm populations (good indicators of soil quality) in soils under different production systems are studied to determine if the population changes are attributable to the intensity of land use and management practices. A correlation model between ADL, edaphic properties, and earthworm population characteristics is developed by using samples of 20 sites in Santa Fe province, Argentina. The inclusion of ADL allowed finding a consistent correlation structure. The results also showed that earthworm density, species diversity, and activity change at the different sites were highly sensitive to anthropic disturbance. Based on this data-driven model, the ADL can be estimated by measuring edaphic and biological data on a soil sample to monitor soil conditions for different production systems. Thus, ADL monitoring would allow deciding how to continue using and managing the land to improve its sustainability.

AB  - The multiple environmental dynamics of watersheds make these natural spaces interesting objects of study, and in areas with few scientific investigations, such as the Mestre Campo Stream watershed, the need for these investigations is even greater. The accomplishment of this paper sought to characterize the morphometry of Mestre Campo Stream Watershed, located in Piranga City, Minas Gerais, Brazil, as a first activity to create a management plan for the natural resources available in the area. Therefore, TOPODATA geomorphological data were used in a geographic information system (GIS) to extract the morphometric information - area and respective perimeter, length of axis and of drainage network - from the study area and, then, these variables were used to estimate the following indicators: form factor, circularity and compactness indexes, elongation ratio and drainage density, in order to describe the watershed. The morphometric indexes indicated an elongated behavior for the watershed, characterizing it as a space of low susceptibility to flooding under normal precipitation conditions. In addition, the drainage network showed fourth-order ramifications and a median capacity of drainage. The sub-watersheds that makes the Mestre Campo Stream Watershed were also characterized, the Sub-watershed of Brum Stream presented a rounded shape, while the Alto Mestre Campo Sub-watershed presented elongated characteristics. These results highlight the heterogeneity of Mestre Campo Stream Watershed, which must be considered when elaborating the management plan for the studied watershed, respecting the particularities of that geographic space in order to properly explore its natural resources.

AB  - The marine environment is subjected to ever-increasing levels of contamination, especially along the coastal areas with urban and industrial activities. Consequently, monitoring campaigns on large scales should be conducted on a regular basis for a better management of marine ecosystems. This study tested the capacity of the green alga Viva Wawa to act as a bioindicator of trace elements along the coasts of Sicily (Italy). The concentrations of the metals Cd, Cr. Cu. Ni. Pb and Zn were analyzed in samples of water, sediments and U. lactuca (balk, which were collected in ten different sites at diverse levels of human impact. The results showed that U. lactuca can accumulate essential and non-essential elements at similar concentrations. The analysis of trace elements showed also that the metal content in U. lactuca is significantly correlated with the levels of trace elements in water and sediments. U. lactuca fits numerous features that make it one of the best bioindicators of marine pollution, also thanks to its worldwide distribution and capacity to accumulate trace elements under toxic conditions. The use of U. lactuca should be encouraged to set up large-scale monitoring programs, especially in highly impacted seas like the Mediterranean where U. lactuca is widespread. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As an important indicator of sunlight conditions, sunshine duration (SSD) has a close relationship with human health, socio-economic activity, ecosystems, and the environment. This paper examines the long-term changes in SSD over eastern China and evaluates the possible urbanization effect on these changes based on a dynamic classification of urban and rural stations using time-varying land use/land cover maps. Daily SSD observations at nearly 2000 stations during 1961-2014 are collected and analyzed. Results show that SSD in eastern China declines throughout the year at an annual rate of -0.132 h/day per decade, with the largest trend in summer (i.e., -0.218 h/day per decade) and most moderate in spring (-0.066 h/day per decade). The dimming trend is even more profound in the highly urbanized and densely populated areas, such as the North China Plain and the Yangtze River Delta. A significant correlation of -0.48 also exists in the SSD trend and urban area fraction around the station. These results demonstrate an essential influence of local urbanization on SSD changes. It is also estimated that urbanization induces an additional decreasing trend of 0.065 h/day per decade for SSD, contributing to 35.3% of the total dimming trend in eastern China.

AB  - In weed biological control programs, pre-release host-specificity testing relies traditionally on no-choice and choice feeding, oviposition, and development tests. Rarely have they included detailed examination of behavioral responses to olfactory and visual cues of biological control candidates, although a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying host recognition may explain potential discrepancies between choice and no-choice tests, and/or between tests conducted in the lab versus field conditions. We investigated how the seed-feeding weevil, Mogulones borraginis, distinguishes its host plant, Cynoglossum officinale, from three native confamilial non-target species in North America. In behavioral bioassays, M. borraginis responded to olfactory and visual cues individually and, to an even greater extent, to both plant cue modalities when offered simultaneously. In tests with the combined cues, M. borraginis was attracted to C. officinale but responded with indifference or was repelled by non-target plants. In electrophysiological experiments, we identified that M. borraginis responded to ten volatile compounds and four wavelengths of lights from inflorescences of C. officinale. We propose that studies of responses to multimodal plant cues can advance our understanding of how biocontrol candidate species discriminate among host plants and closely related non-target species, thereby increasing the accuracy of environmental safety assessments pre-release.

AB  - Introduction: Enteric viruses, including Hepatitis E virus (HEV), are able to persist under environmental conditions and may cause public health problems by contaminating natural and drinking water resources. Routine procedures for monitoring viruses in water samples have not been established for the water microbiology screening panel.
   Methodology: Eighty-six raw sewerage samples were collected from the different regions of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, the twin cities of Pakistan. Samples were concentrated for HEV, using a polyethylene glycol-based method followed by viral RNA extraction using a commercial kit-based method. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with HEV specific primers was used for the detection of HEV.
   Results: The present investigation focused on 86 raw sewerage water samples taken from different locations of drainage outlets of Islamabad and Rawalpindi. After careful experimentation, 35 samples were found to be RT-PCR positive. Nineteen (44.7%) out of 47 samples from Rawalpindi city were HEV positive while 16 (41.02%) out of 39 samples from Islamabad were HEV positive. All positive samples were found in the highly congested areas.
   Conclusions: The high detection rate of HEV in this study shows that HEV circulates at a relatively high frequency in the sewerage waters in Pakistan. This study is the first report on detection of HEV from sewerage waste water from Pakistan and suggests that HEV might be a potent indicator of viral pollution in environmental specimens.

AB  - In this study we measured delta C-13 in various carbon pools along the basipetal transport pathway in co-occurring Pinus pinaster and Acacia longifolia trees under Mediterranean climate conditions in the field. Overall, species differences in photosynthetic discrimination resulted in more enriched delta C-13 values in the water-conserving overstory P. pinaster relative to the water-spending understory invasive A. longifolia. Post-photosynthetic fractionation effects resulted in differences in delta C-13 of water-soluble organic matter pools along the plant axis with progressive depletion in delta C-13 from the canopy to the trunk (similar to 6.5% depletion in A. longifolia and similar to 0.8% depletion in P. pinaster). Regardless of these fractionation effects, phloem sap delta C-13 in both terminal branches and the main stem correlated well with environmental parameters driving photosynthesis for both species, indicating that phloem sap delta C-13 has potential as an integrative tracer of changes in canopy carbon discrimination (Delta C-13). Furthermore, we illustrate that a simple model based on sap flow estimated canopy stomatal conductance (G(S)) and phloem sap delta C-13 measurements has significant potential as a tool for estimating canopy-level carbon assimilation rates.

AB  - Land managers have long identified a critical need for a practical and effective framework for designing restoration strategies, especially where invasive plants dominate. A holistic, ecologically based, invasive plant management (EBIPM) framework that integrates ecosystem health assessment, knowledge of ecological processes, and adaptive management into a successional management model has recently been proposed. However, well-defined principles that link ecological processes that need to be repaired to tools and strategies available to managers have been slow to emerge, thus greatly limiting the ability of managers to easily apply EBIPM across a range of restoration scenarios. The broad objective of this article is to synthesize current knowledge of the mechanisms and processes that drive plant community succession into ecological principles for EBIPM. Using the core concepts of successional management that identify site availability, species availability, and species performance as three general drivers of plant community change, we detail key principles that link management tools used in EBIPM to the ecological processes predicted to influence the three general causes of succession. Although we acknowledge that identification of principles in ecology has greatly lagged behind other fields and recognize that identification of ecological principles and the conditions in which they hold are still being developed, we demonstrate how current knowledge and future advances can be used to structure a holistic EBIPM framework that can be applied across a range of restoration scenarios.

AB  - Flux measurements in coastal sage scrub, chamise chaparral, and creosote bush scrub environments show that methyl bromide (CH3Br) and methyl chloride (CH3Cl), compounds that are involved in stratospheric ozone depletion, are both produced and consumed by southern California shrubland ecosystems. CH3Br and CH3Cl are produced in association with a variety of plants and are consumed by the soils, although there is a large variability in the fluxes, depending on predominant vegetation and environmental conditions. At sites with a net uptake of both compounds the fluxes of CH3Cl and CH3Br show a strong correlation, with a molar ratio of roughly 40:1, pointing to a similar mechanism of consumption. In contrast, the net production rates of these compounds show no apparent correlation with each other. The average observed net CH3Br uptake rates are an order of magnitude smaller than the previously reported average soil consumption rates assigned to shrublands. Extrapolations from our field measurements suggest that shrublands globally have a maximum net consumption of <1 Gg yr(-1) for CH3Br and < 20 Gg yr(-1) for CH3Cl and may, in fact, be net sources for these compounds. Consequently, the measured net fluxes from shrubland ecosystems can account for part of the present imbalance in the CH3Br budget by adding a new source term and potentially reducing the soil sink term. These results also suggest that while shrubland soil consumption of CH3Cl may be small, soils in general may be a globally significant sink for CH3Cl.

AB  - Cutaway peatland is a marginal land, which without further management is an unfavourable environment for plant growth due to low bearing capacity, high acidity and unbalanced nutrient composition of the soil. After wood-ash application, the soil becomes enriched with P and K, creating better conditions for tree growth. In addition to being economically viable, tree plantations ensure long-term carbon storage and promote habitat restoration. In a three-year term, we studied how distance from a drainage ditch and three different doses of wood-ash-5, 10, and 15 tons per hectare-affect the diversity of vascular plants in a tree plantation on a cutaway peatland. Plant species richness, vegetation cover and composition were positively affected by the distance from the drainage ditch and application with fertiliser, but in most cases, fertiliser dose had no significant effect. Both cover and species diversity were not affected by the planted tree species. In a tree plantation, herbaceous plants provide soil fertility by decay and recycling, and reduce mineral leaching in the long term. Since vascular plants play an important role in both the development of habitats and tree growth, it is important to know how multiple factors influence the development of vegetation in tree plantations.

AB  - The Arctic zone of the Russian Federation is a unique geographical area, where the richest mineral reserves are located, various biological resources are presented, and there is a high human potential. However, the successful and sustainable development of the Northern territories depends largely on the state of the regional infrastructure. It provides the prerequisites for efficient production activities, the preservation of natural renewable resources, as well as favorable living conditions of the population in this territory. Thus, if one considers the regional infrastructure in a broad sense, that is, as a set of all supporting structures, transport, construction, social, innovation, and others. Then the Northern regions of Russia owing to the historical and geographical reasons generally lag behind the level of infrastructure development from the average Russian indicators. The purpose of this paper is to develop a game-theoretic model of decision-making on the allocation of public investment to support the development projects of the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation. The presented model can be interesting for both public and private investors in the analysis of the effectiveness of state support for the infrastructure development in the Russian Far North to improve the validity and objectivity in decision-making on regional development. The model can also be used to assess the volume of lobbying for the goals, comparison of investments and possible results by private investors.

AB  - The Brown bear (Ursus arctos) is the biggest mammalian carnivore living in Western Europe and an endangered species in Spain. After centuries of decline. all Iberian populations have become extinct except two of them which are currently being recovered. Today. it seems feasible to initiate new conservation strategies to allow the recovery of extinct bear populations and their ecological functions by means of reintroduction programs. The goal of this study was to assess habitat suitability for the species in the south-eastern part of the Iberian Range. Our starting hypothesis predicts that this geographical area has favourable ecological characteristics to harbour a viable population of brown bears. The results point out that land abandonment, forest regeneration, a large forest extension. high habitat heterogeneity. and large natural protected areas network all provide suitable habitat conditions. The assessment of habitat suitability allowed ranking the land of the study area for the establishment of a Brown bear population; ca. 16 000 km(2) has high or medium-high habitat suitability values. The most suitable areas included abrupt relief. forests and other vegetation cover types that will provide both refuge and food to brown bears throughout all seasons. This study is a first step towards the evaluation of a future reintroduction of the species into the area, which in following steps would require addressing social acceptance and, ultimately. would depend on bold policy decisions.

AB  - The effects of ocean acidification on ecosystems remain poorly understood, because it is difficult to simulate the effects of elevated CO2 on entire marine communities. Natural systems enriched in CO2 are being used to help understand the long-term effects of ocean acidification in situ. Here, we compared biofilm bacterial communities on intertidal cobbles/boulders and bedrock along a seawater CO2 gradient off Japan. Samples sequenced for 16S rRNA showed differences in bacterial communities with different pCO(2) and between habitat types. In both habitats, bacterial diversity increased in the acidified conditions. Differences in pCO(2) were associated with differences in the relative abundance of the dominant phyla. However, despite the differences in community composition, there was no indication that these changes would be significant for nutrient cycling and ecosystem function. As well as direct effects of seawater chemistry on the biofilm, increased microalgal growth and decreased grazing may contribute to the shift in bacterial composition at high CO2, as documented by other studies. Thus, the effects of changes in bacterial community composition due to globally increasing pCO(2) levels require further investigation to assess the implications for marine ecosystem function. However, the apparent lack of functional shifts in biofilms along the pCO(2) gradient is a reassuring indicator of stability of their ecosystem functions in shallow ocean margins.

AB  - Scholars have long been highlighting the value of administrative sanctions in improving environmental policy enforcement. However, few studies have evaluated how such sanctions are implemented, particularly in the context of environmental impact assessments (EIA) and their respective follow-up programs. The main objective of this article was to evaluate how administrative sanctions have been used in EIA follow-ups, using the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais as the empirical context. More specifically it tried to understand what have been the main triggers, frequency, nature and financial values of the sanctions issued to noncompliant mining projects operating under the conditions of environmental licenses. First, through literature reviews, the study characterized the institutional and regulatory framework in which administrative sanctions are applied. Content analyzes of 29 infraction processes further revealed that lump sum fines are the preferred option of administrative sanction in EIA follow-ups. The analysis also revealed that the fines could be perceived as disproportionally small if one considers the size and financial power of non-compliant companies. The great majority of the fines were paid by developers: a fact that contradicts previous empirical findings and anecdotal evidence in Brazil. Overall, the study suggests that the impact of administrative sanctions in corporate behavior, while unclear, is likely small. The study concludes by discussing practical and academic implications.

AB  - This paper examines the response of phytoplankton and potentially harmful species to river inflows in an eastern Mediterranean coastal area, within the context of environmental status assessment suggested by the European Commission's Water Framework Directive (WFD, 2000/60/EC) and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD, 2008/56/EC). The spatio-temporal distribution of phytoplankton communities and biomass (as chlorophyll a), potentially harmful species, nutrient levels, dissolved oxygen, salinity and temperature were studied. A marginal good to moderate physicochemical status was assigned to downstream of River Spercheios that flows into Maliakos Gulf. Silicates and nitrates were indicated as proxies of freshwater influence in Maliakos Gulf, whereas ammonium, nitrites and phosphates as proxies of pollutants from non-point sources. Phytoplankton biomass and abundances reached high levels throughout Maliakos Gulf inter-seasonally. High silicates favoured the dominance of Diatoms. The potentially harmful species bloomed frequently, with higher levels in the estuary, and they were associated with low salinity, thus demonstrating the riverine influence on them. Pseudo-nitzschia was the most frequent potentially harmful genus with an interesting strong linkage with low silicates and nitrates. Maliakos Gulf demonstrated an overall mesotrophic condition and failed to achieve good ecological status.

AB  - Worldwide ecological impact assessments of wind farms have gathered relevant information on bat activity patterns. Since conventional bat study methods require intensive field work, the prediction of bat activity might prove useful by anticipating activity patterns and estimating attractiveness doncomitant with the wind farm location. A novel framework was developed, based on the stochastic dynamic methodology (StDM) principles, to predict bat activity on mountain ridges with wind farms. We illustrate the frainework application using regional data from North Portugal by merging information from several environmental monitoring programmes associated with diverse wind energy facilities that enable integrating the muldfactorial influences of meteotological conditions, land cover and geographical variables on bat activity patterns. Output from this innovative methodology can anticipate episodes of exceptional bat activity, which, if correlated with collision probability, can. be used to guide wind farm management strategy such as halting wind turbines during hazardous periods. If properly calibrated with regional gradients of environmental variables from mountain ridges with windfarms, the proposed methodology can be used as a complementary tool in environmental impact assessments and ecological monitoring, using predicted bat activity to assist decision making concerning the future location of wind farms and the implementation of effective mitigation measures.

AB  - The Asian copepod Pseudodiaptomus forbesi has recently become established in the Columbia River. However, little is known about its ecology and effects on invaded ecosystems. We undertook a 2-year (July 2009 to June 2011) field study of the mesozooplankton in four reservoirs in the Columbia and Snake Rivers, with emphasis on the relation of the seasonal variation in distribution and abundance of P. forbesi to environmental variables. Pseudodiaptomus forbesi was abundant in three reservoirs; the zooplankton community of the fourth reservoir contained no known non-indigenous taxa. The composition and seasonal succession of zooplankton were similar in the three invaded reservoirs: a bloom of rotifers occurred in spring, native cyclopoid and cladoceran species peaked in abundance in summer, and P. forbesi was most abundant in late summer and autumn. In the uninvaded reservoir, total zooplankton abundance was very low year-round. Multivariate ordination indicated that temperature and dissolved oxygen were strongly associated with zooplankton community structure, with P. forbesi appearing to exhibit a single generation per year. The broad distribution and high abundance of P. forbesi in the Columbia-Snake River System could result in ecosystem level effects in areas intensively managed to improve conditions for salmon and other commercially and culturally important fish species.

AB  - Relationships between nutrient concentrations and fish nutrient tolerance were assessed relative to established nutrient criteria. Fish community, nitrate plus nitrite (nitrate), and total phosphorus (TP) data were collected during summer low-flow periods in 2003 and 2004 at stream sites along a nutrient-enrichment gradient in an agricultural basin in Indiana and Ohio and an urban basin in the Atlanta, Georgia, area. Tolerance indicator values for nitrate and TP were assigned for each species and averaged separately for fish communities at each site (TIVo). Models were used to predict fish species expected to occur at a site under minimally disturbed conditions and average tolerance indicator values were determined for nitrate and TP separately for expected communities (TIVe). In both areas, tolerance scores (TIVo/TIVe) for nitrate increased significantly with increased nitrate concentrations whereas no significant relationships were detected between TP tolerance scores and TP concentrations. A 0% increase in the tolerance score (TIVo/TIVe=1) for nitrate corresponded to a nitrate concentration of 0.19mg/l (compared with a USEPA summer nitrate criterion of 0.17mg/l) in the urban area and 0.31mg/l (compared with a USEPA summer nitrate criterion of 0.86mg/l) in the agricultural area. Fish nutrient tolerance values offer the ability to evaluate nutrient enrichment based on a quantitative approach that can provide insights into biologically relevant nutrient criteria.

   Eucalyptus plantations have a negative image in terms of their biological diversity. It would, however, be unfair to oversimplify this representation, since it brings into play a broad diversity of reference models, scales, contexts and objectives. It is appropriate to clarify the processes affecting the biodiversity of eucalyptus plantations according to specific levels of organization. Three main levels can be identified: the plantation plot itself, the surrounding landscape and the region. The genetic diversity of planted eucalyptus trees, their potential allelopathic relations with other organisms, the light conditions in the plantation and the production of wildlife resources can be examined on the scale of the plantation plot. On a higher level, the landscape approach can cast light on the flow of species, possible forms of conversion and the direct or indirect protection effects. Finally, the regional approach involves the investigation of climatic, but also anthropogenic factors which, in turn, exert pressure on the biodiversity of eucalyptus plantations. According to the hierarchy approach, it would seem beneficial to apply all of the criteria, indicators and means of verification identified for the sustainable silviculture of eucalyptus plantations equally in accordance with such levels of organisation. But prior to taking such a step, it is important to clarify the range of social expectations focused on eucalyptus plantations in order to apply the techniques selected, the silvicultural practices applied and the type of management of such stands in an acceptable manner.

AB  - Escalating fertilizer and feed costs, declining product prices, and increasing regulations to reduce environmental pollution have created new pressures to improve nutrient use in agricultural production. This study provides an overview of factors and processes that impact nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in dairy production, identifies practices that may bridge gaps between actual-NUE obtained on commercial farms and potential-NUE obtained under experimental conditions, and explores the possibility of using NUE as a performance indicator and policy tool for dairy production. Actual feed-NUE varies from 16% to 36% and is impacted by of a range of dairy practices; manure/fertilizer-NUE varies from 16% to 77% and is very site-specific; and whole-farm NUE varies from 8% to 64% and declines as stocking rates increase. Optimal stocking rate and manure nitrogen (N) crediting can enhance NUE, increase farm profits, and reduce N loss from dairy farms.

AB  - Samples of the vascular plant Tradescantia pallida and the lichen Usnea amblyoclada were exposed from October 2004 to April 2005 in three sites with different local sources of air pollution in Cordoba city, Argentina. Simultaneous determinations of the ambient levels of total suspended particles were made for each site. Young inflorescenses of T. pallida were collected in November, February and April and the frequency of micronuclei was determined on early tetrads of pollen mother cells. Physiological parameters and the elemental composition of lichen thalli were measured from samples exposed and replaced every month. Significant differences among sampling sites were observed in the frequency of micronuclei measured in T. pallida as well as in many physiological parameters and elements accumulated in lichen thalli. The mass of particulate material as well as the concentration of Ca, Mn, Cu, Zn and Sr was significantly different in different sampling sites, too. These results suggest that in situ biomonitoring using both higher plants and lichens may be of use to characterize air pollution in areas devoid of instrumental monitoring techniques or where it is necessary to explore the distribution of air contaminants at a microscale.

AB  - Biofilms are complex aggregates formed by microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi and algae, which grow at the interfaces between water and natural or artificial materials. They are actively involved in processes of sorption and desorption of metal ions in water and reflect the environmental conditions in the recent past. Therefore, biofilms can be used as bioindicators of water quality. The goal of this study was to determine whether the biofilms, developed in different aquatic systems, could be successfully discriminated using data on their elemental compositions. Biofilms were grown on natural or polycarbonate materials in flowing water, standing water and seawater bodies. Using an unsupervised technique such as principal component analysis (PCA) and several supervised methods like classification and regression trees (CART), discriminant partial least squares regression (DPLS) and uninformative variable elimination-DPLS (UVE-DPLS), we could confirm the uniqueness of sea biofilms and make a distinction between flowing water and standing water biofilms. The CART, DPLS and UVE-DPLS discriminant models were validated with an independent test set selected either by the Kennard and Stone method or the duplex algorithm. The best model was obtained from CART with 100% correct classification rate for the test set designed by the Kennard and Stone algorithm. With CART, one variable describing the Mg content in the biofilm water phase was found to be important for the discrimination of flowing water and standing water biofilms.

AB  - In the past decade, there has been increased scientific interest in the so-called organic farming, especially in comparison with conventional agriculture. Many recent studies compare these two fundamentally different systems for soil properties, in different regions of the world. In this study, two adjacent fields in Central Italy, one managed according to organic, and the other according to conventional farming methods, were studied to determine the effects of these two agricultural systems on soil quality indicators at the farm level. Chemical and microbiological properties were chosen as indicators of soil quality and were measured at soil depth intervals of 5-20 and 20-35 cm, after 7 years of organic certified and conventional management methods. The field under organic management showed significantly better soil nutritional and microbiological conditions; with increased level of total nitrogen, nitrate and available phosphorus, and an increased microbial biomass content, and enzymatic activities (acid phosphatase, protease and dehydrogenase). No consistent increase in total organic carbon was observed. Results of the study suggest that, over the period of 7 year, organic management method strongly affects soil quality indicators. Large differences between the two soils were found in terms of microbiological properties, which are sensitive soil indicators of changes occurred under the different fanning systems.

AB  - Nearly one thousand oysters (Crassostrea virginica) were collected at 15 sites on four sampling trips to Galveston Bay during 1992-1993. Iron, silver, arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc were determined in the whole soft part of the individual oysters. Trace metal concentrations were found to vary among individuals within a site on a given trip, and spatially and temporally around the Galveston Bay estuarine system. Differences in metal concentrations from site to site were a factor of 5 or more for some metals, and similar differences were found from time to time at a given site. Zinc was found in anomalously high concentrations at several sites, mainly along the west side of Galveston Bay. Isolated high values of other metals were found scattered throughout the bay; however, only one site (GBSL, near Swan Lake in lower Galveston Bay) was found to have significantly higher than average concentrations for several metals (Ag, Cu, Ph, and Zn). One obvious trend found in this study was that metal concentrations, except for As, were highest in the summer, followed by the fall, and lowest in the winter and spring. The temporal changes in metal concentrations in oysters cannot be explained by changes in body weight in different seasons, and are apparently caused by changes in environmental conditions (e.g., metal input, salinity) or biological activity (e.g., metabolism, depuration).

AB  - The construction sector represents more than 40% of energy consumption in the European Union, as well as one of the biggest causes of environmental impact. Therefore, this sector needs a great deal of intervention through policies that promote the energetic efficiency of the buildings. One of the most important structural components to reach this energetic efficiency is the facades. In this work, the facade ventilated is chosen due to its better thermal insulation behaviour. The environmental impact of the facade ventilated depends on the thermal insulation material. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the environmental impact of different ventilated facades according to their thermal insulation behavior. For this purpose, the life-cycle assessment is applied in ventilated facades with different materials in different locations. The materials studied are the rock wool, the natural cork and the recycled cork, and the locations considered are the different climatic areas of Spain. To reach a complete environmental assessment all the ventilated facades life-cycle is considered, from cradle to grave. To do this we use the Open LCA software with the Ecoinvent database with the ReCiPe method. The results show that the recycled cork is the thermal insulation with the lowest environmental impact regardless the location.

AB  - A large number of qualitative and semi-quantitative analyses have been performed to summarize the effects of river restoration, while systematic and quantitative assessments of the literature on river restoration are still rare. To fill this gap, we conducted a meta-analysis of 55 peer-reviewed publications describing assessments of river restoration with indicators of biodiversity or ecosystem services (ES). The core of the study was to identify: (i) the overall ecological effects of river restoration; (ii) the restoration effects on different organism groups and types of ES, including the relationship between biodiversity and ES; and (iii) the influence of the restoration context, that is degradation types, restoration techniques and restoration age. The meta-analysis revealed that river restoration significantly enhanced ecological conditions. However, restoration effects varied among organism groups and ES, with plant abundance and regulating services showing higher responses to restoration. Moreover, a trend of a positive correlation was found between biodiversity and ES. Restoration activities showed most significant effects in the context of hydromorphological degradation or land-use changes, and channel reconfiguration and riparian buffer establishment had a particularly favourable outcomes. Only regulating services showed a positive correlation with restoration age; thus, long-time monitoring is necessary to fully understand restoration effects. Overall, our meta-analysis provides evidence-based advice for future projects and assessment of river restoration.

AB  - As far as potential toxic elements (PTEs) have definite numerous adverse impacts on soil ecosystems; there is an urgent need for proper indicators to monitor their remediation process. Certainly, monitoring soil remediation process would enable assessing the efficiency of varied remediation techniques. Remediation of soil ecosystem pollution using protocols of chemical remediative amendments, i.e., (elemental sulfur, rock phosphate, bentonite and kaolinite) and biological remediative amendments, i.e., (Thiobacillus thiooxidans, Thiobacillus ferrooxidans, phosphate dissolving bacteria and Pseudomonas fluorescens) were evaluated under field conditions in a heavy metals contaminated soil ecosystem cultivated with the hyper accumulator turnip. Results showed a significant decrease in the hazards of PTEs in the studied soil ecosystem represented by decreasing Zinc equivalent (ZE) values from 854.5 ppm in the uncultivated control soil to 498.3 ppm in the cultivated control soil. Application of the treatment (T-7), was the best treatment applied, this treatment decreased ZE value to 104.2 ppm. Significant negative correlations were detected between dehydrogenase activity (DHA) as a biological indicator for the whole microbial activity in the soil ecosystem and Zn Equivalent (ZE) as a chemical indicator parameter in both treated and untreated soils. The results of this work imply that the used treatments significantly returned the contaminated soil to a healthy soil.

AB  - Within the framework of disaster risk management, this article proposes an interdisciplinary method for the analysis of multiple natural hazards, including climate change's influences, in the context of cultural heritage. A taxonomy of natural hazards applicable to cultural heritage was developed based on the existing theoretical and conceptual frameworks. Sudden-onset hazards, such as earthquakes and floods, and slow-onset hazards, such as wetting-drying cycles and biological contamination, were incorporated into the hazard assessment procedure. Future alteration of conditions due to climate change, such as change in heat waves' duration, was also taken into account. The proposed hazard assessment framework was applied to the case of the Historic Centre of Rethymno, a city on the northern coast of the island of Crete in Greece, to identify, analyze, and prioritize the hazards that have the potential to cause damage to the center's historic structures. The assessment procedure includes climate model projections, GIS spatial modeling and mapping, and finally a hazard analysis matrix to enable the sharing of a better understanding of multiple hazards with the stakeholders. The results can facilitate decision making by providing the vulnerability and risk analysis with the nature and spatial distribution of the significant hazards within the study area and its setting.

AB  - This paper deals with the study of the co-existence of the chemical compounds CO2 and NO3 in substantial amounts over a long period of time for a wide range of atmospheric conditions. Using the presence of chemical compounds in the nature, the mathematical model for the behaviour is modelled. Lyapunov Characteristic Exponents (LCE) along with the indicators i.e., Small Alignment Index (SALI), Fast Lyapunov Indicator (FLI) and Dynamic Lyapunov Indicator (DLI) are applied to make a distinction concerning ordered/unordered trajectories of the dynamics for these chemical compounds. DLI indicator gives the largest of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix and correct conclusions when applied to models of dynamical systems. FLI method is used to differentiate between regular motion and chaos in the intricate systems. SALI is a competent indicator of predictability which could discriminate amid different steady as well as randomness levels. FLI as well as SALI advance eigenvectors via iterating the progressing Jacobian matrix at every iteration for the set-up. Entropy, on the other hand, is the measure of randomness that would be generated as the system changes its state from consistency to chaos. It is observed that for stable environment the mutual sustenance of NO3 and CO2 should be maintained in a balanced manner, otherwise the environmental cycles get disrupted which results in rise in pollution levels.

AB  - Studies on benthic algae and hydrodynamic characteristics are rarely conducted in natural streams. In this study, a natural stream was selected as a test field. First, we sampled the benthic diatoms on site. Then, we measured stream physicochemical characteristics in the laboratory. Finally, we estimated hydrodynamic characteristics using a numerical simulation. On these bases, the corresponding relations between benthic diatom biomass and stream velocity and shear stress at different sections were studied in the 1D case, and the corresponding relations between benthic diatom biomass and stream velocity and depth were studied in the 2D case. The results show that the suitable flow range for benthic diatoms is approximately 0.85-1 m/s and the suitable shear stress is approximately 24-28 N/m(2) in the 1D case. In the 2D case, the suitable velocity and stream depth are 0.9-1.1 m/s and 0.40-0.48 m, respectively. Therefore, both along the stream and in cross-section, there is always a range with suitable hydrodynamic characteristics to support a relatively high biomass of benthic diatoms. Outside of this range, however, the biomass decreases regardless of whether the values of the hydrodynamic characteristics are higher or lower. The study conclusion may provide a reference for stream ecological assessment and re-storation.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) limitation constrains plant growth, but complex interactions among species and ecosystems hinder our ability to identify primary drivers of N availability. Hydrologic, biogeochemical, and ecological processes interact spatially and temporally, requiring measurements of N across diverse ecosystem types and as a function of both site conditions and vegetation composition. We measured initial exchangeable and mineralized N along a hydrologic gradient in the Alaskan perhumid coastal temperate rainforest to test a conceptual model of linkages between N availability and landscape, hydrologic, and ecosystem characteristics in temperate forests. Mineralization was closely associated with inorganic N concentrations. Inorganic N as NH4+ generally increased with increasing depth to groundwater but was strongly determined by plant-water interactions. Exchangeable and mineralized N were closely linked to tree species, forest biomass, and hydrologic regime regardless of ecosystem type. The emergence of tree species as indicators of N cycling highlights the effect that species have on nutrient dynamics, while the trend of increasing inorganic N with increasing soil saturation points to the role of hydrology in driving N availability. Our research quantified N dynamics for an understudied, yet critical, system and provides a framework for exploring feedbacks among soil saturation, forest composition, and nutrient cycling in temperate forests.

AB  - Bed stability is an important stream habitat attribute because it affects geomorphology and biotic communities. Natural resource managers desire indices of bed stability that can be used under a wide range of geomorphic conditions, are biologically meaningful, and are easily incorporated into sampling protocols. To eliminate potential bias due to presence of instream wood and increase precision of stability values, we modified a stream bed instability index (ISI) to include measurements of bankfull depth (dbf) and median particle diameter (D-50) only in riffles and increased the pebble count to decrease variability (i.e., increase precision) in D-50. The new riffle-based instability index (RISI) was compared to two established indices: ISI and the riffle stability index (RSI). RISI and ISI were strongly associated with each other but neither was closely associated with RSI. RISI and ISI were closely associated with both a diatom-and two macrovertebrate-based stream health indices, but RSI was only weakly associated with the macroinvertebrate indices. Unexpectedly, precision of D50 did not differ between RISI and ISI. Results suggest that RISI is a viable alternative to both ISI and RSI for evaluating bed stability in multiple stream types. With few data requirements and a simple protocol, RISI may also better conform to riffle-based sampling methods used by some water quality practitioners.

AB  - Mountain forests, treeline ecotones included, provide numerous ecosystem services. However, different drivers heavily impact the treeline areas, in particular anthropogenic pressure and climate change. Any change affecting the aboveground portion of terrestrial ecosystems automatically influences their belowground part, i.e. soil and soil organisms. Therefore, the focus of the present paper is on the soil resource that provides multiple ecosystem services, such as carbon storage, water filtration, food and biomass provisioning, biodiversity, maintenance, etc. Soil physical, chemical, and biological properties can be very helpful as indicators of ecosystem services in mountain regions. A selection and integration of appropriate indicators of soil quality is thus needed for soil monitoring and assessment in treeline areas. In this paper, results of case studies from mountain regions in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Italy, Romania, and Slovakia are presented. From these studies, it emerges that soil organic matter (content and quality), pH, and microbial parameters show significant changes in response to anthropogenic pressures and/or climate change. These indicators of soil quality, either in the short-or in the long-term, can thus be used as reliable and sensitive tools for monitoring actions. However, it is advisable to integrate this basic set with additional indicators that can be further selected in relation to specific conditions, such as geographical area, lithological substrate, land use, and management practices.
