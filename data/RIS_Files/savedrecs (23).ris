AB  - The stability of soil aggregates is an indicator of soil structure. Soil acidity affects soil structure stability. Soil acidity has two components: active acidity and exchangeable acidity. In natural conditions, each soil type has a certain level of acidity, which is given by its composition, natural vegetation, the chemical composition of precipitations and other factors that cause changes over time in soil pH. Acidic soils are characterized by physical, chemical and biological properties adverse to crop development. The main objective of the research was to establish a correlation between exchangeable acidity and soil structure stability. Experimental research was conducted on 16 soil types, which are characteristic to North Moldova and Bucovina, Romania's provinces. The total cation exchange capacity (T) of this soils is between 11.11 and 53.20 me/100g and the exchange bases sum (SB) varies from 0.70 to 31.92 me/100g. The correlations between Is (water stability index of soil structure) and H+/T are given by linear regression and by regression straight intervals with variable slope. Researchers have shown that to a variation of H+/T ratio between 0.0-0.6, aggregate stability more pronounced decrease with increasing concentration of H+ exchangeable ions in the soil, compared with the range 0.8-1 of the ratio. In the second range, the influence of increasing concentration of exchangeable H+ ions on the stability of soil structure is less pronounced.

AB  - Testate amoebae inhabiting Sphagnum peatlands are sensitive indicators of substrate-moisture content. However, ecological data from a range of peatland types is needed to assess their indicator-value in other peatland systems. We examined testate amoeba communities and species-environment relationships at 40 locations within a pocosin of North Carolina. Primary objectives were to provide baseline data on the ecology of testate amoebae in pocosins, compare communities with those of northern peatlands, and assess the potential of using testate amoebae as environmental indicators in these systems. Results indicated that pH, substrate-moisture content, and conductivity were important controls on community composition. Communities that were relatively similar and dissimilar to those of northern peatlands were encountered, and the ecology of species with respect to water-table depth was similar in both peatland types. Cross validation of transfer functions for pH and water-table depth suggests that Pocosin testate amoebae can be used as indicators for these variables. However, water-table depth was poorly inferred from communities at several dry sites characterized by high bulk density. These sites may experience large seasonal or interannual variability in moisture conditions because of differences in peat structure, suggesting that research is needed on the influence of short-term variability in shaping community structure.

AB  - Alder (Alnus) carr peats have only rarely been subject of palacoecological research because their mostly bad preservation prevents successful reconstruction of local and regional vegetation development by means of macrofossil and pollen analysis.
   To test the potential of non-pollen palynomorphs as an additional source of information, surface samples from five different types of substrates and three different Alder forest types were analysed on microfossils with special focus on non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs). Forty-six new types of NPPs, mostly fungal spores and remains of decomposed wood, were described and illustrated.
   Ordination of the more common NPPs revealed a good differentiation between substrate groups and - to a lesser extent - site types. Comparison with microfossil data from Alder carr peat showed that the ecological information derived from the modem samples is consistent with the environmental conditions reconstructed from palaeoecological data (pollen, macrofossils, degree of decomposition) from the peat core.
   The analysis of NPPs in surface samples is a promising tool to assess the indicator value of NPPs, allowing an improved interpretation of fossil data. The fact that 2.6 times more NPP types than pollen types were found in the fossil samples illustrates the importance and potential of NPPs for palaeo-palynological research. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The spatial distribution of lake-water pH near the Horne smelter in Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec, Canada, is affected not only by industrial sulphur dioxide emissions, but also by other anthropogenic and natural factors. Regional calcareous glaciolacustrine deposits from glacial lakes Barlow and Ojibway provide buffering capacity. Locally, some kettle lakes are buffered by silicate weathering. Small mines, tailings, and natural sources of acidity (e.g. peat basins, forested catchment areas with acidic soils) also contribute to lake acidification. Interpreting the modern regional distribution of lake-water pH, ranging from 3.7 to 9.3 in 99 lakes, is equivocal in this area where wind-transported emissions and buffering from calcareous glaciolacustrine deposits can yield similar spatial trends. However, in a parallel study, diatom assemblages have been used as bio-indicators of past lake-water pH since they respond to temporal shifts in environmental conditions, including take-water acidity. The historical pH reconstructions for two lakes within a 100-km radius of Rouyn-Noranda suggest that they were naturally acidic before industrialization and have further acidified. Lac de la Pepiniere was naturally acidic in the 1800s (PH 5.5) and reached a pH of 4.8 by 1998; its increased rate of acidification since 1927 corresponds to the beginning of mining and smelting operations.

TI  - ABANDONED PENGUIN ROOKERIES AS HOLOCENE PALEOCLIMATIC INDICATORS IN ANTARCTICA
T2  - GEOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - ORNITHOGENIC SOILS
AB  - Penguins are sensitive indicators of the Antarctic climate and of the environmental parameters that limit their presence and distribution. Paleoenvironmental data, obtained from the study of abandoned penguin rookeries (Pygoscelis adeliae) along the Victoria Land coast in Antarctica, indicate a C-14 date of 11-13 ka for the oldest abandoned rookery and supply new information about the timing of glacier retreat in southern Victoria Land after the last glacial maximum. The continuous presence of the Adelie penguins is documented from 7 ka. According to our data, the limiting factors that control the presence of penguins along the coast of Victoria Land changed during the Holocene. Whereas several colonies were occupied for very long periods, other sites were used for more or less extended periods and then abandoned. The greatest diffusion of rookeries occurred between 3 and 4 ka, a period of particularly favorable environmental conditions that has never been repeated. It was followed by a sudden decrease in the number of penguin rookeries shortly after 3 ka. This event has been attributed to an increase of the sea-ice extension and may have been correlated to a worldwide phase of climate change near the Subboreal-Subatlantic boundary. A minor phase of penguin reoccupation occurred locally in the eighth to fourteenth centuries (A.D.). Because the presence and number of penguins reflect the state of health of the Antarctic marine ecosystem, it is important to evaluate the variations in their distribution in the past, in the absence of human-induced changes.

AB  - The biological communities of mountain lakes are suspected to be highly sensitive to global warming and associated catchment changes. To identify the parameters determining algal community responses, subfossil pigments from 21 different mountain lakes in the Bavarian-Tyrolean Limestone Alps were investigated. Sediment cores were radio-isotopically dated, and their pigment preservation evaluated. General additive models (GAM) of pigment compositions were calculated with temperature as the explanatory variable and generalized linear models with several lake parameters explaining log-transformed GAM P-values. Lake depth and trophic state were identified as major control variables of the algal community and productivity changes. Shifts in a deep oligotrophic alpine lake (lg(P) = -1.04) were half as strong as in a shallow mesotrophic alpine lake (lg(P) = -1.86) with faster warming and higher productivity forcing the development of biomass. Phytoplankton and macrophyte pigments increased clearly with warming, at lower altitudes, and decreased at the treeline, so that periphytic pigments dominated alpine sediments. This pattern is probably the result of interactions of UV radiation and allochthonous inputs of DOM. Our findings suggest that (sub)alpine shallow lakes with higher nutrient levels are most vulnerable to climate change-driven changes whereas deep, nutrient-poor lakes appear more resilient.

AB  - Environmental stress such as nutrient deprivation across multiple fields in nature causes physiological and biochemical changes in organism. Understanding the potential epigenetic modulations to phenotypic variation upon nutrient deprivation stress is crucial for environmental assessments. Here, the methyl-cytosine at single-base resolution was mapped across the whole genome and the methylation patterns and methylation levels coordinated with transcript analysis were systemically elaborated in zebrafish embryonic fibroblast cells under serum starvation stress. The down-regulated genes mainly annotated to the pathways of DNA replication and cell cycle that were consistent with cell physiological changes. Vast differentially methylated regions were identified in genomic chromosome and showed enrichment in the intron and intergenic regions. In an integrated transcriptome and DNA methylation analyses, 135 negatively correlated genes were determined, wherein the hub genes of gins2, cdca5, fbxo5, slc29a2, suv39h1b, and zgc:174160 were predominant responsive to the nutrient condition changes. Besides, nutrient recovery and DNA methyltransferases inhibitor supplements partly rescued cell proliferation with decrease of DNA methylation and reactivation of several depressed genes, implying the possible intrinsic relationships among cell physiological state, mRNA expression, and DNA methylation. Collectively, current study proved the broad role of DNA methylation in governing cellular responses to nutrient deprivation and revealed the epigenetic risk of starvation stress in zebrafish.

AB  - Testate amoebae are widely used in palaeoecological studies as indicators (proxies) of environmental conditions in mires and freshwater ecosystems. The aim of this work was to identify patterns in the dynamics of the species structure of testate amoeban assemblages during a "pond-mire" succession using a multi-proxy analysis of the deposits in the Mochulya mire, Kaluga Region, European Russia. To explain changes in the species structure of testate amoebae, we used data on the plant macrofossil composition, peat humification and the loss on ignition, together with the results of radiocarbon dating and pollen analysis. The deposits were formed by pond sediments, with rich fen and poor Sphagnum-dominated fen peat. The age at the base of the deposits was 4100 cal. yr. BP. Changes in the species structure of testate amoeban assemblages were largely determined by local vegetation, especially Sphagnum mosses, which significantly transformed the environment. The transformation of the waterbody into the rich fen may have most likely occurred as a result of climatic (allogeneic) factors: short-term desiccation and fires that might have led to the overgrowth of the shore. The transformation of the rich to poor fen could be associated with both autogenous (accumulation of the deposits) and allogeneic factors (decrease in human activity in the surrounding area).

AB  - Rapid urbanization has put tremendous pressure on the extraction of natural water resources. Uncontrolled extraction of water has further created water stress in the urban sector. Therefore, it is the need of the day to have a positive water balance for sustainable development of an urban area. The sustainability of water cannot be simply seen as quantitative adequacy but it has other environmental dimensions such as depleting of the groundwater table, drainage problem, and pollution of surface water bodies etc. The present paper focuses on the development of a single index based on a combination of Integrated Urban Water Management (IUWM) and pressure-state-response (PSR) frameworks. In the proposed framework twenty-two sub-indicators have been brought down into seven broad categories to measure the relevant indicators. This single index termed as Water for Development Planning Index (WDPI) may be used for further development planning which will incorporate all aspects of urban water systems. Formulation of WDPI has been established for urban water planning as a decision making tool. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the proposed framework has been developed and applied to Varanasi city where water supply is managed traditionally. The WDPI for Varanasi city is 4.09 (less than 5) which lies in critical condition. Hence, the future planning of the water sector of Varanasi city must reduce the extraction of the water from the natural sources and promote non-conventional practices.

AB  - Depth to water table (DWT, the depth from the water surface to the top of the peat surface) is one of the most important environmental variables related to the habitat types and distribution of vegetation within a subalpine peatland. The distribution of phytolith assemblages and basic environmental data from 43 surface soil samples with significant ecological and hydrological gradients were investigated to generate transfer functions for quantitative reconstruction of paleoenvironmental changes in Dajiuhu peatland, central China. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA) were employed to explore the relationship between main environmental variables and phytolith morphotypes and distributions. Our results indicate that the spatial distribution of phytoliths was significantly correlated with the DWT (25% variance), total organic carbon (TOC, 10% variance) and magnetic susceptibility (chi, 7% variance). We established the transfer functions for the significant variables based on modern analogue technique (MAT), weighted averaging techniques (WA) and weighted averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS), and model performance was assessed using bootstrap cross-validation. The high correspondence of the predicted DWT results based on phytolith-environment calibration data with observed data reflects that the phytolith-based WA-PLS is a reliable effective calibration method for the quantitative DWT reconstruction of ombrotrophic (rain-fed) subalpine peatland.

AB  - Sustainable forest management (SFM) is crucial for forest ecosystem productivity and conservation, especially in systems such as cork oak (Quercus suber L.) threatened by human activities and biotic and abiotic factors. In this study SFM indicators with particular reference to cork oak forests in the region of Sardinia (Italy) are proposed and tested. Sustainable and responsible management options specifically aimed at cork oak forest management and chain of custody certification are also provided. A set of ten indicators was proposed and assessed by an expert panel in cork oak management. Five indicators were also tested against data on structure, origin, health condition and management in 285 forest compartments managed by FoReSTAS (Regional Forest Agency for Land and Environment of Sardinia, Italy), including 361 sampling plots and 5345 trees. In order to investigate the priorities and perceptions of SFM experts and stakeholders, a survey was also carried out by completion of a questionnaire on the technical issues of cork oak woodland management. The survey results highlighted a need to improve environmental and economic performance by means of SFM and certification. The indicators tested in Sardinian cork oak woodlands showed that about 80% of the stands fulfilled management sustainability requirements. The suggested SFM indicators can effectively support proactive management and conservation measures, representing a valuable tool in the current context of growing environmental and socioeconomic awareness.

AB  - The biological slow filtration (BSF) system as a simple and efficient environmental technology has been widely applied in treatment of micro-polluted' water. At present, many related studies have focused on the removal efficiency of biological indicators (such as bacteria and viruses). However, there is less research on the removal performance of nutrients and organics in the BSF system. In this paper, we employed a lab-scale biological slow filter to study the removal efficiency and degradation mechanism of nutrients and organics. We proved through adsorption of filter layer at the early running stage and biodegradation at the later stage, the BSF system could achieve effective removal of NH3-N, TN, TP, CODMn and turbidity and the corresponding removal rates are 83.65%, 42.45%, 42.94%, 60.41% and 83.55%, respectively. Furthermore, we also explored the influence of four main factors (filtration rate, filter depth, hydraulic head and temperature) and their interactions on removal rates of nutrients and organics in the BSF system and obtained the optimal operating parameters as follows: filtration rate 0.1 m/h, filter depth 0.8 m, hydraulic head 0.64 m, temperature 26.06 degrees C. This study would provide a theoretical foundation for the actual application of biological slow filter in treatment of micro-polluted water in developing countries and offer an optimized basis for the design of operating conditions.

AB  - We analysed a dataset composed by the frequency of 79 epiphytic lichens recorded on 243 oaks distributed in 29 oak dominated stands of the Western Carpathians, representing areas with high environmental quality up to disturbed environments. Lichen diversity indices (based on total frequencies and on functional and morphological groups) were used as indicators of the response to air quality and forest management. The level of air quality in these categories was a function of NOx, SO2 and particulate matter. From management viewpoint the units were classified as managed (areas subjected to periodic logging) and semi-natural (which currently have the status of National Nature Reserve and where eventual management practices date back to the history). The results showed that higher environmental levels of pollution were associated to the decrease of fruticose and in general pollution sensitive species, while low environmental levels of pollution were associated to the diffusion of common nitrophilous lichens as well as to a higher share of fruticose and in general pollution sensitive species. As far as forest management is concerned, a higher share of fruticose and sensitive species was associated to semi-natural and natural stands, whereas a higher share of foliose (pioneer and tolerant) species was associated to the managed stands.

AB  - An oil spill occurred in the Straits of Singapore (one of the world's busiest shipping lanes) on 25 May 2010. Pre-and post-oil spill population parameters (i.e., abundances, densities, burrow diameters, location of burrows with respect to shore height and size-distribution gradient) of the ghost crab Ocypode ceratophthalmus on two adjacent beaches at East Coast Park, Singapore, were compared to study the extent of impact and subsequent recovery rate. The ghost crab population, which was decimated after the oil spill, rebounded within three months to densities close to those that were observed prior to the oil spill. The lower boundary of the recolonised population in September 2010 and January 2011 shifted upshore by about 0.4 m from that documented in September 2006. The zone that was recolonised was between 2.6 m and 2.8 m above Chart Datum in January 2011, directly above the upper limit of the region contacted by the spilled oil, indicating that the crabs avoided settling in sediments that contained oil residues. No distinct size distribution gradient on the shore was observed in the pre-and postspill populations. This study confirms that the abundance and distribution of O. ceratophthalmus provide reliable, sensitive and effective indications of the conditions of beach habitats.

AB  - Fungal diversity seems to be a good indicator of ecosystem disturbance and functioning. The purpose of this work was to quantify the fungal population as a sensitive indicator of the changes caused by stubble placement in two tillage systems: reduced tillage (RT) and conventional tillage (CT) with and without cropping. To this end, we determined the effect of soil disturbances such as N fertilization, tillage practice, and cropped area on the soil fungal communities of a Phaeozem luvico of the El Salado river basin (Argentina). Soil samples (at 0-10 cm depth) were collected from a field cultivated with wheat at post-harvest, before sowing and at tillering. The relative abundance of individuals of the fungal population was studied on Nash Snyder and Oxgall agar media after different treatments and assessed as colony forming units (CFU/g of soil). The diversity of the fungal population was studied by Shannon's index (H). The tillage system showed a marked effect only at post-harvest and the number of propagules was highest under RT for both culture media. The largest values of H were found only at post-harvest when Oxgall agar was used. A significant decrease in the values of H was observed when CT and high fertilization was applied in the wheat cropped area. The relative abundance of individuals of the fungal population was different in soils under the different tillage practices.

AB  - In the present study, dispersive liquid-liquid micro-extraction has been applied for trace extraction and determination of mercury (Hg) ions in environmental samples. The mean centering of ratio spectra method was used to optimize the experimental parameters affecting the extraction of Hg. The factors influencing the extraction procedure such as type and volume of extracting and disperser solvent, concentration of chelating reagent, pH, salt effect, and centrifuge time were investigated and optimized. Under the optimized conditions, the limit of detection of the method was 0.15 mu g l(-1) and enrichment factor was 39. The calibration curve was linear in the range of 0.5-100 mu g l(-1) with a correlation of determination (R (2)) of 0.998. The relative standard deviation for determination of 40 mu g l(-1) of Hg(II) was 2.6 % (n = 5). The proposed method was applied for the determination of Hg in pine leaf, sea and river fish, sand, and water samples as indicators of environmental pollution and cigarette with satisfactory analytical results. In comparison with other methods, the proposed method is very simple, easy, rapid, and sensitive for determination of Hg at trace levels in complex matrices.

AB  - In this article, the characteristics of desertification, causative factors and efforts to combat desertification in Libya are presented. Also, the need to mainstream sustainable land management into land use planning is highlighted which could provide a firm basis for future policy decisions to combat desertification. Libya is characterized by a desert type environment and more than 95% of the country is desert or semi-desert. The processes of desertification have been aggravated by human activities coupled with climatic conditions. This intensification of desertification is believed to affect regional as well as global climate. Currently, desertification is one of the main environmental issues in Libya affecting environment and its resources. Among others, overexploitation of natural resources, inappropriate land use planning, insufficient water resources etc. are the main factors escalating the process of desertification and deteriorating environmental quality. Mainstreaming sustainable land management into land use planning has been considered a viable solution to moderate the effects of desertification and rampant usages of natural resources. However, this requires quantifying the severity of desertification by means of identified causative factor. Development of indicators of desertification process by means of using time-series satellite data coupled with ancillary data need to be attempted to establish a monitoring system to manage desertification in more sensitive areas. Moreover, environmental and livelihood implications of increasing desertification need to be addressed in order to promote regional economic sustainable development.

AB  - Peatland-inhabiting testate amoebae are sensitive indicators of substrate-moisture conditions and have increasingly been used in palaeohydrological studies. However, to improve accuracy of testate-amoeba-based hydrological inferences, baseline ecological data on rare taxa, a larger geographic network of calibration sites, and incorporation of long-term estimates of water-table depth are needed. Species-environment relationships at 369 sites from 31 peatlands in eastern North America were investigated. Long-term estimates of water-table depth were obtained using the method of polyvinyl (PVC) tape-discolouration. Transfer functions were developed using a variety of models, and validated through jackknifing techniques and with an independent dataset where water-table depths were directly measured throughout the growing season. Results indicate that mean annual water-table depth can be inferred from testate amoeba assemblages with a mean error of 6 to 8 cm, although there is a slight systematic bias. All transfer function models performed similarly and produced similar reconstructions on a fossil sequence. In a preliminary effort towards development of a comprehensive North American calibration dataset, data from this study were combined with previous studies in Michigan and the Rocky Mountains (n = 650). This combined dataset had slightly larger mean errors of prediction (8-9 cm) but includes data for several rare taxa. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Paleo-hydrologists have adjusted for glacial isostatic uplift and compared the original elevations of paleo-water level indicators and basin outlets for Lake Huron, revealing that Huron lake levels fell tens of meters below its lowest possible outlet (becoming a terminal lake) about 7,900 C-14 years BP. This corresponds to when the upper Great Lakes stopped receiving glacial melt inflow and became dependent for water supply on precipitation alone, as at present. Since these researchers accounted for differential isostatic effects, they surmised that the upper Great Lakes were impacted by severe dry climate. To understand possible climate changes that led to the closure, the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory applied their Advanced Hydrologic Prediction System to explore deviations from present climates that could force the upper Great Lakes to become terminal. GLERL modeled the steady-state water balance of the present upper Great Lakes with pre-development natural water flow conditions by employing lake outflow-depth rating curves (using estimated sill elevations) reasonable for a natural system and by using dynamic lake areas controlled by observed hypsometric relations for each lake. By using systematic shifts in precipitation and temperature relative to the present base climate, GLERL showed the temperature rises and precipitation drops required for a terminal lake; they may be less extreme if additional effects of past differences in wind speed and insolation are also considered.

AB  - Clay pigeon shooting ranges can be an important source of heavy metal contamination in terrestrial ecosystems. The pellets contained in spent ammunition are mainly composed of lead (Pb) and antimony (Sb). Total concentrations of these metals were measured in soils from seven sampling sites within a clay pigeon shooting range and compared with two controls to investigate the effects of their increased levels on the oribatid mites and Collembola community. We found that the spatial distribution of Pb and Sb contamination in the fall-out area is strongly related to the flight path of pellets. Oribatid and Collembola communities are able to survive at levels of heavy metals far higher than the lethal concentration for the most tolerant plants but oribatid mites seem to be affected by heavy metals more than springtails. Collembola and oribatid mites exhibit a wide range of responses to disturbance and many species are more strongly influenced by microhabitat characteristics than Levels of pollution. The effects of annual cultivations conducted in the shooting range and those of heavy metal pollution result in a simplification and homogeneity of community composition. Among arthropods, oribatid mites and springtails have a great potential as bioindicators of environmental conditions; the issue remains as to whether differences in population structure can be used to determine the type of disturbance.

AB  - There has been growing concern about the inflow of metals to the coastal areas because they can be toxic to aquatic and human fife. Some studies have demonstrated the existence of species-specific differences in the metal concentrations of mollusks. We compared metal concentrations between Mytilus galloprovincialis, used as a water quality indicator, and two other bivalve species collected for human consumption (Venerupis pullastra and Cerastoderma edule) in different locations on the Galician coast (northwest Spain). M. galloprovincialis was found to be the best zinc and lead accumulator, whereas silver and arsenic were preferentially accumulated by V. pullastra and chromium and nickel by C edule. Bivalve concentrations of mercury, cadmium, chromium, arsenic, silver, and zinc appeared to be linearly related to environmental concentrations, but this was not the case with copper, nickel, and lead in some species, which indicated that there is a nonlinear accumulation of these metals or an influence of the environmental conditions on species accumulation. The relationship between metal concentration in mussels and in the two other species varied with the metal and the species. In some cases the correlation was high, making it possible to use mussels as bioindicators for the other species. In other cases the correlation was moderate or low, therefore rendering mussels of little or no use in predicting the metal concentrations in the two other species.

AB  - Freshwater lagoons comprise important coastal ecosystems and natural buffers between urbanized land areas and open ocean in the Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Studies of sediment and water chemistry, zooplankton and bacterial communities to assess the extent of anthropogenic disturbance are available. Here we contribute with an organic-geochemical approach supplemented by some microbiological aspects to complete the characterization of these lagoonal ecosystems. Bulk organic matter and extractable lipids (aliphatic hydrocarbons, alcohols and fatty acids, sterols) were investigated from two locations per lagoon: at the seaward site and landward ends-and at two depth intervals (0-3 and 3-6 cm) per site. Urbanized Imboacica Lagoon received increased anthropogenic input over the most recent years represented by the topmost cm of sediment, whereas deeper sediment layers are less affected by human influence. Eutrophication or nutrient availability favored enhanced algal/cyanobacterial growth. In remote Cabiunas and Comprida Lagoons pristine conditions ate preserved. Organic matter from vascular plants dominates (chain length of free lipids up to C36), which is exceptionally well preserved by acidic lagoonal waters. Differentiation between landward and seaward sites in these two lagoons is less well established due to much smaller surface/volume to catchment ratios. No anthropogenic influences are yet detectable in sediments of Cabiunas and Comprida Lagoons.

AB  - Indicators of land quality (LQIs) are being developed as a means to better coordinate actions on land related issues, such as land degradation. Economic and social indicators are already in regular use to support decision making at global, national and sub-national levels and in some cases for air and water quality, but few such indicators are available to assess, monitor and evaluate changes in the quality of land resources. Land refers not just to soil but to the combined resources of terrain, water, soil and biotic resources that provide the basis for land use. Land quality refers to the condition of land relative to the requirements of land use, including agricultural production, forestry, conservation, and environmental management.
   The LQI program addresses the dual objectives of environmental monitoring as well as sector performance monitoring for managed ecosystems (agriculture, forestry, conservation and environmental management). The primary research issue in the LQI program is the development of indicators that identify and characterize the impact(s) of human interventions on the landscape for the major agroecological zones of tropical, sub-tropical and temperate environments. Core LQIs identified for immediate development are: nutrient balance, yield gap, land use intensity and diversity, and land cover; LQIs requiring longer term research include: soil quality, land degradation, and agro-biodiversity; LQIs being developed by other authoritative groups include: water quality, forestland quality, rangeland quality, and land contamination/pollution.

AB  - The effects of modern climate warming are expected to be amplified in northern periglacial regions. Paleohydrological reconstructions in the arctic provide important insights into natural climatic variations during the Pleistocene and Holocene with which to compare predictions of modern impacts. Here the authors describe a new material, calcrete found in fissures in arctic carbonate terrains, which record hydrogeological and climatic conditions during climatic optimums in the north. U-234 and Th-230 activity ratios suggest growth during northern insolation maxima.
   These fissure calcretes strongly resemble biogenic calcite precipitates (endostromatolites), and grow on the external face within fissures in carbonate bedrock in periglacial environments. In thin section, samples are finely laminated and are composed of diverse fabrics including a uniformly present basal layer with regularly spaced columns from several microns to 3 cm in length. Their surface morphology is often preserved in the relief of the adjacent fissure face in a micro-lapies texture strongly suggestive of a dissolution-reprecipitation mechanism whereby the fissure widens in lock-step with column growth. Their highly enriched delta(13)C (0 to +8.4 parts per thousand) composition suggests that methanogenenic bacteria, supported by a substrate of soil-derived organic matter, control growth in a network of groundwater-saturated near-surface fissures extending to a depth of 3 to 5 m. Accordingly, delta(18)O holds valuable paleotemperature information. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Dual-fuel (DF) engines, in which premixed natural gas and air in an open-type combustion chamber is ignited by diesel-fuel pilot sprays, have been more popular for marine use than pre-chamber spark ignition (PCSI) engines because of their superior durability. However, control of ignition and combustion in DF engines is more difficult than in PCSI engines. In this context, this study focuses on the ignition stability of n-heptane pilot-fuel jets injected into a compressed premixed charge of natural gas and air at low-load conditions. To aid understanding of the experimental data, chemical-kinetics simulations were carried out in a simplified engine-environment that provided insight into the chemical effects of methane (CH4) on pilot-fuel ignition. The simulations reveal that CH4 has an effect on both stages of n-heptane autoignition: the small, first-stage, cool-flame-type, low-temperature ignition (LTI) and the larger, second-stage, high-temperature ignition (HTI). As the ratio of pilot-fuel to CH4 entrained into the spray decreases, the initial oxidization of CH4 consumes the OH radicals produced by pilot-fuel decomposition during LTI, thereby inhibiting its progression to HTI. Using imaging diagnostics, the spatial and temporal progression of LTI and HTI in DF combustion are measured in a heavy-duty optical engine, and the imaging data are analyzed to understand the cause of severe fluctuations in ignition timing and combustion completeness at low-load conditions. Images of cool-flame and hydroxyl radical (OH*) chemiluminescence serve as indicators of LTI and HTI, respectively. The cycle-to-cycle and spatial variation in ignition extracted from the imaging data are used as key metrics of comparison. The imaging data indicate that the local concentration of the pilot-fuel and the richness of the surrounding natural-gas air mixture are important for LTI and HTI, but in different ways. In particular, higher injection pressures and shorter injection durations increase the mixing rate, leading to lower concentrations of pilot-fuel more quickly, which can inhibit HTI even as LTI remains relatively robust. Decreasing the injection pressure from 80 MPa to 40 MPa and increasing the injection duration from 500 mu s to 760 mu s maintained constant pilot-fuel mass, while promoting robust transition from LTI to HTI by effectively slowing the mixing rate. This allows enough residence time for the OH radicals, produced by the two-stage ignition chemistry of the pilot-fuel, to accelerate the transition from LTI to HTI before being consumed by CH4 oxidation. Thus from a practical perspective, for a premixed natural gas fuel-air equivalence-ratio, it is possible to improve the "stability" of the combustion process by solely manipulating the pilot-fuel injection parameters while maintaining constant mass of injected pilot-fuel. This allows for tailoring mixing trajectories to offset changes in fuel ignition chemistry, so as to promote a robust transition from LTI to HTI by changing the balance between the local concentration of the pilot-fuel and richness of the premixed natural gas and air. This could prove to be a valuable tool for combustion design to improve fuel efficiency or reduce noise or perhaps even reduce heat-transfer losses by locating early combustion away from in-cylinder walls.

TI  - EXPERIENCES WITH THE APPLICATION OF GIS AND REMOTE-SENSING DATA FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF COST-EFFICIENT AND ECOLOGICALLY SOUND LAND-USE PLANNING, WITH ETHIOPIA PRESENTED AS AN EXAMPLE
T2  - FORSTWISSENSCHAFTLICHES CENTRALBLATT
LA  - German
AB  - The destruction of the natural life bases has reached startling dimensions in Ethiopia during the past 20 years and has lead to a serious threat to this country's people.  Strategies and measures to prevent further losses and towards re-establishment of stabile ecological conditions therefore have highest priority.  Helpful for that are especially methods which provide quick and cost-efficient decision helps.
   The objective of this paper is aimed at the improvement of, and to elaborate on, respectively, geoecological information, applying modern methods (geographical information systems).  This shall lead both to the development of suitable maps and bases for mapping, respectively, and to planning helps for better adaptation of land use to the given natural circumstances.  Required for this is most certainly knowledge of the actual conditions of land use, and the resulting damages and potential risks, respectively.  It had been therefore also the objective of the investigation to picture the present situation of land use and actual risk areas through interpreting satellite data (Landsat TM5) and through using suitable classification methods without elaborate terrestrial inventories.  The three most important steps of the method were therefore:
   - consolidation and evaluation of already available information (maps, climatological data, etc.) using a geographic information system (GIS) - interpretation and evaluation of remote sensing data (satellites) and - plausibility control and supplementation of existing information by specific on-site examination.
   Consolidation and evaluation of the information at hand using a GIS included - the classification of the territory according to original geographic growth regions and - an estimate of the natural ecological potential.  For the former, geographic growth regions were determined on the basis of geo-physiographical criteria, geographic subregions on the basis of climatological data; and further subdivision took place if there were pronounced local differences from the climatological data of the subregion, or because of other peculiarities.
   The estimate of the ecological potential was made on the basis of selected indicators, using GIS.  Indicators were combined, altenatively by using cost-and-benefit-analysis procedures, and by logical combination methods.  Weighting and design of matrices were defined by a Delphie-Study.
   The second methodical approach consists of the evaluation of the remote sensing data, i.e. classification of satellite data for the derivation of the actual land use and risk situation.
   The third methodical part consisted of a plausibility control during which specific on-site examinations, distributed over the territory, were conducted.
   As a result of the trial, the territory was divided into three geographical growth regions (Rift-Valley, highlands, and mountainous areas) with a total of 12 subregions.
   Using selected indicators and a geographical information system, among others the following suitability maps were derived and developed, respectively, for an estimate of the ecological potential - growth-climate suitability - soil suitability - natural risk potential - natural site potential.
   Of the two classification methods used for satellite data, controlled classification furnished better results.  In the beginning, 21 object classes were identified; later on, these were reduced to 12 classes or land use types, respectively.
   Finally, based on soil and climatological suitability maps, natural risk potential, actual land use, and given actual risks, land use objectives and protective measures were derived for each natural region.  The planning suggestions are recommendations which, in the course of further efforts for the ecological stabilization of the region, have then to be discussed and more precisely formulated on-site.

AB  - Heritage institutions house cultural and research content, which is the key source to stimulate soft innovation. Despite the potential, heritage collections are mostly inaccessible via digital mediums. We analyse the macro, meso and micro conditions of heritage organizations across Europe to identify the key determinants that foster soft innovation as reflected by the share of collection digitization and online publication. We find that organizations respond positively to an environment of high consumer digital literacy and sustainable resource allocation that enables slack, skilled staff and long-term strategic planning. Innovation is thus, in fact, enhanced by digital literacy from both producers and consumers.

AB  - Methyl-Ethyl Ketone (MEK) is a promising bulk chemical due to its several applications. MEK can be produced by hydrogenation of 2, 3-Butanediol, a chemical previously produced by fermentation. As hydrogenation results, the output is composed of water, isobutyraldehyde, 2, 3-Butanediol, and Methyl ethyl ketone. Because of the thermodynamic interactions, two azeotropes are formed; consequently, the purification of that mixture is challenging. Current needs promote the generation of alternatives with good economic and environmental performance, however, inherent safety and good controllability must also be accomplished. In this study an intensified process is proposed to reduce the energy investment for MEK purification. The alternative is a hybrid process that combines the advantages of using a liquid-liquid extraction column for handling the azeotropes aforementioned. Additionally, this proposal is compared with four alternatives previously proposed based only on distillation. All alternatives were modeled in Aspen Plus and were optimized considering four targets, the total annual cost, the eco-indicator 99, the individual risk, and the condition number as economic, environmental, safety and controllability indexes, respectively. As a result, interesting trends among objectives and design variables were found. Additionally, the intensified design reported an energy investment of 6.78 MJfuel/kg(MEK), and the best pure distillation alternative 35.5 MJ(fuel)/Kg(MEK). (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Time-series analysis of zooplankton species diversity, distribution, and abundance are essential for ecosystem assessment and fisheries management on continental shelves. This study analyzed two morphologically cryptic species of the calanoid copepod Pseudocalanus, P. moultoni and P. newmani, in zooplankton samples collected during May-June 1995-2012 over Georges Bank, NW Atlantic Ocean. Samples were collected 1995-1999 by US Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics (US GLOBEC) and 2002-2012 by NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center Ecosystem Monitoring (EcoMon). The species were discriminated by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) based on DNA sequence variation of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI). Multivariate statistical analysis revealed significant positive correlation between the geometric mean abundance of P. moultoni and depth-averaged temperature at the collection locations; P. newmani abundances showed no relationship to temperature, suggesting different temperature niches and potential responses to environmental conditions. Interannual patterns of variation of the species-specific abundances of P. moultoni and P. newmani differed significantly from pooled Pseudocalanus spp. Nonmetric multidimensional (NMDS) and regression analyses confirmed significant interannual differences between P. moultoni and P. newmani geometric mean abundances during 1995-2012. This study demonstrates the need for discrimination of closely-related and cryptic zooplankton species to understand and predict impacts of environmental variation and climate change on marine ecosystems.

AB  - We analyzed the spatial-seasonal patterns on the abundance, composition, structure (i.e. abundance distribution among species), and diversity of the ground-dwelling spiders belonging to the retrolateral tibial apophysis (RTA) clade in two pine-oak forest remnants from Mexico. Additionally, a short review to compare the RTA ground-dwelling communities from Mexican habitats was carried out. Spiders were collected monthly, from July 2010 to June 2011, using pitfall-traps at each site. Species composition was seasonally, but not spatially, different. Estimated diversity for the Hill number 1 was influenced by the sites, and a site-season interaction effect was yielded for the Hill number 2. Abundance and community structure were strongly influenced by both sites and seasons. Six species exhibited strong associations with spatial and seasonal-specific conditions (possible bioindicators). Bibliographic analysis showed the highest richness and the lowest number of undescribed species in desert habitats of northern Mexico, pointing those as possible species repositories for the RTA clade. Our results showed a heterogenous spatial-seasonal response in the RTA ground-dwelling spiders, together with a weak influence of the regional variation in temperature and precipitation on the abundance and species richness, suggesting a stronger influence of ecological drivers at the microhabitat scale.

AB  - A significant part of whey generated in Brazil is from small and mid-size dairy companies. Cheese whey has great potential for methane production through anaerobic biological processes but presents instabilities due to its high biodegradability. To study an alternative for the destination of this residue, the aim of this work was to investigate methane from the co-digestion of whey with glycerin and its environmental compliance at 55 degrees C in an anaerobic sequencing batch biofilm reactor. The best performance indicators were obtained with an influent composed of 88% cheese whey and 12% glycerin (by volume), fed-batch mode and organic loading rate of 19.3 kgCOD m(-3) day(-1)at 55 degrees C. This operational condition allowed us to achieve a methane productivity of 203 molCH(4) m(-3) day(-1), a methane yield close to theoretical value, and to remove 68% of all organic matter in the influent. A kinetic metabolic model was fitted to the experimental data, which indicated methanogenesis with preference for the acetoclastic route. Finally, the energy production (approximately 197 MWh month(-1)) from an industrial scale reactor and its volume (three reactors of 152 m(3)) were assessed for a mid-size dairy industry, which could save up to US$ 22,000.00 per month in oil demand.

AB  - In this article we address the environmental assessment of the coprocessing of biomass-based feedstock in crude oil refineries. In particular, we consider the coprocessing of bio-oil (from the pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass) in fluid catalytic cracking and hydrocracking units, and the cogasification of pyrolysis char (coproduced with bio-oil) with coke. In addition to a conventional fossil-based refinery used as the base case, we simulate three alternative case studies including different biofeedstock coprocessing layouts based on original models validated against experimental data. We use process simulation as a primary source of data for the life-cycle assessment (LCA) of each case study. The LCA results show that the system's carbon footprint per energy output is improved when including biofeedstock coprocessing, favoring the study with the highest biofeedstock use. However, the results for other life-cycle indicators such as the abiotic depletion of elements and eutrophication lead to unfavorable results for biofeedstock coprocessing, which is mainly due to the increased use of catalysts and the need for fertilizers. Hence, the suitability of a specific coprocessing layout will be ultimately conditioned by the performance indicators prioritized by the actors involved in the decision-making process.

AB  - Avian feathers have the potential to accumulate trace elements originating from contaminated food and polluted environments. In fact, in feathers, metals bind to keratin, a sulphur-containing protein for which several metals have a strong affinity. Here, the concentrations of 18 essential and non-essential elements were investigated in a Humboldt penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) colony housed at the Acquario di Cattolica (Italy). This species is listed as vulnerable in the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature. According to the literature, there is usually a link between metal levels in the diet of birds and levels detected in their feathers. Thus, metals were also determined in the penguins' food (capelin, Mallotus villosus). We hypothesize that the controlled conditions in which birds are kept in captivity, and the homogeneous diet that they follow could allow a better understanding of metal bioaccumulation (such as mercury) or bio-dilution (such as arsenic) in the marine food chain, indicated by penguins' feathers.
   Moreover, comparisons with our previous investigations performed on an ex-situ African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) colony suggest that penguins living indoors have lower body burden of metals than those living outdoors. Indeed, environmental contaminants usually found in areas subjected to anthropogenic impact, where zoos and aquaria are often located, are not accumulated to levels of concern. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In order to survive environmental changes, bacteria have stress responses, which protect them from adverse and variable conditions. Contamination can be a source of stress and bacterial responses can serve as an indicator of environmental abnormality. In this work, the biochemical effects of toxic compounds that stem from hydraulic fracturing were measured on the whole cell-derived fatty acid and protein compositions of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus subtilis. These microorganisms were exposed to elevated levels of benzene, ethanol, propanol, toluene, and salt. These were chosen to represent significant subsurface contamination or a surface spill. The fatty acid and protein profiles for the bacteria were analyzed using gas chromatography - vacuum ultraviolet spectroscopy and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, respectively. Overall, different fatty acid and protein profiles were observed when the microorganisms were grown in the presence of the toxic compounds. The cells exhibited an increase in the saturated/unsaturated ratio and displayed the presence of branched and cyclopropane fatty acids when in the presence of common fracture fluid constituents to decrease membrane permeability which was confirmed by the analysis of produced water. This approach provides a potentially useful tool for environmental diagnosis, since proteins and fatty acids can act as a harbinger of ecological health.

AB  - Plants retain rhythmic physiological responses when adapting to environmental challenges. However, possible integrations between drought conditions and those responses have not received much focus, especially regarding crop plants, and the relationship between abiotic stress and the diurnal cycle is generally not considered. Therefore, we conducted a genome-wide analysis to identify genes showing both diurnal regulation and water-deficiency response in rice (Oryza sativa). Among the 712 drought-responsive genes primary identified, 56.6% are diurnally expressed while 47.6% of the 761 that are down-regulated by drought are also diurnal. Using the beta-glucuronidase reporter system and qRT-PCR analyses, we validated expression patterns of two candidate genes, thereby supporting the reliability of our transcriptome data. MapMan analysis indicated that diurnal genes up-regulated by drought are closely associated with the starch-sucrose pathway while those that are down-regulated are involved in photosynthesis. We then confirmed that starch-sucrose contents and chlorophyll fluorescence are altered in a diurnal manner under drought stress, suggesting these metabolic diurnal alterations as a novel indicator to evaluate the drought response in rice leaves. We constructed a functional gene network associated with the starch-sucrose KEGG metabolic pathway for further functional studies, and also developed a regulatory pathway model that includes OsbZIP23 transcription factor.

AB  - Indicators are increasingly used to measure environmental systems; however, they are often criticized for failing to measure and describe uncertainty. Uncertainty is particularly difficult to evaluate and communicate in the case of composite indicators which aggregate many indicators of ecosystem condition. One of the ongoing goals of the Ocean Health Index (OHI) has been to improve our approach to dealing with missing data, which is a major source of uncertainty. Here we: (1) quantify the potential influence of gapfilled data on index scores from the 2015 global OHI assessment; (2) develop effective methods of tracking, quantifying, and communicating this information; and (3) provide general guidance for implementing gapfilling procedures for existing and emerging indicators, including regional OHI assessments. For the overall OHI global index score, the percent contribution of gapfilled data was relatively small (18.5%); however, it varied substantially among regions and goals. In general, smaller territorial jurisdictions and the food provision and tourism and recreation goals required the most gapfilling. We found the best approach for managing gapfilled data was to mirror the general framework used to organize, calculate, and communicate the Index data and scores. Quantifying gapfilling provides a measure of the reliability of the scores for different regions and components of an indicator. Importantly, this information highlights the importance of the underlying datasets used to calculate composite indicators and can inform and incentivize future data collection.

AB  - Three organic wastewater compounds (OWCs) were evaluated in theory and practice for their potential to trace sewage-derived microbial contaminants in surface waters. The underlying hypothesis was that hydrophobic OWCs outperform caffeine as a chemical tracer, due to their sorptive association with suspended microorganisms representing particulate organic carbon (POC). Modeling from first principles lab initio) of OWC sorption to POC under environmental conditions suggested an increasing predictive power: caffeine (0.2% sorbed) < triclosan (9-60%; pH 6-9) < triclocarban (76%). Empirical evidence was obtained via analysis of surface water from three watersheds in a rural-to-urban gradient in Baltimore, MD. Mass spectrometric OWC detections were correlated to microbial plate counts for 40 monitoring sites along 14 streams, including multiple chronic sewage release sites and the local wastewater treatment plant. Consistent with ab initio calculations, correlation analyses of 104 observations for fecal coliforms, enterococci, and Escherichia coli in natural surface waters showed that the particle-active antimicrobials triclosan and triclocarban (R-2 range, 0.45-0.55) were indeed superior to caffeine (0.16-0.37) for tracking of microbial indicators. It is concluded that chemical monitoring of microbial risks is more effective when using hydrophobic OWCs such as triclosan and triclocarban in place of, or in conjunction with, the traditional marker caffeine.

Comparison between data on plant-associated invertebrates in the period of maximum eutrophication (1981/82) and twenty years after the total waste diversion (2001/02) was carried out with the aim of demonstrating the performance of this littoral community for the purpose of lake recovery assessment. Following the water clarity improvement characterizing the 2001/02 period, the macrophyte community displayed an amelioration in plant diversification, an enlargement of the colonized area, and an appearance of Charales, important bioindicators of oligotrophic conditions. In complete agreement with this new situation, the invertebrate fauna extended its colonization, and the species composition and quantitative structure changed completely. A considerable increase in species richness and diversity, and significant modifications of percentages and densities of bioindicator taxa (cladocerans, gastropods and acari) showed a very appreciable recovery, which can be defined as a phase of oligotrophication. This trophic state is closely related to nutrient reduction in the water and enhanced by a drift of organic materials from littoral to profundal bottoms. This was due to the remarkable water level reduction of about five meters which occurred in the lake in recent times.

AB  - Biological effects monitoring has seldom been undertaken in offshore pelagic environments. Cages containing hatchery-reared Atlantic cod Gadus morhua were deployed on expected contamination gradients, along a transect from the River Elbe in the German Bight, and in the vicinity of an oil field in the North Sea (Statfjord). Six weeks later, the cod were retrieved and samples taken for a range of biological effects techniques. In this study, metallothionein (MT) and total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC) were measured in liver samples from the caged cod, together with metals (as a measure of bioaccumulation). Both MT and TOSC were highest in cod from the German Bight. In the Statfjord samples MT and TOSC decreased with distance from the oil platform indicating induction in response to anthropogenic sources. The bioavailability of metals appears to be a major factor in MT synthesis, and the measurement of NIT and associated metals is shown to be a useful tool for biological exposure and effects monitoring in pelagic systems. There also appears to be a strong linkage between MT and TOSC levels, indicating overlapping capabilities as stress biomarkers. Results suggest that in addition to its role as a specific indicator of metal exposure, MT in cod could act as a more general biomarker of oxidative stress under certain conditions.

AB  - In recent decades, batchwise equilibrium-based single or sequential extraction schemes have been consolidated as analytical tools for fractionation analyses to assess the ecotoxicological significance of metal ions in solid environmental samples. However, taking into account that naturally occurring processes always take place under dynamic conditions, recent trends have been focused on the development of alternative methods aimed at mimicking environmental events more correctly than their classical extraction counterparts. The present review details the state-of-the-art and the fundamental principles of automated, miniaturized strategies for on-line metal fractionation studies in solid substrates based on the concepts of stirring chambers, rotating coiled columns and packed microcartridges, mostly exploiting the attractive features of continuous-flow analysis, and of the first and second generations of flow-injection analysis. Special attention is also paid to a novel, robust, non-invasive approach for on-site continuous sampling of soil solutions, capitalizing on flow-through microdialysis, which presents itself as an appealing complementary approach to the conventional lysimeter experiments. In addition, a critical comparison between the time-resolved analytical information provided by these novel dynamic extraction procedures and that of the traditional schemes is given and thoroughly discussed in the bulk of the text.

AB  - Spatial prediction of coral reef habitats and coral reef community components was approached on the basis of the 'predict first, classify later' paradigm. Individual community components (biotic and geomorphologic bottom features) were first predicted and then classified into composite habitats. This approach differs from widely applied methods of direct classification based on remote sensing only. In situ coral reef community- condition assessment was first used to measure a response variable (percentage cover of habitat). Reef bottom features (topographic complexity, sand-sediment, rock-calcareous pavement and rubble) were then predicted using generalized additive models (GAMs) applied to continuous environmental maps, high-resolution Ikonos satellite images and a reef digital topographic model (DTM). Next, using GAMs on newly created bottom maps, models were fitted to predict coral community components (hard coral, sea-grass, algae, octocorals). At this stage, high-resolution maps of the geomorphologic and biotic components of the coral reef community at an experimental site (Akumal Reef in the Mexican Caribbean) were produced. Coral reef habitat maps were derived using GIS following a hierarchical classification procedure, and the resulting merged map depicting 8 habitats was compared against thematic maps created by traditional supervised classification. This general approach sets a baseline for future studies involving more complex spatial and ecological predictions on coral reefs.

AB  - This brief paper describes the history and conceptual framework underlying the research presented in the remaining papers in this volume. This project began in 1996 as an international effort to examine Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) ecosystem structure and function in one of the few accessible areas on earth where similar forested ecosystems exist over a 20degrees range in latitude. Widely predicted climate warming leads to serious concerns about how ecosystems may respond to stresses created by climate change. In order to recognize evidence of warming and to predict likely future responses, it is necessary to understand how ecosystems that are distributed along climatic gradients accommodate wide climatic differences. Few tree species are distributed as widely as Scots pine, which ranges over much of Europe. This species is ideal for investigations that address questions regarding climate change effects on forest ecosystem structure and processes. Its distribution over comparable sites extending from temperate to boreal zones (over more than 20degrees of latitude from northern Finland to southern Poland) permits characterization of this ecosystem over a relatively wide climatic range (covering a mean annual temperature difference of 9degreesC). This transect: 1) provides information concerning numerous ecological processes over this wide range of conditions; 2) serves as a template for the development, testing, and evaluation of specific ecological indicators related to climate change; and 3) allows evaluation, comparison, and projection of ecological properties and processes among similar ecosystems with varying climate.

AB  - A grazing intensity gradient in a Zambian woodland covering four sites with long-term grazing histories is defined through ordination procedures. Grazing intensity ranged from zero grazing to severe overutilisation. The frequency and level of abundance of 28 commonly occurring grass species were recorded over the gradient to determine their responses to grazing intensity. Each of the grasses were allocated to one of five ecological status groups. Andropogon gayanus could be a reliable indicator of underutilisation, while Eragrostis palens and Sporobolus pyramidalis could be reliable indicators of overgrazed conditions.

AB  - The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) consists on the identification and assessment of the potential impacts of projects according to the physical, chemical, biological, cultural, economic and social components, in order that by planning and the correct decision-making process, those actions most compatible with the environment are developed. Therefore, it represents a mechanism conditioned to the current global reality, which allows the control and monitoring of environmental management in an integral way. Despite being a widely developed theme, on multiple occasions its application is not fully understood in the face of the plurality of productive sectors that its application contemplates, among other aspects. In Costa Rica, the environmental evaluation process is supervised by the National Environmental Technical Secretariat (SETENA); among the inspection instruments there is an environmental form called "D-1 Form", in which the future developer of the work, activity or project demonstrates the environmental and social impacts to be generated by the activity to develop. In the present research work an evaluation of the environmental impact of different productive sectors in Costa Rica was developed from D-1 forms entered to SETENA during 2018 and 2019. In total, 125 forms of future projects to be developed were analyzed. The industrial sector called "Mining and quarrying" showed the highest environmental impact value (271,27). The industrial sector with the lowest environmental impact value (94,64) corresponds to "Electricity, gas and water".

AB  - Understanding the origins, conditions, advantages and limitations of cooperation in natural and social systems has motivated many investigations in the biological and social sciences. To investigate individual cooperative behaviour in the face of temporal and spatial heterogeneity of resources we considered a definition of cooperation at the same ontological level as competition. We define a cooperative behaviour when an agent acts upon one or more resource(s) with a beneficial result in at least one resource for a recipient of this action, and with a selection process for this behaviour on the side of the acting agent.
   We implemented an agent-based model that represents the interactions of agents through their use of resources. With this model, we illustrated how scarcity of resources in space and time might create situations where cooperative behaviour is beneficial to individuals or to egalitarian groups.
   Simulations highlighted that temporal scarcity as spatial scarcity of the resource procures advantages to egalitarian groups over competitive individuals. Additionally, the factors favouring equity among agents for the access to the resource promote the success of cooperation. Simulations also showed the limitations imposed by group size on cooperation in the context of a common-pool management system.
   The possibility of using indicators of (spatio-temporal) resource variability to characterize the potential for the emergence of cooperation is an interesting research objective for future work.

AB  - The impacts of energy accidents are of primary interest for risk and resilience analysts, decision makers, and the general public. They can cause human health and environmental impacts, economic and societal losses, which justifies the interest in developing models to mitigate these adverse outcomes. We present a classification model for sorting energy accidents in the natural gas sector into hazard classes, according to their potential fatalities. The model is built on decision rules, which are knowledge blocks in the form of "if (condition), then (classification to hazard class x)". They were extracted by the rough sets method using natural gas accident data from 1970-2016 of the Energy-related Severe Accident Database (ENSAD) of the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI), the most authoritative information source for accidents in the energy sector. This was the first attempt to explore the relationships between the descriptors of energy accidents and the consequence (fatalities). The model was applied to a set of hypothetical accidents to show how the decision-making process could be supported when there is an interest in knowing which class (i.e., low, medium, high) of fatalities an energy accident could cause. The successful use of this approach in the natural gas sector proves that it can be also adapted for other energy chains, such as oil and coal.

AB  - The port regions of the Amazon are subject to environmental impacts high shipping traffic. In October 2015, a cargo ship containing 5000 oxen sank in the Port of Vila do Conde, northern Brazil, releasing large amounts of organic matter and diesel oil into the aquatic environment. We evaluated the consequences of this shipwreck on the zooplankton community. Sampling was carried out using a phytoplankton net (64m) at two locations close to the port. We calculated the frequency of occurrence, relative abundance, and trophic state index and performed a canonical redundancy analysis of zooplankton in this area. Total density values ranged from 371 to 8600 organisms/m(3), with minimum values being recorded during the period of the shipwreck and maximum values after the shipwreck. The areas categorized as super eutrophic had the lowest density values. The most abundant species/groups were nauplii and copepodites of the orders Cyclopoida and Calanoida. Of the environmental variables, only biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, and total dissolved solids were selected by the redundancy canonical analysis. The environmental conditions of the region and the ongoing environmental impacts might substantially influence the structure of the zooplankton community. The predominance of these organisms, in addition to the high densities of nauplii and copepodites, was likely related to the large amounts of nutrients generated by the shipwreck.

AB  - Conservation researchers require low-cost access to acoustic monitoring technology. However, affordable tools are often constrained to short-term studies due to high energy consumption and limited storage. To enable long-term monitoring, energy and space efficiency must be improved on such tools. This paper describes the development and deployment of three acoustic detection algorithms that reduce the power and storage requirements of acoustic monitoring on affordable, open-source hardware. The algorithms aim to detect bat echolocation, to search for evidence of an endangered cicada species, and also to collect evidence of poaching in a protected nature reserve. The algorithms are designed to run on AudioMoth: a low-cost, open-source acoustic monitoring device, developed by the authors and widely adopted by the conservation community. Each algorithm addresses a detection task of increasing complexity, implementing extra analytical steps to account for environmental conditions such as wind, analysing samples multiple times to prevent missed events, and incorporating a hidden Markov model for sample classification in both the time and frequency domain. For each algorithm, we report on real-world deployments carried out with partner organisations and also benchmark the hidden Markov model against a convolutional neural network, a deep-learning technique commonly used for acoustics. The deployments demonstrate how acoustic detection algorithms extend the use of low-cost, open-source hardware and facilitate a new avenue for conservation researchers to perform large-scale monitoring.

AB  - The analysis of the polarization of light expands vision beyond the realm of colour and intensity and is used for multiple ecological purposes among invertebrates including orientation, object recognition, and communication. How vertebrates use polarization vision as part of natural behaviours is widely unknown. In this study, I tested the hypothesis that polarization vision improves the detection of zooplankton prey by the northern anchovy, Engraulis mordax, the only vertebrate with a demonstrated photoreceptor basis explaining its polarization sensitivity. Juvenile anchovies were recorded free foraging on zooplankton under downwelling light fields of varying percent polarization (98%, 67%, 19%, and 0% - unpolarized light). Analyses of prey attack sequences showed that anchovies swam in the horizontal plane perpendicular, on average, to the polarization direction of downwelling light and attacked prey at pitch angles that maximized polarization contrast perception of prey by the ventrotemporal retina, the area devoted to polarization vision in this animal. Consequently, the mean prey location distance under polarized light was up to 2.1 times that under unpolarized conditions. All indicators of polarization vision mediated foraging were present under 19% polarization, which is within the polarization range commonly found in nature during daylight hours. These results demonstrate: (i) the first use of oriented swimming for enhancing polarization contrast detection of prey, (ii) its relevance to improved foraging under available light cues in nature, and (iii) an increase in target detection distance that is only matched by polarization based artificial systems.

AB  - Biomass and species richness are two important indicators of ecosystem stability. The relationship between biomass and species richness along precipitation gradient in semi-arid regions is significant for prediction of ecosystem stability under the estimated climatic drying in the-future. In this study, we investigated species richness, aboveground biomass and cover of temperate steppe along a mean annual precipitation (MAP) gradient in central Inner Mongolian of China. We also measured water use efficiency (WUE) of selected species and overall communities. Our results showed that biomass almost remained unchanged in the moist half of the gradient, but species richness decreased markedly with decreasing MAP. Species richness further showed a negligible decrease, whereas a much sharper drop was detected in biomass towards the arid end with decreasing MAP. Vegetation cover shared a similar pattern with biomass and dropped sharply towards the arid end, which may create a strong light and low competition environment favoring C-4 plants. The increment of C-4 species richness could prevent a more intensive decline of species richness under severe arid conditions by raising overall community water use efficiency. Thus, plant communities experiencing water deficiency could also maintain species richness with the occurrence of C-4 plants. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Newly protected, tropical forests recovering from logging and clearance are increasingly important targets for conservation. Recovery is typically evaluated or monitored by using a few easily identified species groups, but this may not be sufficient as unmonitored groups of equivalent ecological importance are unlikely to respond in a similar manner due to physiological or dispersal differences.
   Aims: We compared four groups of plants: large trees, shrubs and saplings, herbs and ferns in a forest recovering from disturbance. We quantified the relative importance of disturbance history and local environmental conditions in determining species richness and community composition of these groups and assessed whether the groups could act as surrogate indicators for one another.
   Methods: Vegetation was surveyed on a gradient of disturbance intensity and recovery time (20-60years) in Mabira Forest, Uganda. We looked for correlations between species groups in richness or composition across sites and used constrained ordinations to identify important environmental variables.
   Results: Neither species richness nor composition patterns were correlated between groups. All groups were weakly related to disturbance history; trees and shrubs were related to soil, herbs to microhabitat and ferns to microclimate.
   Conclusions: No group acted as an indicator for another. The relative influence of disturbance and local environmental effects varied in the manner predicted, with disturbance stronger for trees and environment stronger for ferns.

AB  - Humic acids are the most abundant components of the colloidal and dissolved fraction of natural organic matter (NOM) and widely known to be representatives of NOM behavior in the aquatic environment.
   The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of common anions on the photocatalytic degradation of humic acid and its different molecular size fractions. A representative range of anions were added to humic acid to simulate diverse characteristics of surface water. Induced effects on the removal of the target organic compound were studied. With the aim of assessing the photochemical processes under irradiation conditions, the photocatalytic removal efficiency of humic acid was determined taking into account the major background factors. The results revealed that some specific UV-vis parameters agreed well with the information provided by fluorescence spectroscopy. Despite the complex nature of humic acids in the presence of a solution matrix, the spectroscopic parameters could be regarded as indicators for the photocatalytic removal of humic acid and its molecular size fractions. Depending on the presence of low and high anion matrix, different kinetic model parameters were attained for the photocatalytic removal of the molecular size fractions of humic acid. The photocatalytic degradation rates could be expressed by the half-life values ranging from 20 min to 133 min. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Zeoadsorbents on the basis of copper forms of synthetic zeolite ZSM5 and natural zeolite of the clinoptilolite type (CT) have been studied taking into account their environmental application in removing harmful pyridine (py) from liquid and gas phase. Sorption of pyridine by copper forms of zeolites (Cu-ZSM5 and Cu-CT) has been studied by CHN, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. X-ray powder diffractometry, FTIR spectroscopy, thermal analysis (TG, DTA and DTG) and analysis of the surface areas and the pore volumes by low-temperature adsorption of nitrogen. The results of thermal analyses of Cu-ZSM5, Cu-(py)(x)ZSM5, Cu-CT and Cu-(py)(x)CT zeolitic products with different composition (x depends on the experimental conditions of sorption of pyridine) clearly confirmed their different thermal properties as well as the sorption of pyridine. In the zeolitic pyridine containing samples the main part of the pyridine release process occurs at considerably higher temperatures than is the boiling point of pyridine, which proves strong bond and irreversibility of py-zeolite interaction. FTIR spectra of Cu-(py)(x)zeolite samples showed well resolved bands of pyridine. The results of thermal analysis and FTIR spectroscopy are in a good agreement with the results of other used methods.

AB  - Denticulated margins (also known in older literature as "sawtooth," "cockscomb," or "hacksaw" terminations) are a common feature of pyroxenes and amphiboles, visible in optical and electron microscopes. Denticles are remnants of undissolved material that formerly constituted the walls between elongate etch pits, the characteristic aqueous-dissolution form of chain-silicate minerals. Denticles occur widely in terrestrial near-surface materials that have experienced low-temperature aqueous alteration, including chemically weathered regoliths, soils in a variety of climatic and geomorphic settings, sediments, and sedimentary rocks. Ranges of dissolution forms and dimensions (commonly tens of microns in length) are identical on both pyroxenes and amphiboles in these materials.
   Denticles on terrestrial chain silicates are formed by low-temperature aqueous alteration. Denticles on a soil mineral grain (of unknown composition) at the Phoenix Mars Lander site and on terrestrial pyroxenes naturally weathered in terrestrial low-temperature aqueous environments are broadly similar in size, shape, and orientation relationships between denticles. However, quantitative morphometric parameters vary among different terrestrially weathered pyroxenes and even between different images of compositionally identical pyroxenes from the same naturally weathered sample; such variations are too large to allow simple identification of minerals of unknown composition from morphology alone. Nevertheless, the overall morphological similarities are consistent with a low-temperature aqueous corrosion origin of denticles at the Phoenix Mars Lander site.

AB  - Drought is a natural climatic phenomenon that occurs throughout the world and impacts many sectors of society. To help decision-makers reduce the impacts of drought, it is important to improve monitoring tools that provide relevant and timely information in support of drought mitigation decisions. Given that drought is a complex natural hazard that manifests in different forms, monitoring can be improved by integrating various types of information (e.g., remote sensing and climate) that is timely and region specific to identify where and when droughts are occurring. The Vegetation Drought Response Index for Canada (VegDRI-Canada) is a recently developed drought monitoring tool for Canada. VegDRI-Canada extends the initial VegDRI concept developed for the conterminous United States to a broader transnational coverage across North America. VegDRI-Canada models are similar to those developed for the United States, integrating satellite observations of vegetation status, climate data, and biophysical information on land use and land cover, soil characteristics, and other environmental factors. Collectively, these different types of data are integrated into the hybrid VegDRI-Canada to isolate the effects of drought on vegetation. Twenty-three weekly VegDRI-Canada models were built for the growing season (April-September) through the weekly analysis of these data using a regression tree-based data mining approach. A 15-year time series of VegDRI-Canada results (s to 2014) was produced using these models and the output was validated by randomly selecting 20% of the historical data, as well as holdout year (15% unseen data) across the growing season that the Pearson's correlation ranged from 0.6 to 0.77. A case study was also conducted to evaluate the VegDRI-Canada results over the prairie region of Canada for two drought years and one non-drought year for three weekly periods of the growing season (i.e., early-, mid-, and late season). The comparison of the VegDRI-Canada map with the Canadian Drought Monitor (CDM), an independent drought indicator, showed that the VegDRI-Canada maps depicted key spatial drought severity patterns during the two targeted drought years consistent with the CDM. In addition, VegDRI-Canada was compared with canola yields in the Prairie Provinces at the regional scale for a period from 2000 to 2014 to evaluate the indices' applicability for monitoring drought impacts on crop production. The result showed that VegDRI-Canada values had a relatively higher correlation (i.e., r>0.5) with canola yield for nonirrigated croplands in the Canadian Prairies region in areas where drought is typically a limiting factor on crop growth, but showed a negative relationship in the southeastern Prairie region, where water availability is less of a limiting factor and in some cases a hindrance to crop growth when waterlogging occurs. These initial results demonstrate VegDRI-Canada's utility for monitoring drought-related vegetation conditions, particularly in drought prone areas. In general, the results indicated that the VegDRI-Canada models showed sensitivity to known agricultural drought events in Canada over the 15-year period mainly for nonirrigated areas.

AB  - Spent grains from microbreweries are mostly formed by malting barley (or malt) and are suitable for a further valorization process. Transforming spent grains from waste to raw materials, for instance, in the production of nontraditional flour, requires a previous drying process. A natural convection solar dryer (NCSD) was evaluated as an alternative to a conventional electric convective dryer (CECD) for the dehydration process of local microbrewers' spent grains. Two types of brewer's spent grains (BSG; Golden ale and Red ale) were dried with both systems, and sustainability indices, specific energy consumption (e(C)), and CO2 emissions were calculated and used to assess the environmental advantages and disadvantages of the NCSD. Then, suitable models (empirical, neural networks, and computational fluid dynamics) were used to simulate both types of drying processes under different conditions. The drying times were 30-85 min (depending on the drying temperature, 363.15 K and 333.15 K) and 345-430 min (depending on the starting daytime hour at which the drying process began) for the CECD and the NCSD, respectively. However, e(C) and CO2 emissions for the CECD were 1.68-1.88 center dot 10(-3) (kW h)/kg and 294.80-410.73 kg/(kW h) for the different drying temperatures. Using the NCSD, both indicators were null, considering this aspect as an environmental benefit.

AB  - The Food-Energy-Water (FEW) nexus for urban sustainability needs to be analyzed via an integrative rather than a sectoral or silo approach, reflecting the ongoing transition from separate infrastructure systems to an integrated social-ecological-infrastructure system. As technology hubs can provide food, energy, water resources via decentralized and/or centralized facilities, there is an acute need to optimize FEW infrastructures by considering cost-benefit-risk tradeoffs with respect to multiple sustainability indicators. This paper identifies, categorizes, and analyzes global trends with respect to contemporary FEW technology metrics that highlights the possible optimal integration of a broad spectrum of technology hubs for possible cost-benefit-risk tradeoffs. The challenges related to multiscale and multiagent modeling processes for the simulation of urban FEW systems were discussed with respect to the aspects of scaling-up, optimization process, and risk assessment. Our review reveals that this field is growing at a rapid pace and the previous selection of analytical methodologies, nexus criteria, and sustainability indicators largely depended on individual FEW nexus conditions disparately, and full-scale cost-benefit-risk tradeoffs were very rare. Therefore, the potential full-scale technology integration in three ongoing cases of urban FEW systems in Miami (the United States), Marseille (France), and Amsterdam (the Netherlands) were demonstrated in due purpose finally.

AB  - Fluoranthene, a four-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon that is possible genotoxic in nature, has been used as an indicator for assessing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-containing pollutants. Microbial degradation is one of the promising methods in removing up PAR-contaminated environments. White-rot fungi have showed the ability to degrade a wide range of PAHs. This study aimed to investigate enzyme production, fungal biomass, and glucose utilization during the biodegradation process of fluoranthene by a white-rot fungus Pleurotus pulmonarius F043 and to identify the metabolites produced in the degradation process. The extracellular ligninolytic enzyme system of the fungi, producing laccases and peroxidases, was directly linked to the biodegradation of fluoranthene. The production of ligninolytic enzymes during fluoranthene degradation was related to an increase in the biomass of Pleurotus pulmonarius F043. Fluoranthene removal decreased with an increase in fluoranthene concentrations. The highest biomass production of Pleurotus pulmonarius F043 (>= 4 400 mg L-1) was found in the 10 mg L-1 fluoranthene culture after 30 d of incubation. Two fluoranthene metabolites, naphthalene-1,8-dicarboxylic acid and phthalic acid, were found in the process of fluoranthene degradation. Laccase was revealed as the major enzyme that played an important role in degradation process. Suitable conditions must be found to promote a successful fungal biotransformation augmentation in liquid culture.

AB  - The high inactivation of faecal indicators [faecal coliforms (FC), E. coli and faecal streptococci (FS)] using a combination of methylene blue (MB) with natural sunlight or artificial visible light determined on a small scale, was dependent mainly on the MB concentration, its application process and pH. In order to avoid primarily leaching of the compound into the environment and to further understand the MB photosensitization mechanisms, MB should be properly immobilized within resin. The FC and FS were found to be susceptible to the photodynamic action of MB fixed to the support. The mechanism of faecal bacteria inactivation by MB also seems to be a combination of Type I and Type II processes, and the relative efficiency of each of them depends notably on the experimental conditions. In parallel, the MB stability under light "photobleaching" has been studied by optical absorption spectroscopy. It has been shown that it was dependent essentially on pH, nature of the medium (distilled water and secondary wastewater effluent) and time exposure to light. Practically, all of the MB (10 mu M) disappeared from effluent, exposed to sunlight, by the end of a 12 h experiment with a bleaching rate from 92 at neutral pH. Kinetic data indicate that the dye photobleaching efficiency can be approximated by pseudo-first-order reaction.

AB  - It is very difficult to realistically assess cultivated land quality (CLQ) because its contributing factors cannot be accurately quantified. This study aims at overcoming this difficulty by using information objectively derivable from ETM+ and SPOT images for Hengshan County, Northwest China. This objective approach is able to yield a comprehensive CLQ assessment using five proposed indicators. They are slope gradient, proportion of sandy land, water availability, soil fertility, and land use types organized into three indices of pressure resistance, land state, and land use response. Therefore, this assessment takes into consideration topographic setting, land degradation risk, moisture, vegetation growing condition, and land use response of farmers. The developed CLQ is found to be significantly correlated with the spatial distribution of water resources, suggesting that water availability is a decisive factor influencing land productivity. CLQ is also correlated closely with rural economic level, agricultural infrastructure investment, and the farming system. The whole County was further classified into three cultivated land use zones based on the calculated CLQ value. Each zone is best used for different purposes and requires different strategies of protection. Such assessment outcomes are essential for the prevention of land degradation and adjustment of agricultural structure to promote sustainable use of cultivated land. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sardine (Sardinops sagax) fisheries were the largest in British Columbia from the mid-1920s to the mid-1940s, and catches averaged 40,000t annually. In 1947 not only did the fishery off British Columbia collapse but also the sardines disappeared totally from British Columbia waters. Sardines re-appeared in 1992, after a period of 45 years. As their abundance increased, sardines spawned off the west coast of British Columbia in 1997 and 1998, and one year old juveniles became distributed along the entire coast and off the coast of Alaska. This distribution and spawning behaviour was not reported in the 1930s and 1940s. The changes in sardine dynamics were related to regime shifts, but did not oscillate in synchrony with all the decadal-scale changes in climate as indexed by the pattern of the Atmospheric Forcing Index (AFI). This response indicates that the linkage between sardines and climate regimes is specific to an assemblage of factors that characterise the regimes. Indicators of ecosystem change such as temperature should be viewed more as surrogates of change than specific regulators of distribution and abundance. The specific aggregate of factors that create favourable ecosystems for sardines remains to be discovered. We suggest that it is the change of regimes that creates conditions favourable to sardines by improving the productivity of diatoms that are specific to the improved early survival of larval sardines.

AB  - In order to cope with degradation and unsustainability of ecosystems, many countries had developed a large number of ecotechnologies. Before learning ecotechnology from other regions, we should evaluate the technology to judge whether it is suitable for our own situation. Based on the lack of scientific and reasonable index system as well as evaluation model in ecotechnology evaluation, we constructed a comprehensive evaluation index system consist of the eco-technology attributes, the implementation conditions, the implementation effects and the popularization potential; and established three-stage evaluation method with Logistic Regression Model according to the analysis of advantages and disadvantages of commonly used assessment models. According to our understanding degree of ecotechnology, the model could not only realize the comprehensive evaluation of ecotechnology as a whole, but also modularly assess the various elements of technology, and the evaluation process is dynamic and objective. We realized the evaluation model of ecotechnology based on the investigation on soil and water conservation technology in the Loess Plateau, and verified its effectiveness using the data of Nangou Village. The results show that the three-stage evaluation method based on Logistic Regression Model is suitable for ecotechnology assessment. The model can not only provide scientific and effective support for the introduction and popularization of ecotechnology, but also provide reference for the design of ecological engineering construction scheme.

AB  - Large-scale monitoring of wild populations in remote areas using traditional live-capturing methods is logistically and financially challenging. Devices that can be used to obtain biological material remotely and store it for an extended period have considerable potential to monitor population densities and health status, but their applicability remains largely unexplored. The present study describes a device that collects trace amounts of DNA from the saliva of small mammals that is deposited on the surface of a collection medium (WaxTags (R)). The device's performance was evaluated on Australian brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), an invasive pest species and the most significant vector of bovine tuberculosis infective agent (Mycobacterium bovis), under field conditions in Canterbury, New Zealand. The retrieved DNA was used to amplify eight possum-specific microsatellite markers and bacterial 16S rRNA. The design is mechanically robust, and the quality of the recovered DNA was adequate for microsatellite-based identification of individual possums, estimation of population density, and partial reconstruction of their oral microbiomes as a potential indicator of health. Several medically important bacteria, including strains of environmental Mycobacterium sp., were detected. The design can be refined to monitor other animals' populations proactively and provide different levels of information necessary to manage wild populations.

AB  - The relevance of a biomarker for biomonitoring programs was influenced both by the knowledge on biomarker natural inter-individual and site variabilities and by the sensitivity of the biomarker towards environmental perturbations. To minimize data misinterpretation, robustness reference values for biomarkers were important in biomonitoring programs. Specific three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, immune reference ranges for field studies had been determined based on laboratory data and one reference station (Contentieuse river at Houdancourt). In this study, data obtained in one uncontaminated and three contaminated sites were compared to these reference ranges as a validation step before considering them for larger scale biomonitoring programs. When the field reference range were compared to data from the uncontaminated station (Be ' ronelle), only few deviations were shown. In this way, data coming from uncontaminated station (Be ' ronelle) was integrated in the field reference ranges to improve the evaluation of site variability. The new field reference ranges provided better discrimination of sites and spanned a larger range of fish lengths than the initial reference ranges. Furthermore, the results suggest lysosomal presence during several months and phagocytosis capacity in autumn may be the most relevant immunomarkers towards identifying contaminated sites. In the future, combining this reference value approach with active biomonitoring could facilitate the obtention of data in multiple stream conditions.

AB  - The famous terraced rice ecosystem in the mountainous areas as Sapa of northern Vietnam has expanded with unstable productivity over generations. However, the question arises of how natural and human conditions on terraces can boost the quality of rice provisioning ecosystem service supply with rice yields as an indicator. The study used a semi-structured interview method, the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) tool and general linear models to investigate the influence of natural and human-derived components on the rice provisioning service at six villages. The results showed that along with the importance of applying a fertilizer-based system in the terraced rice ecosystem, topology- and hydrology-based systems have been influencing significantly on water and nutrient supply for irrigation on terraced rice fields. Moreover, analyzing the natural components has been considered more efficient than human-derived components for a sustainable rice ecosystem. The results indicated that the high potential of rice provisioning service supply had found at the downstream of Ta Van sub-catchment and the Vu Lung Sung village where the distance from paddy fields to sinks or outlet of streams is lower than five kilometers. The last result of the synthetic model proving 74.28 percent of deviance of terraced rice production did not avoid many noises in collecting and standardizing data that also discuss in this study.

AB  - We examined the variations in microfungal communities from different surface types (cyanobacterial crusts, lichen-dominated crusts, and noncrusted bare surface) at two different positions-north-oriented slope and sun-exposed plain in the Tabernas Desert, Spain. A total of 77 species from 46 genera was isolated using the soil dilution plate method. The studied mycobiota, similar to the majority of desert mycobiotas, was dominated by melanin-containing species. However, in the Tabernas crusts, unlike the studied crusts of the Negev Desert (Israel) and the Tengger Desert (China), melanized fungi with large multicellular spores were much less abundantly represented, while the thermotolerant group, Aspergillus spp., remarkably contributed to the communities' structure. Density of microfungal isolates positively correlated with chlorophyll content indicating possible significant influence of organic matter content on fungal biomass. The variations in crust composition, biomass, and the position of habitats were accompanied by the variations in microfungal community structure, diversity level, and isolate densities, with the communities at the plain sun-exposed position being much less variable than the communities at the north-oriented position. The study shows that microclimatic and edaphic factors play an essential role in the development of crust and noncrust microfungal communities, and their structure can be a sensitive indicator of changing environmental conditions at a microscale.

AB  - Understanding the impacts of agricultural practices on soil quality indicators, such as enzymatic activities, is of great importance, in order to advance in their diagnosis and sustainable management. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of ecological and conventional agricultural managements on enzymatic activities of a soil under coffee agroecosystems. The enzymatic activities were associated with the biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen (urease and protease), phosphorus (acid and alkaline phosphatase) and carbon (beta-glucosidase), during the rainy and dry seasons. Physical-chemical soil proprieties were also assessed and related to resilience scores linked to the climatic variability reported for the areas under study. The activities of urease, alkaline and acid phosphatase and beta-glucosidase were statistically higher in ecological agroecosystems than in conventional ones. This may be attributed to the greater application of organic waste in the ecological environment, as well as to the absence of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers, which allow better conditions for the microbial activity. The resilience scores to the climate variability that showed the highest correlations with the assessed enzymatic activities were: the farmers' knowledge on soil microorganisms, non-use of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers and non-dependence on external supplies. It was concluded that the enzymatic activities are modified by the management systems, being specifically favored by the ecological management. This agroecosystem, in the long term, ensures an efficient use of the soil resources, with a lower degradation and contamination.

AB  - The assumption behind Amplitude Variation with Offset (AVO) concept is that amplitude changes (either decrease or increase) with offset can be related to rock physical properties and pore-fluid content. The technique has been widely deployed in the Gulf of Mexico, and has proved to be an excellent indicator of hydrocarbons and lithology. Over the past 40 years, several studies have shown that AVO responses of gas sands differ by geologic setting. These responses have been observed in many locations around the globe, some in basins similar to the Mexican Gulf such as the North Sea, South Canada, but others are in different geological settings than the Gulf setting. In this study we review some examples from North African and Middle Eastern basins. We discuss the occurrence of AVO anomalies and the successful application of the technique for detecting and delineating hydrocarbon reservoirs. Furthermore, we illustrate case studies where the technique was used for carbonate and naturally fractured reservoirs exploration and characterization. The case histories illustrated in the study demonstrate that AVO technique is applicable in different geological settings and environments including old and deep sand reservoirs in North Africa and the Middle East. Once calibrated to the local geology. AVO can perform well even in geological conditions that differ from the Gulf of Mexico where the technique was first developed and successfully implemented.

AB  - Which plant species can be found on rice field bunds and what are the prevailing life forms? Which plant communities occur and what are the main environmental drivers and phytogeographic patterns shaping these communities? How do species diversity and composition differ between bunds and paddies? To answer these questions, 133 vegetation relev,s using the Braun-Blanquet method were collected in lowlands and uplands of Vietnam and the Philippines between 2012 and 2015. Soil samples were collected and farmers were interviewed. Properties of soil, climate, and geography were assessed, further structural parameters, landscape heterogeneity, seasonality, management and intensity of cultivation. Hierarchical UPGMA cluster analysis and NMDS ordinations were performed to visualize variation in plant community composition and the determinants. We found 302 vascular plant species, of which 94 species are red listed by the IUCN (under category "Least concern"). Therophytes and helophytes are the prevailing life forms. Six clusters of plant communities were classified, and temperature, soil acidity, land use intensity and nutrient availability were identified (according to relevance) as explanatory variables. Bunds revealed higher species richness than paddies and bunds in mountain areas were more species-rich than those in the lowlands. We conclude that the composition of bund communities provides valuable information on environmental and biogeographical conditions of the local rice landscapes, and that it is probably the best applicable and most reliable indicator of management intensity.

AB  - A new dataset of ecological indicator values for species, subspecies and some varieties, hybrids and infrageneric species groups has been compiled for the vascular flora of the Czech Republic. Indicator values for light, temperature, moisture, (soil) reaction, nutrient availability and salinity were assigned to 2275 species and 801 other taxa, using the nine-degree (or 12-degree for moisture and 10-degree for salinity) ordinal scales proposed by Heinz Ellenberg for the flora of Germany. The values are compatible with Ellenberg indicator values, which were used as a baseline, but extensively revised based on our own field observations, literature, comparison with indicator value systems of other countries and an analysis of taxon co-occurrences in vegetation plots from the Czech National Phytosociological Database. Taxa in the Czech flora missing in the original Ellenberg tables were added. Compared with the original Ellenberg's dataset of indicator values, smaller proportions of taxa were classified as extremely basiphilous, extremely oligotrophic or strictly avoiding saline habitats. The revised values were tested by regressing unweighted site mean indicator values against measured environmental variables. In most cases, prediction of environmental conditions was slightly more accurate with the new Czech indicator values than with the original Ellenberg indicator values. The full dataset of indicator values is available in an electronic appendix to this paper.

AB  - There is increasing empirical evidence that changes in habitat quality play an important role in determining species distributions and biodiversity. However, most research has focused on habitat quality, and we still lack approaches for tracking habitat quality dynamics. In this paper, by establishing qualitative and quantitative relationships between waterbird populations and key habitat indicators such as water abundance, food, shelter conditions and disturbance, we developed an object-oriented classification method, in conjunction with a geographic information systems (GIS) based centroid moving method, to assess habitat suitability dynamics for waterbirds at the Momoge Nature Reserve, China. Our results showed that habitat suitability improved during 1990-2000 and declined during 2000-2014. Habitats with very good and good grades increased by 71.47 km(2) (4.88%) during 1990-2000 and decreased by 200.66 km(2) (13.78%) during 2000-2014. The habitat area with a good grade moved to the north, while the habitat area with a poor grade moved to the south during 1990-2014. This was mainly because the surrounding cropland area increased and shifted as oil and gas projects developed. These findings suggest that our object-oriented classification and centroid moving methods have great potential for use in biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management.

AB  - Resource allocation to multiple alternative conservation actions is a complex task. A common trade-off occurs between protection of smaller, expensive, high-quality areas versus larger, cheaper, partially degraded areas. We investigate optimal allocation into three actions in boreal forest: current standard forest management rules, setting aside of mature stands, or setting aside of clear-cuts. We first estimated how habitat availability for focal indicator species and economic returns from timber harvesting develop through time as a function of forest type and action chosen. We then developed an optimal resource allocation by accounting for budget size and habitat availability of indicator species in different forest types. We also accounted for the perspective adopted towards sustainability, modeled via temporal preference and economic and ecological time discounting. Controversially, we found that in boreal forest set-aside followed by protection of clear-cuts can become a winning cost-effective strategy when accounting for habitat requirements of multiple species, long planning horizon, and limited budget. It is particularly effective when adopting a long-term sustainability perspective, and accounting for present revenues from timber harvesting. The present analysis assesses the cost-effective conditions to allocate resources into an inexpensive conservation strategy that nevertheless has potential to produce high ecological values, in the future.

AB  - A method for the determination of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) by fast gas chromatography coupled with mass-spectrometric detection in selective ion monitoring mode has been developed. Chromatographic separation was carried out with HT-8 column (30 m x 0.25 mm) under sharp temperature increase from 80 to 320A degrees C at a rate of 40A degrees C/min. Duration of chromatography is 10 min. Fast chromatography conditions suggested by authors makes it possible to increase S/N ratios 10 times and so to reduce significantly the representative weight of the sample and develop an effective sample preparation technique. The method was used for PCB determination in Baikal area samples such as soil, snow, sediments from Lake Baikal and its tributaries, tissues of Baikal omul (Coregonus migratorius, Georgi, 1775) and blubber of Baikal seal (Phoca sibirica Gm.). The sample preparation stage includes PCB extraction from environmental samples and hydrolyzate of biological material with the following cleanup of the extract on the compact silica gel and florisil cartridges (0.5 g of the sorbent). The method enables the measurements of total PCBs and isomer groups of the same chlorination level with interlaboratory precision of no greater than 10% and the determination of indicator congeners (PCBs 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153, and 180) with a precision not exceeding 15%.

AB  - This paper aims to assess the vulnerability at regional level, the model and the proposed indicators being explicitly intended for an essentially rural region, in this case-Tutova Hills (Eastern Romania). Five categories of variables were taken into account to define the vulnerability components: rural habitat, demographic features, agriculture, environmental quality and emergency situations. For each one, five variables were analyzed and ranked based on the level of determination or subordination. In order to ensure the flexibility of the model and to avoid the criteria duplication in assessing vulnerability, only a single indicator of each category was retained and included in analysis: total number of inhabitants, dependency ratio, weight of arable land on slope categories, weight of land under forestry and road accessibility of villages. The selected indicators were mathematically processed in order to maximize their relevance and to unitary express the results in the spread 0-1. Also, values of each indicator were grouped into four classes, corresponding to the level of vulnerability: low, medium, high and very high. A general index was obtained through the integration of vulnerability factors in an equation based on the geometric mean. Spatial analysis was based on features of the MicroImages TNTmips 7.3. software, which allow the vulnerability mapping. This approach argues and states that vulnerability assessment through indicator-based methods can be made only according to the level and scale of analysis and related to natural or human conditions of a region.

AB  - Ecological risk assessments rarely evaluate indirect pesticide effects. Pesticides causing no direct mortality in wildlife can still reduce prey availability, resulting in a lower reproductive rate or poor juvenile condition. Few studies have examined these consequences at the population level. We use a four-year data set from a forest ecosystem in which Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki (Btk) was applied to control gypsy moths (Lymantria dispar L.). Lower worm-eating warbler (Helmitheros vermivorus) productivity on Btk plots contributed to an intrinsic growth rate <1. Altered provisioning behavior by adults led to lower nestling mass in Btk-treated plots, and simulations of reduced juvenile survival expected as a result further reduced population growth rate. The present study explored different spatial representations of treated areas, using a two-patch matrix model incorporating dispersal. Minimal migration from areas with increasing subpopulations could compensate for detrimental reductions in reproductive success and juvenile survival within treated subpopulations. We also simulated population dynamics with different proportions of treated areas to inform management strategies in similar systems. Nontoxic insecticides are capable of impacting nontarget populations with consistent, long-term use and should be evaluated based on the spatial connectivity representative of habitat availability and the time period appropriate for risk assessment of pesticide effects in wildlife populations.

AB  - Herbaceous plant species are important components of forest ecosystems, and their persistence in forests may be affected by invasive plant species that reduce mycorrhizal colonization of plant roots. I examined the effect of the invasive plant Alliaria petiolata on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonizing the roots of three forest plant species. AMF root colonization and community structure was examined from plants that were growing, either in the absence or presence of Alliaria under natural forest conditions. AMF root colonization varied among the plant species but was not significantly affected by Alliaria. With molecular methods, similar to 12 different taxa of AMF could be distinguished among the root samples, and these taxa belonged to the genera Acaulospora and Glomus, with Glomus dominating AMF communities. There were significant differences between the community of AMF colonizing roots of Maianthemum racemosum and Trillium grandiflorum, but only AMF communities of Maianthemum roots were significantly affected by Alliaria, indicator species analysis found that an Acaulospora species type was a significant indicator of Maianthemum plants grown in the absence of Alliaria. These results suggest invasive plants like Alliaria may selectively suppress AMF fungi, and this suppression can affect AMF communities colonizing the roots of some native plant species.

AB  - Multi-proxy paleoenvironmental reconstructions are useful to determine the various factors affecting the biological communities of a lake, but to assess if changes in community composition of one indicator organism accurately reconstructs climatic changes through time, it may be more useful to compare temperature reconstructions using the same indicator in several lakes. Here, we compare reconstructions of mean July air temperature using chironomid-based transfer functions from Holocene records at three nearby lakes in the Abisko Valley of northern Sweden to assess if chironomids can be used as indicators of regional temperature changes. The three study lakes experience the same regional climatic conditions, but are located along gradients of elevation (348-999 in a.s.l), temperature (8.1-12degreesC) and terrestrial vegetation (coniferous to alpine). Chironomid-temperature reconstructions from the three sites indicate a general pattern of temperature decrease (1.5-2.4degreesC) during the Holocene, consistent with decreases observed from analyses of other proxies in this area, and from other alpine regions in Europe and North America. Similarities between these reconstructions suggest that chironomids can adequately record general patterns of temperature changes through the Holocene, although effects of site-specific factors such as variations in lake water pH can cause deviations in inferred temperature among sites during some periods.

AB  - Karst is the result of an epigenetic geomorphologic process that may involve rapid changes to landscapes and their physical properties, with the newly formed relief complicating regional economic development and the protection of nature. The intensity of the karst process is closely linked with the circulation of surface and groundwater, so that the parameters characterising water circulation and chemical denudation can serve as indicators of the intensity of karstification. In this article, we describe the North Lithuanian karst region, and evaluate the influence of climate and hydrological conditions on karstification. Upper Devonian gypsum and dolomites occur beneath the Quaternary sediments here. Sinkholes frequently appear where the latter are particularly thin and underlain by gypsum, suggesting that karstification is intensifying. This is perhaps related to climate change expressed by an increase in mean annual temperature and runoff, especially during warm winters. To identify the main determinants of the karst processes, monitoring was carried out between 1994 and 1999, and data on river runoff and water chemistry from 1962 to 1999 were examined. From 1978 to 1999, the mean chemical denudation rate in the active gypsum karst zone was 30% higher than from 1962 to 1977, a change mirrored by the increased total volume of new sinkholes that appeared in the 1980s and 1990s. We have calculated the rate of chemical denudation and sink-hole formation in the last four decades and discuss karst activitiy as a geoindicator of environmental change.

AB  - The distributions of a range of elements (including Cs-137 and Pb-210) have been studied in surface sediments and 0.5 m cores from the Bilbao Estuary (Cantabrian coast, northern Spain) to determine recent and historical sediment contamination. Benthic foraminifera have also been examined to infer recent ecosystem changes. High concentrations of a range of metals are observed in three cores and in surface-scrapes. Observed concentrations depend on the proximity to sources of pollutants. Living foraminifera are absent from surface sediments in the upper estuary, and are scarce in the middle and lower estuary, due to persistent anoxia in the estuarine channel, and possibly, high pollutant concentrations. High metal concentrations in sediment core profiles, combined with the sporadic presence of foraminifera, indicate that environmental degradation has persisted in this estuary for at least the last 40 years. This degradation has been caused by the discharge of untreated industrial and domestic effluents. Surface sediments show a few transported living foraminifera of species char have been identified as dominant in nearby, less-polluted estuarine environments.. Successful recolonization by these species may occur if the sediment conditions improve sufficiently. Foraminiferal assemblages could therefore be used as environmental quality indicators to assess the effectiveness of current regeneration schemes implemented under strategic local authority plans.

We studied frost injuries in tree-rings of Araucaria araucana trees growing at the northern limit of its natural distribution. We recorded 121 frost injuries at two sites in the northern xeric distribution of A. Araucana forests. Frost rings at both sites were primarily restricted to the middle frost ring section of the rings. These results represent the first attempt to report and describe the occurrence of these events for this species and region. These proxy records represent important indicators of extreme temperature conditions.

AB  - Development and testing of a simple runoff sampler which can be used to monitor the quantity of sediment carried by runoff from small agricultural watersheds is presented.  The sampler uses the rapidly fluctuating flow nature to account for the temporal variation in sediment concentration.  Intensive laboratory testing was carried out for sampler efficiencies at various flow and sediment conditions.  Overall efficiency obtained was in the range of 87 to 98%.  The sediment catching efficiencies for clay, silt, fine sand and coarse sand particles were 96%, 87%, 75% and 60%, respectively.  The sampler has been in use for the last 4 years in the field and its general performance has been satisfactory.

AB  - To determine the relationship between region specific dinoflagellate cyst distribution in the Po-river discharge area and oceanic environmental conditions, surface sediments of 48 sites in the middle and distal part of the discharge plume area have been studied. Establishing such a relationship is a prerequisite to create reconstructions of the eutrophication history as well as the palaeoclimatic and palaeoceanography history of the area.
   Literature based information about the sedimentation rates based on Pb-210 dating methods are available for 18 sites. This enables the calculation of cyst accumulation rates of individual cyst species which reflect their cyst production. Correlation of the accumulation rates of individual species with environmental parameters of the upper waters allows us to adapt and refine the ecological characteristics of a selection of cyst species. This latter is trivial since the current concepts on the ecological significance of dinoflagellate cyst have to be revised as a result of the current developments in the dinoflagellate research field. These developments have elucidated that a considerable part of the relative abundance datasets that form the basis for the present day ecological concepts of dinoflagellate cysts might have suffered from so called "closed sum effects" and have been overprinted by early diagenetic processes.
   The dinoflagellate cyst association reflects both upper and bottom water circulation. Based on the relative abundance data four associations can be distinguished that are characteristic for the major oceanographic settings in the region. (1) River discharge association. This association consists of Echinidinium spp., Lejeunecysta sabrina, Lingulodinium machaerophorum, Polykrikos kofoidii, Polykrikos schwarzii, cysts of Protoperidinium stellatum, Selenopemphix quanta and reworked cysts. These species have high relative abundances in sites where bottom waters are low in oxygen and upper waters are influenced by river discharge waters that are characterized by high productivity and relative low salinity. (2) Warm water association. This association consists of Spiniferites mirabilis, Spiniferites pachydemus, Spiniferites ramosus and Spiniferites spp. which have their highest relative abundances in the sites at the plume margin that are characterized by relative warm upper waters and intermediate chlorophyll-a concentrations. (3) Oxygenated bottom water group. Species of this group; Impagidinium aculeatum, Impagidinium patulum, Impagidinium sphaericum, Operculodinium centrocarpum and Operculodinium israelianum have their highest relative abundances at sites where bottom waters are formed by well ventilated Adriatic Deep Water or Eastern Mediterranean Deep Water. (4) Golfo di Taranto group consisting of round brown cysts produced by Protoperidinium species (grouped as Brigantedinium spp,).
   The variation in accumulation rates can be related to gradiental changes in the trophic state of the surface waters linked to river outflow. Most species show a positive relationship between cyst production and nutrient/trace element availability in upper waters. No negative correlation between cyst production and nutrient/trace element availability could be documented. Production of Brigantidinium spp., Echinidinium spp., L. sabrina. L. machaerophorum, P. kofoidii/schwarzii, Spiniferites spp., S. mirabilis and S. quanta shows the most pronounced increase with increasing nutrient/trace element availability. These species can be considered as valuable indicators for reconstructing changes in the trophic state of the upper waters within the Po-river area in palaeo-environmental studies.

AB  - Digeneans have important roles within ecosystems; however, it is estimated that only 14% of the species have been described. Therefore, before being able to detail their role, digenean species' identification and the diversity present in the ecosystems must be known. In this study, the diversity and the temporal-spatial dynamics of larval digeneans in the freshwater snail Heleobia parchappii were analysed in a shallow lake. Specimens of H. parchappii were collected seasonally at three points during one year and a total of 2871 molluscs were analysed. A total of 23 species of digenea were registered and both the overall prevalence and the composition of the assemblages presented temporal and spatial variations, responding to the differential environmental conditions characteristics (anthropic effect, presence of native forests, and differential use of the habitat by the definitive hosts) of three sampled sites. The assemblages of larval digenean in their first intermediate host support the idea that this area is of great importance in biodiversity, and could be endemic areas of some species of digenean that use reptiles, amphibians and bats as hosts, groups that are at risk of conservation. Protection of these environments is a fundamental pillar in the policies for the conservation of wild flora and fauna.

AB  - Spatiotemporal variability in the land surface energy flux is largely and comprehensively affected by many factors, including land surface temperature (LST), land coverage, soil characteristics, terrain conditions, etc. In contrast with other climatic zones, arid and semiarid lands have fragile ecological environments that are more sensitive to land surface energy flux changes. In this study, we used MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST products (2001-2015) for air temperature comparisons. Then, we investigated the spatiotemporal variation in LSTs in the Syr Darya Basin (SDB) during 2001-2015. More specifically, a new statistical model known as GeoDetector was adopted to analyze the driving factors controlling the spatiotemporal variation in LSTs. The result shows that the MODIS LST can provide a good estimation of air temperature, especially at night. The LST change rate can be considered as an important indicator of climate change (rapid warming at high altitudes) and human activities (increased water consumption of crop). Based on the GeoDetector model, we determined that the elevation explained more of the LST distribution (84-90%) and spatiotemporal variation (22-26%) than any other land surface parameters. The combination of albedo and the other explanatory variables can significantly increase the explanatory power of each single factor, especially with elevation.

AB  - Lowland forests in Europe went through dramatic changes in the last century. Data accumulated from the nature reserve Buky u Vysokeho Chvojna in the Czech Republic provide a unique opportunity to follow beech forest development using a time series consisting of five points in time from 1926 to 2019. Our goal was to reconstruct changes in plant species richness and plant community composition over this period. Based on the available data, we concluded that vascular plant species richness per plot declined by at least 50%, possibly by 75% since 1951. Compositional dissimilarities between the first survey and subsequent resurveys revealed a directional trajectory of vegetation changes. Treating time as an environmental factor and tree canopy cover as a covariable (and vice versa) in canonical correspondence analysis permutation tests where only the herbaceous layer was used, time turned out to be much more important. Variance partitioning revealed that time explained 28.1% and tree canopy 4.2% of the variation in the species data. The two variables together explained 36.8% of the variance, revealing that the shared effect of these two variables was 4.5%. Ellenberg-type indicator values point to a possible role of increasing nitrogen and decreasing pH. Several other factors potentially responsible for observed vegetation changes are discussed.

AB  - Over recent years much attention has been paid to the fishery use of geothermal sources. The prospects for this area are enormous, as it opens up possibilities for managing fish-breeding processes, regardless of climatic conditions. The main objective of the research was a comprehensive study of the technological processes of growing. One of the promising reserves for increasing fish production is the rational fishery use of waste warm water and geothermal sources. Research work was carried out in 2019 based on the farm of "Tengri Fish" LLP, which is located 270 kilometers from Almaty. The collection and processing of materials were carried out according to generally accepted methods in ichthyology and fish farming, followed by their analysis on a PC. Based on the results of the research, technological primaries of growing tilapia in a RAS (Recirculating Aquaculture System) using geothermal waters were determined. During the research, work was carried out to optimize the hydrochemical regime. The main fish breeding and biological indicators for the growth and development of tilapia were established. The optimal stocking density of tilapias in recirculating aquaculture systems using geothermal waters and the temperature when tilapias have a higher average daily weight gain were found. The novelty of the research: a complex study of biology and adaptation of a new object of industrial fish farming of tilapia and clarium catfish has been carried out outside the range and determined the adaptation possibilities of tilapia and clarium catfish to extreme factors of the aquatic environment.

AB  - The aim of this study was to understand the changes of floodplain vegetation following the disruption of lateral connectivity from streams by levee construction under the temperate monsoonal conditions of South Korea. We compared the plant community structure and selected environmental variables in paired floodplains, one connected to the stream inside a levee and the other isolated by a levee. Cluster analysis of the vegetation identified ten plant communities and their associated indicator species. There were clear differences in communities between the connected floodplains and isolated floodplains. Pioneer and early-successional communities, which are resistant to flood disturbance, were found only in the connected floodplains. In contrast, diverse aquatic-macrophytic communities, adapted to long flood duration, and late-successional communities sensitive to flooding disturbance were found mainly in the isolated floodplains. -turnover was the main driver in species compositions in both types of floodplain. The isolated floodplains had a longer flood duration, and their soils had a finer texture, higher moisture content, and were more acidic compared tothe connected floodplains. Flood duration and topological elevation were identified as the most important environmental variables with respect to plant community composition. Our results suggest that reinstatement of lateral connectivity is necessary to restore the fluvial native vegetation in the isolated floodplains of a region with a monsoonal climate.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to test whether different degrees of human activity affect the diet of the Brazilian silverside Atherinella brasiliensis in two tropical estuaries. Fish were collected along the salinity gradient of two Brazilian estuaries, the heavily impacted Paraiba Estuary and the less impacted Mamanguape Estuary, in the dry and wet seasons. The findings confirm that A. brasiliensis has generalist feeding habits and is able to change its diet under different environmental conditions. The results indicate clear spatial ( i.e. along the estuarine gradient) changes in diet composition in both estuaries, but diet was also influenced by the degree of anthropogenic disturbance. During the wet season in the nutrient enriched Paraiba Estuary, when human activity was higher, the diet of A. brasiliensis was poorer and dominated by few dietary items, reflecting the potential impoverishment of prey items in this heavily disturbed system. The specimens collected in the most affected estuary also had a greater frequency of micro-plastics and parasites in their stomachs, reflecting the greater degree of human disturbance in the estuary. The present findings suggest that the diet of A. brasiliensis could be a useful indicator of changes in the ecological quality of these and other tropical estuaries of the western Atlantic Ocean.

AB  - Aquatic oligochaete Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri (L hoffineisteri) has been commonly used as a lethal and/or sub-lethal toxicological model organism in ecological risk assessments in contaminated water environments. In this study, experiments were conducted to investigate the potential toxic effects of copper (Cu(II)) with or without perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) under different pH values (6.0, 7.0 and 8.0) on LC50, bioaccumulation, and oxidative stress biomarkers in L hoffineisteri after 3 and 7 days. The LC50 values of Cu(II) decreased with the increasing pH and the addition of PFOS. After each exposure, increasing bioaccumulation of Cu(II) in L. hoffmeisteri was observed in the combined exposure treatments, whereas the bioaccumulation of PFOS decreased. Moreover, the activity of superoxide dismutase, the level of glutathione, and the content of malondialdehyde were significantly altered after these exposures, possibly indicating that the bioaccumulation of Cu(II) and PFOS caused adverse effects on antioxidant defenses of L. hoffmeisteri. The integrated biomarker response index, indicates that the combined effect was proposed as synergism, which is coincided with the results of toxic unit. Moreover, this work showed that aquatic environment may become more livable when water conditions changed from acidic to near-neutral or alkaline. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - High levels of fecal indicator bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, can be indicative of poor water quality. The use of shellfish to reduce eutrophication has been proposed, but application of bivalves to reduce bacterial levels has not been extensively reported. Removal of E. coli by the native freshwater mussel Anodonta californiensis was studied using laboratory batch systems and field-based flow-through systems. Batch systems were utilized to determine the fate and inactivation of E. coli after uptake by the mussel. Batch experiments demonstrated that uptake patterns followed first order kinetics and E. coli was inactivated with less than 5% of the initial colonies recoverable in fecal matter or tissue. Flow-through systems located at an urban impaired lake in San Francisco, CA were utilized to determine uptake kinetics under environmentally relevant conditions. The bivalves maintained a 1-log removal of E. coli for the duration of exposure. The calculated uptake rates can be used in conjunction with hydrologic models to determine the number of bivalves needed to maintain removal of E. coli in different freshwater systems. The outcomes of this study support the use of native freshwater bivalves to achieve the co-benefits of rehabilitating a freshwater ecosystem and improving water quality via reduction of E. coli in contaminated freshwater systems.

AB  - Agro-meteorological metrics are indicators of weather determined environmental conditions on which agricultural management decisions are made. Metrics derived from an estimated future climate provide an opportunity to characterise the impacts of climate change on a wide range of agricultural systems, land use practices and ecosystem services. Such indications are vital for determining how changes in the biophysical environment can lead to land management and policy adaptations to achieve multiple objectives of financial viability, food security, biodiversity conservation and environmental sustainability. They provide valuable links between probable management adaptation responses and capacity for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. However, there are large uncertainties associated with projected future climates, including the climate models' spatial scale of representation and those at which agro-meteorological metrics are applied. This paper describes the estimation of agro-meteorological metrics derived from observed weather and downscaled Regional Climate Model projection data for 12 sites in Scotland. Results show that projected changes to seasonal rainfall distribution, growing season length, soil moisture deficits and accessibility will be substantially different from the present climate. Fundamentally, the metrics indicate a substantial shift in land management requirements and potential need for substantial changes in agricultural systems and land use that will have implications across a wide range of research disciplines.

AB  - . 1. Agricultural intensification has contributed to severe declines in odonate (dragonfly and damselfly) populations. The objective of our study is to benefit current measures for the conservation of odonates by establishing the conditions favourable to Odonata and focusing on ponds within agricultural land. 2. Our landscape-scale study used exuvial counts and habitat measurements from 29 ponds across a catchment in England, over 3 years, to determine key factors affecting odonate abundance and species richness. 3. Ponds dominated by floating and submerged vegetation were the most transparent, supported the highest abundance and species richness of exuviae, and were always fully or partially surrounded by buffer strips. Ponds lacking vegetation were turbid, yielding no exuviae even if they were buffered. English agri-environment schemes (AES) currently support pond and buffer strip creation and management. 4. Abundance of exuviae was higher in recently created ponds compared to older ponds, whereas ponds that had dried out the previous summer had fewer exuviae. 5. Species richness of exuviae decreased with increasing distance to the nearest viable pond, falling by more than 40% for distances over 100 m. 6. We conclude that odonate conservation would be more effective if AES would consider the spatial scale at which ponds are created and the location, type, and quality of ponds targeted for buffer strips.

AB  - Species abundance distribution (SAD) is a classic topic of multispecies ecology. Different types of SAD may indicate specific environmental conditions. A possible way to present some properties of a theoretical or empirical SAD is the construction of a rank-abundance curve (RAC). With regard to the applicability of the RAC as a widely used indicator of the structure of a multispecies community and of the ecological status of its habitat, a basic question is the link between the type of SAD and the shape of the associated RAC. One of the simplest ways to characterize a RAC is to determine its concave and convex segments. However, none of ecological textbooks does give a clear-cut guideline concerning this issue. In the paper a connection is presented between some types of SAD and the convex and concave segments of the related RAC: including among others linearity for the geometric SAD (e.g. with communities in early stage of succession), convexity for the Zipf-Mandelbrot SAD (e.g. with communities with slow successional process), and convexity and then concavity with an inflexion point at approximately the mode of the associated histogram for the lognormal SAD (e.g. with climax, equilibrium communities). Our approach has the potential to improve and justify the use of RACs when searching for the determinants of community structure, initiating further studies in this field. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Arsenopyrite-rich wastes from abandoned tungsten and tin exploitations were studied to determine the composition and characteristics of the secondary phases formed under natural weathering conditions so as to assess their potential environmental risk. Representative weathered arsenopyrite-bearing rock wastes collected from the mine dumps were analysed using the following techniques: X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis, polarizing microscopy analysis, electron microprobe analysis (EMPA) and microRaman and Mossbauer spectroscopies. Scorodite, pharmacosiderite and amorphous ferric arsenates (AFA) with Fe/As molar ratios in the range 1.2-2.5 were identified as secondary arsenic products. The former showed to be the most abundant and present in the different studied mining areas. Its chemical composition showed to vary in function of the original surrounding rock mineralogy in such a way that phosphoscorodite was found as the mineral variety present in apatite-containing geoenvirons. Other ever-present weathering phases were goethite and hydrous ferric oxides (HFO), displaying, respectively, As retained amounts about 1 and 20% (expressed as As2O5). The low solubility of scorodite, the relatively low content of AFA and the formation of compounds of variable charge, mostly of amorphous nature, with high capacity to adsorb As attenuate importantly the dispersion of this element into the environment from these arsenopyrite-bearing wastes.

TI  - Engineering geology and the reduction of geotechnical risk: challenges facing the profession in Hong Kong
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND HYDROGEOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - There has been considerable discussion on the role of engineering geologists in reducing geotechnical risk both internationally and in Hong Kong. This paper discusses the problems facing the engineering geological profession by examining the current approach to natural landslide assessments in Hong Kong. Although the problems discussed are based on a Hong Kong perspective many are applicable elsewhere in the world. The assessment and mitigation of landslide risk from natural slopes is a rapidly expanding area of geotechnical work in Hong Kong. Under relatively new legislation, the Hong Kong Government now requires a natural terrain hazard study to be undertaken for all new developments close to steep natural terrain. In addition to the assessment of new developments Hong Kong has recently started a programme to assess the risk from natural terrain landslides to existing developments. However, with respect to engineering geology, the profession faces a number of challenges including skills shortages and insufficient training opportunities, and, more broadly, challenges related to certain contract conditions and prevailing market forces. The combination of these factors in Hong Kong has resulted in the reduction of engineering geological input within the geotechnical industry. This may result in the adoption of over-conservative mitigation works with resulting impacts on cost, safety and the environment. In the worst case, the lack of engineering geological input may result in the failure to recognize the potential for low-frequency, high-magnitude landslides, with potentially severe future consequences.

AB  - A microcosm experiment was conducted to investigate the degradation of coprostanol and related sterol biomarkers and Escherichia coli in 'natural' sediments from a highly mixed (marine and estuarine) sub-tropical environment following a simulated pollution event. This experiment revealed that sterols are synthesised and degraded over time by auto- and hetero trophic organisms within the sediment matrix from a onetime addition of a sewage/effluent seawater mixture. Coprostanol was the only sterol to degrade continually, with only minor fluctuations (synthesis/degradation) over a time period of two months. Results further revealed a sharp decline of coprostanol within the first week. From this it could be concluded that, without any further addition, external inputs of coprostanol are reduced to background levels within this time period. Therefore, removal of coprostanol after six days was 94% and 73% in mud and sand, respectively. The rate of removal of coprostanol was much higher in mud than sand, reflecting a higher level of microbial activity in muddy sediments for assimilation of sterols. Bacterial indicators levelled off more quickly than coprostanol degraded (i.e. within 2 days), which shows that coprostanol is a more conservative sediment quality indicator for tracing human derived sewage in coastal sediments than indicator bacteria.

AB  - The start, end, duration and intensity of the thermal growing season (the period with mean daily temperatures exceeding 5 degrees C) during the past century (1890-1995) was analysed at nine sites in the Nordic region. Statistical comparisons were made between three adjacent 35-year periods. The results indicate that the growing season lengthened considerably at all sites between 1891-1925 and 1926-1960. Lengthening has continued at a slower rate up to the present at the eight Fennoscandian sites but not at the Icelandic site. In contrast, the intensity of the growing season, expressed by effective temperature sum above 5 degrees C, which increased at all sites between the first two periods, has decreased slightly at all locations except Turku in recent decades.
   Under three scenarios, representing the range of estimated greenhouse gas-induced warming by the 2050s, the growing season is expected to lengthen at all sites. For a "Central" scenario, the greatest lengthening is computed for southern and western Scandinavia (7-8 weeks) with smaller changes in Finland (4 weeks) and Iceland (3 weeks).
   With a lengthening growing season during the past century in Fennoscandia, there are likely to have been impacts on natural and managed ecosystems. Some evidence of recent biotic and abiotic effects already exists, but other indicators of long-term change remain to be analysed.

AB  - Mapping of geosystems attracts attention as a concise way to organize a significant amount of geographical information. Initially, the development of theoretical provisions and the compilation of geosystem maps were based on geobotanical principles and methods of integrating facies according to structural and structural-dynamic indicators. At the present stage, the task of mapping geosystems is largely determined by the need for predictive studies of their natural and anthropogenic transformations. The relevance of the development of geosystem mapping in the direction described here is determined by the need to create medium-scale maps of the transformation of geosystems, which are characterized by significant spatial and temporal scales, heterogeneous genesis, various stages of development. The creation of such maps requires the synthesis of time and space in a single whole, the comparison of the current state of the geosystem with the natural rhythms and laws of the development of the natural environment. The mapping methodology is based on the modern idea of the transformation of geosystems and the further development of the theory of geosystems by V. B. Sochava, includes techniques for displaying patterns of development and transformation of geosystem structures.

TI  - The effects of the record-setting drought from 2018 to 2020 on ground water tables in Central Germany
T2  - WASSERWIRTSCHAFT
LA  - German
AB  - A record-setting drought from 2018-2020 occurred in Germany! Severe adverse consequences affected not only anthropogenic purposes like agriculture, forestry, or water supply but also the corresponding natural systems, in particular aquatic ecosystems or wetlands. A key indicator of water availability at the landscape scale is the groundwater table, whose depth is influencing the access of terrestrial vegetation to water, the baseflow of rivers and the water level in groundwater-fed lakes and ponds. This study therefore studies the effects of the 2018-2020 drought on long-term dynamics of groundwater tables by analysing 30 years of groundwater dynamics in more than 220 gauges in central Germany. This region is particularly susceptible to droughts because it receives comparatively low annual precipitation and harbours the lowest groundwater recharge rates in whole Germany. We found severe reductions of groundwater tables down to historically low levels with more than 50 % of the gauges showing water tables below the 5% quantile based in the 30 years reference period. The decrease in groundwater was spatially consistent over the whole region though magnitude differed regionally. A strong trend of decreasing groundwater tables is already visible for 10 years in this region and the water deficit is estimated to be between 300 and 400 mm indicating a long recovery time, if ever recovering is realistic given the ongoing change in climatic conditions leading to higher water losses.

AB  - Restingas are lowland sandy ecosystems located between mountain ranges and the sea. For living organisms in this ecosystem, restingas can be seen as habitats formed by islands of vegetation separated by a sandy matrix. These organisms are highly influenced by the environmental conditions and physical characteristics of the landscape, including size, connectivity and environmental heterogeneity. Given the recognized effectiveness of ants as bioindicators, this study uses these organisms as a model to assess how do the physical characteristics of a landscape influence the structures of ant communities. The study was carried out in the Parque das Dunas, Salvador - Bahia, Brazil. Within this park, four categories of vegetation islands (Small, Medium, Large and Continuous) were delimited, where the ant fauna was sampled and the forms of vegetal life were analyzed, using the Raunkiaer analysis. A total of 69 ant species were collected from 31 genera and six subfamilies. We found a positive relationship between ant richness and diversity of plant life forms (Shannon index). In general, there was a significant difference in the composition of ant species between the areas of continuous vegetation and the different vegetation islands. We conclude that there is a bottom up effect mediating the ant community associated with dune vegetation, where the local richness of ant species responds to vegetation heterogeneity.

AB  - Based on the system analysis of the long-term information and analytical materials of the RSE "Kazhydromet" on water pollution in the Yesil river basin and the use of the Shannon index and the maximum pollution coefficient V.V. Shabanova made an assessment of water quality by hydrochemical indicators on a spatial and temporal scale in the conditions of anthropogenic activity to identify the causes and consequences of the formation of the hydrochemical regime of water bodies. On the basis of the conducted multivariate assessments and rationing of the water resources of the Yesil River, the directivity and intensity of changes in water quality, that is, their pollution with the main ions (Cl, Na, SO4), biogenic elements (NH4, NO2, NO3) and heavy metals (Cu, Zn) are shown on a spatial-temporal scale which are one of the main environment-forming systems for the life of the population of Central and Northern Kazakhstan. In this case, the maximum pollution coefficient (K-n3) in the catchment area of the Yesil River Basin on a time scale from the hydrological station - the village of Turgenevka to the village of Dolamatova are increasing and, by degree of pollution, mainly refers to the contaminated and trophic status of E.S. Shannon - eutrophic, which must be considered when developing environmental protection measures to restore and improve the eco-capacity of water bodies in Central and Northern Kazakhstan.

AB  - The main petroleum product transported through pipelines in Canada is diluted bitumen (dilbit), a semiliquid form of heavy crude oil mixed with natural gas condensates to facilitate transport. The weathering, fate, behavior, and environmental effects of dilbit are crucial to consider when responding to a spill; however, few environmental studies on dilbit have been completed. We report on 11-d-long experimental spills of dilbit (Cold Lake Winter Blend) in outdoor microcosms meant to simulate a low-energy aquatic system containing natural lake water and sediments treated with low (1:8000 oil:water) and high (1:800 oil:water) volumes of dilbit. In the first 24 h of the experiment, volatile hydrocarbons quickly evaporated from the dilbit, resulting in increased dilbit density and viscosity. These changes in dilbit's physical and chemical properties ultimately led to its submergence after 8 d. We also detected rapid accumulation of polycyclic aromatic compounds in the water column of the treated microcosms following the spills. The present study provides new information on the environmental fate and behavior of dilbit in a freshwater environment that will be critical to environmental risk assessments of proposed pipeline projects. In particular, the study demonstrates the propensity for dilbit to sink under ambient environmental conditions in freshwaters typical of many boreal lakes. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:2621-2628.

AB  - Liquefied natural gas (LNG), a clean fuel type mainly containing methane, has been becoming more popular amongst the other fuels for the power generation systems. Although there are a lot of thermodynamic and thermoeconomic assessments about the LNG fired power generation systems, the environmental and sustainability aspects have still lack investigation, especially on the optimization step. To minimize this gap, a multiobjective optimization study is performed for the LNG fired microcogeneration system. The current study considers various objective functions from thermodynamic, environmental, thermoeconomic, and sustainability aspects. A newly developed sustainability index is used as one of the objective functions in the study. The approach is defined as the complex multiobjective optimization procedure that constitutes different multiobjective optimization groups to better understand and evaluate the different objective functions together. The controllable air temperature and relative humidity are selected as the external decision variables. The best trade-off regions are identified between 300.00 K and 313.15 K at the relative humidity of 90% while they are found between 310.15 K and 313.15 K at the relative humidity of 50%. The high relative humidity and ambient air temperature present the best climatic conditions for the optimal operation of the small-scale system during the indoor operations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - High throughput mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics is a popular platform for small molecule metabolites analyses that are widely used for detecting biomarkers in the research field of environmental assessment. Crucian carp (Carassius carassius, CC) is an economically and ecologically important fish in Asia. It can adapt to extremely high alkalinity, providing us with valuable material to understand the adaptation mechanism for extreme environmental stress. However, the information on the metabolite biomarkers and metabolic mechanisms of CC exposed to alkaline stress is not entirely clear. We applied high-throughput UPLC-Q-TOF/MS combined with chemometrics to identify changes in the metabolome of CC exposed to different concentrations of alkalinity for long term effects. Metabolic differences among alkalinity-treated groups were identified by multivariate statistical analysis. Further, 7 differential metabolites were found after exposure to alkaline conditions. In total, 23 metabolic pathways of these differential metabolites were significantly affected. Alkalinity exposure resulted in widespread change in metabolic profiles in the plasma with disruptions in the phenylalanine metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, tyrosine metabolism, etc. The integrated pathway analysis of the associated metabolites showed that tRNA charging, l-cysteine degradation II, superpathway of methionine degradation, l-serine degradation, tyrosine biosynthesis IV, etc. appear to be the most significantly represented functional categories. Overall, this study demonstrated that metabolic changes in CC played a role in adaptation to the highly alkaline environmental stress.

AB  - The objective of this project was to test the feasibility of a recirculated aquaculture system in the bioclimatic conditions of the PEIMA. During the 3 year experiment, only 7.2 m(3) of make-up water per kilogram of fish produced has been used instead of the 100 required for an open output circuit. The design of the system components allowed this sharp reduction without degrading water quality (N-NH4+: 0.66 +/- 0.13 mg.L-1; N-NO2-: 0.12 mg.L-1 +/- 0.03). The main indicators of animal performances were significantly improved (10 to 15% more weight gain and feed consumption ratio decreased by nearly 10%) and no impact on survival rate was observed. Reproduction was not affected by the rearing system (eggs survival rate: 67.03 +/- 0.57% vs 62.65 +/- 3.36%) and parasitism could be controlled. Flesh quality such as flavor has not been altered. Fillet and physicochemical quality of fillet (colour, texture, fat content) are only slightly affected by the rearing system. Despite its environmentally friendly characteristics its contribution to the European production is still small compared to cages, flow-through systems or ponds. The judicious combination of technical improvements in the recirculation loop and water treatment could improve the efficiency of the system in order to help the aquaculture industry to be less dependent on natural resources, while continuing to provide quality products to the consumer.

AB  - The effect of pH on the structure of the communities of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria (APB) was studied under laboratory conditions. Samples of natural APB communities were inoculated into media that differed in pH values, which were 7, 9.5, or 10.5. The structure of the APB communities in the obtained enrichment cultures at all pH values depended also on the mineralization levels of the media, which were the same as in the lakes from which samples were taken. The same dependence of the community structure on salinity was observed as in the case of the natural communities that had been described previously. APB were most diverse in the enrichment cultures grown at pH 9.5. The shift of the pH to either neutral or extremely alkaline values restricted the species diversity within the APB community, resulting in marked predominance of the most adapted forms. It was shown that the status of Ectothiorhodospira species within the community could serve not only as an indicator of salinity but also as an indicator of pH in soda lakes with a water mineralization of higher than 5 g/l. The statuses of various APB groups in the community as dependent on pH and salinity are discussed, as well as possible changes in these statuses due to changes in the water level and other environmental parameters in the studied lakes.

AB  - Economists and ecologists are often asked to collaborate on landscape-level analyses designed to jointly assess economic and ecological conditions resulting from environmental policy scenarios. This trend toward multidisciplinary projects, coupled with the growing use of geographic information systems, has led to the development of spatially explicit models that can be used to examine and project land-use change. Although spatial land-use models are still evolving, most published efforts have modeled the conversion of nonurban land to urban uses as a function of explanatory variables based on population density and the spatial proximity of land to roads, markets, and population centers. In this paper, we use a gravity model to describe the urbanization potential of forest and agricultural land as a combination of population and proximity. We develop an empirical model that describes the probability that forests and agricultural land in western Oregon and western Washington were transformed to residential, commercial, or industrial uses over a 30-year period as a function of urbanization potential, other socioeconomic factors, and geographic and physical land characteristics. Land-use data were provided by the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis program. We use this empirical model to generate geographic information system maps depicting the probability of future land-use change that can be integrated with landscape-level ecological models developed for western Oregon's Coast Range.

AB  - Objective: The authors assess implications of DSM criteria for schizophrenia by reviewing the criteria's 1) emphasis on psychotic features, 2) dissociation of symptoms from their etiology, 3) exclusive reliance on clinical features but exclusion of biological indicators, and 4) classification of schizophrenia as a discrete category. The authors then discuss alternative conceptions of schizophrenia that take into account recent data concerning its genetic and neurodevelopmental origins and its pathophysiological substrates.
   Method: The historical development of diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia is reviewed in the context of recent published data on the biology and development of schizophrenia.
   Results: Growing evidence suggests that symptoms of psychosis may be a common end-state in a variety of disorders, including schizophrenia, rather than a reflection of the specific etiology of schizophrenia. Features occurring before the advent of psychosis that are clinical, biological, and/ or neuropsychological in nature may constitute evidence of a genetic predisposition toward schizophrenia ("schizotaxia") and may provide more specific information about the genetic, pathophysiological, and developmental origins of schizophrenia.
   Conclusions: The success of efforts to treat and prevent schizophrenia will depend to an important extent on an accurate understanding of its causes. This goal can be furthered by conducting field trials to develop research criteria to assess the value of a developmentally sensitive, biologically informed approach to classification that would consider schizotaxia with psychosis (schizophrenia) and schizotaxia alone as distinct diagnostic conditions.

AB  - The important role of organic matter (OM) justifies the growing interest for the identification of more efficient use and management systems for the improvement of organic stock in tropical oxisols. The objective of this work was to analyze quantitative and qualitative OM stock variations and to characterize organic compartments in a clayey Dark-Red Latosol under situations of natural savanna vegetation (CER), long-term (PAL) and degraded grasslands (PAD), and fallow conditions (PAC). These were compared with crops under conventional plowing (CCL) and zero tillage (PD). Small organic stock variation was found in surface layer of studied soils, explained by human disturbance of vegetation in CER, no residue exportation in PD and CCL, and by fallow practice in PAC. Particle-size fractionating, considering the compartments plant residues (20-2,000 mu m), silt-organic (2-20 mu m) and clay-organic (0-2 mu m), showed differences in OM quality, when comparing similar environmental situations. Even with very weak differences, plant residues compartment was an important indicator of organic stock evolution, allowing the characterization of grassland degradation and zero-till effect, when compared with conventional system. PD has favored C stocking in organic-clayey compartment. Studied soils were distinct from other tropical clayey soils by the high C/N relationship found in 0-20 mu m fraction.

AB  - Drying optimization, to mitigate fungal growth and Ochratoxin A (OTA) contamination is a key topic for raisin and currant production. Specific indicators of environmental conditions and drying properties were analyzed using two seedless grape varieties (Crimson-red and Thompson-white), artificially inoculated with Aspergillus carbonarius under open air and tunnel drying. The air temperature (T), relative humidity, grape surface temperature (T-s) and water activity throughout the drying experiment, the grapes' moisture content and the fungal colonization and OTA contamination during the drying process and their interactions were recorded and critically analyzed. Drying properties such as the water diffusivity (D-eff) and peel resistance to water transfer were estimated. The grapes T-s was 5-7 degrees C higher in tunnel vs. open air-drying; the infected grapes had higher maximum T-s vs. the control (around 4-6 degrees C). OTA contamination was higher in tunnel vs. open air-dried grapes, but fungal colonies showed the opposite trend. The D-eff was higher in tunnel than in the open air-drying by 54%; the infected grapes had more than 70% higher D-eff than the control, differences explained by factors affecting the water transport. This study highlighted CFU and OTA indicators that affect the water availability between red and white grapes during open air and tunnel drying, estimated by the D-eff and peel resistance. This raises new issues for future research.

AB  - The Devonian succession in Paran ' a Basin encompasses marine deposits bearing fossils representative of the Malvinokaffric Realm, corroborated by sedimentological and ichnological data. Although the trace fossil assemblage preserved in these beds is archetypal of fully marine conditions, signs of environmental stressing conditions can be observed locally in the Givetian beds. This study aims to provide an integrated ichnological, sedimentological, and taphonomic analysis to test the hypothesis of a continental influence in the shallow marine environmental settings that sheltered the Malvinokaffric Realm in the Parana Basin during the Lower Givetian. The integration among seven lithofacies, nine ichnofabrics, and three taphofacies allowed identifying a continental influence associated with salinity variations in a prograding section of an early highstand systems tract, above the maximum flooding surface (Kacak Evet). The stress apparently caused by salinity fluctuations, as indicated by the ichnological signatures, and the high organic input in the Itaytyba outcrop succession may be related to freshwater flows that were reworked by longshore currents. The results presented herein support the hypothesis that continental influxes along shoreline fed by rivers locally generated shoreline progradation and affected the Parana Basin shelfal settings during the Lower Givetian. It contributed to reducing the benthic diversity in the Malvinokaffric Realm, as normally expressed in the basal intervals of Devonian beds from Parana Basin.

AB  - The research focus of the paper is set on the socio-economic potential of a protected area, as a key factor and a prerequisite for its development. The spatial framework of the research includes five settlements in the vicinity of Special Nature Reserve "Carska Bara" (Northern Serbia). For the purpose of this research, they are classified into two groups, based on their distance from the fundamental phenomenon. The demographic characteristics analyses of the study area include basic demographic determinants such as population structures and migration characteristics. Population data related to the change in the number of inhabitants and the types of the total population movement were collected and analyzed, and a comparative analysis of the aging index was performed as well. In order to better understand the condition of the economic structure, the economic activity, and the structure of the active population performing occupation were analyzed by activity sections. The current state of the social infrastructure (schools, primary health care facilities, pharmacies, post offices, sports, and recreation facilities) was also considered, as one of the qualities of life indicators of the local population. The obtained results indicate an unfavorable demographic picture of the analyzed areas. These are smaller population areas, predominantly inhabited by population of the old age groups. Although they are in protected areas which, in the context of tourism, are abounding in natural potentials, but without implementing significant steps and certain measures, no progress and improvement of the demographic condition can be expected.

AB  - Black saxaul (Haloxylon aphyllum) is a native tree species tolerant of aridity and salinity. It is planted to alleviate environmental damage due to the formation of the Aralkum desert and improve vegetation of the Aral Sea region. To investigate the environmental factors that determine seedling mortality and growth after rooting, we focused on soil properties and topographic factors in a study plot. We found that a hard clay layer that was low in hydraulic conductivity underlay accumulated sandy sediments at different depths. The soil in low seedling mortality areas was consistently sandy and low in salinity from the surface to a depth of 100 cm. In areas of high seedling mortality (75-100%), soils with a high content of silt and clay, with high salinity were detected within 100 cm depths. This suggests that accumulated sand sediment over a depth of 100 cm is required for root development. Plant height was positively correlated with depth of the hard clay layer. Significant relationships with plant height were also detected in chemical and physical properties at 80-100 cm such as electric conductivity (ECe), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), and sand ratio. However, these properties had no significant relationship at 0-20 cm or with the relative elevation of the plot, suggesting that the subsequent growth of seedlings depends more on the sub-soil environment than on-surface conditions. The assessment of sub-soil condition is recommended to make site selection for reforestation much more reliable.

AB  - To achieve sustainable sugarcane cultivation in subtropical cropland of Okinawa, Japan, it is necessary to improve and maintain the soil fertility by organic matter application. In most islands of Okinawa, green manure (GM) application is commonly used to improve the soil organic matter content because of its cost effectiveness. In this study, we evaluated the effect of application of different GMs, i.e., Crotalaria juncea (CRO) and Sesbania cannabina (SES), on soil nutrient dynamics in relation to soil enzymes, which are a sensitive indicator of land management in a sugarcane field of Kitadaito, Okinawa. We evaluated the fluctuation of soil enzymes (dehydrogenase [DH], [beta-glucosidase [BG], and phosphomonoesterase [PHO]), soil nutrients (extractable carbon [Ext-C] and nitrogen [Ext-N], and available phosphorus [Avail-P]) with environmental conditions after GM application for seven months. We also measured the sugarcane growth parameters seven months after planting. Application of CRO and SES clearly increased the BG and PHO activities throughout the experimental period and increased the sugarcane number (ca. 11%-20%), but they did not increase the DH activity and soil nutrients (e.g., Ext-C and Avail-P). Application of CRO also increased Ext-N, but SES application had no clear effect, possibly because of the different GM quality and decomposition patterns. Thus, our results showed that CRO is the preferred GM species in terms of improvement of soil enzyme and nutrient conditions for GM-sugarcane cropping systems in Kitadaito.

AB  - Description of the subject. Climate change challenges the strategy of varietal diffusion, employed by the Senegalese cotton company (SODEFITEX), based on the distinction of two cultivars: one adapted to humid conditions and the other to drought. Based on data collected in an experimental station and farmer plots from 2004 to 2011, the study provides an assessment of that strategy.
   Objectives. The aim of the study was to evaluate both the methodology used for varietal selection and the performance of released and candidate cultivars, under contrasted water environments due to variability in rainfall (spatial and temporal) and crop management.
   Method. The methodology used allowed the identification of the occurrence of severe water stress during the critical cotton development phases (flowering and boll development) and its effect on seed cotton yield and fiber quality. The resulting indicator of plant water status was then inserted into our statistical analysis as an environmental covariate.
   Results. The resulting indicator allowed the discrimination of seed cotton yield in the experimental station as well as in on-farm experiments. Despite an effect of cultivar on ginning outturn and fiber quality, all cultivars showed similar resilience to water status.
   Conclusions. Despite a lack of cultivar adaptation to water stress, results support the adoption of a single cultivar in the whole production basin. However, the diffusion strategy would benefit from a better consideration of farmer cropping conditions, which would thus allow for the evaluation of cultivars by the producers.

AB  - Tolerance to waterlogging is an important breeding objective for barley (Hordeum vulgare L.); however, it is a complex quantitative trait. It is difficult to screen large numbers of lines in the field due to environmental variability, and it is also challenging to screen large numbers in controlled conditions if yield data are to be collected. The direct measurement of traits that contribute to waterlogging tolerance, such as aerenchyma development in roots, may offer advantages especially if molecular markers can be developed to screen breeding populations. A doubled haploid population from a cross between Franklin and YuYaoXiangTian Erleng was screened for adventitious root porosity (gas-filled volume per unit root volume) as an indicator of aerenchyma formation. A single QTL for root porosity was identified on chromosome 4H which explained 35.7 and 39.0 % of phenotypic variation in aerated and oxygen-deficient conditions, respectively. The nearest marker was EBmac0701. This QTL is located in the same chromosomal region that contributed to tolerance when the same population was screened in an earlier independent soil waterlogging experiment. Comparative mapping revealed that this QTL is syntenic with the Qaer1.02-3 QTL in maize and the Sub1A-1 gene in rice, which are associated with aerenchyma formation (maize) and submergence tolerance (rice), respectively. This is the first report of a QTL for root porosity in barley which elucidates a major mechanism of waterlogging tolerance.

AB  - Endolithic microbial communities inhabiting porous rocks in the cold, dry mountainous regions of Antarctica have been studied extensively as examples of life's adaptations to extreme environments. Here, we examine hydrocarbons and fatty acids occurring in these communities in order to clarify their biogeochemical features with respect to source organisms, microbial activity fossilization processes and the influence of Gondwanaland sediments. Unusually, long-chain (>C-19) n-alkanes and anteiso-alkanes were often the major hydrocarbons in the samples. A suite of n-alkanoic acids (n-C-9 - n-C-32) and long-chain anteiso-alkanoic acids (a-C-20 - a-C-30) were found, along with short-chain iso- and anteiso-alkanoic acids, and n-alkenoic acids. The relationship between long-chain n-alkanoic acids (n-C-20 - n-C-32) and long-chain anteiso-alkanoic acids suggests that these compounds probably originated from the same group of microorganisms, Such as bacteria or endolithic lichens, under moderate pH conditions (pH 3-5). Relatively hiah trans/cis-C-16:1 alkenoic acid ratios suggest the presence of unfavorable environmental conditions in the endolithic microbial habitat. Normal-alkenoic/alkanoic acid ratios may be a useful marker for the fossilization of endolithic microbial communities. Thermally, matured triterpanes and steranes from fossilized associations on Mount Fleming strongly suggest the presence of Gondwanaland sediments formed during Devonian and Jurassic (400-180 million years ago).

AB  - A study was conducted to examine the variation in fish farm sediment quality with varying organic carbon input in the form of feed. In order to elucidate the seasonal variation in farm sediment quality, relation between seasonal organic carbon input, temperature and sediment quality was studied. The sediment ignition loss, redox potential and acid volatile sulfide sulfur (AVS-S) content showed a correlation with annual organic carbon input. The seasonal AVS-S content showed a significant correlation with the seasonal organic carbon input as well as temperature. Multiple regression analysis revealed that both of these factors explicated 80% of the seasonal variation in AVS-S content. Although redox conditions of the sediment could also be correlated with both the organic carbon input and temperature, the latter seemed to have a greater control. Thus, the farm sediment quality could be directly related to the annual organic carbon input to the fish farm under similar hydrographic conditions. Acid volatile sulfide sulfur content exhibited a significant correlation with both the annual as well as the seasonal organic carbon input. Therefore, AVS-S content proved to be a fairly simple and better indicator for monitoring the fish farm environment for effective farm management and sustainable aquaculture. Importance of size of pellets as a factor affecting the feed input-sediment quality relation is also demonstrated in the present study.

AB  - Attributes of 25 headwater streams and their associated wetlands were quantitatively sampled in-the inner coastal plain of eastern North Carolina. Data from these sites were used to construct and test one functional assessment model (biogeochemical cycling) using the hydrogeomorphic (HGM) approach. Of the 25 sites sampled, 16 unaltered sites were used to establish standards against which field indicators could be compared (indexed). Nine altered sites were used to examine the sensitivity of the model to assess the types of alterations typically inflicted upon headwater ecosystems in eastern North Carolina: channelization, logging, construction of cross-floodplain ditches to shunt water directly from uplands to the main stream channel, and conversion of stream floodplains and buffer zones to cropland. Of 30 field indicators measured that potentially could be used to model alterations to hydrologic regime and biomass stocks, we found six were robust in assessing conditions related to biogeochemical cycling. Hydrologic indicators used in the model included: (1) presence/absence of channelization, (2) presence/absence of cross-floodplain ditches, and (3) a measure of buffer condition (using width and quality). Biomass indicators included: (4) total basal area of trees, (5) percent litter cover, and (6) volume of coarse woody debris. Our preliminary biogeochemical cycling model using these six variables was sensitive to alterations in nine altered sites and to a suite of hypothetical restorations of the most altered site. However, in order to improve accuracy of our preliminary model, it should be validated with studies designed to measure how alterations of various types and magnitudes affect biogeochemical processes.

AB  - This comprehensive study of medieval and modern fish remains from archaeological sites in Switzerland provides insights into former aquatic ecology and socio-cultural aspects. Local fishing practices predominate, and there is a clear correlation between the consumer's social status and fish consumption. Fishing pressure, changes in water ecology and fishing regulations are also reflected in the species spectra. A decrease of sensitive fish species over the centuries becomes apparent, particularly in the studied sites on the Rhine.

AB  - Stream biofilms are among the first to react to environmental degradation, since their structural and functional characteristics are tightly linked to the physicochemical variables in the water and sediment. The objectives of this research were to study the differences in chlorophyll-a, bacterial density and metabolism endpoints of epipelic biofilms in nutrient-rich streams under different physical-chemical conditions in the stream water in relation to changes in urbanization, and to measure the short-term responses (up to 72 h) in the biofilm when translocated to more urbanized sites. For these purposes, chlorophyll-a, bacterial density, biofilm respiration (electron transfer activity) and O-2 consumption were measured in epipelic biofilms in nutrient-rich streams exposed to different levels of urbanization after a 30 day colonization. Afterward, biofilms were translocated downstream to more polluted sites, and sampled to identify any fast occurring changes to be considered as potential indicators of environmental degradation. Results show that in the nutrient-rich streams studied, the structural characteristics of the biofilm were linked to urbanization, and even after a short time following the translocation, chlorophyll-a and bacterial density varied, reflecting the environmental degradation. On the other hand, metabolic variables were highly variable and produced inconsistent results when representing an increase in urbanization.

AB  - The seasonal and spatial variations (desert, desert-oasis, and oasis) in some enzyme activities (urease, alkaline phosphatase, nitrate reductase, dehydrogenase, and catalase) in the 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm soil layers were evaluated along a typical desert-oasis transition zone in the Shule River basin in China. The results showed that there was a significant positive correlation of soil urease, alkaline phosphatase, dehydrogenase, and catalase activities with vegetation coverage and available phosphorus while they had a negative correlation with soil pH and EC. Nitrate reductase activity was positively correlated with soil pH and EC but was negatively correlated with elevation and vegetation coverage. According to the redundancy analysis, environmental factors (elevation, vegetation coverage, soil moisture contents, pH, EC, OM, AP and AK) in this study explained 89.8% of the soil enzymatic activity variations when combined (p < 0.01). The Monte Carlo simulation showed that the order of importance of environmental factors on soil enzyme activities was as follows: vegetation coverage (42.5%) > elevation (38.0%) > EC (30.7%) > AP (18.1%) > pH (15.4%). Accordingly, catalase activity exhibited sensitivity to changes in land use intensity and no seasonal variation, suggesting that it is the soil biological activity indicator best suited for measuring existing conditions and potential changes in the desert-oasis transition zone soils.

AB  - The paper presents the results of the analysis of diatoms from surface sediments (stones, sands) and macroflora (seagrass, macroalgae) collected at 16 sampling sites located along the inner coastal zone of Puck Bay (southern Baltic Sea) along the Hel Peninsula. The main diatom species of epilithon, epipsammon and epiphyton were characterized with respect to their autecological preferences (habitat, salinity, trophic status, saprobity). Three groups of diatoms were distinguished with respect to the type of substrate based on the results of benthic flora analysis: diatoms (i) of one type of substrate, (ii) of two types and (iii) those occurring on all types of substrates. Moreover, the distribution of benthic diatom communities indicates ecological differences in the study area. Marine and brackish-water species were observed in large numbers in the coastal zone of the Outer Puck Bay, whereas freshwater flora occurred with a higher frequency in the coastal zone of the Puck Lagoon. The content of polysaprobionts and of alpha-mesosaprobionts indicates that the region of the Hel Tip is highly eutrophicated and very polluted. The coast in the vicinity of Kuznica is less polluted, whereas the best environmental conditions are found in the Jurata-Jastarnia region, as evidenced by the frequency of diatoms that are beta-mesosaprobionts.

AB  - Wearable biosensors attract significant interest for their capabilities in real-time monitoring of wearers' health status, as well as the surrounding environment. Sensor patches are embedded onto the human epidermis accompanied by data readout and signal conditioning circuits with wireless communication modules for transmitting data to the computing devices. Wearable sensors designed for recognition of various biomarkers in human epidermis fluids, such as glucose, lactate, pH, cholesterol, etc., as well as physiological indicators, i.e., pulse rate, temperature, breath rate, respiration, alcohol, activity monitoring, etc., have potential applications both in medical diagnostics and fitness monitoring. The rapid developments in solution-based nanomaterials offered a promising perspective to the field of wearable sensors by enabling their cost-efficient manufacturing through printing on a wide range of flexible polymeric substrates. This review highlights the latest key developments made in the field of wearable sensors involving advanced nanomaterials, manufacturing processes, substrates, sensor type, sensing mechanism, and readout circuits, and ends with challenges in the future scope of the field. Sensors are categorized as biological and fluidic, mounted directly on the human body, or physiological, integrated onto wearable substrates/gadgets separately for monitoring of human-body-related analytes, as well as external stimuli. Special focus is given to printable materials and sensors, which are key enablers for wearable electronics.

AB  - Background: Although the crucial importance of sediments in aquatic systems is well-known, sediments are often neglected as a factor in the evaluation of water quality assessment. To support and extend previous work in that field, this study was conducted to assess the impact of surface water and sediment on fish embryos in the case of a highly anthropogenically influenced river catchment in Central Hesse, Germany.
   Results: The results of 96 h post fertilisation fish embryo toxicity test with Danio rerio (according to OECD Guideline 236) revealed that river samples comprising both water and sediment exert pivotal effects in embryos, whereas surface water alone did not. The most prominent reactions were developmental delays and, to some extent, malformations of embryos. Developmental delays occurred at rates up to 100% in single runs. Malformation rates ranged mainly below 10% and never exceeded 25%.
   Conclusion: A clear relationship between anthropogenic point sources and detected effects could not be established. However, the study illustrates the critical condition of the entire river system with respect to embryotoxic potentials present even at the most upstream test sites. In addition, the study stresses the necessity to take into account sediments for the evaluation of ecosystem health in industrialised areas.

AB  - In the present study, the ecological status of four major South Korean rivers flowing near industrial complexes is assessed using physico-chemical analyses and various descriptors based on benthic diatom assemblages. Principal component analysis conducted with physical and chemical variables singled-out four sites as more severely impacted (higher concentration of metals and total nitrogen, higher conductivity and biological oxygen demand), while the remaining 12 sites indicated less impacted conditions, although showing nutrient enrichment. Less-contaminated sites based on physico-chemical properties showed higher cell densities, higher richness and diversity, a larger proportion of live and healthy-looking diatoms, lower production of lipid bodies (in terms of number and size) and fewer teratologies than more-contaminated sites. Non-taxonomical metrics (cell heath status, cell size, lipid bodies and valve deformities) were in good agreement with traditional taxonomical metrics (assemblage structure, richness, diversity). Overall, water quality assessment based on diatom assemblages and diatom-based metrics had a good fit with the available physico-chemical data and agreed on the most impacted sites. However, additional sites showed signs of degradation based on the diatom metrics used. This suggests that the use of biotic indicators provides useful complementary information on the health status at the selected sites.

AB  - The purpose of thermal comfort is to speck the combinations of indoor space environment and personal factors that will produce thermal environment conditions acceptable to 80% or more of the occupants within a space. Naturally ventilated indoors has a very complex air movement, which depends on numerous variables such as: outdoor interaction, intensity of infiltration, the number of openings, the thermal inertia of walls, occupant behaviors, etc. The most important mechanism for naturally ventilated indoors is the intensity of infiltration and thermal buoyancy mechanism. In this study the objective was to determine indicators of thermal comfort for children, by the CFD model based on experimental measurements with modification on turbulent and radiant heat transfer mathematical model. The case study was selected on school children of 8 and 9 years in "France Presern" primary school in Belgrade. The purpose was to evaluate the relationships between the indoor environment and the subjective responses. Also there was analysis of infiltration and stack effect based on meteorological data on site. The main parameters that were investigated are: operative temperature, radiant temperature, concentration of CO2, and air velocity. The new correction of turbulence and radiative heat transfer models has been validated by comparison with experimental data using additional statistical indicators. It was found that both turbulence model correct and the new radiative model of nontransparent media have a significant influence on CFD data set accuracy.

AB  - Benthic diatoms are important indicators of ecological conditions in lotic systems. The objective of this study was to elucidate the confounding effects of eutrophication, organic pollution and ionic strength and conductivity on benthic diatom communities. Benthic diatoms and water quality sampling was done at 10 sites during summer base flow period (2008 and 2009). Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were used to determine environmental gradients along which species vary with respect to ionic strength and conductivity and other environmental variables. Using variance partitioning, we assessed the individual importance of a set of environmental variables (eutrophication and organic pollution) versus ionic strength and conductivity on diatom community structure. The effects of ionic strength and conductivity and organic pollution, eutrophication and other environmental variables were integrated into overall resultant benthic diatom communities. Through partial CCA, we partitioned the variance in diatom data between two sets of exploratory variables, i.e. ionic strength and conductivity (26.9%); other variables, particularly eutrophication and organic pollution (23.0%); shared variance (11.3%) and unexplained variance (38.8%). Due to the interaction of the effects of ionic strength and conductivity and other variables in this study, laboratory experiments must be performed to confirm the observed effects of ionic strength and conductivity.

AB  - Fluorescent dyes and proteins have become ubiquitous tools for the study of intracellular function. However, standard techniques used to visualize these indicators in the brain usually require cellular dissociation or fine sectioning of the specimen into slices for viewing under a fluorescence microscope. These actions remove cells from their natural physiological environment and in the case of neurons, sever synaptic connections from other regions of the central and peripheral nervous system. Even with the use of multi-photon excitation microscopy, resolution of neurons in the intact brain beyond depths of around 500 mu m is technically difficult to achieve. We have developed a relatively inexpensive small fiber optic probe ('micro-optrode') to simultaneously record extracellular electrical activity and intracellular fluorescence changes in real-time from structures deep within the intact brain. The micro-optrode was tested during experiments in the in situ working heart-brainstem preparation (WHBP) of rat, which allows the study of the intact ponto-medullary neuronal network that controls breathing. In conjunction with calcium-sensitive indicators, we successfully validated the utility of the micro-optrode by recording, for the first time, intracellular calcium dynamics in respiratory neurons of the intact respiratory network under normal conditions and during physiological and pharmacological manipulations.

AB  - Airflow significantly affects indoor environment and air quality. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling provides a useful and inexpensive tool for airflow analysis, but its application is limited by the ability to validate the model with accurate measurements. In this study, both a renormalization group (RNG) kappa-epsilon model and a larger eddy simulation (LES) model were evaluated using intensive air velocity data from a full-scale test room measured by particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques. The results showed that the RNG kappa-epsilon model predicted airflow patterns similar to the PIV measurements throughout the room space. In approximately 60% to 70% of the ventilation space, the normalized mean square error (NMSE) between the predicted and measured velocity magnitude was less than 0.25, which is an indicator of adequate model performance. Furthermore, under winter conditions, approximately 85% to 90% of NMSE values in animal and human zones were less than 0.25. These factors indicate that the RNG model is an effective tool for predicting non-isothermal airflow distributions in a full-scale room with simple geometry. The low grid LES model (< 300,000 grids), which is feasible using Fluent software and normal computer resources, did not predict the PIV measurement as closely as did the RNG model in this study.

AB  - An Environmental Resource Assessment and Management System (ERAMS), a computer-aided decision support system developed for determination of present and potential pastoral productivity of arid and semiarid regions, was used in this study on rangelands that have been cropped or grazed by sheep or both for 150 years. ERAMS determines productivity of mapped land units on the basis of soil-water availability. This in turn is dependent on annual rainfall, slope, soil depth, salinity, and physical and chemical constraints. Stock carrying capacity is dependent on vegetation type and condition, based on foliage cover and botanical composition, and nutritive value of the pasture. Physical and biological features are determined by field survey. ERAMS has been used to examine the likely impacts of management strategies that alter either the vegetation type, vegetation state, or degree of erosion. Six Land Capability classes were derived from combinations of rainfall, slope, soil depth, and salinity. Total dry matter production was calculated and ranged from 58 kg(-1) ha(-1) to 1980 kg(-1) ha(-1) Rainfall use efficiency (kg(-1) ha(-1) of total dry matter mm(-1) of mean annual rainfall) ranged from 3.05 to 4.07. Comparison of present and potential production indicates the likely benefits of programs designed to increase carrying capacity through improved vegetation cover and land stability.

AB  - Habitat-selection theory can be applied to solve numerous problems in the conservation and management of wildlife. Many of the solutions involve the use of habitat isodars, graphs of densities in pairs of habitats such that expected fitness is the same in both. For single species, isodars reflect differences in habitat quality, and specify the conditions when population density will, or will not, match the abundance of resources. When two or more species co-occur, isodars can be used to assess not only whether the species compete with one another, but also differences in habitat, in habitat selection, and in the functional form of density-dependent competition. Isodars have been applied to measure scales of habitat selection, the presence or absence of edge effects, as well as the number of habitats that species recognise in heterogeneous landscapes. Merged with foraging behaviour, isodars reveal the relative roles of habitat selection, spatial structure, and environmental stochasticity on local populations. Habitat-selection models can be linked similarly with theories of patch use to assess the underlying cause of source -sink dynamics. Isodars can detect and measure Allee effects, describe human habitat selection, and use human occupation of habitat as a leading indicator of threatened biodiversity. Even so, we have only begun to reveal the potential of habitat selection, and other optimal behaviours, to solve pressing problems in conservation and management.

AB  - Microbiotic crusts are assemblages of non-vascular plants (mosses, liverworts, algae, lichens, fungi, bacteria and cyanobacteria) which form intimate associations with surface soils. They play a major role in infiltration processes through changes to soil physico-chemical properties, and through their influence on soil surface roughness. Whilst some research suggests that they may restrict infiltration, Australian experience is that they are generally associated with enhanced infiltration. Unlike physical soil crusts, microbiotic crusts stabilize the soil against water and wind erosion, increasing landscape stability, particularly in areas of low vascular plant cover. Microbiotic crusts are thus useful indicators of soil surface condition, and cyanobacteria in the crusts fix nitrogen which may be utilized by developing vascular plant seedlings. Little is known, however, about how they interact with vascular plants and soil invertebrates. Their role in rangeland ecosystems has received renewed attention over the past few years with an increasing interest in ecologically sustainable development of arid and semi-arid grazing systems.
   In this review we discuss the characteristics and distribution of microbiotic crusts in the rangelands of Australia, their roles in soil and ecological processes and the impacts of fire and grazing. Finally we propose a new system for classifying crusts into functional groups and identify areas requiring further investigation.

AB  - This study examines the role of institutions in reducing a presumably negative impact of poor environmental quality on health outcomes, using a panel of 45 sub-Saharan African countries over the period, 1996-2016. The empirical estimation is based on the panel quantile regression estimator. The study established inter alia: first, the declining health status occasioned by environmental degradation resulted in low life expectancy, high child mortality and increasing health expenditure. Second, strong institutional settings are needed to reverse the adverse effects of poor environmental quality on health outcomes. Thus, the minimum thresholds of control of corruption, government effectiveness, regulatory quality and overall institutions that restore human age expectancy are -0.37, -0.59, -0.40 and -0.40, respectively. In the same order, 0.08, -0.18, -0.41 and -0.15 are needed for health spending, whereas 0.24 of control of corruption and -0.21 of regulatory quality are needed to minimise child mortality. Third, the net effects of interactions do not align with the hypothesised relationships. Finally, we acknowledged the importance of some auxiliary indicators specific to each measure of health outcomes. On the policy front, setting-up an innovative and sustainable agenda of green environment and clean growth seems critical to realising improved health conditions.

AB  - The present study was conducted to comprehensively evaluate watershed sustainability with the help of an initiative barometer developed based on different dimensions of social, economic, environmental, and policy. The newly developed barometer was then applied to assess the temporal variation of sustainability for the Shazand Watershed, Iran, for four-node years of 1986, 1998, 2008, and 2016. The appropriate criteria were then adapted to calculate the study dimensions. The effect sizes of selected criteria on each dimension were also determined. Consequently, the status of each dimension and integrated watershed sustainability status were mapped for four-node years. The results indicated that study dimensions were unevenly distributed over the Shazand Watershed. So that, the social dimension had high effectiveness across different sub-watersheds, and the policy dimension had a poor situation in all study years. In addition, the respective sustainability index of 0.32, 0.32, 0.35, and 0.35 for node years of 1986, 1998, 2008, and 2016 verified a slight improvement. Overall, the proposed barometer of sustainability facilitated understanding the dimensional sustainability and comprehensive watershed sustain ability and provided references for policy formulations and watershed management. Besides, the developed barometer has a high potential for evaluating sustainability for other watersheds worldwide. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the last few decades, the eutrophication of lakes has been a serious issue in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River watershed. To explore the relationship between lake systems and anthropogenic activities, sediments were collected from the Shuanglong reservoir in the Dianchi watershed in Southwest China. Total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total organic carbon (TOC), and the carbon isotopic ratio (delta C-13) were analyzed in sediment cores to reconstruct the effects of natural succession and human activities on the past lacustrine environmental conditions. A reliable chronology of the sediment core was established by using the Pb-210 dating technique, which indicated that the age span of the 70-cm sediment core is from the years 1871 to 2011. Above - 31 cm depth in the core, TN, TP, TOC, C/N, and delta C-13 increased significantly, indicating that eutrophication has occurred since the 1980s. By combining the indicators of delta C-13 and C/N, it was shown that terrestrial and lacustrine components were the main sources of organic matter (OM) in the reservoir, which was mostly controlled by terrestrial C-3 plants and algae. Since the 1980s, increased sewage discharge, fish aquaculture, fertilizer application, population, and economic strength have sped up the eutrophication process, and the eutrophication was further intensified in 2001.

AB  - To realize the coordinated and sustainable development of hydropower projects and regional society, comprehensively evaluating hydropower projects' influence is critical. Usually, hydropower project development has an impact on environmental geology and social and regional cultural development. Based on comprehensive consideration of complicated geological conditions, fragile ecological environment, resettlement of reservoir area, and other factors of future hydropower development in each country, we have constructed a comprehensive evaluation index system of hydropower projects, including 4 first-level indicators of social economy, environment, safety, and fairness, which contain 26 second-level indicators. To solve the problem that existing models cannot evaluate dynamic nonlinear optimization, a projection pursuit model is constructed by using rough set reduction theory to simplify the index. Then, an accelerated genetic algorithm based on real number coding is used to solve the model and empirical study is carried out with the Y hydropower station as a sample. The evaluation results show that the evaluation index system and assessment model constructed in our paper effectively reduce the subjectivity of index weight. Applying our model to the social impact assessment (SIA) of related international hydropower projects can not only comprehensively analyze the social impact of hydropower projects but also identify important social influencing factors and effectively analyze the social impact level of each dimension. Furthermore, SIA assessment can be conducive to project decision-making, avoiding social risks and social stability.

AB  - This study, concerning the epigeic fauna of carabid beetles (Coleoptera; Carabidae), was conducted in the north-east of Poland, in an area which is part of the Dabrowka Forest Subdistrict and has been included in the "Small water retention program for the Province of Warmia and Mazury in 2006-2015". The purpose of the study was to assess the impact of the water retention implemented within the framework of the above program on assemblages of ground beetles. These insects are highly sensitive to any anthropogenically induced transformations. This analysis was based on the interactions among the analyzed insects caused by changes occurring in their habitat. During the 3-year study, 5,807 specimens representing 84 species were captured. The water storage had a significant influence on the structure of the Carabidae assemblages. Before the earthworks were constructed for the project, the beetle assemblages had comprised a large group of xerophilous species, whereas after the small retention reservoirs had been created, an increase in the contribution of hygrophilous species was noticed. The results indicate that the retention works cause alterations in the water and environmental conditions of the habitats, and thereby effect changes in the composition of Carabidae assemblages. Moreover, modification in water relations within a habitat causes long-term changes in the structural and functional diversity of the beetles.

AB  - This study investigates where coastal green infrastructure (CGI) can provide highest potential coastal protection benefits, while considering its vulnerability to environmental conditions. CGI provides important coastal protection benefits, however, influenced by climate change and human activities, these benefits are highly threatened. This vulnerability of CGI was not considered in the previous studies. This study provides a framework and an indicator-based methodology to fill this gap. A review of the literature was conducted to identify the parameters used to measure CGI's coastal protection benefits and vulnerability. The content of the references that contained specific parameters related to CGI's role in coastal protection and vulnerability were systematically reviewed. A total of 11 indicators were identified and organized into two indices: CGI coastal protection index, and CGI vulnerability index. The indices were synthesized using a 2 x 2 matrix to identify areas with the highest coastal protection potential. Analysis was conducted for the 74 most populated coastal communities in the Salish Sea region. Results indicate that the British Columbia communities in the Salish Sea region have high potential to utilize CGI for coastal protection. CGI in 59% of the communities in British Columbia and 36% in Washington State can provide high coastal protection benefits, even when vulnerability is accounted for.

AB  - There has been a trend toward increasing anthropocentrism in definitions of river health through the explicit inclusion of societal valuation of ecosystem services provided by rivers. New frameworks and associated indicators of river health are therefore required to centralize ecosystem services within river assessment and management activities. Here, we adopt an anthropocentric conceptualization of rivers to focus on a river's ability to maintain ecological function and structure that support ecosystem services valued by society. We apply this approach to further existing conceptual models of river assessment by identifying how benthic indicators can be linked to valued ecosystem services in a river services assessment framework. This approach extends bioassessment from a focus on assessing departure from reference condition to also include the evaluation of rivers based on their delivery of ecosystem services. Indicators based on benthic processes and assemblages are widely used in river health assessments; thus, these are reviewed to identify those indicators most closely linked with the provision of river ecosystem services. Finally, we illustrate how our approach can be applied to management through contrasting watershed examples, including a highly modified agricultural region and relatively pristine Arctic watersheds. The proposed approach supports an explicit connection between valued ecosystem services and benthic indicators, providing more targeted assessment results for use in river management decision-making.

AB  - Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) activates cognate G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to initiate biological signaling cascades. Lysophospholipid (LP) receptor binding properties remain incompletely assessed because of difficulties with ligand lipophilicity and lipid stickiness. These inherent attributes produce high levels of nonspecific binding within cell-membrane preparations used to assess GPCRs, as has been shown in classical binding assays using radiolabeled ligands, making accurate measurements of lipid binding kinetics difficult to achieve. Backscattering interferometry (BSI) is an optical technology that measures molecular binding interactions by reporting changes in the refractive index of a solution after binding events. Here, we report the use of BSI to assess LPA(1) for its ability to bind to naturally occurring lipids and a synthetic LPA(1) antagonist (ONO-9780307), under both primary- and competition-binding conditions. Assessment of 12 different lipids demonstrated that the known LP ligand, 1-oleoyl-LPA, as well as an endocannabinoid metabolite, anandamide phosphate, are specific ligands for LPA(1), whereas other LPs tested were not. Newly determined dissociation constants (K-d values) for orthosteric lipid ligands approximated 10(-9) M, substantially lower (i.e., with higher affinity) than measured K-d values in classical binding or cell-based assays. These results demonstrate that BSI may have particular utility in assessing binding interactions between lipid receptors and their lipid ligands and could provide new screening approaches for lipid receptor identification and drug discovery.

AB  - The type and the management have strong effect on the composition and activity of microbial community and therefore on fertility of the soil. In this study ecological and conventional managements were compared in a sandy area of the Nyirseg (North-Eastern) region, Hungary. Soil samples were collected twice from the upper and lower part of the sloping study sites, in autumn 2012 and in spring 2013, from the 0-30 cm and 30-60 cm depth intervals. Beside the main physical and chemical soil properties, the community structure (phospholipid fatty acid characterization) and activity (invertase and catalase enzymes) of microbes were investigated. The recycled plant residues can buffering the negative environmental/human effects, decreases the differences between the chemical and microbiological results of two elevation positions, and results favourable conditions to the soil microbes. Higher pH, total and organic C content, total and nitrite-nitrate-N content, furthermore higher enzymatic activities were measured in the ecological than in conventional site. Our results showed that ecological management had positive effect on the quality and fertility of the sandy soils in the Nyirseg region by improving the chemical soil parameters and increasing the community size and the activity of microbes. Most of the measured parameters were more favourable in the 0-30 cm than the lower sampled layer.

AB  - Suspended particulate matter (SPM) is a key environmental indicator for rivers, estuaries, and coastal waters, which can be calculated from remote sensing reflectance obtained by an airborne or satellite imager. Here, algorithms from prior studies are applied to a dataset of in-situ at surface hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance, collected in three geographic regions representing different water types. These data show the optically inherent exponential nature of the relationship between reflectance and sediment concentration. However, linear models are also shown to provide a reasonable estimate of sediment concentration when utilized with care in similar conditions to those under which the algorithms were developed, particularly at lower SPM values (0 to 20 mg/L). Fifteen published SPM algorithms are tested, returning strong correlations of R-2 > 0.7, and in most cases, R-2 > 0.8. Very low SPM values show weaker correlation with algorithm calculated SPM that is not wavelength dependent. None of the tested algorithms performs well for high SPM values (> 30 mg/L), with most algorithms underestimating SPM. A shift toward a smaller number of simple exponential or linear models relating satellite remote sensing reflectance to suspended sediment concentration with regional consideration will greatly aid larger spatiotemporal studies of suspended sediment trends.

AB  - Excess nutrients in surface waters, such as phosphorus (P) from agriculture, result in poor water quality, with adverse effects on ecological health and costs for remediation. However, understanding and prediction of P transfers in catchments have been limited by inadequate data and over-parameterised models with high uncertainty. We show that, with high temporal resolution data, we are able to identify simple dynamic models that capture the P load dynamics in three contrasting agricultural catchments in the UK. For a flashy catchment, a linear, second-order (two pathways) model for discharge gave high simulation efficiencies for short-term storm sequences and was useful in highlighting uncertainties in out-of-bank flows. A model with non-linear rainfall input was appropriate for predicting seasonal or annual cumulative P loads where antecedent conditions affected the catchment response. For second-order models, the time constant for the fast pathway varied between 2 and 15 h for all three catchments and for both discharge and P, confirming that high temporal resolution data are necessary to capture the dynamic responses in small catchments (10-50 km(2)). The models led to a better understanding of the dominant nutrient transfer modes, which will be helpful in determining phosphorus transfers following changes in precipitation patterns in the future.

AB  - Ecotoxicology provides data to inform environmental management. Many testing protocols do not consider offspring fitness and toxicant sensitivity. Cadmium (Cd) is a well-studied and ubiquitous toxicant but little is known about the effects on offspring of exposed parents (transgenerational effects). This study had three objectives: to identify endpoints related to offspring performance; to determine whether parental effects would manifest as a change in Cd tolerance in offspring and how parental exposure duration influenced the manifestation of parental effects. Adult snails were exposed to Cd 0, 25, 50, 100, 200 and 400 mu g Cd/L for eight weeks. There were effects on adult endpoints (e.g., growth, reproduction) but only at the highest concentrations (>100 mu g/L). Alternatively, we observed significant transgenerational effects at all Cd concentrations. Surprisingly, we found increased Cd tolerance in hatchlings from all parental Cd exposure concentrations even though eggs and hatchlings were in Cd-free conditions for 6 weeks. Explicit consideration of offspring performance adds value to current toxicity testing protocols. Parental exposure duration has important implications for offspring effects and that contaminant concentrations that are not directly toxic to parents can cause transgenerational changes in resistance that have significant implications for toxicity testing and adaptive responses.

AB  - Urban streams display many similar symptoms around the world, but awareness is growing that the mechanisms and severity of the symptoms differ among regions. Climate is a key contributor to these differences via: 1) variation in the initial conditions of streams across climate (and their sensitivity to urbanization), 2) interactions between climate and urbanization, and 3) indirect effects of climate on the form of urbanization or management via effects on human behaviors. We discuss the direct and indirect pathways by which climate shapes the structure and function of urban streams and how differences in climate affect how the urban stream syndrome is manifested. For some symptoms, such as stream flashiness, climate can affect the direction and magnitude of response, whereas for others, such as losses of sensitive taxa, climate can affect the magnitude of the response. Mechanisms linking urbanization with ecological degradation, even when responses are similar, can differ among climates. Limited research has been done on the role of climate in stream response to urbanization. Controlled, large-scale studies are needed to address this issue, particularly because climate may covary with types of infrastructure and technological capabilities across the globe. Understanding the linkages between climate and urban stream ecosystems will improve our theoretical understanding of urban streams and our ability to implement tailored and regionally sensitive management strategies.

TI  - Effective Decontamination of Laboratory Animal Rooms with Vapour-phase ("Vaporized") Hydrogen Peroxide and Peracetic Acid
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the decontaminant effects of vapour-phase hydrogen peroxide (VHP) and peracetic acid (PAA) in laboratory animal rooms. Methodologically and microbiologically, both methods were evaluated as an alternative to traditional methods. In the VHP decontamination process, the cycle consisted of 4 phases (dehumidification, conditioning, decontamination and aeration). The residual vapour was catalytically decomposed into water and oxygen. The complete process of room decontamination with VHP took 14-15 hours.
   In PAA decontamination, the dry fog system produced very fine droplets of disinfectant that were dispersed throughout the laboratory animal rooms. The overall decontamination process by PAA mist took 3 hours, which was much faster than VHP decontamination. In both methods, no corrosion appeared on the material surfaces. The results of chemical and biological indicators showed complete decontamination after exposure to VHP and PAA fumigation. In the airborne microbiological examinations, total colony counts for the surface and environmental microorganisms were minimal. There were no significant differences between VHP and PAA fumigation. In laboratory facilities, conventional decontaminating methods will be gradually converted into VHP or PAA decontamination. This experiment confirmed that the VHP method is suitable for the decontamination of a relatively limited space whereas the PAA method is applicable to the rapid decontamination of spacious laboratory animal rooms. In conclusion, decontamination with VHP and PAA holds great promise as an effective alternative to currently used formaldehyde fumigation.

AB  - Among all proxy archives, tree rings are highly promising indicator of ecological and environmental processes due to their high climatic sensitivity, better annual resolution, and large spatial coverage. Seasonal importance of soil moisture dynamics and impact of drought events on tree growth development and carbon sequestration potential in tropical moist forests was assessed using the teak tree ring width index and instrumental climate data from Aizawl, Mizoram. Present analysis suggests that soil moisture during months of the early growing season with low precipitation is crucial for determining the growth of teak trees in the Northeast region of India. Results of the present study reflected the impact of remote atmospheric climate regulation modes such as El Nin similar to oSouthern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), Sea surface temperature (SST) and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) on site climate. Results indicate that the increasing moisture stresses in the region may cause the survival risk for the other forest vegetation having low adaptability to climate change stresses with the inability to make niche shifts. Increasing the number of tree ring studies linked with eco-physiological parameters of tree growth is recommended to better visualize the level of stresses on the trees in the moist tropical forests. This information will be useful in developing better management plans for biodiversity conservation in the tropical region.

AB  - The incorporation of sustainability aspects into the design of chemical processes has been increasing since the last century. Hence, there are several proposed methodologies and indicators to assess chemical facilities through process analysis techniques. A comprehensive assessment involving economic, environmental, safety, and exergy parameters of two alternatives for butanol production from Man ihot esculenta Crantz (cassava waste) is presented in this study. The modeling of process topologies involved using Aspen Plus software. Topology 1 generated a product flow rate of 316,477 t/y of butanol, while this value was 367,037 t/y for topology 2. Both processes used a feed flow of 3,131,439 t/y of biomass. This study used seven technical indicators to evaluate both alternatives, which include the return of investment, discounted payback period, global warming potential, renewability material index, inherent safety index, exergy efficiency, and exergy of waste ratio. Otherwise, this study implemented an aggregate index to assess overall sustainability performance. The results revealed that topology 2 presented higher economic normalized scores for evaluated indicators, but the most crucial difference between these designs came from the safety and exergetic indexes. Topology 1 and topology 2 obtained weighted scores equaling to 0.48 and 0.53; therefore, this study found that the second alternative gives a more sustainable design for butanol production under evaluated conditions.

AB  - When using a Terrestrial 3D laser scanning (TLS) to monitor the mining subsidence in a mining area, the conventional methods are to set up the public target manually, or to set up the ground control network in advance. However, these have the disadvantages of high labor intensity and low efficiency. In order to overcome the shortcomings of the conventional methods, this paper presents the subsidence monitoring method using TLS without a target in the mining area. Feature points are used to splice the multi-station point clouds in the same phase, and a few station coordinates are used to uniformly transform the multiphase data into a geodetic coordinate system. Afterwards, the surface digital elevation model (DEM) is established by using the point clouds after coordinate transformation, and the dynamic subsidence value and subsidence basin during the period of observation are obtained by DEM subtraction. Compared to traditional methods, this method simplifies the field measurement process, reduces the labor intensity, and transfers the main work to the internal industry. It is suitable for surface subsidence monitoring with a harsh external environment and complicated topographic conditions. Surface deformation values are important basic data for mining area subsidence parameters acquisition, mining area environmental assessment, land reclamation, and ecological restoration. As a consequence, it is of great value to popularize and apply in mining area for subsidence monitoring.

AB  - A revised Holocene sea-level history for the southern Gulf of Carpentaria is presented based on new data from the South Wellesley Archipelago and age recalibration of previous research. Results confirm that rising sea levels during the most recent post-glacial marine transgression breached the Arafura Sill ca. 11,700 cal. yr BP. Sea levels continued to rise to ca. -30 m by 10,000 cal. yr BP, leading to full marine conditions. By 7700 cal. yr BP, sea-level reached present mean sea-level (PMSL) and continued to rise to an elevation of between 1.5 m and 2 m above PMSL. Sea level remained ca. + 1.5 between 7000 and 4000 cal. yr BP, followed by rapid regression to within +/- 0.5 m of PMSL by ca. 3500 cal. yr BP. When placed into a wider regional context results from this study show that coastal landscape evolution in the tropical north of Australia was not only dependent on sea-level change but also show a direct correlation with Holocene climate variability. Specifically, the formation and preservation of beach-rock deposits, intertidal successions, beach and chenier ridge systems hold valuable sea-level and Holocene climate proxies that can contribute to the growing research into lower latitude Holocene sea-level and climate histories.

AB  - Export banana production in Latin America is pesticide intensive, receiving much negative publicity regarding human health problems and environmental degradation. The Rainforest Alliance (RA) certification scheme was established to certify farms that met a number of social, occupation health and environmental standards set by RA and their certifying body, the Sustainable Agriculture Network (SAN). This study was one of the first, independent studies of the environmental impact of some of the principles set by RA and SAN. The study focuses on insect and bird diversity as an indicator of ecosystem health. Five RA certified farms, six non-RA certified farms, and five organic certified farms were sampled. The data was analyzed with RDA multivariate analyses and Monte Carlo permutation tests. The results showed that RA certified farms had less insect diversity compared to non-RA certified farms and that both farm types had less insect diversity than organic farms. There was little difference between RA and non-RA certified farms with regards bird community composition. Thus, organic farming conserves biodiversity, while alternative environmental labels (e.g. a Rainforest alliance seal) may not have any visible positive effect on in-farm biodiversity. This study points to the need for improvements in SAN certification standards to achieve improved environmental conditions. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Many of the observed species interactions embedded in ecological communities are not permanent, but are characterized by temporal changes that are observed along with abiotic and biotic variations. While work has been done describing and quantifying these changes, little is known about their consequences for species coexistence. Here, we investigate the extent to which changes of species composition impact the likelihood of persistence of the predator-prey community in the highly seasonal Bialowieza Primeval Forest (northeast Poland), and the extent to which seasonal changes of species interactions (predator diet) modulate the expected impact. This likelihood is estimated extending recent developments on the study of structural stability in ecological communities. We find that the observed species turnover strongly varies the likelihood of community persistence between summer and winter. Importantly, we demonstrate that the observed seasonal interaction changes minimize the variation in the likelihood of persistence associated with species turnover across the year. We find that these community dynamics can be explained as the coupling of individual species to their environment by minimizing both the variation in persistence conditions and the interaction changes between seasons. Our results provide a homeostatic explanation for seasonal species interactions and suggest that monitoring the association of interactions changes with the level of variation in community dynamics can provide a good indicator of the response of species to environmental pressures.

AB  - Beta diversity represents a powerful indicator of ecological conditions because of its intrinsic relation with environmental gradients. In this view, remote sensing may be profitably used to derive models characterizing or estimating species turnover over an area. While several examples exist using spectral variability to estimate species diversity at several spatial scales, most of these have relied on standard correlation or regression approaches like the common Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression which are problematic with noisy data. Moreover, very few attempts were made to derive beta diversity characterization models at different taxonomic ranks. In this paper, we performed quantile regression to test if spectral distance represents a good proxy of beta diversity considering different data thresholds and taxonomic ranks. We used plant distribution data from the North and South Carolina including 146 counties and covering a variety of vegetation formations. The dissimilarity in species composition at different taxonomic ranks (using Sorensen distance) among pairs of counties was compared with their distance in NDVI values derived from 23 yearly MODIS images. Our results indicate that (i) spectral variability represents a good proxy of beta diversity when appropriate statistics are applied and (ii) a lower taxonomic rank is important when changes in species composition are examined spatially using remotely sensed data.

AB  - Radon is a natural radioactive gas derived from geological materials. It has been estimated that about half of the total effective dose received by human beings from all sources of ionizing radiation is attributed to Rn-222 and its short-lived progeny. In this paper, the use of human respiratory tract models to assess the health hazard from environmental radon is reviewed. A short history of dosimetric models for the human respiratory tract from the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) is first presented. The most important features of the newest model published by ICRP in 1994 (as ICRP Publication 66) are then described, including the morphometric model, physiological parameters, radiation biology, deposition of aerosols, clearance model and dose weighting. Comparison between different morphometric models and comparison between different deposition models are then given. Finally, the significance of various parameters in the lung model is discussed, including aerosol parameters, subject related parameters, target and cell related parameters, and parameters that define the absorption of radon from the lungs to blood. Dosimetric calculations gave a dose conversion coefficient of 15 mSv/WLM, which is higher than the value 5 mSv/WLM derived from epidemiological studies. ICRP stated that dosimetric models should only be used for comparison of doses in the human lungs resulted from different exposure conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article presents a bio-economic household model, which has been developed to assess the potential impacts of agricultural intensification efforts on economic and ecological indicators in eastern Uganda. A study region in the Lake Victoria Crescent was selected with comparative advantages for intensive agricultural production: high agricultural potential, high market access, and high population density. However, current production is characterized by low input-output systems revealing a discrepancy between development opportunities and actual development outcomes. Based on a farmer participatory research approach, production methods were introduced in the study region aimed at fostering sustainable agricultural development. Data from two community surveys, two comprehensive household and plot level surveys, and farm-trial data were used to develop and calibrate bio-economic models for four representative household types. Model scenarios reveal that farm households in eastern Uganda would not pursue sustainable intensification under current socio-economic conditions. The market environment has to be improved substantially, i.e., transaction and transportation costs have to be reduced, innovative credit schemes for smallholders have to be introduced, and alternative forms of labor acquisition have to be promoted, to provide sufficient economic incentives for the adoption of environmentally sound production methods. In addition, agricultural service provision needs to be reformed and more agricultural research is needed for new and better-targeted technologies.

AB  - Mud Banks are littoral zones along the Kerala (southwest) coast of India with increased suspended sediments during the Southwest Monsoon (SWM), which facilitate remarkable damping of incident waves creating a localized calm sea environment conducive for fishing activities. In this paper, we used the response of mesozooplankton community as a whole and copepod species in particular as a tool to characterize the relative importance of Coastal Upwelling and Mud Bank in shaping the biological manifestations along the southwest coast of India. The geographical area studied was off Alappuzha (Kerala coast) and altogether 18 field samplings (weekly/fortnightly) were carried out in three locations in the region (Ml, M2 and M3) from the Pre-SWM to the Late-SWM of 2014. M1 was a reference location at the same depth contour (6 m) and 10 km north of location M2 that represented the region where the Mud Bank forms during the SWM. Location M3 was situated beyond the offshore boundary of the Mud Bank zone (12 m depth), perpendicular to location M2. The physical characteristics of the Mud Bank, such as relatively high suspended sediments and calm sea conditions, existed at M2 by mid June and before that all the three locations had comparable physical characteristics in the water column. Coastal Upwelling was prevalent over all the three locations by early-June, characterized by cool and less oxygenated waters, more so in the subsurface waters. The mesozooplankton community in the study domain was composed of 15 heterogeneous groups; their biomass and abundance were high during the Peak- (av. 6.02 +/- 5.19 ml m(-3) and av. 7285 +/- 3248 No m(-3)) and Late-SWM (av. 4.91 +/- 4.35 ml m(-3) and ay. 6802 +/- 2727 No m(-3)) compared to the Pre-SWM (av. 0.63 +/- 0.55 ml m(-3) and av. 3045 +/- 1584 No m(-3)) and Early-SWM (av. 0.58 +/- 0.46 ml m(-3) and av. 2047 +/- 1675 No m(-3)). Mesozooplankton abundance was dominated by copepods (>70%) and the number of larger zooplankton carnivores (medusae, siphonophores and chaetognaths) was found to be low (<5%). Altogether, 43 species of copepods were recorded from the present study. Based on the abundance and species distribution of copepods in all three locations, cluster and SIMPROF analyses delineated four environmental conditions (clusters) typical of Pre-SWM (cluster 1), Early-SWM (cluster 2), Peak-SWM (cluster 3) and Late-SWM (cluster 4). SIMPER analysis demarcated the discriminating species of copepods in the environmental clusters delineated by cluster/SIMPROF. The discriminating copepods were composed of Acartia dance, A. erythraea, Centropages orsini (cluster1); Temora turbinata (the upwelling indicator) (cluster 2); Oithona similis (cluster 3); Temora turbinata, Pseudodiaptomus serricaudatus, Centropages tenuremis (cluster 4). The dominance and distribution pattern of copepods observed in all three study locations were very similar and the detailed Multivariate Redundancy analysis confirmed the dominant influence of Coastal Upwelling and not the Mud Bank in structuring the mesozooplankton/copepod community in the study domain. The present study provides the first in-depth information on the mesozooplankton (especially copepods) from a Coastal Upwelling - Mud Bank system along the southwest coast of India, evidencing the dominant role of Coastal Upwelling in shaping the zooplankton community during the SWM.

AB  - As industrialized fishing activities have moved into deeper water, the recognition of Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs) has become important for the protection of the deep-sea. Our limited knowledge on the past and present distribution of VMEs hinders our ability to manage bottom fisheries effectively. This study investigated whether accounting for bottom fishing intensity (derived from Vessel Monitoring System records) as a predictor in habitat suitability models can (1) improve predictions of, and (2) provide estimates for a pre-fishing baseline for the distribution and biomass of a VME indicator taxon. Random Forest models were applied to presence/absence and biomass of Geodia sponges and environmental variables with and without bottom fishing intensity. The models including fishing were further used to predict distribution and biomass of Geodia to a pre-fishing scenario. Inclusion of fishing pressure as a predictive term significantly improved model performance for both sponge presence and biomass. This study has demonstrated a way to produce a more accurate picture of the current distribution of VMEs in the study area. The pre-fishing scenario predictions also identified areas of suitable Geodia habitat that are currently impacted by fishing, suggesting that sponge habitat and biomass have been impacted by bottom trawling activities.

AB  - Context Widespread loss of wetland ecosystems resulting from human land use highlights the need for a reclamation strategy that can sustain wetland ecosystem services. Since wetland function partly depends on landscape structure, reclamation and monitoring can be aided by knowing the differences in wetland configuration between undisturbed and disturbed landscapes.
   Objectives Identify a parsimonious set of landscape metrics for quantifying wetland configuration and land-cover composition, and quantify how these metrics vary with anthropogenic disturbance.
   Methods A large suite of landscape metrics quantifying area/edge, shape, aggregation, and diversity were calculated for landscapes in the Grassland, Parkland, and Boreal Natural Regions of Alberta. Variable reduction techniques were applied to identify representative metrics. These representative metrics were related to anthropogenic disturbance using non-parametric tests.
   Results The spatial configuration of wetlands in low-disturbance and high-disturbance landscapes were significantly different from other landscapes. Aggregation metrics were the most commonly identified measures of wetland configuration independent of wetland-proportion in the landscape.
   Conclusions Our findings provide insight for reclamation and monitoring by showing that some aspects of wetland configuration vary independently of composition, and therefore both need to be considered when parameterizing the design of reclaimed landscapes. We suggest that using landscape metrics in a reference condition approach is appropriate for evaluating landscape degradation and for setting landscape reclamation targets and monitoring programs.

AB  - The study of agricultural terraces in mountainous Dagestan that date to the Middle Ages revealed the polygenetic character of anthropogenic soils, which reflects the main stages of their evolution. In light of their long-term burial, the soil layers of the preanthropogenic stage of evolution were characterized by fairly high values of biological activity, with the exception of the biomass of fungal mycelium, a small amount of which remained. At the early agrogenic stage, soil plowing without irrigation did not significantly change their microbiological properties; however, the increase in urease activity in some studied profiles may indicate that cattle fertilizers were applied in some areas of the terraces. During the Little Ice Age (the 16-18th centuries A.D.) the terraces were abandoned, which led to the accumulation of organic carbon in the soils as a result of the fallow process, as well as an increase in their enzymatic activity. The second agrogenic stage with irrigation was characterized by a noticeable growth in the active microbial biomass, the soil phosphatase activity, and, in particular, the urease activity, which may indicate that farming was intensive and organic fertilizers were applied. In the last 20 years, the development of terraces under natural conditions led to a noticeable growth in the biological activity of upper fallow horizons. However, the urease activity significantly decreased in nonirrigated areas, whereas the indicators of microbial biomass remained at the same level.

AB  - Rule-based weight of evidence approaches to ecological risk assessment may not account for uncertainties and generally lack probabilistic integration of lines of evidence. Bayesian networks allow causal inferences to be made from evidence by including causal knowledge about the problem, using this knowledge with probabilistic calculus to combine multiple lines of evidence, and minimizing biases in predicting or diagnosing causal relationships. Too often, sources of uncertainty in conventional weight of evidence approaches are ignored that can be accounted for with Bayesian networks. Specifying and propagating uncertainties improve the ability of models to incorporate strength of the evidence in the risk management phase of an assessment. Probabilistic inference from a Bayesian network allows evaluation of changes in uncertainty for variables from the evidence. The network structure and probabilistic framework of a Bayesian approach provide advantages over qualitative approaches in weight of evidence for capturing the impacts of multiple sources of quantifiable uncertainty on predictions of ecological risk. Bayesian networks can facilitate the development of evidence-based policy under conditions of uncertainty by incorporating analytical inaccuracies or the implications of imperfect information, structuring and communicating causal issues through qualitative directed graph formulations, and quantitatively comparing the causal power of multiple stressors on valued ecological resources. These aspects are demonstrated through hypothetical problem scenarios that explore some major benefits of using Bayesian networks for reasoning and making inferences in evidence-based policy.

AB  - This paper tries to answer the following research question: can multidimensional concepts like well-being or sustainability be measured by using a single metric such as shadow prices? The defence of shadow prices is generally based on the pragmatic argument that different dimensions (economic, social, environmental,.) cannot be aggregated when measured by means of different metrics, thus a common measurement rod has to be found, that is shadow prices have to be used. Here the following conclusions are drawn: (1) The choice of shadow prices is not neutral, in fact implicit assumptions such as that substitutability is always desirable need to be accepted. This means that the use of shadow prices is not consistent with a simple measurement objective but with a precise weltanschauung. (2) Shadow prices are primarily meant to implement efficiency, i. e. prices reflect conditions at the margin, and thus this is their natural objective. In the framework of sustainable well-being measurement, this may give rise to counterintuitive results, such as that the loss of an important well-being component is not perceived since its physical scarcity is compensated by its increase in monetary value. (3) The pragmatic measurement argument is not well grounded, since multidimensional measurement frameworks exist, such as multi-criteria evaluation. Since incommensurability between different metrics does not imply incomparability, there is no obvious reason for not using multidimensional techniques to measure multidimensional concepts.

AB  - Surface albedo plays a crucial role in the energy balance of soils. The surface albedo and surface soil moisture of bare sand and biological soil crusts (BSCs) were concurrently observed on field plots of shifting sand dune and in revegetated desert ecosystems at Shapotou, northwestern China, to study relationships between surface albedo, solar elevation angle, and surface soil moisture. Results indicated that rainfall exerted a remarkable lowering effect on the variation of surface albedo by increasing surface soil moisture. Surface albedo was an exponential function of solar elevation angle, and the normalized surface albedo (solar elevation angle effect was removed) decreased exponentially with the increase of surface soil moisture. Sand surface had a higher albedo (0.266) than BSCs (0.226) when the surfaces were very dry. However, sand surface albedo became increasingly lower than that of BSCs when the surfaces were in wet conditions and when the soil moisture exceeded a critical value. The changes in soil surface albedo from sand dune to BSCs after revegetation in shallow soil profiles associated with the variation of the surface soil moisture can be seen as an indicator of the degree of sand dune stabilization when compared with the original shifting sand dune soil.

AB  - Submerged macrophytes are important elements for the structure and functioning of lake ecosystems. In this study, we used chemical and maximum colonisation depth (C_max) data from 12 European countries in order to investigate how suitable C_max may describe the impact by eutrophication. The analyses include data from 757 lakes and 919 lake years covering oligotrophic to eutrophic lakes. Overall, C_max was closely related to Secchi depth (R (2) = 0.58) and less closely to chlorophyll a (R (2) = 0.31), TP (R (2) = 0.31) and total nitrogen, TN (R (2) = 0.24). The low coefficients of determination between C_max and nutrient concentrations suggest that other response factors than nutrient-phytoplankton-light conditions are important for C_max and that it will be difficult to establish strong relationships between external nutrient loading and C_max. Yearly monitoring for 13-16 years in eight Danish lakes showed considerable year-to-year variability in C_max, which for the individual lakes only related weakly to changes in Secchi depth. The use of C_max as an eutrophication indicator is especially relevant in not very shallow lakes (maximum depth > 4-5 m), not too turbid lakes (C_max > 1 m) and not very humic lakes (colour < 60 mg Pt/l).

AB  - Theory predicts that because males are more variable in reproductive success than females, a mother should produce more sons to maximize fitness return from the sex allocation if she is of high-quality (the female quality hypothesis) or mates with a high-quality male (the male quality hypothesis). While most previous studies have looked at each hypothesis, we tested both of them simultaneously in the white-rumped snowfinch Montifringilla taczanowskii, a socially monogamous, sexually monomorphic passerine where body size is a potential indicator of individual quality in intrasexual competition and territory defense. Brood sex ratios at the population level did not deviate from random expectation. Among individual broods, the proportion of sons did not depend on body size of either male or female parent, but on interaction of this trait of both parents. Further analyses revealed that brood sex ratios were independent of body size of male or female parents when their mates were smaller, but positively related with body size of male or female parents when their mates were larger. These results suggest that mechanisms underlying the two hypotheses may act jointly on offspring sex allocation. The mechanisms are expected to evolve through size-assortative mating which is often reached by sexual selection [Current Zoology 59 (2): 271-277, 2013].

AB  - One of the major barriers to addressing complex social-ecological issues through integrated coastal management (ICM) is a lack of intergovernmental coordination and cooperation (horizontal and vertical fragmentation). This article describes an effort to overcome the barriers to ICM in Sri Lanka by fostering intergovernmental collaboration and initiating adaptive governance to restore one town, Hikkaduwa, and its associated marine protected area (MPA) and coastal zone habitats. Administrators from 12 national and local governmental agencies that are responsible for aspects of coastal management in the town of Hikkaduwa participated in a series of formal and informal workshops and a week-long tour of ICM projects in the Philippines. Outcomes demonstrate that these informal and formal meetings, workshops, and travel experiences fostered trust, social capital, and attitudinal organizational commitment (AOC). The experiences motivated members to overcome vertical and horizontal governance fragmentation through the formation of an independent intergovernmental committee for the restoration of Hikkaduwa into a sustainable and resilient community. ICM activities undertaken by the newly formed organization suggest that internal leadership capacity, effective local-national partnerships, explicitly linked ecological-economic projects, and long-term commitment are necessary conditions for success. Overall, attainment of sustainability and resilience through successful ICM should be thought of as a journey and not a destination.

AB  - Gene-environmental interaction (G x E) between a common functional polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT) and environmental adversity on the onset of depression in humans has been found in fifteen independent studies. It is supported by evidence from animal experiments, pharmacological challenge and neuroimaging investigations. However, negative findings have been reported in two large samples. We explore reasons for the inconsistencies and suggest means to their resolution. Sample age and gender composition emerge as important factors. While the G x E has been consistently detected in young adult samples, there are contradictory findings in adolescent boys and elderly people. The method of assessment of environmental adversity is also important with detailed interview-based approaches being associated with positive G x E findings. Unresolved issues in the definition of the genotype include the dominance of alleles and influence of other polymorphisms, both in 5-HTT and other genes. Assessment of multiple adverse outcomes, including depression, substance use and self-destructive behaviour is needed to clarify the generalisability of the G x E pathogenic mechanisms. Biological and behavioural intermediate phenotypes are yet to be exploited to understand the mechanisms underlying the G x E.

AB  - This report describes a study of exposure to omethoate during manual operations with ornamental plants in two intensive cultivation tunnels (tunnel 8 and tunnel 5). Airborne concentrations of omethoate were in the range 1.48-5.36 nmol/m(3). Total skin contamination in the range 329.94-12,934.46 nmol/day averaged 98.1 +/- 1.1% and 99.3 +/- 0.6% of the total potential dose in tunnel 8 and tunnel 5, respectively. Estimated absorbed doses during work in tunnel 5 were much higher than the acceptable daily intake of omethoate, which is 1.41 nmol/kg b.w. This finding shows that organization of the work or the protective clothing worn in tunnel 5 did not protect the workers from exposure. Urinary excretion of alkylphosphates was significantly higher than in the general population, increasing with exposure and usually showing a peak in the urine sample collected after the work shift. Urinary alkylphosphates showed a good correlation with estimated potential doses during work in tunnel 8 and are confirmed as sensitive biological indicators of exposure to phosphoric esters. The linear regression analysis between the urinary excretion of alkylphosphate, expressed as total nmol excreted in 24 h, and total cutaneous dose allows for estimating that the fraction of omethoate absorbed through the skin during work in tunnel 8 is about 16.5%.

AB  - The biggest illegal dumping site in Japan has been found on the border between Iwate and Aomori Prefectures. It has caused major social problems such as environmental contamination and is a cause of anxiety among local inhabitants. Improvements in the environmental conditions such as the removal of the large amount of waste and an improvement in water quality are urgently needed and, therefore, the development of a system for observing the state of contamination and the state of recovery on the site and an environment assessment and analysis of the results are also needed. For this purpose, a remote sensing system consisting of satellites and on-site sensors have been established for this study and the data collected by the system and other data are to be combined for environmental analysis in order to forecast and prevent the escalation of contamination and thus the damage caused by negative publicity, and observe the state of recovery.
   After the system of on-line sensors was established, observations on water, observations through cameras installed on the site and observations of the weather were made. Data from NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites were received directly by our university and analysed. As a result, a relationship between the changes in the temperature of the surface of the ground on the site and the existence of industrial wastes was successfully confirmed. In addition, situations in which the natural features of the site had changed were confirmed using SPOT images.

AB  - The potential for a classical biological control agent, Harmonia axyridis (Pallas), to have non-target effects on populations of the monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus (L.), was examined using no-choice predation studies under laboratory and caged field conditions. Three separate laboratory functional response experiments were conducted with adult and larval H. axyridis preying on immature D. plexippus. Nonlinear functional responses for third instar H. axyridis preying on D. plexippus eggs and first instars reached plateaus at about 25 and 15 prey consumed per day, respectively. A linear response resulted for adult H. axyridis preying on D. plexippus eggs. Potted Asclepias syriaca L. placed into large field-cages were infested with first instar D. plexippus and third instar H. axyridis. Survival of first instar D. plexippus was significantly lower in cages with H. axyridis larvae than in cages without H. axyridis larvae. The present experiments identify H. axyridis as a potential stressor to populations of D. plexippus. Further research is needed to assess the likelihood of D. plexippus exposure to H. axyridis in the field and to quantify the likelihood of H. axyridis having an adverse effect on D. plexippus in the presence of other prey, particularly aphids. These data could be used to develop an ecological risk assessment. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

AB  - Extensive evidence suggests that humoral and cellular immune responses against lipid peroxidation products occur in vivo and that they modulate the progression of atherosclerosis. The biological significance of these immune responses is the focus of this review. Lipid peroxidation generates reactive aldehydes and oxidized phospholipids which form complex, immunogenic adducts with proteins or other phospholipids. Autoantibodies against oxidative neoepitopes are present in humans and other species and their titre may be an indicator of the extent of atherosclerosis. Interventions boosting immune responses to oxidized LDL reduce the progression of atherosclerosis in animal models. However, other interventions inhibiting immune cells or signalling factors enhance atherogenesis, suggesting that different elements of the immune system exert opposite effects. Evaluation of the role of immune mechanisms in atherosclerosis is further complicated by the fact that other chronic inflammatory conditions induce similar humoral immune responses to oxidative neoepitopes, in particular oxidized phospholipids. Naturally occurring antibodies cloned from atherosclerotic mice provide insights into the nature of antigens formed in vivo and on biological effects of some antibody populations. For example, antibodies to oxidized phospholipid adducts inhibit macrophage uptake of oxidized LDL by blocking scavenger receptors. Antibodies to oxidation-specific epitopes may also be suitable for non-invasive diagnosis of atherosclerosis

AB  - 315 isolated semi-natural and natural stands in NW Germany were investigated floristically, 285 stands of ancient woodlands and 30 recent ones. In the study area nearly all semi-natural and natural ancient woodlands are found on mesotrophic or eutrophic sites and can be assigned to the Fagetalia. 54 selected herbaceous and five woody Fagetalia-species have been tested in their association to ancient woodlands. 21 of the 59 selected plant species show a highly significant association to ancient woodlands and seven species show a weak significance. 31 plant species are not significantly correlated with ancient woodland sites, but 25 of them have a low frequency. The result shows that investigations of the historical ecology can help to understand floristic composition of present-day woodlands.
   Restriction of many woodland species to ancient woodlands, especially rare species, emphasizes the importance of woodlands with a long continuous history for the preservation of endangered species. Irrespective of ecological conditions, the restriction of plant species to ancient woodlands seems to be mainly caused by their low ability to colonize recent woodlands, especially isolated stands. Differences in the association to ancient woodlands between European countries are assumed to be a function of both time and degree of isolation of woodlands, of the dispersal mode of the plant species and of the availability of suitable habitats.

AB  - Azoxybenzenes are important intermediates in industrial chemistry, and have many applications in the production of dyes, indicators and liquid crystals. In this paper, we describe a novel method for the preparation of azoxybenzenes via the reduction of the corresponding nitroarenes by beta-CD/NaOH in water. Several azoxybenzenes were synthesized in moderate to high yields. The reaction conditions were optimized, and a tentative reaction mechanism was proposed. This method is simple, economic and environmentally friendly, and has extended the application of beta-CD in organic synthesis.

AB  - The recent reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) urge for the reconceptualization of our design of the urban built environments. However, current efforts to integrate urban environmental assessment into practice in Egypt are proving insufficient. This paper utilises the Ladybug tools simulation plugins to investigate the impact of changing the morphological characteristics of three-block typologies (scattered, linear and courtyard) and their associated parameters to understand their multidimensional relationship with environmental conditions, outdoor thermal comfort and energy use intensity. This study based in Cairo, Egypt, considers 3430 hypothetical geometrical configurations comprising of a variety of design parameters and indicators. The results show a strong correlation between the design parameters and the combined performance of thermal comfort and energy consumption (R-2 = 0.84), with urban density having the strongest impact on both thermal comfort and energy use (R-2 = 0.7 and 0.95, respectively). The design parameters exhibited a consistent impact on the different typologies, albeit with varying magnitude. Compact and medium-density urban forms are shown to elicit the best overall performance, especially for ordinal orientations (e.g., similar to 45 degrees) across all typologies. Compact high-density scattered forms are favoured when considering thermal comfort, while courtyards outperform other typologies when considering energy efficiency and overall performance.

AB  - The experiment was conducted in the region of the Central Balkan Mountain (Bulgaria) in the period 2013-2015. Humate fertilizers were the objective for the present research was humate fertilizers (Phosphorus humate, Boron humate and Molybdenum humate) applied individually and in combination (at the stage of active vegetation of grass species) on the natural grass stand of Chrysopogon gryllus type. Grass stands treated with Molybdenum humate alone (160 ml/da) formed the highest yield of fresh (570.0 kg/da) and dry (195.6 kg/da) mass, which was proven (P <0.01). While the variants with foliar treatment by a combination of biofertilizers, such as Phosphorus humate (250 ml/da) + Boron humate (100 ml/da) + Molybdenum humate (100 ml/da), registered the lowest values (470.0 kg/da of fresh mass and 155.7 kg/da of dry mass). The percentage and species share of the main biological groups (grasses, legumes, motley grasses) in the natural grass stand changed in a positive way from the first to the third experimental year. The share of both main species Chrysopogon gryllus (characterizing the grass community) and motley grasses decreased, while there was an increase of Agrostis capillaris and legume meadow grasses (Trifolium campestre and Lotus corniculatus) in the above ground mass. The above data presupposes the formation of biomass with better qualitative and quantitative indicators.

AB  - Teleosts are the largest class of bony fishes and account for more than 90% of fish species. Their reproductive systems are the key feature to adopt gradual evolutionary change under aquatic environmental conditions. Aquatic ecosystems are faced with a serious threat to their proliferation due to the discharge of untreated industrial effluents into them. Here, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the damaged ovaries of the freshwater fish Rohu, Labeo rohita (Hamilton-Buchanan), due to their exposure to different heavy metals in the polluted waters of Harike Wetland in Punjab, India. Deformed oocytes with rough and distorted surfaces were observed in SEM. Microscopic analysis showed that environmental pollution caused by municipal effluents had damaged the microstructural surface on the fish ovaries. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy also showed damage of the microstructural surface and an abnormal deposition of heavy metals. The alterations in the reproductive system of the fish appeared to be the most responsive and a reliable indicator of environmental pollution, which indicates their significance in aquatic biomonitoring systems. This is the first report in North India showing tissue level markers in biomonitoring programs using the ovary of Labeo rohita as the model system. Microscopic analysis showed that environmental pollution caused by municipal effluents damaged the microstructural surface of the fish ovaries.

AB  - Rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) is a native species of the Amazon biome. This species had great economic importance due to the production of latex, used to obtain natural rubber. Seeking growth in productivity with adequate management is necessary to optimize production and increase areas with rubber trees. This study aimed to verify the physical and chemical attributes of soil under three different managements and two rubber tree clones, searching for the best alternative for the general edaphoclimatic conditions of the Cerrado biome. The experiment was installed in Palmeiras of Goias, GO, Brazil, in a randomized block design in a 2x3 factorial arrangement, consisting of two rubber tree clones (PB 312 and RRIM 600) and three management strategies (organomineral fertilizer with poultry litter, pigeon pea as green manure, and mechanical mowing-brushcutter). Physical attributes such as soil density, soil penetration resistance, soil moisture and aggregation, soil fertility, and tree development were analyzed. Statistical analyses of variance and Tukey test were carried out in order to compare the dendrometric data and physical and chemical attributes of the soil under the different treatments applied in the inter-row of rubber trees. No significant statistical differences were found among treatments and between clones in relation to soil physical attributes. However, the soil pH reduced the use of organomineral fertilizer and the clone RRIM 600 had the highest heights.

AB  - The study was carried out to determine the natural regeneration of four species of mangroves along with estimation of physico-chemical characteristics of sediment and water from seven sites of mangroves in the southern Gulf of Kachchh. Spatial variation of different parameters of water and sediment investigated were: water-pH (7.87-8.04); Salinity (37.07-39.42 ppt); Nitrate (1.21-2.71 ppm); Nitrite (0.03-0.08 ppm); Phosphate (0.39-0.95 ppm) and sediment-pH (7.39-7.61); Bulk density (0.36-0.54 g/cc); Particle density (1.19-1.68 g/cc); Organic carbon (0.77-1.05%), and Organic matter (1.06-1.71%). The density (recruit/sq. m) of natural recruitment of four mangrove species was in order of Avicennia marina > Ceriops tagal > Aegiceras corniculatum > Rhizophora mucronata. Cluster analysis grouped seven sites in three major clusters i.e. Group A (Poshitra & Khi-jadiya -91% similarity); Group B (Dedeka-Mundeka, Kalubhar & Pirotan- 94% similarity) and Group C (Sikka & Jodiya- 93% similarity) whereas Non-metric multidimensional scaling showed formation of two groups (Coastal and Islands) depending on the environmental conditions and mangrove natural regeneration. Principal component analysis showed the number of parameters such as salinity, texture and organic carbon which affects the natural regeneration of mangrove species in the study area.

AB  - Ongoing climate warming threatens the survival of bogs at the warm/dry limit of their distribution (e.g. in central Europe), and jeopardises the restoration of damaged bogs even more. Because vegetation changes can be slow, early indicators of hydrological change such as testate amoebae are useful. We used testate amoeba community structure and community weighted mean of functional traits to monitor the impact of two very hot and dry summers on a small (around 100 m(2)) artificial peatland constructed in the botanic garden of Neuchatel, Switzerland. We collected analogous samples in a naturally regenerating cutover peatland at 1000 m a.s.l. in the Jura Mountains as a reference. The comparison of living and dead assemblages in the botanic garden showed an increased representation of smaller testate amoeba taxa (Corythion dubium, small Euglypha sp.) with a small pseudostome (indicative of dry conditions) and a loss of mixotrophy in 2015, followed by a weaker further shift in 2016. Nevertheless, the testate amoeba community structure in 2016 still indicated a dry Sphagnum bog. Testate amoeba analysis allows rapid assessment of peatland health and/or restoration success. The comparison of living and dead assemblages makes it possible to observe changes within a season in a single sampling campaign.

AB  - The patterns and mechanisms underlying the genetic structure of microbial populations remain unresolved. Herein we investigated the role played by two non-mutually exclusive models (i.e. isolation by distance and isolation by environment) in shaping the genetic structure of lacustrine populations of a microalga (a freshwater Bathycoccaceae) in the Argentinean Patagonia. To our knowledge, this was the first study to investigate the genetic population structure in a South American microorganism. Population-level analyses based on ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 sequences revealed high levels of nucleotide and haplotype diversity within and among populations. Fixation index and a spatially explicit Bayesian analysis confirmed the occurrence of genetically distinct microalga populations in Patagonia. Isolation by distance and isolation by environment accounted for 38.5% and 17.7% of the genetic structure observed, respectively, whereas together these models accounted for 41% of the genetic differentiation. While our results highlighted isolation by distance and isolation by environment as important mechanisms in driving the genetic population structure of the microalga studied, none of these models (either alone or together) could explain the entire genetic differentiation observed. The unexplained variation in the genetic differentiation observed could be the result of founder events combined with rapid local adaptations, as proposed by the monopolisation hypothesis.

AB  - This study investigates the socio-ecological system dominated by pasture land in Asteroussia Mountains (Crete, Greece) between 1950 and 2010 with the aim to identify changes in the most relevant system's attributes, as a contribution to the study of land degradation from the resilience perspective. The analysis of 10 system indicators identifies two time periods (1950 - mid 1980s and mid 1980s - 2010) characterized by distinct relations between system's components. The grazing system was sustainable in the former time period being satisfactorily managed with moderately-low soil erosion rates despite adverse soil, topographic and climate conditions. Larger land patches have experienced better system's performance than smaller patches. The latter time interval was characterized by landscape fragmentation which has impacted negatively the stability of the overall system. A continuous growth in livestock density was observed in the study period determining high soil erosion rates, loss in plant productivity and a general over-exploitation of natural resources. A significant increase in desertification risk and a parallel decrease of ecological resilience were observed in the last time interval. The contrasting spatial patterns of system's indicators - possibly associated with different responses to land degradation - can be considered in the design of mitigation strategies addressing climate change and socioeconomic vulnerability of Mediterranean pasture land.

AB  - This work describes the effects of high temperatures and fire simulations in nature (100 degrees C for 5min) on the viability of oak genus seeds. In this work, germination of five oak seed genotypes has been studied by the standard method. The result is presented with the help of quantitative indicators of germination (technical germination, vigor).
   To study the relationship of analyzed characteristics, Two Factorial Analysis of Variance was used as well as the Fisher's Least Significant Difference Test for the significance level alpha 0,05.
   The aim of the research is to investigate the tolerance of analyzed oak seed genotypes on fires in the environment, which is important both for natural regeneration and for seedling production. Both analyzes show differences between the two genotypes in germination of acorns, and the significant influence of the applied treatment. Also, differences between the genotypes in terms of reaction on the high-temperature treatment are very clear, emphasizing the genotype 2 (close to 50% of technical germination after treatment). Comparison of thermally untreated and treated seed shows differences between genotypes. Generally speaking, oak acorns showed sensitivity on the heat treatment (100 degrees C for 5min) regarding germination. Low germination of oak seed exposed to stressful conditions reduces its potential for natural spreading in the forest environment. These results are important for further research of oak seed tolerance on fires in the environment.

AB  - Globally, there is a growing awareness that geographically isolated wetlands contribute to important landscape functions and ecological services. One of their most important functions is providing habitat to a diverse fauna and flora adapted to variable wet and dry environments. We focus on analysis of similarities among three distinct taxa, vascular plants, aquatic beetles, and amphibians, in isolated wetlands in the southeastern coastal plain of Georgia. Although species richness for these three taxa is quite high in isolated wetlands at a regional scale, we found a low degree of congruence in species richness and species composition among taxa. This finding demonstrates that none of these groups could be used as a surrogate for the overall biodiversity of these wetlands represented by the three taxa. We identified environmental factors influencing the complex patterns of species richness and distribution for the three groups that indicate biotic and abiotic processes operate at different scales for each taxonomic group and for individual species. Our study illustrates the importance of considering structural diversity, hydrologic variation, and landscape position as key elements to understanding overall diversity represented by the three taxa in isolated wetlands and in developing assessment tools of wetland condition.

AB  - A microcosm experiment was carried out in order to test the effect of the herbicide metolachlor on river periphytic diatoms and to find potential diatom bioindicators of contamination. Effects were investigated at different biological organization levels (biofilm, diatom community, population and individual levels). The colonization of glass substrates by natural biofilm in artificial streams did not vary quantitatively between control and contaminated conditions (5 and 30 mu g.L-1). However, non-parametric multivariate analysis of variance revealed a significant difference between contaminated and control diatom communities with regard to species composition. The difference was due to the greater development of probably tolerant species in the presence of the herbicide (e. g., Planothidium frequentissimum, Planothidium lanceolatum, Amphora montana, Surirella brebissonii and Nitzschia gracilis). An increase in the occurrence of abnormal forms was observed in relation to metolachlor concentration. In particular, up to 8% of the frustules of the species Surirella angusta exhibited prominent deformities. Monospecific acute toxicity tests were then performed on two species to estimate toxicity parameters based on growth inhibition. These tests also confirmed the teratogenic effect of the herbicide on S. angusta. This study shows that low concentrations of metolachlor in natural streams may significantly alter diatom community structure and that abnormal diatom forms should be taken into account in water contamination assessment.

AB  - Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is one of the most common detected antibiotics in the environment. In order to study whether SMX can affect behavior and growth and whether these effects could be transferred to the progeny, Caenorhabditis elegans was exposed at environmentally relevant concentrations for 24, 48, 72 and 96 hr, respectively. After exposure, the exposed parent generation (P-0) was measured for behavior and growth indicators, which were presented as percentage of controls (POC). Then their corresponding unexposed progeny (F-1) was separated and measured for the same indicators. The lowest POC for P-0 after 96 hr-exposure at 100 mg/L were 37.8%, 12.7%, 45.8% and 70.1% for body bending frequency (BBF), reversal movement (RM), Omega turns (OT) and body length (BL), respectively. And F-1 suffered defects with the lowest POC as 55.8%, 24.1%, 48.5% and 60.7% for BBF, RM, OT and BL, respectively. Defects in both P-0 and F-1 showed a time- and concentration-dependent fashion and behavior indicators showed better sensitivity than growth indicator. The observed effects on F-1 demonstrated the transferable properties of SMX. Defects of SMX at environmental concentrations suggested that it is necessary to perform further systematical studies on its ecological risk in actual conditions.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is an indicator of ecosystem quality and plays a major role in the biogeochemical cycles of major nutrients and water Shortcomings exist to estimate SOC across large regions using rapid and cheap sod sensing approaches Our objective was to estimate SOC in 7120 mineral and organic soil horizons in Florida using visible/near-infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (VNIRS) calibrated by COMM nice trees and partial least squares regression (PLSR2) The derived VNIRS models were validated using independent datasets and explained up to 71 and 38% of the variance of SOC in mineral and organic horizons, respectively We stratified the mineral horizons into seven soil orders and derived PLSR models for each order, which explained from 32% (Histosols) to 75% (Ultisols) of the variance of SOC concentration in validation mode Estimates of SOC from all models were highly scattered along the regression lines, especially for high SOC values, and the slopes of the regression lines were generally <1 because VNIRS models tended to underestimate high SOC values and overestimate low SOC Despite the great scatter of estimates in the prediction plots, VNIRS models had reasonable explanatory power for mineral horizons. given the heterogeneity of soils and environmental conditions in Florida, and have potential for the rapid assessment of SOC, with implications for regional SOC assessments, modeling, and monitoring However, VNIRS models for organic horizons were hampered by small sample size and had very limited explanatory power

AB  - The response of the taxonomic structure of algal assemblages, several trophic and saprobic indices and taxa richness to environmental gradients was investigated in small suburban streams with high organic and trophic load. Gradients of nutrient richness, electrical conductivity and substratum (a gradient from muddy to stony substratum) were considered. Although all the gradients explained a significant portion of variance in the taxonomic structure of algal assemblages, the gradient of nutrient richness was the most important. Contrary to our expectations, trophic indices responded well neither to the gradient of nutrient richness nor electrical conductivity; only TIDIA weakly correlated with nutrient richness, while TI with the substratum gradient, which probably reflected prevailing hydraulic conditions. This was most probably caused by the shortness of the nutrient richness gradient in the heavily polluted studied streams, and by the fact that the indices were primarily set up to distinguish between low and high trophic levels, instead of distinguishing between high and yet higher trophic levels. On the other hand, algal taxa richness reflected quite strongly an additive effect of nutrient richness and electrical conductivity and was identified as a parameter, which might be helpful in identification of streams (sites) of the worst ecological quality which require priority restoration measures. We also suggest that the algal taxa richness should be tested for its performance in extreme parts of other environmental gradients.

AB  - LAS (Linear Alkylbenzene Sulphonate) shows relatively high aquatic toxicity in hard freshwater or seawater. In this paper, we studied the effect of adsorbent on the aquatic toxicity of LAS in hard freshwater and seawater. Daphnia magna and Artemia salina were used for acute aquatic toxicity test in freshwater and seawater, respectively. Kaolin was used as a model adsorbent and toxic surface tension (gamma(tox)) was used as an indicator of toxic condition. Results showed that the values of gamma(tox) of LAS to D. magna and A. salina were about 45-55 mN/m and 35-40 mN/m, respectively. Surface tension of LAS solution decreased and its aquatic toxicity increased with increasing the water hardness or the salinity. By adding adsorbent into the solutions, the surface activity and the aquatic toxicity were decreased greatly, and the effect of water hardness or salinity on surface tension and aquatic toxicity were removed. That is to say, the surface tension curve of soft freshwater corresponds with that of hard freshwater containing adsorbent and the surface tension curve at low salinity corresponds with that obtained for high salinity solutions containing the adsorbent. Therefore, our experimental data leads to the conclusion that the relatively high aquatic toxicity of LAS in concentrated solution of inorganic salts disappears in the presence of adsorbents. This is an important viewpoint in conducting environmental risk assessment of surfactants.

AB  - Uncontrolled dredging in complex environments such as barrier island systems can produce major changes in inlet conditions, current circulations patterns and modify channel margins, leading to silting or erosion. This paper presents a study of the evolution of Faro Channel between 1927 and 2001, in the Ria Formosa barrier island system, taking into account the natural evolution and the impacts of dredging operations. Faro Channel, the only navigable channel providing access to Faro Harbour, is the largest inside the Ria Formosa and the most hydraulically efficient. An inlet was opened east of Faro Channel, and has forced a channel migration trend toward the east (axis and margins). Analysis of the evolution of the channel (width and axis) as well as the surrounding marsh areas was made. Results shows that the channel runs preferentially to the east and the axis displacement is being amplified by the intense dredge operations (specially after 1985 until present), resulting in loss of marsh areas in some areas. The continuous over exploitation of the channel could lead to its continuous deepening and can have consequences such as changing current circulation patterns and creating pronounced irregularities along the channel or loss of margins, as the channel is trying to achieve its natural equilibrium. This can not only affect the entire backbarrier area, but also cause significant problems for navigation security.

AB  - The disposal of radioactive wastes in Arctic seas has made it important to understand the processes affecting the accumulation of radionuclides in food webs in coldwater ecosystems. We examined the effects of temperature on radionuclide assimilation and retention by the bioindicator bivalve Macoma balthica using three representative nuclear waste components, (241)Am, (57)Co, and (137)Cs. Experiments were designed to determine the kinetics of processes that control uptake from food and water, as well as kinetic constants of loss. (137)Cs was not accumulated in soft tissue from water during short exposures, and was rapidly lost from shell with no thermal dependence. No effects of temperature on (57)Co assimilation or retention from food were observed. The only substantial effect of polar temperatures was that on the assimilation efficiency of (241)Am from food, where 10% was assimilated at 2 degrees C and 26% at 12 degrees C, For all three radionuclides, body distributions were correlated with source, with most radioactivity obtained from water found in the shell and food in the soft tissues. These results suggest that in general Arctic conditions had relatively small effects on the biological processes which influence the bioaccumulation of radioactive wastes, and bivalve concentration factors may not be appreciably different between polar and temperate waters.

AB  - A study was conducted to evaluate the use of volatile organic microbial metabolites, particularly geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol, as indicators of activity of specific groups of microorganisms (actinomycetes, bacteria, or fungi) in soil. Substrates and selective antibiotics were added to soil microcosms to establish different soil microbial communities; volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the headspace atmosphere of the microcosms were collected by purge-and-trap methods and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Treatments differed in total amount of VOCs produced, numbers and kinds of VOCs detected, and in temporal patterns of VOC production. The greatest total amount of VOCs and largest number of different VOCs were produced in the treatment with greatest actinomycetal and bacterial activity, followed by the treatment dominated by fungal activity. Geosmin was occasionally detected in small amounts but only in microcosms with substantial activity of all three groups of microorganisms (actinomycetes, bacteria, and fungi). 2-Methylisoborneol was regularly detected in significant amounts but only in the treatment dominated by actinomycetes and bacteria. Terpenes were the VOCs produced in greatest quantity in the treatment with the most fungal activity. Results indicate that VOCs from soil may provide information as to the nature of the soil microbial community; however, relating the structure of the microbial community to soil VOC emissions is complicated because VOCs present in natural soils may be derived from a variety of sources and their production is strongly influenced by environmental conditions.

AB  - A survey of the natural mycorrhizal potential has been carried out in a representative area of a desertified semiarid ecosystem in the southeast of Spain, Many indigenous plants from the field site were mycorrhizal, including the dominant Anthyllis cytisoides, which had high levels of colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), Low numbers of AMF spores were present in the soil, although a range of species, including Scutellospora calospora, Glomus coronatum, Glomus constrictum, and several Acaulospora species, was represented, Soil infectivities, as determined by a soil dilution method; were similar for most plants tested but were significantly lower for Anthyllis cytisoides. Nevertheless, when a less disruptive method to determine soil infectivity was used, the importance of the mycelial network in maintaining the infectivity of soil under perennial shrubs, such as Anthyllis cytisoides, was highlighted, Seasonal variations in the mycorrhizal infectivity showed that it was higher towards the end of the summer period than in midwinter. In screening trials in a greenhouse, the indigenous AMF did not significantly improve the growth of plants compared with that of noninoculated controls, Augmentation of the soil with an inoculum of Glomus intraradices resulted in improved growth of Anthyllis cytisoides in both sterile and nonsterile conditions, in contrast to results obtained following inoculation with Glomus mosseae or another Glomus sp, Our findings suggest that the indigenous inoculum levels of AMF are inadequate to support an extensive revegetation program in the absence of an additional mycorrhizal inoculum.

LA  - Czech
AB  - Influence on betaine content in leaves and roots of selected sugar beet varieties, of various application of biologically active agents during the years with various climatic conditions, 1993 and 1994, was investigated in the small plot trials in Uhrineves. The agents were growth stimulators Rastim, Atonik, synthetic cytokinin and bioalginate. The average betaine content in dry substance of leaves in the tested variants was in 1993 3,44% and in 1994 5,73%. The roots contained in 1993 2,18% and in 1994 1,77% betaine in dry substance in average of all the variants. The differences of Letaine content among the varieties were higher than among the different amounts of agents applied and mostly were statistically little conclusive. The relatively lowest betaine content was found in the leaves and roots in both years in the variety Ibis and the highest in the leaves of the variety Edda and roots of variety Petra. In 1993 the most decrease of betaine in the leaves and roots appeared after the application of Atonik and in 1994 the most increase in the leaves and roots was found after the spring application of cytokinin. In 1993 the negative correlation was proved of the yield of foliage and roots on the betaine level in leaves and roots. The anticipation was confirmed that betaine content may be a suitable additional indicator of ecological influence on sugar beet yield and quality.

AB  - Lacustrine organic-rich shales are well developed within the Eocene Dongying Depression in the Bohai Bay Basin in eastern China and across Southeast Asia. Understanding the sedimentation of these shales is essential to the study of depositional processes, paleo-environment, and paleoclimate reconstruction. This study investigates the sedimentary characteristics and formation mechanisms of lacustrine shales in the upper fourth member of the Eocene Shahejie Formation (Es4s) within the Dongying Depression based on thin sections and field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) observations of well cores combined with X-ray diffraction and geochemical indicators. Six litho-facies were identified: (1) laminated calcareous mudstone, (2) laminated dolomitic mudstone, (3) laminated clay mudstone, (4) laminated gypsum mudstone, (5) massive mudstone, and (6) siltstone. The organic matter in the Es4s shale is mainly type I and type II kerogens, as well as a small proportion of type III kerogen. On the basis of lithofacies associations, paleosalinity values, redox properties, and terrigenous inputs, the lower Es4s shale can be divided into six intervals from bottom to top, numbered I, II, III, IV, V, and VI. The thickness of each interval ranges from several meters to more than 10 m, reflecting high-frequency oscillations in the environment of the lake basin, markedly different from a relatively stable marine environment.
   The laminated mudstones are characterized by fine grain sizes, scarce large terrigenous debris (quartz and feldspar), and compositions that are rich in pyrite and sapropelic organic matter. These features indicate that these lithofacies were deposited out of suspension in a quiet water body characterized by a relatively low rate of deposition. The characteristic laminae of these lithofacies indicate subtle differences in depositional processes. The laminated gypsum mudstone was likely deposited in an evaporative environment, because its formation would have consumed Ca2+ and SO42-, promoting the deposition of a laminated dolomitic mudstone. In contrast, laminated clay mudstone was deposited in a manner that increased the volume of small terrigenous materials. Deposition of this lithofacies was controlled by the nature of the water body, paleoclimate, and terrigenous inputs. Laminated mudstones are dominant in the lower Es4s shale, suggesting that suspension was the main depositional process leading to formation of the lower Es4s shale. In contrast, the massive mudstones were likely rapidly deposited associated with siltstone as the result of fine-grained turbidites. The lower Es4s shale was formed in a depositional environment composed of a saline, medium-depth lake under anoxic conditions, with limited terrigenous inputs. The depositional process included suspension and turbidity currents. The high salinity is suggested to be related to a marine transgression, which may have been facilitated by a rise in sea level caused by global warming in the early Eocene, together with the large-scale tectonic activity of East Asia. Seawater input affected the lithofacies, influenced lake water body conditions, triggered turbidity currents, and prompted the accumulation of organic matter. The deposition of the Es4s shale in the Dongying Depression may help us to understand the deposition of lacustrine shale, paleoclimate reconstructions for the Eocene, and the tectonic activity of East Asia.

Parameters of the humus group composition, optical densities of solutions of humic acids, pool of chlorophyll, lipids, fatty acids, and lignin phenols together with the isotopic composition of organic carbon and soil age are suggested as promising biomarkers for paleoecological studies.

AB  - Glycoproteins are a large family of proteins which have great biological and clinical importance including molecular recognition, signal transduction, cell adhesion and immune response. Many glycoproteins are important biomarkers for disease diagnosis and as therapeutic targets. However, glycoproteins are present in very low abundance in the body and coexist alongside interfering species present at much higher abundance. So, specific recognition of glycoproteins is of great significance. Although antibodies are commonly used to solve this issue, they are associated with some apparent drawbacks, such as, difficult to prepare, poor storage stability, high cost and requiring harsh conditions for target release. Therefore, novel alternatives are highly desirable. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), which are synthesized through polymerization in the presence of a template, exhibit specific binding towards the template molecules. A series of molecular imprinting approaches have been developed to produce glycoprotein-specific MIPs. Boronic acids can covalently bind cis-diol groups of cis-diol-containing compounds like glycoproteins and glycopeptides, to form stable five-or six-membered cyclic esters at relatively high pH values. The esters dissociate reversibly when the pH of the environment is made acidic. In recent years, our group has developed a series of boronate affinity molecular imprinting techniques for specific recognition of glycoproteins, especially boronate affinity controllable-oriented surface imprinting method. Based on silane hydrolysis in alcohol phase, this method permits getting the desired thickness of the imprinting layer according to the size of the template molecules. The method allows for easy and efficient preparation of MIPs specific to glycoproteins, glycans, and monosaccharides, enabling promising applications. Recently, we can even achieve precision imprinting of glycopeptides for the facile preparation of glycan-specific MIPs. However, the molecular imprinting of intact proteins in organic phase often results in the denature of the template proteins while imprinting approaches using glycans as the templates require relatively tedious glycan preparation procedure. Herein, we developed a new approach for imprinting in organic phase using an intact target glycoprotein as a semi-template. This method allowed for the imprinting of only the glycans on the target glycoprotein, without worrying about possible denature of the target protein in organic phase. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which is a glycoprotein enzyme that has been routinely used as an indicator for several diseases in clinical tests, was used as the target. ALP-specific molecularly imprinted magnetic nanoparticles (MI-MNPs) were prepared using this method. By using boronic acid-functionalized MNPs as the nanocores, the target molecules were immobilized onto the nanocores via boronate affinity. Then, a thin-layer of silica was controllably formed to cover the templates to an appropriate thickness through polycondensation of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) in ethanol. After that, the templates are removed facilely by washing with an acidic solution to disrupt the boronate affinity interaction. The prepared MIPs exhibited good specificity towards ALP, and this characteristic was preserved even in a complicated real sample. The developed approach exhibited high imprinting efficiency. It overcame the limitations of previous imprinting approaches. Also, the MI-MIPs synthesized in this work were simple to prepare, stable, cost-efficient and easy to collect.
   Besides, the target release just needed gentle conditions. It can be a promising means to produce glycoprotein-specific MIPs for important applications such as affinity separation and disease diagnosis.

AB  - The assessment of variations and the reconstruction of palaeoclimate, based on the distribution of n-alkanes and stable carbon isotope data, during early Palaeogene have been made on the Barsingsar lignite-bearing sequence associated with Palana Formation (Bikaner-Nagaur basin). The distribution pattern of various n-alkanes and the derived indices/ratios have widely been used as palaeoclimate indicators in several depositional realms. The distribution of n-alkanes in the studied sequence varies from C-13 to C-34. The values of calculated n-alkane parameters range from 26.20-28.39 (aliphatic chain length (ACL) index); 0.32-7.21 (low-to-higher molecular weight (L/H) ratio); 0.42-0.85 (Proxy wax (P-wax)); 0.20-0.67 (Proxy aqueous (P-aq)); 0.28-5.22 (terrigenous/aquatic ratio (TAR)); 0.16-0.79 (C-23/C-29 ratio); 1.14-6.31 (C-27/C-31 ratio) and 1.47-7.02 (C-29/C-31 ratio). The delta C-13 varies from -24.8 to -26.1 parts per thousand and the TOC varies from 9.6 to 69.5 wt.%. All these variations indicate the changes in palaeoclimate from dry and warm to cool and wet conditions during the deposition of this lignite-bearing sequence. Further, it is also suggested that the climatic condition was cooler than that of the Palaeocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) event.

AB  - The demand for water withdrawal continues to increase worldwide. These water withdrawals from rivers can affect fish habitat and aquatic life. As such, environmental flow assessment methods are used in order to protect rivers against excessive water withdrawals. The concept of environmental flow relates to the quantity of water required in rivers to sustain an acceptable level of living conditions for aquatic biota at various phases of their development. For many agencies, environmental flow methods are essential in environmental impact assessments and in the protection of important fisheries resources. The present study deals with the evaluation of hydrologically based environmental flow methods within the Maritime Province of Canada. In total, six hydrologically based environmental flow methods were compared using data from 52 hydrometric stations across the region. Some methods provided adequate environmental flow protection (e.g. 25% mean annual flow and Q(50) flow duration method); however, other methods did not provide adequate flow protection (e.g. Q(90) flow duration method and 7Q10 and 7Q2 low-flow frequency). The 70% Q(50) method provided adequate flow protection only under good baseflow conditions and should be applied with extreme caution. The present study shows the importance of the hydrologic flow regime, particularly as it pertains to the baseflow component, as a significant determinant in the level of instream flow protection.

AB  - Intestinal parasitic diseases are widely spread in the world, with the highest prevalence in developing countries. Children are mainly affected, showing a decrease in physical and mental development, as well as the expected manifestations of the disease. This situation can be greatly enhanced in children with poor nutritional status. The World Health Organization considers intestinal parasitic diseases a major cause of morbidity, closely linked to poverty and poor personal hygiene, inappropriate handling of raw food, lack of sanitation, lack of potable water supply, and environmental fecal contamination.
   Some parasitic diseases are cosmopolitan while others have variable geographic distribution, due to different factors such as the presence of exclusive intermediate hosts. In the past few years, globalization allowed the spread of certain parasites from endemic to non-endemic regions. Even though people's customs influence on the frequency of certain parasites, environmental conditions are a determinant factor for parasite survival. In our country, due to the variety of soils and climatic conditions, several causative agents of these parasitoses can be found.
   The aim of this work was to review the literature on the intestinal parasitic agents found in Argentina in human fecal samples and its environment, as parasitic contamination constitutes a direct indicator of the infection risk by intestinal parasites.

AB  - This paper presents a field-study of real pesticide application conditions in a vineyard. The objective was to measure the exposure, the transfer and the effects of pesticides on a non-target soil invertebrate, the land snail Helix aspersa. There was no drift of the herbicides (glyphosate and glufosinate) whereas the fungicides (cymoxanil, folpet, tebuconazole and pyraclostrobin) were detected up to 20 m from the treated area. For folpet and particularly tebuconazole, spray deposits on soil (corresponding to losses for the intended target i.e. the vine leaves) were high (41.1% and 88.8% loss of applied dose, respectively). For herbicides, the target was the soil and losses (percentage of compounds which did not reach the soil) were of 22% for glufosinate and 52% for glyphosate. In the study plot, glyphosate was transferred to and accumulated in snail tissues (4 mg kg(-1) dry weight, dw), as was its metabolite AMPA (8 mg kg(-1) dw) which could be in relation with the reduced growth observed in snails. No effects on snail survival or growth were found after exposure to the other organic compounds or to copper and sulphur-fungicides, although transfer of tebuconazole, pyraclostrobin and copper occurred. This study brings original field data on the fate of pesticides in a vineyard agro-ecosystem under real conditions of application and shows that transfer and effects of pesticides to a non-target organism occurred.

AB  - Twenty-one cabbage (Brassica oleracea capitata group) varieties, including 16 local varieties and five commercial hybrids, were screened for resistance to the moth Mamestra brassicae L. under natural and artificial conditions in northwestern Spain. Resistance was assessed as the proportion of damaged plants and damaged leaves, leaf feeding injury, and number of larvae present. Correlation coefficients among damage traits showed that a visual scale (general appearance rating) should be a useful indicator of resistance. Most local varieties were highly susceptible to M. brassicae, whereas the commercial hybrids tested were resistant in terms of head foliage consumption and number of larvae per plant. Performance of varieties was similar under natural and artificial infestation although some of them performed differently at each year. Three local varieties (MBG-BRS0057, MBG-BRS0074, and MBG-BRS0452) were highly susceptible at both natural and artificial infestation conditions being MBG-BRS0074 the most damaged variety. Two local varieties (MBG-BRS0402 and MBG-BRS0535) and commercial hybrids were identified as resistant or moderately resistant to M. brassicae. Among them, 'Corazon de Buey' and 'Cabeza negra' were the most resistant and produced compact heads. These varieties could be useful sources of resistance to obtain resistant varieties to M. brassicae or as donors of resistance to other Brassica crops. The possible role of leaf traits, head compactness, and leaf glucosinolate content in relation to M. brassicae resistance is discussed.

AB  - We relate changes in diatom assemblages to Holocene climate since ca. 10 300 cal. years BP at a small (4 ha), alkaline, alpine tundra lake in the Rocky Mountains of northeast British Columbia. A complex of small benthic Fragilaria-type taxa generally dominated the fossil diatom communities reflecting shallow, alkaline, and likely low light conditions resulting from minerogenic turbidity or extensive ice cover throughout the Holocene. Shifts in diatom assemblages occurred with changes in local vegetation, inferred from pollen and stomate records, and shifts in charcoal-inferred fire frequency (e.g., lowering of tree line and reduced fire frequency (approx. 7500 cal. years BP) and establishment of modern alpine tundra (approx. 3500 cal. years BP). Importantly, striking changes in diatom communities (e.g., during the mid-Holocene (approx. 5500 to approx. 3500 cal. years BP) and Medieval Warm Period (approx. AD 800 to approx. AD 1250)) occurred without evidence of vegetation shifts. During these times, diverse periphytic diatoms dominated suggesting improved benthic habitat availability with longer growing seasons and probably reduced alkalinity and turbidity with warmer- and wetter-than-present climates. Diatom analysis from this alpine lake provides a sensitive record of climate-related limnological responses, but also refines our previous understanding of Holocene climate changes in the northern Rocky Mountains inferred from terrestrial-based paleoecological records.

AB  - A new stable and accurate, finite-difference 2D elastic seismic wave propagation modeling algorithm is developed, with a Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) absorbing boundary condition to avoid reflections from the edges of the numerical model. This is used to study the interaction of seismic surface waves with near-surface heterogeneities. The effects of different empty cavity shapes and depths and altered zones is evaluated from the direct and diffracted seismograms and corresponding Rayleigh wave dispersion images. Differential seismograms calculated for models both with and without a cavity show a complex, non-symmetrical, diffraction pattern and their dispersion images show well-localized scattering from heterogeneities. Missing coherent energy appears in specific frequency bands, related to the cavity depth, shape and degree of modification of the surrounding medium.
   The cavity more strongly affects seismograrns when it is shallower. A 2-m deep rectangular cavity generates more severe perturbations than a circular section, due to non-symmetrical back-scattered patterns recognized in dispersion images. Furthermore, low velocity zones around and above the cavity, due to soil alteration, trap waves and lead to increased ground roll attenuation and strong footprints in dispersion images that can possibly mask the cavity signature. If the altered zone extends to the surface as a cone, trapping phenomena completely dominate seismograms. The detection of altered zones is a very useful indication in natural hazard assessment, making it possible to distinguish the signature of a 'safe' cavity from a potentially dangerous one.

AB  - Marine fish farms cause environmental disturbance of sediment due to uneaten food and fish faeces that accumulate on the sea bottom. These products give rise to organic enrichment followed by degradation processes; reduction of level of dissolved oxygen in the bottom water; generation of high levels of sulfides; changes of benthic assemblages and even azoic conditions. The soft bottom benthic communities and, above all, the polychaetes are considered good indicators of environmental perturbations considering their relatively fast changes in diversity and abundance and because their trophic flexibility and life-history traits are considered a pre-adaptation to the condition of disturbed habitats. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the polychaete population changes as a result of organic enrichment produced by a marine fish farm. The study was carried out on a fish farm located in the coastal water of Porto Ercole ( Tyrrhenian Sea) with two submersible sea cages and a year production of 180 tonnes. The macrobenthos samples were collected during four campaigns ( July and December 2001, May and October 2002). The results showed: 1) a rapid change of the assemblage located beneath the cages related to the fish biomass reared and a high dominance of the opportunistic Capitella spp.; 2) limited sediment disturbance close to cages ( 20 - 50 m); 3) no effect in the area 50 m beyond the cages. Two months after the fish harvest and thus reduction of organic enrichment, perturbated assemblages showed signals of recovery like species richness increase and reduction of opportunistic species.

TI  - Case-control study of early-term abortions (early fetal losses) associated with mare reproductive loss syndrome in central Kentucky
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
LA  - English
AB  - Objective-To identify factors associated with abortions during early gestation classified as mare reproductive loss syndrome (MRLS).
   Design-Case-control study.
   Animals-324 broodmares from 43 farms in central Kentucky, including 121 mares from 25 farms that had early-term abortions (ETAs) associated with MRLS (case horses), 120 mares from the same farms but that did not abort, and 83 mares from 18 farms that were not severely impacted by MRLS.
   Procedure-Farm managers were interviewed to obtain data on various management practices and environmental exposures for the mares. Data for case and control horses were compared to identify risk factors for mares having MRLS-associated ETAs.
   Results-Several factors increased the risk of MRLS-associated ETAs, including feeding hay in pasture, greater than usual amounts of white clover in pastures, more eastern tent caterpillars in pastures, abortion during a previous pregnancy, and sighting deer or elk on the premises.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Analysis indicates that certain characteristics of pastures predisposed mares to MRLS-associated ETAs. Methods for limiting exposure to pasture (keeping mares in stalls longer) during environmental conditions similar to those of 2001 lie, sudden freezing in mid-April following warmer-than-usual springtime temperatures and larger-than-usual numbers of eastern tent caterpillars in and around pastures should reduce the risk of mares having MRLS-associatecl ETAs. It was not possible to determine whether exposure to white clover or caterpillars were causal factors for MRLS or were merely indicators of unusual environmental conditions that resulted in exposure of mares to a toxic or infectious agent.

AB  - Microplastics (<5 mm) ingested by species at the base of food webs are potentially biotransferred to higher trophic levels (and to other compartments in the oceans, e.g. nekton). Therefore, assessing microplastic pollution at lower trophic levels, such as the benthic fauna, can help elucidate scenarios that include sediments, which tend to be increasingly contaminated by microplastics over time. Sixty-seven articles (1990 to 2019) were selected and analysed in this critical review. Eighty percent were published within recent years, showing that interest in the topic continues to grow. The majority (60%) of the studies were done in the laboratory under controlled conditions, and there are few reports of realistic microplastic exposure concentrations and the conditions under which interactions with the biota occur. Many different units of measurement have been used in the ingestion studies, impairing comparisons. Molluscs are the most widely studied group due to easy access, handling, rearing, and food safety concerns. Toxicity, biochemical, and physical effects of the uptake of microplastics by benthic species are seldom reported. Most works are concerned with the presence of microplastics in gut contents or gills. It is now important to collect information to identify animal models that can serve as bioindicators for microplastic pollution to help protect the environment and the quality of human food.

AB  - Soft robots are considered intrinsically safe with regard to human-robot interaction. This has motivated the development and investigation of soft medical robots, such as soft robotic gloves for stroke rehabilitation. However, the output force of conventional purely soft actuators is usually limited. This restricts their application in stroke rehabilitation, which requires a large force and bidirectional movement. In addition, accurate control of soft actuators is difficult owing to the nonlinearity of purely soft actuators. In this study, a soft robotic glove is designed based on a soft-elastic composite actuator (SECA) that integrates an elastic torque compensating layer to increase the output force as well as achieving bidirectional movement. Such a hybrid design also significantly reduces the degree of nonlinearity compared with a purely soft actuator. A model-based online learning and adaptive control algorithm is proposed for the wearable soft robotic glove, taking its interaction environment into account, namely, the human hand/finger. The designed hybrid controller enables the soft robotic glove to adapt to different hand conditions for reference tracking. Experimental results show that satisfactory tracking performance can be achieved on both healthy subjects and stroke subjects (with the tracking root mean square error (RMSE) < 0.05 rad). Meanwhile, the controller can output an actuator-finger model for each individual subject (with the learning error RMSE < 0.06 rad), which provides information on the condition of the finger and, thus, has further potential clinical application.

AB  - The work presents analysis of chemical condition of the water of the River Bug stretch extending from Kirylowo to Krzyszew. The analysis was preformed based on data of monitoring of surface water quality available on the website of Voivodeship Inspectorate of Environmental Protection in Lublin (WIOS) spanning the years 2015-2017. Eight measurement points and the following months were considered: February, April, June, August, October and December. Analysis of variance and Kruskal-Wallis test were used to analyse the effect of localities and months on selected chemical indicators. The concentrations of nearly all the parameters (excluding BOD) were found to be influenced by the localities. Phosphorus content, sulphates and chlorides increased along the course of the river. Also, the analysis revealed that the concentration of ammonium ions, dissolved oxygen, sulphates and chlorides increased in winter. Multidimensional analysis demonstrated that differences in chemical conditions between the localities were predominantly due to nitrogen compound content, total phosphorus content and chlorides. Cluster analysis showed that in nearly all the months (excluding August) the tested stretch of the River Bug could be divided into two parts with different chemical composition parameters. The first part, characterised by higher average values of ammonium nitrogen content, dissolved oxygen content and total phosphorus content, included the following measurement points: Krzyszew, Kukuryki, Wlodawa and Kuzawka. The second part was formed by the following localities: Krylow, Zosin and Horodlo, all with higher average BOD values, sulphates and chlorides.

AB  - Obtaining clear and true images is a basic requirement for agricultural monitoring. However, under the influence of fog, haze and other adverse weather conditions, captured images are usually blurred and distorted, resulting in the difficulty of target extraction. Traditional image dehazing methods based on image enhancement technology can cause the loss of image information and image distortion. In order to address the above-mentioned problems caused by traditional image dehazing methods, an improved image dehazing method based on dark channel prior (DCP) was proposed. By enhancing the brightness of the hazed image and processing the sky area, the dim and un-natural problems caused by traditional image dehazing algorithms were resolved. Ten different test groups were selected from different weather conditions to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, and the algorithm was compared with the commonly-used histogram equalization algorithm and the DCP method. Three image evaluation indicators including mean square error (MSE), peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), and entropy were used to evaluate the dehazing performance. Results showed that the PSNR and entropy with the proposed method increased by 21.81% and 5.71%, and MSE decreased by 40.07% compared with the original DCP method. It performed much better than the histogram equalization dehazing method with an increase of PSNR by 38.95% and entropy by 2.04% and a decrease of MSE by 84.78%. The results from this study can provide a reference for agricultural field monitoring.

AB  - A methodology for setting lake nutrient standard was proposed in this study based on review of water quality standards (WQS) in China and understanding of lake nutrient criteria. There are very few studies about lake nutrient criteria and water body classification system, which may cause difficulties in nutrient level assessment and management. This paper reviewed WQS system in the US, EU, and Japan, and then presented the development procedures for revising surface WQS in different periods in China. The amendment includes indicators, standard values, and framework of the standard system. However, current WQS set in light of the criteria and standards of the US and Europe couldn't adapt to the natural conditions of lakes in China. Therefore, by learning from the water quality criteria setting method of USA and taking the regional differences into consideration, a methodology of combining structure equation model and expert elicitation was recommended for setting WQS. Furthermore, it considered to investigate the differences (climate, elevation and geographical condition, etc.) in each region, and set lake nutrient criteria and standards on regional scale. Consequently, the proposed methodology for setting standards could be applied to each region in China. Yungui ecoregion was taken as an example for setting up the lake nutrient standards with considering TP, Chl-a, TN and CODMn, four influence factors for designated use attainment, and a suitable TP standard 0.02 mg/L was recommended by using the proposed methods.

AB  - Periparturient disease conditions affecting transition dairy cows have been recognized as a critical contributor to impaired dairy performance and have become a focal point of herd diagnostic investigations. Over the past 40 years use of blood sampling in the form of metabolic profiling has been applied to herd diagnostics with mixed impressions of diagnostic robustness. Research has greatly increased our understan ding of underpinning mechanisms related to cow biology, management, environment and their interactions responsible for peripartum diseases. Elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentration (> 1.2 mmol/l) within 7-10 days following calving identifies high risk cows for therapeutic intervention. Herd evaluations with 15-25% of first week fresh cows with elevated BHB indicates significant disease risk and productive losses. Elevated peripartal serum nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) also indicate increased disease risk. This review discusses documented (BHB, NEFA) and other potential analytes using individual or pooled samples useful for disease risk assessment or nutritional status and their application in risk-based or herd screening methods of herd metabolic profiling diagnostics. A pooled sample approach modified from the original Compton Metabolic Profile allows for more economic assessment of multiple analytes, though interpretation and herd-size application may be limited. Pooled samples between 5 and 10 individuals accurately represent arithmetic means of individuals. Most importantly metabolic profiles must be used in concert with other diagnostic metrics of animal and facility evaluations, body condition scoring and ration evaluation to be fully useful in herd evaluations.

AB  - Interest in methods that routinely and accurately measure and predict animal characteristics is growing in importance, both for quality characterization of livestock products and for genetic purposes. Mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIRS) is a rapid and cost-effective tool for recording phenotypes at the population level. Mid-infrared spectroscopy is based on crossing matter by electromagnetic radiation and on the subsequent measure of energy absorption, and it is commonly used to determine traditional milk quality traits in official milk laboratories. The aim of this review was to focus on the use of MIRS to predict new milk phenotypes of economic relevance such as fatty acid and protein composition, coagulation properties, acidity, mineral composition, ketone bodies, body energy status, and methane emissions. Analysis of the literature demonstrated the feasibility of MIRS to predict these traits, with different accuracies and with margins of improvement of prediction equations. In general, the reviewed papers underlined the influence of data variability, reference method, and unit of measurement on the development of robust models. A crucial point in favor of the application of MIRS is to stimulate the exchange of data among countries to develop equations that take into account the biological variability of the studied traits under different conditions. Due to the large variability of reference methods used for MIRS calibration, it is essential to standardize the methods used within and across countries.

AB  - Almost all the organisms possess a system to cope with the harsh physiochemical factors of environment. Such a system is based on a group of stress genes, which show rapid responses in form of stress proteins, especially heat shock proteins, when cells are confronted with insult. Heat shock proteins are now known to express in response to variety of toxic and stress conditions including diseases. As a molecular chaperone, against cytotoxicity, these ensure the functional ability of cells by repairing the denatured proteins, cellular structures like cytoskeleton and centrosomes and processes dealing with protein synthesis are stabilized or repaired during a second stress in stress tolerant cells and organisms. In unstressed cells these play an imperative role in the synthesis and transport of normal proteins. Their role in certain diseases reveals their potential application in medical field. Certain Hsp are helpful in coping carcinogenicity caused environmental pollutants and have been suggested to have anti-apoptotic, anti stress and anti-allergic function. Their expression is tissue and species specific with respect to type, intensity and duration of a toxicant. These are developmentally regulated and help in process of differentiation and thus their abnormal regulation impairs the normal development. However, their role as biomarker in risk assessment of environmental pollution warrants further research. Due to broad functional range, therefore, present review is embracing the functional aspects of smaller and Hsp70 families expressing in animals under toxic conditions.

AB  - Carbon isotope discrimination (Delta C-13) is considered a useful indicator for indirect selection of grain yield (GY) in cereals. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the genetic variation in Delta C-13 and its relationship with GY. A doubled haploid (DH) population derived from a cross of two common wheat varieties, Hanxuan 10 (H10) and Lumai 14 (L14), was phenotyped for Delta C-13 in the flag leaf, GY and yield associated traits in two trials contrasted by water availability, specifically, rain-fed and irrigated. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified by single locus and two locus QTL analyses. QTLs for Delta C-13 were located on chromosomes 1A, 2B, 3B, 5A, 7A and 7B, and QTLs for other traits on all chromosomes except 1A, 4D, 5A, 5B and 6D. The population selected for high Delta C-13 had an increased frequency of QTL for high Delta C-13, GY and number of spikes per plant (NSP) when grown under rain-fed conditions and only for high Delta C-13 and NSP when grown under irrigated conditions, which was consistent with agronomic performance of the corresponding trait values in the high Delta C-13 progeny; that is, significantly greater than that in the low Delta C-13. Therefore, selection for Delta C-13 was beneficial in increasing grain yield in rain-fed environments.

AB  - The environmental impact assessment existing in the Russian Federation at the present moment cannot provide potential scenarios of consequences for the environment from examined processes, since its goal is to calculate the money equivalent of emissions to the environment. Also, it cannot help the environmental specialist to choose the most environmentally sustainable scenario or process, proceeding from the whole life cycle of the object, because it is usually performed only for the use phase of an object.
   This study also aims to show possibilities for applying LCA methodology, as accepted in the ISO standards series 14040, and as applied to Russian conditions. The main purpose was to investigate a possibility of using the existing environmental impact assessment as the inventory stage in the LCA. As the minor goal, normalisation and weighting factor data for the Russian Federation were calculated on the basis of energy consumption extrapolation.
   In this paper, the environmental impacts are associated with a sewage wastewater facility. The inventory analysis is performed with data obtained from the MosvodokanalNIIproject (Moscow Research Institute for sewage wastewater treatment facilities) and supplemented with the SimaPro 5.0 database (the Netherlands). The environmental impact categories included and discussed in this study are eutrophication, global warming, landfill, acidification, ozone layer depletion and photochemical ozone creation. This study was performed for several design alternatives or scenarios of the wastewater facility. According to the LCA performed in this study, the most environmentally sustainable scenario is that which has the most effective and complicated treatment of sewage water and sludge.

AB  - The purpose of the study is to develop methodological principles of classification of social risks in the context of requirements of social risk management. The risk is considered as possible occurrence of a risk of a negative state of a particular phenomenon or event, undesirable by the object. Social risks are proposed to be all risks arising in the social sphere. When analysing the existing solutions to the problem, classifying social risks according to the requirements of social risk management, the paper uses the following research methods: system approach, analysis and synthesis. The research subject - social risks in the light of their classification by certain characteristic features from the perspective of requirements of social risk management. Analysis of the application of hierarchical and facet methods for the classification of social risks is carried out. The use of a combined approach, i.e. when at some levels of classification risks are classified by using the hierarchical method, and at others - by facet one, is proposed. The necessity and sufficiency of 6 levels of risk division are shown. The 1st level of classification is directed to the division of a set of risks by nature and character of occurrence into macrolevel categories, accordingly, into natural, technogenic, economic, and social. The 2nd level is classified by factors of risk formation. These are risks of social policy, risks of stochastic nature of the formation, physiological risks, and behavioural risks. The 3rd level of classification - risks that are combined in the following forms by the sphere of activity: risks of reproduction of the population, employment of population, income and expenditure of population, living conditions and housing and utilities, education, healthcare, law enforcement, environment, risks of deteriorating social indicators when compared with other countries in the world. The 4th level of classification - by risk types, and the 5th - by levels of the hierarchy of public activity. The 1st, 2nd, and 4th levels are classified by the hierarchical method, 3rd and 5th - by facet method. The 6th level is facet with the horizontal distribution of risks into facets by different features. Conclusion. It is substantiated that obtained results arise from the provisions of economic theory and are in agreement with the acting organisational structure of societal life, which will contribute to creating better conditions for managing social risks. Social risk management begins from the definition of type and nature of risk, place and level of its formation, presentation of its determined characteristics. Here a need arises to divide a set of risks based on the defined signs and criteria into separate subsets. That is, a need arises to classify risks into more concrete groups with similar features. Accordingly, risk classification is important and necessary stage of social risk management. In practice, risk classification is carried out, as a rule, by using facet method when each facet includes an aggregate of risks with homogeneous values of this classification feature. Facet classification is single-level, that is, it does not stipulate for further division of risks into more detailed groups, however, the need for vertical hierarchical multilevel specification arises. The analysis shows that multilevel combined classification system when hierarchical method alternates with facet one satisfies the requirements of social risk management.

AB  - Hydrodynamic dispersion, the combined effects of chemical diffusion and differences in solute path length and fl ow velocity, is an important factor controlling contaminant migration in the subsurface environment. However, few comprehensive threedimensional datasets exist for critically evaluating the impact of travel distance and site heterogeneity on solute dispersion, and the conservative nature of several commonly used groundwater tracers is still in question. Therefore, we conducted a series of field-scale experiments using tritiated water ((HHO)-H-3-H-1), bromide (Br-), and two fluorobenzoates (2,4 Di-FBA, 2,6 Di-FBA) as tracers in the water-table aquifer on the USDOE's Savannah River Site (SRS), located on the upper Atlantic Coastal Plain. For each experiment, tracer-free groundwater was injected for approximately 24 h (56.7 L min(-1)) to establish a steady-state forced radial gradient before the introduction of a tracer pulse. After the tracer pulse, which lasted from 256 to 560 min, the forced gradient was maintained throughout the experiment using nonlabeled groundwater. Tracer migration was monitored using six multilevel monitoring wells, radially spaced at approximate distances of 2.0, 3.0, and 4.5 m from the central injection well. Each sampling well was further divided into three discrete sampling depths that were pumped continuously (similar to 0.1 L min(-1)) throughout the course of the experiments. Longitudinal dispersivity (a L) and travel times for 3H1HO breakthrough were estimated by fitting the field data to analytical approximations of the advection-dispersion equation (ADE) for uniform and radial fl ow conditions. Dispersivity varied greatly between wells located at similar transport distances and even between zones within a given well, which we attributed to variability in the hydraulic conductivity at the study site. The radial fl ow equation generally described tritium breakthrough better than the uniform flow solution, as indicated by the coefficient of determination, r2, yielding lower a L while accounting for breakthrough tailing inherent to radial fl ow conditions. Complex multiple-peak breakthrough patterns were observed within certain sampling zones, indicative of multiple major fl ow paths and the superposition of resulting breakthrough curves. A strong correlation was found between a L and arrival times observed from one experiment to the next, indicative of the general reproducibility of the tracer results. Temporal moment analysis was used to evaluate tracer migration rate as an indicator of variations in hydraulic conductivity and fl ow velocity, as well as mass recovery and retardation for the ionic solutes compared with tritiated water. Retardation factors for Br- ranged from 0.99 to 1.67 with no clear trend with respect to transport distance; however, Br- mass recovery decreased with distance, suggesting that the retardation values are biased in terms of early arrival because of limited detection and an insufficient monitoring duration. Anion retardation was attributed to sorption by iron oxides. Similar results were observed for the FBA tracers. The assumption of conservative behavior for the anionic tracers would generally result in higher a L values and lower estimated fl ow velocities.

AB  - Among the prelithification deformation structures recognised in sedimentary rocks, stepped fractures from glacial environments and coalfields have so far remained unexplained. A comparative analysis of these structures in the two domains has led to the proposal that they are formed by the passage of a striating object over or within the incompletely lithified sediment. Stepped fractures that formed under glacial conditions thus constitute a good indicator of the direction of ice movement in an ice cap, whereas in coalfields they can indicate the polarity of early deformation in gravity slides or on synsedimentary faults.

AB  - This paper summaries 12 years of documentation of secondary halite deposits in the Iranian salt karst. A variety of secondary halite deposits was distinguished and classified into several groups, on the basis of the site and mechanism of their origin. Deposits formed: i) via crystallization in/on streams and pools, ii) from dripping, splashing and aerosol water, iii) from evaporation of seepage and capillary water, and iv) other types of deposits. The following examples of halite forms were distinguished in each of the above mentioned group: i) euhedral crystals, floating rafts (raft cones), thin brine surface crusts and films; ii) straw stalactites, macrocrystalline skeletal and hyaline deposits, aerosol deposits; iii) microcrystalline forms (crusts, stalactites and stalagmites, helictites); iv) macrocrystalline helictites, halite bottom fibers and spiders, crystals in fluvial sediments, euhedral halite crystals in rock salt, combined or transient forms and biologically induced deposits. The occurrence of particular forms depends strongly on the environment, especially on the type of brine occurrence (pool, drip, splashing brine, microscopic capillary brine, etc.), flow rate and its variation, atmospheric humidity, evaporation rate and, in some cases, on the air flow direction. Combined or transitional secondary deposits can be observed if the conditions changed during the deposition. Euhedral halite crystals originate solely below the brine surface of supersaturated streams and lakes. Macrocrystalline skeletal deposits occur at places with rich irregular dripping and splashing (i. e., waterfalls, places with strong dripping from the cave ceilings, etc.). Microcrystalline (fine grained) deposits are generated by evaporation of capillary brine at places where brine is not present in a macroscopically visible form. Straw stalactites form at places where dripping is concentrated in small spots and is frequent sufficient to assure that the tip of the stalactite will not be overgrown by halite precipitates. If the tip is blocked by halite precipitates, the brine remaining in the straw will seep through the walls and helictites start to grow in some places. Macrocrystalline skeletal deposits and straw stalactites usually grow after a major rain event when dripping is strong, while microcrystalline speleothems are formed continuously during much longer periods and ultimately (usually) overgrow the other types of speleothems during dry periods. The rate of secondary halite deposition is much faster compared to the carbonate karst. Some forms increase more than 0.5 m during the first year after a strong rain event; however, the age of speleothems is difficult to estimate, as they are often combinations of segments of various ages and growth periods alternate with long intervals of inactivity. Described forms may be considered in many cases as the analogues of forms found in the carbonate karst. As they are created in a short time period the conditions of their origin are often still visible or can be reconstructed. The described halite forms can thus be used for verification of the origin of various carbonate forms. Some of the described forms bear clear evidence of the paleo-water surface level (transition of the skeletal form to halite crystals and vice versa). Other kinds of deposits are potential indicators of the microclimate under which they developed (humidity close to the deliquescence relative humidity).

AB  - Background, Aim and Scope. As a way of getting a comprehensive assessment of soil quality it is necessary to gather information on several appropriate soil parameters as well as also to perceive their spatial variation between geographic regions. The present work aimed to characterize and compare soil samples from different geographical regions and vegetation covers in the Portuguese territory through the use of physicochemical, biological and biochemical parameters. The study also intended to ascertain if those parameters are sensitive tools that consistently respond to geographical variations.
   Methodology. Physical and chemical (soil organic matter contents, moisture, pH and conductivity), biological (macroarthropod es and diversity) and biochemical (potential nitrification, dehydrogenase and acid phosphatase activities) soil parameters were determined for three different regions of Portugal. Several sub-areas were chosen within each region, in order to include main vegetation patches. At each sampling sub-area, 5 traps were randomly set up for the collection of macroarthropods. For each sampling location, diversity descriptors of soil macro-fauna were calculated: species richness, P diversity, the Shannon diversity (H') and Pielou evenness (J') indices. A principal component analysis (PCA) was used to plot the different sampling locations based on physical and chemical parameters; a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was performed to analyse the relationships between soil fauna and environmental variables (physicochemical parameters and enzyme activities) and a partial canonical correspondence analysis (pCCA), with vegetation patches as covariables, was carried out to perceive their contribution to the variation in macroarthropod distribution.
   Results. Physical and chemical parameters discriminated soils from the different geographic regions in the PCA. Nevertheless, a CCA of environmental variables (physical and chemical properties, dehydrogenase activity, acid phosphatase activity and potential nitrification) and soil macroarthropod catches only discriminated continental soils (Arouca and S. Domingos Mine) from insular ones (Porto Santo Island). The former were correlated with high dehydrogenase activity (DHA) and potential nitrification values, while soils from the Porto Santo Island were particularly correlated with high pH values and low moisture percentages. However, in spite of the extreme conditions, Porto Santo sampling sub-areas presented a great diversity of macroarthropods, especially when compared to the S. Domingos Mine. The pCCA showed that the different vegetation patches only explained 15% of the variation in edaphic species distribution.
   Discussion. Even though physical and chemical parameters were sufficient to discriminate the different geographical regions included in this study, biochemical and biological parameters grouped continental regions, discriminating them from the insular one. According to the CCA triplot, it was evident that the sampling sub-areas from the island were negatively correlated with soil moisture, suggesting that this was probably the main factor for the suppression of the microbial parameters in the island. On the other hand, the location of the S. Domingos mine area, in a metallogenetic province - the Iberian Pyrite Belt may have contributed to the dominance of taxa more adapted to higher background levels of heavy metals.
   Conclusions. In order to perceive geographical variation among different regions, more information is needed regarding different vegetation covers and the chemical composition of their corresponding litter, as well as about other soil chemical parameters. Recommendations and Perspectives. The data gathered in this study will help to distinguish variation in soil biological and biochemical parameters induced by abiotic conditions from the one promoted by anthropogenic disturbances.

AB  - Beta diversity is a key component of biodiversity with implications ranging from species dynamics to ecosystem functioning. However, beta-diversity and its drivers have received little attention, especially for micro-eukaryotes which play key roles in soil functioning. We studied the diversity of soil micro-eukaryotes in a Swiss lowland floodplain using high-throughput Illumina sequencing of soil DNA. We determined the temporal vs. spatial patterns of soil micro-eukaryotic alpha- and beta-diversity in six contrasted habitats sampled over one year. We identified the drivers of these patterns among soil conditions and functions and identified indicator taxa of habitats in each season. We found higher spatial than temporal variability and a strong space-time interaction in soil microeukaryotic diversity patterns as well as in their edaphic drivers, which contrasts with previous observation of bacterial diversity patterns. Our results show that, although soil micro-eukaryotic diversity indeed varies seasonally, it is correlated most strongly with edaphic variables and vegetation but the strength of correlations with individual drivers varied seasonally. Microbial diversity patterns and their drivers can thus differ quite substantially among seasons and taxa. Despite the dominance of spatial patterns, the temporal component of microbial diversity should not be ignored to accurately estimate the diversity and the complexity of soil microbial community assembly processes. Given the importance of soil microbial diversity for ecosystem functioning such knowledge is relevant for land management.

AB  - Access to jobs is an important issue in cities which has not been experienced evenly. The Municipality of Sao Paulo, one of the world's megacities, reflects this uneven accessibility, marked by urban disparities and segregation of poverty-stricken groups. This study examines the inequalities in job accessibility and how it overlaps with socioeconomic indicators, life expectancy and infrastructure conditions, constituting multiple barriers to the most deprived populations. To capture this data, two extreme ends of the human development index have been selected: below the 10th percentile and above the 90th percentile of the Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI). The level of job accessibility was calculated considering proximity to the public transport network. The public transport network was developed in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment based on General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data and Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) from buses to measure travel times and to compute accessibility. Additionally, a spatial autocorrelation method considering job accessibility and HDI was applied to better explore the spatially overlapped pattern. Results have showed that lower rates of job accessibility are associated with areas of worse socioeconomic condition, where life expectancy is shorter and infrastructure is disproportionally precarious. In addition to facing longer travel times in public transportation, this lowest HDI percentile faces the overlapping inequalities that prevent their social ascension and inclusion. Highlighting these factors is essential in the search for equity in accessibility and the development of more inclusive transport policies.

AB  - Water quality monitoring techniques that target microorganisms in the order Bacteroidales are potential alternatives to conventional methods for detection of fecal indicator bacteria. Bacteroidales and members of the genus Bacteroides have been the focus of microbial source tracking (MST) investigations for discriminating sources of fecal pollution (e.g., human or cattle feces) in environmental waters. For accurate source apportionment to occur, one needs to understand both the abundance of Bacteroides in host feces and the survival of these host-associated microbial markers after deposition in the environment. Studies were undertaken to evaluate the abundance, persistence, and potential for growth of Bacteroidales originating from poultry litter under oxic and anoxic environmental conditions. Bacteroidales abundance, as determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) with GenBac primers and probe, increased 2 to 5 log gene copies ml(-1) and 2 log gene copies g litter(-1) under most conditions during incubation of poultry litter in a variety of laboratory microcosm and field mesocosm studies. DNA sequencing of the Bacteroidales organisms in the litter identified taxa with sequences corresponding exactly to the GenBac primer and probe sequences and that were closely related to Bacteroides uniformis, B. ovatus, and B. vulgatus. These results suggest that MST studies using qPCR methods targeting Bacteroidales in watersheds that are affected by poultry litter should be interpreted cautiously. Growth of Bacteroidales originating from poultry litter in environmental waters may occur while Bacteroidales growth from other fecal sources declines, thus confounding the interpretation of MST results.

AB  - The opportunistic pathogens belonging to the Aspergillus genus are present in almost all seasons of the year, and their concentration is related to meteorological conditions. The high density of Aspergillus spp. conidia in a haematological hospital ward may be a significant risk factor for developing invasive fungal diseases in immunocompromised patients. Aim of the present study was to evaluate the variability of airborne Aspergillus spp. conidia contamination in a Haematological Unit (HU) within a period of 16 months in relation with some meteorological parameters. An environmental Aspergillus surveillance was conducted in the HU in four rooms and their bathrooms, in the corridor and in three external sites using an agar impact sampler. During each sampling, temperature and relative humidity at each site were recorded and current wind speed and rainfall events were taken from the official weather service. Aspergillus spp. conidia concentration differed significantly across the sampling sites. Internal Aspergillus spp. loads were significantly dependent on temperature, internal relative humidity and rain. External conidia concentrations were significantly influenced by outdoor temperature and relative humidity. A suitable indicator was introduced to evaluate the seasonal distribution of Aspergillus spp. conidia in the sampling sites, and a significant dependence on this indicator was observed inside the HU. Seventeen different fungal species belonging to the Aspergillus genus were detected during the sampling period. Aspergillus fumigatus was the most frequently isolated species and its distribution depended significantly on the seasonal indicator both inside and outside the hospital ward.

AB  - The Atlantic stingray, Dasyatis sabina, found along the Gulf of Mexico and southeastern Atlantic coasts, is a euryhaline species of elasmobranch. This species is able to osmotically compensate for changing environmental salinity by altering plasma and intracellular solutes, including urea and counteracting methylamines (betaine and TMAO). Parvalbumin (PV) is an intracellular protein that facilitates muscle relaxation by sequestering calcium. Determining the effects that in situ concentrations of urea (146 mM), betaine (62 mM), and TMAO (11 mM) have on PV function in marine and freshwater adapted populations of D. sabina could provide insight into intracellular correlates of euryhaline tolerance for this species. PV from marine and freshwater populations of D. sabina was identified and purified by SDS-PAGE, western blot analysis, and full amino acid sequence analysis. Both populations exhibited two PV isoforms, PV I (similar to 12.18 kDa mw) and PV II (11.96 kDa mw). PV dissociation constants (K-D) were determined in the presence and absence of physiological concentrations of urea, betaine, and TMAO by fluorescence spectroscopy using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fluo-3 which competes with PV for Ca (2+). Functional studies revealed PV I showed no significant changes in calcium binding from in situ muscle conditions, except in the presence of betaine. In contrast, PV II's ability to bind calcium was increased relative to physiological conditions in the presence of each osmolyte independently. Thus, it appears that organic osmolytes have isoform specific effects on PV function. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim Three species of primitive spiders of the genus Atypus occur in European xerothermic habitats, where they live in burrows. The aim of this study is to explain their distribution by investigating environmental variables at sites where they occur in central Europe.
   Location Over 50 sites in central Europe, Czech Republic.
   Methods Data on climatic, edaphic and vegetational parameters were collected from more than 50 sites. Phytocenological data were processed using Ellenberg's indicator values.
   Results Atypus muralis was found to occur almost exclusively in dry grassland (Festucion valesiacae), exposed to a continental microclimate. Atypus affinis usually occurred in dry sparse forests (Genisto germanicae-Quercion) that provide an Atlantic microclimate. Atypus piceus occurred in dry grassland (Bromion erecti) or forest fringes (Geranion sanguinei) characterized by an intermediate microclimate. Atypus piceus and A. muralis were restricted to agglutinate calcareous soils.
   Main conclusions Our results show that Atypus species colonized sites with different continentality in central Europe. These differences correspond to differences among their probable glacial refugia. Atypus muralis and A. piceus occur in habitats with a markedly continental climate, and are restricted to calcareous agglutinate soils that more efficiently buffer temperature and humidity extremes. Habitats of A. muralis and A. piceus are threatened by overgrowth of vegetation after a recent decline in grazing and by the decalcification of the landscape. However, habitats of A. affinis are stable in the present central European climate.

AB  - The resistance of chestnut clones to Phytophthora cinnamomi was evaluated by a soil inoculation experiment under controlled environmental conditions, as well as by excised and intact stem tests. One-year-old plants of fifty different clones were inoculated with two isolates of Phytophthora cinnamomi and evaluated fourteen weeks after inoculation. There were significant differences among clones for all root and collar rot variables. There were significant differences for isolates of P. cinnamomi but only for the collar rot variables. A total of 84% of plants grown in infested soil showed symptoms of root rot but only 50 % of the plants with root rot, showed also had collar rot. The roots of resistant clones were able to confine the colonization, in roots and from roots to collar. Percentage circumference of collar rot was the best indicator or descriptor of sensitivity, a 50% of clones were resistant or highly resistant clones, with respectively less than 20% and than 10% circumference of collar rot. Percentage of survival of plants is not sufficient to indicate resistance to the pathogen, as mortality may be affected by environmental conditions or by other pathogens. The clonal heritability of collar rot variables ranged between 0.54 and 0.71. The plants grown on inoculated soil showed a reduction in growth. The phenotypic and genotypic correlations between soil infestation characteristics and the length of necrosis in both intact and excised stem tests were positive and highly significant and indicated similar resistance rankings of the clones.

AB  - Geographers have been arguing recently that the idea of what is 'international' in this field has been occupied by the hegemonic discourses of Anglo-American geography and journals. This paper takes this lively debate as an indicator of the global challenges facing higher education and research and provides an analysis of the changing conditions of knowledge production, characterised by internationalisation and competition. Knowledge production is governed to an increasing degree through practices based on market-like operations. The author argues that this may lead to the homogenisation of social science publication practices, which are known to be heterogeneous and context dependent. One indicator of this homogenisation is the demand for publishing in international journals that is arising in social sciences and humanities round the world. Both 'international' and 'quality' are increasingly being connected with the journals noted in the Institute of Scientific Information's (ISI) databases. Starting with an analysis of the changing conditions of knowledge production in general and in human geography in particular, the author scrutinises the spatial patterns of the international journal publishing spaces constituted by the ISI. The results show specific geographies: not only the manner in which the Anglo-American journals dominate the publishing space in science but also how the publishing spaces of the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities are very different. The publication space of social science journals is particularly limited to the English-speaking countries, and this is especially the case with human geography.

AB  - The leaf-curling plum aphid (Brachycaudus helichrysi Kalt.) is one of the main pests of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) in Europe. Yield losses were assessed in open field conditions and natural infestations over a 3-year period in Central West France. Plant variability and the choice of the more vigorous plants by aphids in open field conditions were two factors interfering with the experiments. To improve their sensitivity and to correct for biases without expanding the experimental design, an analysis of covariance was the best compromise. Field and cage experiments were conducted between 1985 and 1989 to assess the influence of aphids on the relationship between stem diameter at harvest and seed yield. As an indicator of plant vigour (size and yield), stem diameter at harvest was the best choice, as neither its relationship with seed yield nor its mean value was affected by aphid infestation. It was then used as a covariate to study yield losses. Aphid populations were quantified weekly from the beginning to the end of the infestations according to the leaf-curling symptom and to the number of aphids per plant. Multivariate analyses followed by cluster analysis identified groups of plants displaying similar infestation dynamics. It was found that when aphid populations reached > 100 per plant at the budding stage, yield losses occurred. When populations were < 100 aphids per plant at the budding stage and then decreased, no yield loss was observed. This gives growers ample time to monitor populations and treat crops.

These might however be biased due to inconspicuousness, due to rapid decay and disappearance, or due to high site-dependent variance in decay dynamics. Mapping of indirect signs is a frequently applied approach to study habitat use or distribution of grouse species. However, only a few studies addressed avian dropping decay up to now, and no study focused on dropping decay of European grouse species. Consequently, we conducted field surveys and greenhouse trials, studying time spans over which capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) droppings persist and factors influencing the decay rates (i.e., habitat type, small mammal access, and precipitation regime). In the field survey, after an exposure of 98 days, only 6% of droppings (n = 156) decayed completely and most droppings remained nearly unchanged. The decay rate was influenced by microsite conditions (i.e., vegetation and location), with lowest decay rates in areas with little ground vegetation or on tree stubs. Destruents were not found to play a major role in affecting decay rate. The greenhouse trial revealed the impact of precipitation on the decay rate of droppings (n = 400): under high-amount and high-intensity precipitation regime droppings decayed faster compared to low-amount and low-intensity precipitation. The slow decay rate, and resulting long time period that they can be detected, therefore means that capercaillie droppings are a valid proxy for species' occurrence.

AB  - The observation and representation in general circulation models (GCMs) of cloud vertical overlap are the objects of active research due to their impacts on the earth's radiative budget. Previous studies have found that vertically contiguous cloudy layers show a maximum overlap between layers up to several kilometers apart but tend toward a random overlap as separations increase. The decorrelation length scale that characterizes the progressive transition from maximum to random overlap changes from one location and season to another and thus may be influenced by large-scale vertical motion, wind shear, or convection. Observations from the U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program ground-based radars and lidars in midlatitude and tropical locations in combination with reanalysis meteorological fields are used to evaluate how dynamics and atmospheric state influence cloud overlap. For midlatitude winter months, strong synoptic-scale upward motion maintains conditions closer to maximum overlap at large separations. In the tropics, overlap becomes closer to maximum as convective stability decreases. In midlatitude subsidence and tropical convectively stable situations, where a smooth transition from maximum to random overlap is found on average, large wind shears sometimes favor minimum overlap. Precipitation periods are discarded from the analysis but, when included, maximum overlap occurs more often at large separations. The results suggest that a straightforward modification of the existing GCM mixed maximum-random overlap parameterization approach that accounts for environmental conditions can capture much of the important variability and is more realistic than approaches that are only based on an exponential decay transition from maximum to random overlap.

AB  - Toxicological studies enable to identify those plants with the highest sensibility to low concentrations of soil pollutants. Leguminous plants have extremely sensible organs and physiological responses to low concentrations of oil in the soil. The object of this study was to assess and explain the response in terms of growth, total biomass, number of nodules and presence/absence of leghaemoglobin in the nodules of four different leguminous plants at four different concentrations of oil under two conditions: new oil, recently extracted, or weathered oil, exposed to the environment for > 20 years. Two phytotoxicity assays were carried out under greenhouse conditions. The first involved << wild chipilin >> plants (Crotalaria sp) for 120 days with a 1x5 factorial arrangement and a random design with four replicates per treatment testing oil concentrations (in mg(.)kg(-1) of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), dry weight) of 150 (control soil), 7500, 25000, 5000 (new oil) and 79457 (weathered oil). The second assay lasted 150 days, testing plants of "dormilona >> (Mimosa sp). << guaje >> (Leucaena sp) and << zarza >> (Mimosa pigra), in a 3x5 factorial arrangement, at random with four replicates. The concentrations tested were 150, 5000, 79457, 100000, and 150000 mg(.)kg(-1) TPH, dry weight. Statistically significant differences were found in all variables, being negatively associated to the presence of oil in soil. Wild chipilin was the most sensitive species to oil exposure, better showing its phytotoxicity, so that it could be used as a phytoindicative species of oil-polluted soil. The number of nodules containing leghaemoglobin was the most sensitive indicator of oil's phytotoxic effect.

AB  - For more than three decades chronic studies in rodents have been the benchmark for assessing the potential long- term toxicity, and particularly the carcinogenicity, of chemicals. With doses typically administered for about 2 years (18 months to lifetime), the rodent bioassay has been an integral component of testing protocols for food additives, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals, and all manner of byproducts and environmental contaminants. Over time, the data from these studies have been used to address an increasing diversity of questions related to the assessment of human health risks, adding complexity to study design and interpretation. An earlier ILSI RSI working group developed a set of principles for the selection of doses for chronic rodent studies ( ILSI, 1997). The present report builds on that work, examining some of the issues that arise and offering new perspectives and approaches for putting the principles into practice. Dose selection is considered both from the prospective viewpoint of the choosing of dose levels for a study and from the retrospective interpretation of study results in light of the doses used. A main theme of this report is that the purposes and objectives of chronic rodent studies vary and should be clearly defined in advance. Dose placement, then, should be optimized to achieve study objectives. For practical reasons, most chronic studies today must be designed to address multiple objectives, often requiring trade-offs and innovative approaches in study design. A systematic approach to dose selection should begin with recognition that the design of chronic studies occurs in the context of a careful assessment of the accumulated scientific information on the test substance, the relevant risk management questions, priorities and mandates, and the practical limitations and constraints on available resources. A stepwise process is described. The aim is to increase insofar as possible the utility of an expensive and time-consuming experiment. The kinds of data that are most commonly needed for dose selection and for understanding the dose-related results of chronic rodent studies, particularly carcinogenicity studies, are discussed as " design/ interpretation factors." They comprise both the inherent characteristics of the test substance and indicators of biological damage, perturbation or stress among the experimental animals. They may be primary toxicity endpoints, predictors or indicators of appropriate dose selection, or indicators of conditions to be avoided in dose selection. The application and interpretation of design/ interpretation factors is conditioned by the study objectives-what is considered desirable will depend on the strategy for choice of doses that is being followed. The challenge is to select doses that accommodate all of the issues raised by the relevant design/ interpretation factors. Three case studies are presented here that illustrate the interplay between study objectives and the design and selection of doses for chronic rodent studies. These examples also highlight issues associated with multiple plausible modes of action, multiple pathways for biotransformation of the chemical, extraneous high-dose effects, the use of modeling in dose selection, and the implications of human exposure levels. Finally, looking to the future, the report explores seven potential paradigm shifts for risk assessment that will significantly impact the design and interpretation of toxicity and carcinogenicity studies.

AB  - CONSPECTUS: Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of mortality globally resulting from an infectious disease, killing almost 1.6 million people annually and accounting for Biological Insight approximately 30% of deaths attributed to antimicrobial Mycobacterium resistance (AMR). This despite the widespread administration tuberculosis of a neonatal vaccine, and the availability of an effective combination drug therapy against the causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Instead, TB prevalence worldwide is characterized by high-burden regions in which co-epidemics, such as HIV, and social and economic factors, undermine efforts to control TB. These elements additionally ensure conditions that favor the emergence of drug-resistant Mtb strains, which further threaten prospects for future TB control.
   To address this challenge, significant resources have been invested in developing a TB drug pipeline, an initiative given impetus by the recent regulatory approval of two new anti-TB drugs. However, both drugs have been reserved for drug-resistant disease, and the seeming inevitability of new resistance plus the recognized need to shorten the duration of chemotherapy demands continual replenishment of the pipeline with high-quality "hits" with novel mechanisms of action. This represents a massive challenge, which has been undermined by key gaps in our understanding of Mtb physiology and metabolism, especially during host infection. Whereas drug discovery for other bacterial infections can rely on predictive in vitro assays and animal models, for Mtb, inherent metabolic flexibility and uncertainties about the nutrients available to infecting bacilli in different host (micro)environments instead requires educated predictions or demonstrations of efficacy in animal models of arguable relevance to human disease. Even microbiological methods for enumeration of viable mycobacterial cells are fraught with complication.
   Our research has focused on elucidating those aspects of mycobacterial metabolism that contribute to the robustness of the bacillus to host immunological defenses and applied antibiotics and that, possibly, drive the emergence of drug resistance. This work has identified a handful of metabolic pathways that appear vulnerable to antibiotic targeting. Those highlighted, here, include the inter-related functions of pantothenate and coenzyme A biosynthesis and recycling and nucleotide metabolism-the last of which reinforces our view that DNA metabolism constitutes an under-explored area for new TB drug development. Although nonessential functions have traditionally been deprioritized for antibiotic development, a common theme emerging from this work is that these very functions might represent attractive targets because of the potential to cripple mechanisms critical to bacillary survival under stress (for example, the Rel(Mtb)-dependent stringent response) or to adaptability under unfavorable, potentially lethal, conditions including antibiotic therapy (for example, DnaE2-dependent SOS mutagenesis). The bar, however, is high: demonstrating convincingly the likely efficacy of this strategy will require innovative models of human TB disease.
   In the concluding section, we focus on the need for improved techniques to elucidate mycobacterial metabolism during infection and its impact on disease outcomes. Here, we argue that developments in other fields suggest the potential to break through this barrier by harnessing chemical-biology approaches in tandem with the most advanced technologies. As researchers based in a high-burden country, we are impelled to continue participating in this important endeavor.

AB  - Balancing ecological and social outcomes of conservation actions is recognized in global conservation policy but is challenging in practice. Compensation to land owners or users for foregone assets has been proposed by economists as an efficient way to mitigate negative social impacts of human displacement from protected areas. Joint empirical assessments of the conservation and social impacts of protected area establishment involving compensation payments are scarce. We synthesized social and biological studies related to the establishment of the Derema forest corridor in Tanzania's biodiverse East Usambara Mountains. This lengthy conservation process involved the appropriation of approximately 960 ha of native canopy agroforest and steep slopes for the corridor and monetary compensation to more than 1100 claimants in the surrounding villages. The overarching goals from the outset were to conserve ecological processes while doing no harm to the local communities. We evaluated whether these goals were achieved by analyzing 3 indicators of success: enhancement of forest connectivity, improvement of forest condition, and mitigation of negative impacts on local people's livelihoods. Indicators of forest connectivity and conditions were enhanced through reductions of forest loss and exotic species and increases in native species and canopy closure. Despite great efforts by national and international organizations, the intervention failed to mitigate livelihood losses especially among the poorest people. The Derema case illustrates the challenges of designing and implementing compensation schemes for conservation-related displacement of people. Resultados Ecologicos y Sociales de un area Protegida Nueva en Tanzania
   Resumen El equilibrio de los resultados ecologicos y sociales de las acciones de conservacion esta reconocido en la politica de conservacion global pero es un reto en la practica. La compensacion para los duenos de los terrenos o para los usuarios de bienes predeterminados ha sido propuesta por los economistas como una forma eficiente de mitigar los impactos sociales negativos del desplazamiento humano de las areas protegidas. Los calculos empiricos conjuntos de la conservacion y los impactos sociales del establecimiento de areas protegidas que involucran los pagos de compensacion son escasos. Sintetizamos los estudios sociales y biologicos relacionados con el establecimiento del corredor boscoso Derema en las biodiversas montanas de Usambara Oriental en Tanzania. Este largo proceso de conservacion involucro la apropiacion de approximate to 960 ha de dosel de agrobosque nativo y pendientes empinadas para el corredor y compensaciones monetarias para mas de 1100 demandantes en las aldeas alrededor. Las metas dominantes al inicio fueron conservar los procesos ecologicos a la vez que no se causaba dano a las comunidades locales. Evaluamos si estas metas se lograron al analizar 3 indicadores de exito: el mejoramiento de la conectividad forestal, la mejoria de la condicion forestal y la mitigacion de los impactos negativos sobre el bienestar de los locales. Los indicadores de la conectividad y las condiciones forestales mejoraron por medio de las reducciones en la perdida forestal y de especies exoticas y el aumento en las especies nativas y el cierre del dosel. A pesar de los grandes esfuerzos hechos por organizaciones nacionales e internacionales, la intervencion fallo en la mitigacion de perdidas del bienestar, especialmente entre los habitantes pobres. El caso Derema ilustra los retos de disenar e implementar esquemas de compensacion para el desplazamiento de personas por causa de la conservacion.

AB  - Purpose. The purpose of the article is a methodological substantiation of the problem of economic modernization and business development of livestock industry.
   Methodology / approach. The theoretical and methodological basis of the study was the dialectical method of cognition of economic processes, fundamental provisions of modern economic theory, scientific works of domestic and foreign scientists, related to the study of the economic nature and content of relations between the subjects of the livestock products market.
   The methodological basis of the study was those functional provisions that comprehensively highlighted the need for economic modernization and effective development of livestock in the face of scarcity of financial resources. The problem of the need for economic modernization and predicting the effective development of animal husbandry was investigated using a number of methods (correlation-regression, scenario planning, selective sociological research, mathematical modeling of economic processes, forecasting), which are aimed at identifying ways and mechanisms of knowledge of reality.
   This made it possible to substantiate changes in livestock production, composition of the genetic potential of animals and their productivity, to identify factors that hinder the changing economic, social, political and environmental conditions in the livestock industry to innovate its development through the implementation of modern technologies. Using the regression analysis, the relationship between the phenomena (the numerical values of each observation result in the time series) was analyzed analytically in the form of mathematical functions.
   Results. The peculiarities of application of the proposed methods and methodological approaches made it possible to take into account the main components of modernization transformations in livestock enterprises for the detection of changes in the genetic potential, animal productivity, production of livestock products, the implementation of modern technologies, farm machinery and equipment and to forecast the development of livestock industry.
   The result of the implementation of the methodological approach to the development strategy of the livestock industry is the proposed list of strategic development scenarios, which creates opportunities for the implementation of the objectives of its development and outlines a problematic field for economic modernization.
   Originality / scientific novelty. The article presents, for the first time, the results of the study that substantiate the feasibility of forming an information base and the study of dynamic changes in economic indicators of livestock development using an analytical approach in the study of problems of further development of the livestock industry, which, unlike existing ones, takes into account the influence of random variables that do not occur risky situations of the environment.
   Practical value / implications. The use of the proposed models and methods and the integrated systematic approach for the research of problems of regional modernization transformations allows to ensure the implementation of the process of modernization itself, forecasting the development and use of technologies; to assess the specific nature of the scientific and technological direction, the level of economic and social measures for the introduction of new technologies; focus on a number of issues that have not yet been resolved for the sake of future benchmarks for businesses and their industries in a particular region.

AB  - Atmospheric pollution and other human activities have altered natural element cycles over large regions of the world. Much current understanding of nutrient dynamics in temperate region ecosystems has been derived from such biogeochemically altered areas. While it is increasingly difficult to find regions of temperate forest that can be classified as free from human influences, studies of unpolluted and undisturbed areas can (1) provide important ''baseline'' information about natural patterns of element cycling, against which disturbed cycles can be compared; (2) provide insights into the biogeochemical conditions that acted as evolutionary and selective constraints on biotic communities before the advent of regional-scale human impacts. and (3) provide an opportunity to evaluate the general nature of biogeochemical theories that have been developed in areas subject to strong human influences.
   We here report on patterns of hydrologic nutrient loss from old-growth temperate forest ecosystems in southern Chile based on chemical analyses of small streams draining 31 watersheds. These forests have not been subject to air pollution inputs and have remained floristically stable throughout the Holocene. For major elements our results support predictions from current biogeochemical theory (the ''nutrient retention hypothesis'') that net biotic retention of elements should be minimal in old-growth forest ecosystems. Despite the dilute nature of watershed streams, the overall patterns of loss of most elements could be explained almost exclusively by atmospheric inputs of marine aerosols. In contrast. patterns of nitrogen loss were more complex than predicted by current conceptual models. Hydrologic N losses occurred nearly exclusively (95% of total N) as dissolved organic forms of nitrogen (DON), rather than as the inorganic forms NO3- (0.2% of total N) and NH4+ (4.8% of total N). The strong dominance of organic over inorganic losses of N indicates that losses of N from old-growth forest ecosystems are not exclusively subject to traditional mechanisms of direct biotic control (i.e., mineralization supply or biotic uptake), but are also subject to indirect biotic control associated with the long-term accumulation, humification, and leaching of soil organic N during ecosystem succession. The view of unpolluted old-growth forests as ''leaky'' vs. ''non-leaky'' with respect to N depends on whether ecosystem budgets or models consider dissolved organic, as well as inorganic, forms of N. High- and mid-elevation forests in our study area showed the lowest efflux concentrations of N as NO3- reported from any old-growth temperate forest ecosystem (0.10 vs. 0.30 mu g/L, respectively). Comparisons against other old-growth forests, subject to varying levels of N deposition, indicated that levels of NO3- and the relative abundance of NO3- vs. NH4- in Northern Hemisphere forests may be strongly influenced by atmospheric N inputs. Our analyses suggest that patterns of N cycling, as well as evolutionary selective pressures on plant and microbial species, may have changed as a function of regional-scale increases in atmospheric N deposition to European and North American temperate forests. We hypothesize that, because they inherently are more poor than aggrading forests at retaining added nutrients, old-growth forest ecosystems are particularly sensitive indicators of N deposition.

AB  - A four yearlong air monitoring data (since 2015 to 2018) was collected to assess the impact of meteorological parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and wind direction on the spatial and temporal variability of CO (carbon monoxide), NO2 (nitrogen oxide), O-3 (ozone), SO2 (sulfur dioxide), PM10 and PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter aerodynamic less than 2.5 ism and 10 mu m respectively) in Lima Metropolitan Area (LMA). Data from eight air quality monitoring stations, currently under the supervision of the National Meteorological and Hydrological Service (SENAMHI), was used to capture traffic - related pollutants concen- trations under various local traffic conditions. Effects on meteorological events on seasonal traffic -related pol- lutants concentration variability were identified. Using average data from the eight stations, it was found that the monthly mean traffic -related pollutants since 2015 to 2018 were higher in spring and winter and lower in autumn and summer. Low -wind speed was associated with events that contribute to elevated seasonal PM2.5 levels. Correlation coefficients between PM2.5 concentrations and meteorological variables fluctuated significaly across different seasons. High PM2.5 concentrations were associated with low relative humidity and high wind conditions in spring. Results suggest that there exist a seasonal variation of PM2.5 concentration, and set the need of future work on the understanding of the air pollution effects on human health.

AB  - Despite its limited analytical specificity and ruggedness, the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay has been widely used as a generic metric of lipid peroxidation in biological fluids. It is often considered a good indicator of the levels of oxidative stress within a biological sample, provided that the sample has been properly handled and stored. The assay involves the reaction of lipid peroxidation products, primarily malondialdehyde (MDA), with thiobarbituric acid (TBA), which leads to the formation of MDA-TBA2 adducts called TBARS. TBARS yields a red-pink color that can be measured spectrophotometrically at 532 nm. The TBARS assay is performed under acidic conditions (pH = 4) and at 95 degrees C. Pure MDA is unstable, but these conditions allow the release of MDA from MDA bis(dimethyl acetal), which is used as the analytical standard in this method. The TBARS assay is a straightforward method that can be completed in about 2 h. Preparation of assay reagents are described in detail here. Budget-conscious researchers can use these reagents for multiple experiments at a low cost rather than buying an expensive TBARS assay kit that only permits construction of a single standard curve (and thus can only be used for one experiment). The applicability of this TBARS assay is shown in human serum, low density lipoproteins, and cell lysates. The assay is consistent and reproducible, and limits of detection of 1.1 mu M can be reached. Recommendations for the use and interpretation of the spectrophotometric TBARS assay are provided.

AB  - Climate models are often affected by long-term drift that is revealed by the evolution of global variables such as the ocean temperature or the surface air temperature. This spurious trend reduces the fidelity to initial conditions and has a great influence on the equilibrium climate after long simulation times. Useful insight on the nature of the climate drift can be obtained using two global metrics, i.e. the energy imbalance at the top of the atmosphere and at the ocean surface. The former is an indicator of the limitations within a given climate model, at the level of both numerical implementation and physical parameterisations, while the latter is an indicator of the goodness of the tuning procedure. Using the MIT general circulation model, we construct different configurations with various degree of complexity (i.e. different parameterisations for the bulk cloud albedo, inclusion or not of friction heating, different bathymetry configurations) to which we apply the same tuning procedure in order to obtain control runs for fixed external forcing where the climate drift is minimised. We find that the interplay between tuning procedure and different configurations of the same climate model provides crucial information on the stability of the control runs and on the goodness of a given parameterisation. This approach is particularly relevant for constructing good-quality control runs of the geological past where huge uncertainties are found in both initial and boundary conditions. We will focus on robust results that can be generally applied to other climate models.

AB  - Participatory decision-making in the management of linear parks can provide better outcomes than classical top down procedures. However, the integration of technical knowledge with the understanding of the community requires an approach able to deal with uncertainty, due to the issues of vagueness and subjectivity. Therefore, the present paper introduces a fuzzy-based proposal for supporting participatory diagnosis. For this purpose, five Mamdani-type systems were built based on the knowledge of experts, including as indicators the species richness of fauna and flora, land cover, basic and recreational facilities, support services, and the park users' perceptions. By integrating such indicators, three indexes were obtained for assessing the natural condition, infrastructure, and functional performance of a linear park. The proposed system was then applied in a case study of the Tiquatira linear park in Sao Paulo city, Brazil. The results indicated that the park has' high functional performance, but that improvements in its natural condition and infrastructure are needed, such as the reclamation of disturbed areas and ongoing maintenance of the facilities. The use of fuzzy modeling enabled integration of the technical assessment by experts and the users' perception, in order to support a participatory diagnosis taking into account the existing uncertainties. In conclusion, this fuzzy-based proposal can be considered a promising approach for the participatory management of linear parks. In future studies, techniques for the case-by-case weighting of variables could be assessed, in order to strengthen the systems described in the present paper.

AB  - Generally, it is agreed that QoL differs in diverse local places. Explaining these differences remains a complex and challenging problem. Scientific research has concluded that the impacts of socio-economic circumstances in local places (measured by social indicators) on subjectively perceived individual QoL are not direct, but complex, versatile and diverse. Objective differences of socio-economic factors in local places suggest that personal characteristics as well as other objective and subjective QoL factors, specific to individuals, could form some common patterns, able to disclose the differences in individually perceived QoL in different socio-economic conditions and diverse local places, e.g. cities, towns, or rural areas. The research aims at investigating differences in the patterns of individual subjectively perceived QoL in diverse local places. The differences of the considered local places are reasoned by the indicators of objective socio-economic conditions in cities, towns and rural areas. The tested presumption is that common patterns of individual subjectively perceived QoL differ, respecting objective socioeconomic factors in local places. The research concludes with the discovery and discussion of statistical regression models to predict individual subjectively perceived QoL in towns, big cities and rural areas. Residents' attitude to social environment, their abilities to deal with important problems in life, household total income and age are used as predictors to explain the differences of individual subjectively perceived QoL. The case of Lithuania is being investigated, using European Social Survey (round 6, 2013) data.

AB  - The between perception of individual exposure to different environmental stimuli; microclimate, noise and especially particulate matter (PM) was examined. Microclimate, noise and PM were monitored during field surveys with 260 questionnaire-guided interviews at a road construction site and a traffic site on the UC San Diego campus. The overall comfort was determined primarily by the thermal environment. The air quality was considered to be poor by 42% of the interviewees at the construction site, which was burdened with higher PM counts and sound levels. Overall, higher PM concentrations were correlated with perception of poor air quality. Similarity between the overall air quality and how dusty it feels suggests that visual clues of PM, such as dust, affect the perception of air quality and pollution. The effect of medical or smoking history on the perceived air quality was also examined. People with a medical history of hay fever voted more frequently for poor air quality conditions than those without, whereas current smokers were the least sensitive to ambient air quality conditions. Through the exposure-response relationships between the various perception votes and PM, it was possible to predict perceived air cleanness using the PM count. Understanding the human assessment of environmental stimuli could inform the design and development of urban spaces, in relation to the allocation of uses and activities, along with air quality management schemes.

AB  - The paleohydrological evolution of several high altitude, saline lakes located in the southernmost Altiplano (El Peinado and San Francisco basins, Catamarca province, NW Argentina) was reconstructed applying sedimentological, geochemical and isotopic techniques. Several playa lakes from the San Francisco basin (26 degrees 56' S; 68 degrees 08' W, 3800-3900 m a.s.l.) show evidence of a recent raise in the watertable that led to modern deposition of carbonate and diatomaceous muds. A 2 m - long core from El Peinado Lake (26 degrees 29' 59 " S, 68 degrees 05' 32 " W, 3820 m a.s.l.) consists of calcitic crusts (unit 3), overlaid by an alternation of macrophyte-rich and travertine clast- rich, laminated muds (unit 2), and topped by travertine facies (unit 1). This sedimentary sequence illustrates a paleohydrological evolution from a subaerial exposure (unit 3) to a high lake stand (unit 2), and a subsequent smaller decrease in lake level (unit 1). The delta C-13(organic matter) record also reflects the lake transgression between units 3 and 2. Although there is a general positive correlation between delta O-18(carbonate) and salinity proxies (Na, Li and B content), the large data dispersion indicates that other factors besides evaporation effects control chemical and isotopic composition of lakewater. Consequently, the oxygen isotopic composition cannot be interpreted exclusively as an indicator of salinity or evaporation ratio. The degassing of CO2 during groundwater discharge can explain the enriched delta C-13 values for primary carbonates precipitated. The carbon budget in these high altitude, saline lakes seems to be controlled by physical rather than biological processes.
   The Altiplano saline lakes contain records of environmental and climatic change, although accurate C-14 dating of these lacustrine sediments is hindered by the scarcity of terrestrial organic material, and the large reservoir effects. Sedimentologic evidence, a Pb-210-based chronology, and a preliminary U/Th chronology indicate a very large reservoir effect in El Peinado, likely as a result of old groundwaters and large contributions of volcanic and geothermal C-14-free CO2 to the lake system. Alternative chronologies are needed to place these paleorecords in a reliable chronological framework. A period of increased water balance in the San Francisco basin ended at about 1660 +/- 82 yr B.P. (calendar yr U/Th age), and would correlates with the humid phase between 3000 and 1800 yr B.P detected in other sites of the southern Altiplano. Both, Pb-210 and preliminary U/Th dating favor a younger age for the paleohydrological changes in El Peinado. The arid period reflected by subaerial exposure and low lake levels in unit 3 would have ended with a large increase in effective moisture during the late 17th century. The increased lake level during deposition of unit 2 would represent the period between AD1650 - 1900, synchronous to the Little Ice Age. This chronological framework is coherent with other regional records that show an abrupt transition from more arid to more humid conditions in the early 17th century, and a change to modern conditions in the late 19th century. Although there are local differences, the Little Ice Age stands as a significant climatic event in the Andean Altiplano.

AB  - Mangrove forests are valuable ecosystems, but their extent and diversity are increasingly threatened by sea-level rise and anthropogenic pressures. Here we develop a bio-morphodynamic model that captures the interaction between multiple mangrove species and hydro-sedimentary processes across a dynamic coastal profile. Numerical experiments are conducted to elucidate the response of mangrove assemblages under a range of sea-level rise and sediment supply conditions, both in the absence and presence of anthropogenic barriers impeding inland migration. We find that mangrove coverage can increase despite sea-level rise if sediment supply is sufficient and landward accommodation space is available. Tidal barriers are mainly detrimental to mangrove coverage and result in species loss. Importantly, we show that bio-morphodynamic feedbacks can cause spatio-temporal variations in sediment delivery across the forest, leading to upper-forest sediment starvation and reduced deposition despite extended inundation. As such, bio-morphodynamic feedbacks can decouple accretion rates from inundation time, altering mangrove habitat conditions and causing mangrove diversity loss even when total forest coverage remains constant or is increasing. A further examination of bio-morphodynamic feedback strength reveals that vegetation-induced flow resistance linked to mangrove root density is a major factor steering the inundation-accretion decoupling and as such species distribution. Our findings have important implications for ecosystem vulnerability assessments, which should account for the interactions between bio-morphodynamics and mangrove diversity when evaluating the impacts of sea-level rise on species assemblages.

AB  - In large, alluvial floodplains dominated by agriculture, small streams have the potential to experience nutrient enrichment affecting algal assemblage structure and metabolism. Nutrient enrichment is largely driven by application of nutrients and altered hydrologic regimes. To inform stressor-response-based nutrient reduction goals for agricultural alluvial plain streams, diatom assemblages were sampled from 25 streams located within the Mississippi Alluvial Plain (MAP) with various land management practices and associated P and N inputs. From August through September 2015, epidendric diatom assemblage samples were collected from instream woody debris. Field nutrient gradients were skewed toward higher concentrations, and ranges of previously reported diatom assemblage response thresholds indicative of oligotrophic conditions were not well represented. Ordination analysis identified a gradient in species composition associated with increasing P and decreasing dissolved oxygen. A significant shift in diatom assemblage structure occurred when total P concentrations in the MAP streams exceeded 0.12 mg L-1. Phosphorus-enriched systems were represented by a distinct set of indicator species, lower abundances of ubiquitous species, greater abundances of highly tolerant species, and greater abundances of high-P indicator species. No relationships were observed among diatom assemblage measures or traits with increasing N. Current results do not address potential criteria for identifying high-quality, oligotrophic streams. However, measures of diatom assemblage structure have potential for helping set benchmarks to reduce nutrient impacts and monitor effects of agricultural best management practices on MAP streams.

AB  - The land use and land cover (LUC) of the Zezere watershed (Portugal) have undergone major changes in recent decades, with the increase of artificial surfaces. This trend is quantified in some studies, but the probability of the increase of this type of LUC, nor the places where the next transitions or land use/cover changes (LUCC) for artificial surfaces will have high probability of occurrence has not yet been assessed. This research presents an evaluation of these two aspects, by means of bivariate statistical models (fuzzy logic and information value) and environmental data. The artificialization probability by sectors within the same watershed is also evaluated, to further understand which areas will require greater attention, taking into account the environmental conditions favorable to the occurrence of this process and bearing in mind the conditions under which this process took place in the past. The results obtained using these models were assessed independently, through curves of success, noting that the modeling through the fuzzy gamma presents slightly better efficiency in determining the probability of artificialization surfaces in the study area. The area with the highest probability of artificialization is mostly located in the SW of this watershed, but high probabilities are also present in the upstream sector, being those areas that require further preventive measures once they have influence on the water quality and quantity in the main reservoirs of this watershed.

AB  - The recycling of spent lithium-ion batteries brings benefits to both economic and environmental terms, but it can also lead to contaminants in a workshop environment. This study focused on metals, nonmetals and volatile organic compounds generated by the discharging and dismantling pretreatment processes which are prerequisite for recycling spent lithium-ion batteries. After discharging in NaCl solution, metal contents in supernate and concentrated liquor were detected. Among results of condition #2, #3, #4 and #5, supernate and concentrated liquor contain high levels of Na, Al, Fe; middle levels of Co, Li, Cu, Ca, Zn; and low levels of Mn, Sn, Cr, Zn, Ba, K, Mg, V. The Hg, Ag, Cr and V are not detected in any of the analyzed supernate. 10 wt% NaCl solution was a better discharging condition for high discharge efficiency, less possible harm to environment. To collect the gas released from dismantled LIB belts, a set of gas collecting system devices was designed independently. Two predominant organic vapour compounds were dimethyl carbonate (4.298 mg h(-1)) and tert-amylbenzene (0.749 mg h(-1)) from one dismantled battery cell. To make sure the concentrations of dimethyl carbonate under recommended industrial exposure limit (REL) of 100 mg L-1, for a workshop on dismantling capacity of 1000 kg spent LIBs, the minimum flow rate of ventilating pump should be 235.16 m(3) h(-1).

AB  - Pacific salmon are a dominant component of the northeast Pacific ecosystem. Their status is of concern because salmon abundance is highly variable-including protected stocks, a recently closed fishery, and actively managed fisheries that provide substantial ecosystem services. Variable ocean conditions, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), have influenced these fisheries, while diminished diversity of freshwater habitats have increased variability via the portfolio effect. We address the question of how recent changes in ocean conditions will affect populations of two salmon species. Since the 1980s, El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events have been more frequently associated with central tropical Pacific warming (CPW) rather than the canonical eastern Pacific warming ENSO (EPW). CPW is linked to the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), whereas EPW is linked to the PDO, different indicators of northeast Pacific Ocean ecosystem productivity. Here we show that both coho and Chinook salmon survival rates along western North America indicate that the NPGO, rather than the PDO, explains salmon survival since the 1980s. The observed increase in NPGO variance in recent decades was accompanied by an increase in coherence of local survival rates of these two species, increasing salmon variability via the portfolio effect. Such increases in coherence among salmon stocks are usually attributed to controllable freshwater influences such as hatcheries and habitat degradation, but the unknown mechanism underlying the ocean climate effect identified here is not directly subject to management actions.

AB  - Blooms of Dinophysis ovum and Mesodinium spp. have been observed in the Gulf of Mexico since 2007 using the Imaging FlowCytobot technology. Bloom dynamics of these two organisms in conjunction with ancillary environmental data for a 5-year period were analyzed to identify the conditions necessary for bloom initiation or presence with the goal of predicting future blooms of D. ovum. Using time-series analysis, we observed a positive time-lagged correlation between the two organisms in each year when both were present, which suggests that the presence of Mesodinium may be useful as a leading indicator for a D. ovum bloom. Although in some cases D. ovum and Mesodinium co-occurred, no strong predator-prey relationship was observed. We identified a narrow range of temperature and salinity that could be necessary for bloom initiation of D. ovum and Mesodinium in the Gulf of Mexico. Analysis of images over the time series revealed a wide range in the size of Mesodinium cells, which suggests that species other than M. rubrum may be present in the Gulf of Mexico. Based on the occurrence of a D. ovum bloom preceded by low abundances of Mesodinium, we suggest that D. ovum is able to utilize ciliates other than M. rubrum as prey. Our observations indicate that environmental conditions, as well as Mesodinium abundance and species composition, can affect initiation, presence or abundance of D. ovum and thus may help in the prediction of future blooms.

AB  - Carotenoprotein, containing astaxanthin as the prosthetic group was extracted from the carapace shells of the lobster, Jasus lalandii. The material, with a molecular mass of around 400 000 Da and lambda(max) 525 nm (alpha-crustacyanin), was readily converted under the conditions used for extraction and on standing to the Subunit (beta-crustacyanin) of molecular mass around 40 000 Da and lambda(max) 560 run. The latter complex was Stable Lip to 65 degrees C and between pH 5 and 8. Both the large molecule and the subunit showed the reversible bathochromic shift (lambda(max) similar to 480 nm) after being subjected to conditions of heat above 65 degrees C and below 85 degrees C and pH between 3 and 10, which alter the natural protein orientation. Above 85 degrees C and outside of the pH range, the shift was irreversible. Crustacyanin from J. lalandii differed from the blue crustacyanin of the Homarus species with respect to visible spectra (lambda(max) 632 nm and lambda(max) 585 nm) and by displaying a hypsochromic shift between the alpha- and beta-crustacyanin. Stability of the alpha-crustacyanin and affinity to DE52 also differed. Yellow protein, with a lambda(max) 409/410 nm as described for the Homarus species was not detected in this J. lalandii study, although it may have been co-eluted. The properties of the extracted complex show potential for its use as a natural water Soluble food colourant or temperature sensitive indicator. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The studied Alfisols were developed on Quaternary calcareous deposits and belong to the great group of Rhodoxeralfs. They occur usually in the meso-Mediterranean bioclimatic zone and are affected by water deficit during the summer period. They are located mainly on backslope geomorphic surfaces, old terraces, and alluvial fans, and their erodibility is medium to low. Trends of decreased iron content in the deeper soil layers due to severe drainage conditions may be responsible for relatively low values of free iron oxides (Fed). The rather limited variation of Fed may reflect the specific pedogenetic conditions in which red soils were formed. Indices of pedogenesis [Feo/Fed (Feo: amorphous Fe), Fed-Feo, and iron illuviation index of Fed] indicated that the studied pedons are at different stages of development. Redness indices (RI) of Bt horizons in pedons were found in the following decreasing order: P1 = P5 P4 = P6 P2 P3. There were no clear trends of free manganese oxide (Mnd) distribution with depth. The lack of correlation between Mnd and clay or Fed suggested that Mnd oxides do not take part in the co-illuviation of clay and Fed oxides. Acidity, low content of organic carbon, exchangeable potassium (K+), available phosphorus (P), and water deficit are the main impediments to crop production on these soils. Geomorphological and physicochemical properties suggest that rotation schemes, minimum tillage, liming practices, soil leveling, use of proper irrigation systems, and micronutrient application are among the suggested practices to sustain crop production and mitigate erosion risk.

AB  - A whole-lake alum treatment was applied to eutrophic Spring Lake during October and November 2005. Eight months later. an ecological assessment of the lake was performed and compared with data collected in 2003 and 2004. Field measurements showed reduced soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in the water column the summer after the alum application, but chlorophyll levels and irradiance profiles were not significantly affected. Total macroinvertebrate density declined significantly in 2006 compared with 2004, with chaoborids and oligochaetes experiencing the greatest reductions. Internal phosphorus release rates, measured using sediment cores incubated in the laboratory, ranged from -0.052 to 0.877 mg TP m(-2) d(-1) under anaerobic conditions. These internal loading rates were significantly lower than those measured in 2003 at three out of four sites. Mean porewater SRP concentrations were lower in 2006 than in 2003, but this difference was statistically significant only under aerobic conditions. The NaOH-extractable SRP fraction in the sediment was also significantly lower in 2006 compared with 2003, whereas the HCl-extractable SRP sediment fraction showed the opposite pattern. Overall, these results indicate that the alum treatment effectively reduced internal P loading in Spring Lake. However, watercolumn phosphorus concentrations remain high in this system, presumably due to high external loading levels, and may account for the high chlorophyll levels. An integrated watershed management approach that includes reducing internal and external inputs of P is necessary to address the cultural eutrophication of Spring Lake.

AB  - The effects of microcystins from cyanobacterial cells on various oxidative stress biomarkers in liver, kidney and gill tissues in freshwater tilapia fish (Oreochromis sp.) were investigated under laboratory conditions. Microcystins are a family of cyclic peptide toxins produced by species of freshwater cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). Fish were exposed to the cyanobacterial cells in two ways: mixed with a commercial fish food or crushed into a commercial fish food so that the toxins were released. Two different exposure times were studied: 14 and 21 days. The oxidative status of fish was evaluated by analyzing the level of lipid peroxidation (LPO), as well as the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR). The findings of the present investigation show that microcystins induce oxidative stress in a time-dependent manner and that the type of administration of the cyanobacterial cells influences the extent of these effects. Thus, the crushed cyanobacterial cells (released toxins) induced the antioxidant defences studied and increased the LPO level to a greater extent than the non-crushed cells. The liver was the most affected organ followed by kidney and gills. These results together with reports that fish can accumulate microcystins mean that cyanobacterial blooms are an important health, environmental and economic problem. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Latest field research and palaeoenvironmental reconstructions have revealed that within less than 6000 years the eastern Sahara experienced a dramatic climatic change similar to that in the western Sahara, passing from hyperaridity to semi-aridity (dry savanna) to its present hyperarid state. Groundwater levels started to rise about 9300 years before present (C-14 years BP), leading to the formation of a mosaic of freshwater rakes and swamps. Within a few decades, the aquifers were loaded and the palaeopiezometric surface was as much as 25 m higher than it is today. The uplands generated up to 800 km long fluvial systems, which put an end to the endorheic drainage of the region and functioned as migration paths for large savanna mammals. These wetter conditions persisted in western Nubia during the Holocene until ca 5000 years BP The climatic deterioration began around 5700 years BP as shown by evaporitic sediments. Reversal events prior to aridification during the Late Holocene were not recorded systematically in the sediments of the eastern Sahara because of the stability of the ecosystems. Changes in land-surface conditions such as palaeolakes, swamps and vegetation created water vapour sources that generated local rainfall and buffered short dry spells. Radiocarbon-dated charcoal indicates that Neolithic human occupation culminated during this Early Holocene wet phase and ended ca 2000 years after the fading of the wet phase at about 3000 years BP, when the shallow aquifers were exhausted.

AB  - Drugs of abuse can cause local and systemic hyperthermia, a known trigger of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR). Another trigger of ER stress and UPR is ER calcium depletion, which causes ER exodosis, the secretion of ER-resident proteins. In rodent models, club drugs such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') can create hyperthermic conditions in the brain and cause toxicity that is affected by the environmental temperature and the presence of other drugs, such as caffeine. In human studies, MDMA stimulated an acute, dose-dependent increase in core body temperature, but an examination of caffeine and MDMA in combination remains a topic for clinical research. Here we examine the secretion of ER-resident proteins and activation of the UPR under combined exposure to MDMA and caffeine in a cellular model of hyperthermia. We show that hyperthermia triggers the secretion of normally ER-resident proteins, and that this aberrant protein secretion is potentiated by the presence of MDMA, caffeine, or a combination of the two drugs. Hyperthermia activates the UPR but the addition of MDMA or caffeine does not alter the canonical UPR gene expression despite the drug effects on ER exodosis of UPR-related proteins. One exception was increased BiP/GRP78 mRNA levels in MDMA-treated cells exposed to hyperthermia. These findings suggest that club drug use under hyperthermic conditions exacerbates disruption of ER proteostasis, contributing to cellular toxicity.

AB  - Disaster risk is not only associated with the occurrence of intense hazard events but also with the vulnerability conditions that facilitate disasters when such events occur. Vulnerability is closely linked to social processes and governance weaknesses in disaster-prone areas, and is usually related to a set of fragilities, susceptibilities, and issues regarding the lack of resilience of the exposed human settlements. The holistic risk assessment aims to reflect risk from a comprehensive perspective by using, in one hand, the physical risk or potential physical damage directly linked to the occurrence of hazard events and, on the other hand by capturing how underlying risk drivers or amplifiers-social, economic, environmental issues, non-hazard dependent elements, worsen the current existing physical risk conditions in terms of lack of capacity to anticipate or resist, or to respond and recover from adverse impacts. This article presents the results of the holistic evaluation of risk as well as of the implications of risk for development obtained at global level in the framework of the UN Atlas-GAR: Unveiling Disaster Risk, using the probabilistic physical risk results, obtained from the multi-hazard Global Risk Assessment 2015, socioeconomic indicators and macroeconomic flow variables available in worldwide databases for more than 200 countries and territories. These results are useful to identify risk drivers that are associated not only to the physical vulnerability of countries' assets but also to social, economic and financial issues that should be examined and tackled in a comprehensive way.

AB  - Desmids are unicellular green algae dominating habitats that are vulnerable and highly threatened, like raised bogs, mires and fens. Here, we studied the desmid diversity in four different localities on the Danish island Bornholm. A total of 186 species, 58 of which not previously recorded from Denmark, were observed. The species composition of the locality 'Kohullet' was compared to more than 130 year-old records. In the 1880s this locality contained 65 species vs 70 in in the present study. The species composition has changed towards more oligo-mesotrophic and more acidophilic species. The reasons for these changes may be the 1960-1970s' increase in atmospheric deposition of nitrous- and sulphurous oxides leading to a pH-decrease, and the possible use of Kohullet in the 1880s for cattle drinking leading to more mesotrophic conditions than present days conditions. We used an empirical system developed by Coesel for classifying the trophic state or 'conservation value' of freshwater habitats using desmids as indicator organisms. All localities studied had maximum scores, i.e. represented highly structured and well-balanced ecosystems. Thirty of the recorded species were potential Red List species, using the Dutch Red List criteria for desmids. We suggest that Kohullet should be considered an Important Plant Area (IPA), as it has a high diversity of desmids, a long history of algal records including desmids and may be considered a threatened habitat of major significance to desmids. Furthermore, it is suggested that several desmids are considered Red List species.

AB  - Outdoor thermal comfort is one of the most influential factors in the habitability of a space. Thermal level is defined not only by climate variables but also by the adaptation of people to the environment. This study presents a comparison between inductive and deductive thermal comfort models, contrasted with subjective reports, in order to identify which of the models can be used to most correctly predict thermal comfort in tree-covered outdoor spaces of the Mendoza Metropolitan Area, an intensely forested and open city located in an arid zone. Interviews and microclimatic measurements were carried out in winter 2010 and in summer 2011. Six widely used indices were selected according to different levels of complexity: the Temperature-Humidity Index (THI), Vinje's Comfort Index (PE), Thermal Sensation Index (TS), the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), the COMFA model's energy balance (S), and the Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET). The results show that the predictive models evaluated show percentages of predictive ability lower than 25 %. Despite this low indicator, inductive methods are adequate for obtaining a diagnosis of the degree and frequency in which a space is comfortable or not whereas deductive methods are recommended to influence urban design strategies. In addition, it is necessary to develop local models to evaluate perceived thermal comfort more adequately. This type of tool is very useful in the design and evaluation of the thermal conditions in outdoor spaces, based not only to climatic criteria but also subjective sensations.

AB  - An integrated multiproxy analysis from westernmost Mediterranean hemipelagic sediments has provided further insights into natural climate variability and forcing mechanisms in this region during the last two millennia. Two deep-sea marine records, with a robust age model provided by the activity-depth profiles of Pb-210 and Cs-137, together with C-14 dating, allowed us to perform a detailed reconstruction of paleoenvironmental and paleoceanographic responses during the Medieval Climate Anomaly' (MCA), the Little Ice Age' (LIA), the Industrial period (IP) and the second-half of the 20th century. Decreasing trends of fluvial-derived element (Si) and a increasing eolian input (Zr/Al ratio) characterized the MCA and the second-half of the 20th century as prevalent dry periods, while generally humid conditions are evidenced during the LIA and the IP, in accordance to a positive and a negative mode of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), respectively (Trouet et al., 2009). The LIA developed as a sequence of successive short and abrupt dry-humid phase alternation. Furthermore, a noteworthy and sharp decrease of redox-sensitive elements (V/Cr and Ni/Co ratios) and coarser sortable silt at ad 1450 and 1950 yr, support more energetic hydrodynamic conditions at this time (oxygenated bottom waters and faster bottom currents), likely promoted by strengthened cooler waters flowing into the Mediterranean Sea.

AB  - Low-molecular mass proteins rich in cysteines called metallothioneins (MT) can be considered as markers for the pollution of the environment by metals. Here, we report on suggestion for an automated procedure for the isolation of MT followed by voltammetric analysis. Primarily, we optimized the automated detection of MT using an electrochemical analyser. It was found that the most sensitive and repeatable analyses are obtained at a temperature of 4 degrees C for the supporting electrolyte. Further, we optimized experimental conditions for the isolation of MT by using antibody-linked paramagnetic microparticles. Under the optimal conditions (4 h long interaction between the microparticles and MT), the microparticles were tested on isolation of various amounts of MT. The lowest isolated amount of MT by antibody-linked paramagnetic microparticles was 5 mu g ml(-1) of MT (50 ng). The automated procedure of MT isolation was further tested on isolation of MT from guppy fish (Poecilia reticulata) treated with silver(I) ions (50 mu M AgNO3). The whole process lasted less than five hours and was fully automated. We attempted to correlate these results with the standard method for MT isolation. The correlation coefficient is 0.9901, which confirms that results are in good agreement. Moreover, the concentration of silver ions in tissues of fish treated with Ag(I) ions was determined by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection.

AB  - The tolerance of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to desiccation is important for the use of this microorganism in the wine industry, since active dry wine yeast is routinely used as starter for must fermentations. Many studies have shown the complexity of the cellular effects caused by water loss, including oxidative injuries on macromolecular components. However the technological interest of yeast drying was not addressed in those studies, and the dehydration conditions were far from the industrial practice. In the present study a molecular approach was used to characterize the relevant injuring conditions during pilot plant dehydrations under two different drying temperatures (i.e., 35 and 41 degrees C). We have analyzed expression changes for several stress gene markers and we have determined two biochemical redox indicators (glutathione and lipid peroxidation levels) during pilot plant dehydrations to produce active dry biomass, according to the standard practice in industry. The main gene expression response involves the induction of genes TRR1 and GRX5, corresponding to the two main redox balance systems, thioredoxins and glutathione/glutaredoxins. Elevated glutathione content and significant lipid peroxidation damage indicate the physiological impact of the oxidative stress on cellular components. The comparison between commercial stocks and pilot plant samples demonstrate the suitability of the molecular approach at the pilot plant scale to study physiological traits of industrial yeast products.

AB  - Evaluating the impacts of point source discharges on fish species in estuarine environments can be challenging because of a paucity of resident species. We evaluated the biology of rock gunnel (Pholis gunnellus) at three relatively uncontaminated sites in the Bay of Fundy, along the Atlantic coast of Canada. Rock gunnel are seasonally resident (April to November) in tide pools, but little was known about their life history in Atlantic Canada or their potential for use for monitoring environmental quality. Fish were collected between April and November, and ranged from 2.46 g-15.2 g in weight and 97 mm-170 mm in length, with a maximum age of 7 years. Both males and females were similar in size, and both reached sexual maturity at a size of 5.5 g. Organ weights and condition indices of fish were stable from spring when they returned from offshore (April to May) until late summer (August to September), but fall fish (October to November) had slightly larger gonads, livers and condition indices. Rock gunnel may be a useful indicator to provide insight into local impacts of point sources over a short time period. However, they do not provide adequate information on reproductive development and performance since they are not exposed to onshore contaminants during the periods of gonadal development that have most commonly found to be sensitive to anthropogenic stressors.

AB  - This study was aimed to purified and characterized the bacteriocin produced from Lactobacillus acidophilus HT1, in order to use it in a skin pharmaceutical formula. The optimal conditions for bacteriocin production was investigated and results showed that modified nutrient broth was the best medium with glucose (30 gm/L) and yeast extract (7 gm/L) with peptone (7 gm/L) were the optimum carbon and nitrogen sources. In addition, 2% inoculum size, 37C degrees and pH 6.4 were the optimal conditions to obtain maximum bacteriocin of 640 AU/ml after 24 hrs. The bacteriocin was purified using 70% ammonium salt saturation and gel filtration with sephadex G50 that resulted 20 % yield and 2560 AU/ml of activity, then the partial purified bacteriocin was characterized and found the bacteriocin was protein in nature and kept its activity after 10 min at 20, 30 and 40 degrees C, however 50% of the activity was lost at 50C degrees. Moreover, it showed stability at pH 6 and 7 for 30 min whereas; no activity was observed at pH 4 and 9. In addition, results showed that bacteriocin has a bactericidal effect rather than bacteriostatic. A cream formula contained the bacteriocin was prepared which already examined in vitro and in vivo. The effectiveness of the formula was confirmed using Klebsiella sp., Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as indicator strains. Results established that treatment at the onset time was more effective and the time of healing was decreased.

AB  - A recent large-scale welfare study in North America involving 106 Asian (Elephas maximus) and 131 African (Loxodonta africana) elephants at 64 accredited facilities identified links (i.e., risk factors) between zoo environmental factors and a number of welfare outcomes (stereotypic behavior, ovarian acyclicity, hyperprolactinemia, walking and recumbence, body condition, health status, serum cortisol). For this population of elephants, we used the same epidemiological methods to examine associations between those risk factors and two additional welfare outcomes, mean concentration and individual variability (CV) of fecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations (FGM) as indicators of stress. Results indicate that African elephants are more responsive to social stressors than Asians, and that poor joint health is a stress-related welfare problem for Asian, but not African elephants in the North American population. For both species, higher FGM concentrations were associated with zoos located at more northern latitudes, whereas lower FGM concentrations were associated with having free access to indoor/outdoor spaces, and spending more time in managed interactions with staff. Also important for captive management, elephants having diverse enrichment options and belonging to compatible social groups exhibited reduced intra-individual variability in FGM concentrations. Our findings show that aspects of the zoo environment can be potential sources of stress for captive elephants, and that there are management activities that may facilitate coping with zoo conditions. Given species differences in factors that affected FGM, targeted, species-specific management approaches likely are needed to ensure good welfare for all elephants.

AB  - New environments are known to be anxiogenic initially for many animals including the zebrafish. In the zebrafish, a novel tank diving (NTD) assay for solitary fish has been used extensively to model anxiety and the effect of anxiolytics. However, studies can differ in the conditions used to perform this assay. Here, we report the development of an efficient, automated toolset and optimal conditions for effective use of this assay. Applying these tools, we found that two important variables in previous studies, the direction of illumination of the novel tank and the age of the subject fish, both influence endpoints commonly measured to assess anxiety. When tanks are illuminated from underneath, several parameters such as the time spent at the bottom of the tank, or the transitions to the top half of the tank become poor measures of acclimation to the novel environment. Older fish acclimate faster to the same settings. The size of the novel tank and the intensity of the illuminating light can also influence acclimation. Among the parameters measured, reduction in the frequency of erratic swimming (darting) is the most reliable indicator of anxiolysis. Open source pipeline for automated data acquisition and systematic analysis generated here and available to other researchers will improve accessibility and uniformity in measurements. They can also be directly applied to study other fish. As this assay is commonly used to model anxiety phenotype of neuropsychiatric ailments in zebrafish, we expect our tools will further aid comparative and meta-analyses.

AB  - During high-water events, backward erosion piping poses a serious threat to the stability of artificial levee structures. Sand boils forming on the land-side of levees are presently the best indicator of active backward erosion piping, but surveying these features across extensive levee works during flood events is time and resource intensive. Using geographic information system (GIS) technology and a probabilistic statistical analysis, this study assimilates geologic, environmental, and spatial relationship data to generate models to predict the likelihood of sand boil development. Data such as unfavorable geologic orientation, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and blanket thickness are assigned to over 100km of levees along the Waal and IJssel rivers of the Netherlands. A binary logistic regression is then applied to identify factors with statistically significant relationships to historical sand boil locations, and generate a predictive model using the significant factors. The logit models generally support previous findings indicating unfavorable orientation of geologic deposits and NDVI have a significant relationship with the spatial occurrence of sand boils. Despite this statistical significance, the best predictive model yields an accuracy only 10.83% higher than a random prediction model. Given variance in factors between models, sand boil formation appears to be dependent on a combination of conditions experienced on a local scale. Furthermore, attempting to predict sand boils using a single logit model across multiple geologic environments reduces the influence of region-specific conditions, yielding a less effective model than evaluating the systems individually.

AB  - The article presents a mini review of the published research focused on understanding environmental and human health impacts nearby waste incineration plants. We found no studies indicating that modern-technology waste incineration plants, which comply with the legislation on emissions, are a cancer risk factor or have adverse effects on reproduction or development. There are several factors in favor of this affirmation: (a) the emission levels of the plants currently built in the developed countries are several orders of magnitude lower than those of the plants in whose environments epidemiological studies have been carried out and which have found some kind of negative association in terms of health; (b) risk assessment studies indicate that most of the exposure is produced through the diet and not by a direct route; and (c) monitoring dioxin level studies in the population resident in the environment of incineration plants did not reveal increases of these levels when compared with a population living in reference areas. A necessary condition for the development of a waste incineration plant is to generate the conditions to prevent any impact that activates or potentially carries damage or risks to the environment and, in particular, to health. This makes it imperative to use a preventive strategy through the implementation of a previous environmental impact assessment and the establishment of emissions standards and an emissions monitoring program in order to ensure the prevention of environmental damage.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the physiological responses of a submerged macrophyte to a floating filamentous green algal bloom in clear-water conditions. Elodea nuttallii was grown with floating Cladophora sp. at four different levels (0, control; 140, 280, 560 g FW/m(2)) in an outdoor experimental system, and its photosynthetic and antioxidant systems were evaluated. The presence of floating Cladophora sp. significantly changed the water environment by decreasing light intensity and increasing dissolved oxygen and the pH value. The photosynthetic parameters of E. nuttallii (e.g. Delta F/F-m',F-v/F-m, total chlorophyll) were higher in the presence of floating Cladophora sp. than in the control at the beginning of experiment. Because of the increasing dissolved oxygen concentration and pH value, the values of these indicators decreased (except for photosynthetic pigments) during the experiment. Compared with E. nuttallii in the control, E. nuttallii growing in the presence of floating Cladophora sp. showed higher malondialdehyde content, catalase activity, and peroxidase activity. The biomass of E. nuttallii was decreased by about 30% in the presence of high biomasses of floating Cladophora sp. (280 and 560 g FW/m(2)). These results suggest that floating Cladophora had complex effects on the biomass of E. nuttallii and that changes in water quality resulting from floating Cladophora sp. may be more important than its direct shading effect.

AB  - Despite the increasing recognition of the need for building resilience among poor farmers in developing countries in the face of changing climate conditions, there is a lack of information on the various factors influencing their resilience capacity. This paper develops an indicator-based Resilience Capacity Index (RCI) aimed at a better understanding of the factors influencing resilience capacity of the most hazard-prone riparian rural households in Bangladesh, as a case study in a developing country. The RCI is a relative measure and the value ranges between 0 and 1, where the higher the value the higher the resilience capacity. The index value of 0.297 for riverine mainland households is significantly higher than that for char (island) households (0.201). However, the lower index values in both locations infers the households' inability to cope with and adapt to the impacts of climate change and associated hazards due to a lack of adaptation options along with their poor socio-economic conditions. The main drivers of the resilience capacity include livelihood strategies, level of education, and access to food, water and health services. Creating employment opportunities, increasing the level of education, and ensuring access to food, water and health services are potential climate-resilient strategies that are likely to enhance the resilience capacity of most vulnerable riparian households across Bangladesh, with some experiences which may be replicable elsewhere.

AB  - Live-cell imaging is a powerful technique that can be used to directly visualize biological phenomena in single cells over extended periods of time. Over the past decade, new and innovative technologies have greatly enhanced the practicality of live-cell imaging. Cells can now be kept in focus and continuously imaged over several days while maintained under 37 degrees C and 5% CO2 cell culture conditions. Moreover, multiple fields of view representing different experimental conditions can be acquired simultaneously, thus providing high-throughput experimental data. Live-cell imaging provides a significant advantage over fixed-cell imaging by allowing for the direct visualization and temporal quantitation of dynamic cellular events. Live-cell imaging can also identify variation in the behavior of single cells that would otherwise have been missed using population-based assays. Here, we describe live-cell imaging protocols to assess cell fate decisions following treatment with the anti-mitotic drug paclitaxel. We demonstrate methods to visualize whether mitotically arrested cells die directly from mitosis or slip back into interphase. We also describe how the fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (FUCCI) system can be used to assess the fraction of interphase cells born from mitotic slippage that are capable of re-entering the cell cycle. Finally, we describe a live-cell imaging method to identify nuclear envelope rupture events.

AB  - Biomagnifying organohalogenated compounds (OHCs) may have adverse effects on the health of birds, especially marine avian top predators that accumulate high OHC loads. Contaminants may impair the humoral immunity and also influence the antioxidant enzyme activity (i.e. oxidative stress). Moreover, physical conditions and oxidative stress during development may reduce telomere lengths, one of the main mechanisms explaining cell senescence. To examine the potential effects of environmental contaminants on physiological biomarkers of health, OHCs with different 'physicochemical' properties were related to immunoglobulin Y levels (IgY; humoral immunity), superoxide dismutase enzyme (SOD) activity in blood plasma, and telomere length (measured in red blood cells) in individual 7-8 weeks old nestlings (n = 35) of white-tailed eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla) in the Norwegian Sub-Arctic. Different organochlorines (OCs) and perfluoroalkylated substances (PFASs) were measured in blood plasma of nestlings, demonstrating higher concentrations of the emerging contaminants (PFASs), notably perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), compared to legacy OCs. There were no relationships between the contaminant loads and plasma IgY levels. Moreover, differences between years were found for telomere lengths, but this was not related to contaminants and more likely a result of different developmental conditions. However, there were significant and negative relationships between the OC loadings and the SOD activity. This suggests that some legacy OCs challenge the antioxidant capacity in nestlings of white-tailed eagles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigates the applicability of selected pharmaceutical compounds (e.g. sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, ibuprofen) as anthropogenic indicators for the interaction of surface water and groundwater in the hyporheic zone of an alluvial stream. Differences in transport behaviour and the resulting distribution of the pharmaceuticals in the riverine groundwater were evaluated. The investigated field site in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Europe is represented by low permeable sediments and confined aquifer conditions. Water samples from single-screen and multilevel observation wells installed in the riverbank at the field site were taken and analysed for selected pharmaceuticals and major ions for a period of 6months. Surface water and groundwater levels were recorded to detect effluent and influent aquifer conditions. Nearly all pharmaceuticals that were detected in the stream were also found in the riverine groundwater. However, concentrations were significantly lower in groundwater than in surface water. A classification into mobile and sorbing/degradable pharmaceuticals based on their transport relevant properties was made and verified by the field data. Gradients with depth for some of these pharmaceuticals were documented and a more detailed understanding of the system stream/riverbank was obtained. It was demonstrated that the selected pharmaceutical compounds can be used as anthropogenic indicators at the investigated field site. However, not all compounds seem to be suitable indicators as their transport behaviour is not fully understood. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The direct quantification of multiple pathogens has been desired for diagnostic and public health purposes for a long time. In this study, we applied microfluidic quantitative PCR (qPCR) technology to the simultaneous detection and quantification of multiple food-and waterborne pathogens. In this system, multiple singleplex qPCR assays were run under identical detection conditions in nanoliter-volume chambers that are present in high densities on a chip. First, we developed 18 TaqMan qPCR assays that could be run in the same PCR conditions by using prevalidated TaqMan probes. Specific and sensitive quantification was achieved by using these qPCR assays. With the addition of two previously validated TaqMan qPCR assays, we used 20 qPCR assays targeting 10 enteric pathogens, a fecal indicator bacterium (general Escherichia coli), and a process control strain in the microfluidic qPCR system. We preamplified the template DNA to increase the sensitivity of the qPCR assays. Our results suggested that preamplification was effective for quantifying small amounts of the template DNA without any major impact on the sensitivity, efficiency, and quantitative performance of qPCR. This microfluidic qPCR system allowed us to detect and quantify multiple pathogens from fecal samples and environmental water samples spiked with pathogens at levels as low as 100 cells/liter. These results suggest that the routine monitoring of multiple pathogens in food and water samples is now technically feasible. This method may provide more reliable information for risk assessment than the current fecal contamination indicator approach.

AB  - Aims: The aim of the study was to assess whether, for vineyards in Vaud (Switzerland), vine water status might be a major natural factor in determining wine sensory characteristics, i.e., responsible for the so-called "terroir" effect.
   Methods and Results: The impact of vine water status on fruit and wine characteristics was examined for 23 non-irrigated locations with different soil water holding capacities during three seasons (2007-2009). In 2009, a close relationship was observed between delta C-13 and soil water holding capacity. Furthermore, the level of vine water status influenced both fruit and wine composition. Berry weight was strongly correlated to vine water status. The highest grape soluble solids content (SSC) at harvest was reached when water deficit was mild. Wine colour was related to vine water status: wine made from grapevines with low water status showed a significantly higher colour density. However, sensory analysis did not discriminate between wines from different water conditions.
   Conclusion: In a dry year like 2009, vine water status was related to soil water holding capacity and determined grape and wine characteristics. However, no clear relationship was observed between wine sensory characteristics and vine water status.
   Significance and impact of the study: This study confirms the importance of soil in determining grape and wine characteristics through its effect on vine water status.

AB  - There is concern regarding microbial water quality in many pastoral catchments in New Zealand which are home to numerous livestock and wild animals. Information on microbial impacts on water quality from these animals is scarce. A framework is needed to summarise our current knowledge and identify gaps at the scale of an individual farm. We applied a Monte Carlo modelling approach to a hypothetical dairy farm based on the extensive data sets available for the Toenepi Catchment, Waikato, New Zealand. The model focused on quantifiable direct inputs to the stream from ducks, cows and farm dairy effluent (FDE) during base-flow conditions. Most of the inputs of Escherichia coli from dairy farms occur sporadically and, therefore, have little effect on the expected median stream concentrations. These sporadic inputs do however, have a strong influence on extrema such as 95th percentile values. Current farm mitigations of fencing streams and using improved management practices for applying FDE to land, such as low application rate deferred FDE irrigation systems, would appreciably reduce faecal microbial inputs to the stream. However, the concentrations of E. coli in rural streams may not reduce as much as expected as wild fowl living in streams would have a larger effect on water quality than a farm in which environmental mitigations are widely implemented.

AB  - This study demonstrates how conventional ecological knowledge on species together with models resulting from functional traits can be tested and refined by tapping large data sources that have been made available through recent electronic compilations. The study is based on the comparison of three rare, closely related flood-meadow violet species, which have been supposed to have similar ecological behaviour and niche occupation. In contrast, the analysis of 335 Central European releves using different methods of numerical ordination, classification and calibration revealed distinct differences in habitat preferences between the three species. Detrended correspondence analysis ordination, and multiple-response permutation procedures and TWIN SPAN classification displayed the separation of Viola persicifolia from V. elatior and V. pumila along a moisture and base-richness gradient, while the latter two differed mostly in terms of mowing compatibility. Although the three violets are considered to be weak competitors they may be found under nutrient-poor as well as nutrient-rich site conditions. The distribution of C-S-R strategy types in releves supported the hypothesis that at more fertile sites the violets crucially depend on disturbance by management or flooding events that create gaps and weaken strong competitors, while at less productive sites they may persist for a long time even under fallow conditions. The S/R strategy is shared by all three violets. Problems and perspectives arising with the use of phytosociological databanks as a source of ecological information are discussed.

AB  - The concentration of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in leaves is primarily a product of airborne exposures and dependent upon bioconcentration factors and release rates. The bioconcentration factors for VOCs in grass are found to be related to their partitioning between octanol and air equivalent to a relationship previously determined for PCBs. The rate that leaves release VOCs is dependent upon meteorological conditions and the enthalpy of phase change between air and plant. The enthalpy of phase change (Delta H-PA) for a compound in leaves is closely related to its enthalpy of vaporization. The BCF and Delta H-PA for a compound vary among plants but are highly correlated to each other. The change in BCF by plant (and correlated change in Delta H-PA) is likely due to differences in the amount of octanol-equivalent matter contained in their leaves. The concentration of airborne VOCs is predicted to maximize near dawn simultaneous with natural inversion patterns. A model incorporating this phenomenon with other meteorological data, Delta H-PA, and BCF is a useful tool predicting concentrations of VOCs in leaves. Vegetation can be especially useful in capturing VOCs at the critical time that air exposures are greatest. How long a leaf might retain a compound after uptake is dependent on the compound, the leaf type, and the magnitude of the wind and temperature. During calm weather, leaves can be used as a record of these early morning exposures. However, windy conditions quickly clear leaves of their VOC content.

AB  - Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) objectives include the return of more natural salinity regimes to the bays and estuaries of southern Florida (U.S.A.). We examined for spatiotemporal patterns in rainwater killifish (Lucania parva) density and size with emphasis on relations with salinity, salinity variation, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), temperature, and depth. Using linear quantile mixed models (LQMM) and cluster analyses, we analyzed 18 consecutive wet-dry seasons (9 years) of enclosure trap data from 44 fixed stations along mainland shoreline of southern Biscayne Bay, Florida. The LQMM results suggested that SAV was the strongest influencing, and (potentially) most limiting, habitat variable on killifish density, and that decreases in mean salinity and salinity variation may result in higher killifish densities in our study domain. Killifish size-habitat relationships were few. Cluster analysis of stations, based on killifish densities across time, failed to reveal clear spatial fish density gradients, consistent density hot-spots, or grouping according to median habitat conditions. However, cluster analysis of seasons, based on killifish densities across space, indicated that high densities were associated with the wet season and low densities with the dry, although this depended on year. Our analyses suggest that realization of lower salinities and lower salinity variation in our study domain, if they are not accompanied by SAV decreases, may enhance killifish populations and/or their role as prey. Owing to its high stress -tolerance and extreme variability in density, L. parva is not an ideal indicator species of CERP-modified salinity conditions, but warrants tracking as restoration activities ensue.

AB  - The ten-year experiment on the soil physical properties of biochar-amended Podzol was studied. Biochar was applied to the soil in the following rates: treatment BC10-10 Mg x ha(-1), treatment BC20-20 Mg x ha(-1), treatment BC30-30 Mg x ha(-1) and treatment BC0-Control (soil without the addition of biochar). Biochar was mixed the soil arable layer (0-20 cm). Soil samples were collected ten times, once a year-after harvest rye. They were taken from layers: 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm, in six replicates, using 100 cm(3) metal cylinders. The soil physical properties were determined: particle size distribution, particle density, bulk density, total porosity, air capacity and permeability (at -15.5 kPa), water content at sampling, field water capacity (at -15.5 kPa), available and unavailable water content, and the ratio of field water capacity and total porosity was calculated. It was found that biochar application causes changes in the soil physical condition. The soil density decreased, while the porosity, aeration and water retention increased; the ratio of field water capacity and total porosity was favorable. These changes cannot be considered as permanent. Most of the analyzed properties showed a durability of no more than 3-4 years. We found that biochar incorporation into soil is a good method for environmental management of waste biomass.

AB  - The sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase 2s (SnRK2s) have been shown to play critical roles in the response to environmental stresses in higher plants. Although the SnRK2 genes family has been identified in various plants, little is reported regarding SnRK2s in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), which is one of the most important crops for both food and sugar production. In the current study, the SnRK2s genes are identified in the sugar beet genome by bioinformatics, and their expression patterns under salinity conditions are tested by the qRT-PCR method. Results showed that a total of six BvSnRK2 genes are identified and characterized from the genome of sugar beet and are further classified into three distinct groups (Group 1, 2, and 3). All BvSnRK2s contained a highly conserved N-terminal kinase region and a greatly divergent C-terminal region. Except for BvSnRK2.4, most of the BvSnRK2 genes were disrupted by eight introns with size ranging from 82 to 2164 bp. Moreover, the expression levels of the BvSnRK2s genes were strongly enhanced by salt treatments, which may be an indicator of potential roles in the response to salinity. The present work is the first systematic analysis of the SnRK2 family genes in sugar beet. The results from this study provide a novel insight for the functional exploration and application of the SnRK2s genes for crop improvement, especially in sugar crops.

AB  - Among different biofuel feedstocks, algal biodiesel is seen as a promising feedstock. Different research papers have assessed the sustainability of algal biofuel production, but it is always difficult to have a better sense of the results since comparing them with all the differences in data sources, life cycle assumptions, functional units and environmental metrics measured is difficult. The present study develops a comparative life cycle assessment of algal biofuel production under autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions with different inputs. SimaPro 8 was used considering five different scenarios for microalgae cultivation to compare environmental impacts, energy demand and damage analysis associated with water scarcity methodology. Open ponds with three different assumptions of using fresh water, recycled water and waste water, and photobioreactor and heterotrophic technologies are considered. Results were analyzed per energy basis-the functional unit of 1 MJ of energy produced. Results of total GHG emissions show that algae cultivated in pond with wastewater and heterotrophic culture are competitive with tradition fossil fuels. Also the use of algae as the source of energy might increase the energy demand, whereas it does not have adverse impact on the environment, health and climate. The results of the water scarcity indicator show the competiveness of algae oil. This study presents an overview of environmental impacts throughout the full life cycle of a product through different pathways in cultivation stage which demonstrates the importance of decision-making process for further investment.

AB  - In recent years the steady trend to growth of the technogenic load of the environment closely correlates with deterioration of the health status of the population, chronic diseases and worsening of demographic indicators. One of the main threats to human health from contamination with heavy metals is associated with the influence of lead, which contributes to the development of chronic diseases of the nervous, hematopoietic, endocrine, renal and hone systems. In the process of studying the properties of zinc, its use as an osteoprotective agent is becoming more actual. In connection with the foregoing, the aim of our study was to study the content of zinc in hone tissue in low-dose isolated and combined effects of various forms of lead and zinc under the experimental conditions. For the experiment, sexually mature Wistar rats with a body weight of 150-170 g were selected, with the following randomization into six experimental and one control group, eight rats in each one. The data obtained and their comprehensive analysis allow to Ally suggest the formation of a bioantagonistic relationship between lead and zinc in the bone at the level of the latter, observed both in the isolated action of lead and in combination with zinc. Along with this, our results correspond with the data of other researchers on the osteoprotective properties of zinc under the action of even low-dose levels of lead, especially of its nanoacqualate form (zinc citrate).

AB  - There is growing interest in the development of new monitoring strategies for obtaining spatially extensive data diagnostic of microbial processes occurring in the earth. Open-circuit potentials arising from variable redox conditions in the fluid local-to-electrode surfaces (electrodic potentials) were recorded for a pair of silver-silver chloride electrodes in a column experiment, whereby a natural wetland soil containing a known community of sulfate reducers was continuously fed with a sulfate-rich nutrient medium. Measurements were made between five electrodes equally spaced along the column and a reference electrode placed on the column inflow. The presence of a sulfate reducing microbial population, coupled with observations of decreasing sulfate levels, formation of black precipitate (likely iron sulfide), elevated solid phase sulfide, and a characteristic sulfurous smell, suggest microbial-driven sulfate reduction (sulfide generation) in our Column. Based on the known sensitivity of a silver electrode to dissolved sulfide concentration, we interpret the electrodic potentials approaching 700 mV recorded in this experiment as an indicator of the bisulfide (HS-) concentration gradients in the column. The measurement of the spatial and temporal variation in these electrodic potentials provides a simple and rapid method for monitoring patterns of relative HS- concentration that are indicative of the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Our measurements have implications both for the autonomous monitoring of anaerobic microbial processes in the subsurface and the performance of self-potential electrodes, where it is critical to isolate, and perhaps quantity, electrochemical interfaces contributing to observed potentials.

AB  - 1. Justifying the designation of protected areas often depends on the ability to select areas in good ecological conditions, with high taxonomic richness, and unique habitats or species assemblage characteristics.
   2. The ecology of scleractinian coral and prosobranch snails were examined along the Masoala Peninsula of north-eastern Madagascar using rapid assessment methods to evaluate the correspondence between unique invertebrate faunal characteristics and park designation.
   3. The reefs along this peninsula are in good ecological condition and have a coral and snail fauna similar to most of the western Indian Ocean, with no indications of local endemism in these groups. There was no relationship between the taxonomic richness of snails and corals. Corals were better at distinguishing locations based on taxonomic richness while snails were better based on unique faunal characteristics.
   4. Corals had the highest taxonomic richness on the extreme windward north and south and the lowest richness on the leeward side of the peninsula. The leeward side did, however, have an unusual habitat of corals growing on granite rock with a unique coral and snail fauna. A northern and southern assemblage characterized snail fauna on the windward side of the peninsula.
   5. The composite findings indicate that the currently designated park areas cover two of the three areas that have either high diversity or unique faunas. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Bryophytes are an important plant group with long-term dominance in alpine habitats. The alpine environment is however severe, and may restrict variation in bryophyte life history. This study examines the relationship between frequencies of bryophyte species and their life history traits between and within two alpine environments that differ in important environmental variables identified for bryophytes: 1) an oceanic region, with humid acidic soils (Setesdal) and 2) a sub-continental region, with more dry, productive, base-rich soils (Hol). A comparison between regions showed a higher frequency of base-demanding bryophytes in the sub-continental region. Sexual reproduction was more common among bryophytes in the oceanic region and these species also had higher indicator values for oceanic conditions and temperature as expected. Several life history traits were strongly correlated with bryophyte frequencies in the oceanic region-local species abundance increased in relation to shoot longevity, dioicism ( mainly vegetative reproduction), and high humidity indicator values, but decreased for species with asexual propagules ( gemmae). No traits were correlated with bryophyte frequencies in the sub-continental region. The importance of life history traits in the oceanic region indicates that severe environmental factors override bryophyte community heterogeneity only in the oceanic, acidic region. A possible explanation for higher environmental stress favoring tolerant long-lived species with vegetative reproduction could be higher grazing pressure, which is also reflected in significantly lower cryptogam coverage and correspondingly larger area of open soil in the oceanic region.

AB  - Levels of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and the xylenes (BTEX) in different indoor microenvironments such as offices, homes, schools, shopping malls and restaurants were investigated in Hong Kong. Different indoor environments including six offices, six homes, six air-conditioned classrooms, six shopping malls and four restaurants were selected in Hong Kong for indoor and outdoor BTEX measurement. This study is aimed to determine qualitatively or semi-quantitatively sources of BTEX. Source identification is possible by determining the indoor/ outdoor (I/O) concentration ratio. An I/O ratio > 1 was considered as an indicator for indoor sources. For BTEX in different indoor environments except for schools, some of the pollutants were dominated by outdoor sources while others mainly originated from indoor sources. In schools, however, the BTEX predominantly originated from outdoor sources. The potential sources of BTEX in indoor environments were also identified by using principal component analysis and nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test. The number of variables was reduced to two and one new factors for indoor and outdoor data, respectively. These factors were related to certain source characteristics. It is shown that the type of land use, the use of printers, the traffic condition, the cooking style, the type of gas stove, smoking and internal decoration strongly influence the indoor concentrations of BTEX (p<0.05). Significant difference of BTEX concentrations in the five types of indoor environments were also observed (P<0.05). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Two populations of Salpa thompsoni, collected from the Weddell-Scotia confluencc area at the end of two summers (1994 and 1995) with contrasting densities, are compared. The present study was aimed at corroborating whether fluctuations in abundance could be related to sonic life history parameters considered as indicators of growth rate in salp populations, such as the body size of solitary reproductive individuals, number of buds per block or chain in the stolon, and the offspring to parent ratio. No differences were observed in the sizes reached by aggregate individuals, or in the size at which oocyte maturity was attained (moment at which the development of the embryo can be detected). There were no differences in the size reached by the embryos during their residence inside the mother's blastozooid. In 1995, the percentage of non-fecundated blastozooids (which included even the largest individuals) was higher than in 1994. The mean size of the solitary individuals was significantly higher in 1994 than in 1995. The number of buds per block was also significantly higher in most of the stages, confirming that this is the mechanism used by these organisms to produce swarms. This species eventually attains high population densities under favourable environmental conditions such as poor sea-ice cover in winter. Under optimal conditions, the number of potential descendants produced by a single solitary individual would exceed 800.

AB  - In the present study we suggest the use of kinematics for measuring locomotive abilities of two lamb crossbreds, bred for meat production (Berrichons and BMC), facing three environmental conditions: walking on a regular mud floor, walking on a stony ground and jumping from an uphill slope. In order to observe their locomotive strategy, animals were free to move around. Classical kinematic analysis was modified in relationship to the experimental context. Spatial and temporal data (stride length and duration, time interval between footfalls of limbs, amplitude of angular variations of articular segments) were collected to quantify motor coordination and limb posture, The BMC spontaneously adopted a more extensive scale of gaits with lateral sequences, they also used a wider range of speeds (0.8-2.5 m/s) with larger stride length (0.82 m) on the regular floor. On the stony ground, both breeds adapted their gaits in the same way, walking slowly (0.5-1.2 m/s). A large behavioural difference appeared between both breeds during the approach phase of the jump. For example, Berrichons slowed down and adjusted the feet position before jumping. Conversely, BMC showed the greatest manoeuverability as regards the obstacle. This study shows a difference in locomotive stategies between breeds according to the exercice. It underlines a better ability of BMC to walk in the varying conditions that characterise extensive grassland. Thus, the data of kinematic analysis should be used as an indicator for the selection of production animals.

AB  - In the present work, we analysed time series data on the introduction of new non-indigenous species (NIS) in the Mediterranean between 1970 and 2017, aiming to arrive at recommendations concerning the reference period and provisional threshold values for the NIS trend indicator. We employed regression analysis and breakpoint structural analysis. Our results confirm earlier findings that the reference conditions differ for the four Mediterranean subregions, and support a shortening of the reporting cycle from six to three years, with a two-year time lag for the ensuing assessment. Excluding Lessepsian fishes and parasites, the reference period, defined as the most recent time segment with stable mean new NIS values, was estimated as 1997-2017 for the eastern Mediterranean, 2012-2017 for the central Mediterranean, 2000-2017 for the Adriatic and 1970-2017 for the western Mediterranean. These findings are interpreted primarily on the basis of a basin scale temperature regime shift in the late 1990s, shifts in driving forces such as shellfish culture, and as a result of intensified research efforts and citizen scientist initiatives targeting NIS in the last decade. The threshold values, i.e., the three-year average new NIS values during the reference period, are indicative and will ultimately depend on the choice of species and pathways to be used in the calculations. This is discussed through the prism of target setting in alignment with specific management objectives.

AB  - Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data provides robust information for the United States Forest Service's (USFS) mid-to-broad-scale planning and assessments, but ecological challenges (i.e., climate change, wildfire) necessitate increasingly strategic information without significantly increasing field sampling. Small area estimation (SAE) techniques could provide more precision supported by a rapidly growing suite of landscape-scale datasets. We present three Regional case studies demonstrating current FIA uses, how SAE techniques could enhance existing uses, and steps FIA could take to enable SAE applications that are user-friendly, comprehensive, and statistically appropriate. The Northern Region uses FIA data for planning and assessments, but SAE techniques could provide more specificity to guide vegetation management activities. State and transition simulation models (STSM) are run with FIA data in the Southwestern Region to predict effects of treatments and disturbances, but SAE could support model validation and more precision to identify treatable areas. The Southern Region used FIA to identify existing longleaf pine stands and evaluate condition, but SAE techniques within FIA tools would streamline analyses. Each case study demonstrates a desire to have FIA data on non-forested conditions and non-tree variables. Additional tools to measure statistical confidence would help maximize utility. FIA's SAE techniques could add value to a widely used data set, if FIA can support key supplements to basic data and functionality.

AB  - Many countries are concerned about how concentrations of outdoor air pollutants have decreased due to control measures aftermath of the COVID-19 outbreak. In Saudi Arabia, the measures started with suspending entry to Saudi Arabia on February 27, 2020, and ended with full prevention of Saudis for outdoor movement on April 2, 2020, until the back return to normal life by the start of September 2020. These measures are expected to impact air quality levels during this period by decreasing the concentrations of air pollutants. This paper investigates the major trends of ambient air pollution (SO2, NO2, CO, O-3, and PM10), and maps the spatiotemporal variability of air pollutants in Makkah city, using a continuous air quality monitoring network (6 sites) during the pre-pandemic period. Findings indicate the presence of a significant decrease of concentration rates during the lockdown period, compared with the pre-pandemic period, by 26.34% for SO2, 28.99% for NO2, 26.24% for CO, 11.62% for O-3, and 30.03% for PM10. Therefore, the vehicular traffic activities represent 25-30% of the total air pollution load in Makkah city. The COVID-19 lockdown conditions in Makkah provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of the reduction of vehicular traffic activities on the air quality levels of Makkah city and similar mega-cities and introduce credible solutions to improve the conditions of the ambient environment and air quality in such settings.

AB  - The stage of degumming of vegetable oils is carried out in order to extract polar lipids - phospholipids. The efficiency of this stage depends not only on the low final content of phospholipids in the refined oil, but also on the safety of the used degumming agents, speed, easiness of degumming and low cost of the process. The process of degumming of sunflower oil in the presence of a new degumming agent - calcium acetate has been studied. Calcium acetate (food additive E 263) is a safe substance that is completely absorbed by the human body and does not have a negative impact on the environment. Rational conditions for degumming to obtain the oil with a phospholipid content of. 0.05% have been established. Rational conditions for degumming in the presence of calcium acetate have been determined. The main indicators of the quality of refined oil and lecithin obtained as a result of degumming have been investigated. They comply with the requirements of the current regulatory documents. One of the disadvantages of sunflower lecithin is its ability to be changed from a liquid to a plastic state, namely,, to increase the viscosity during storage. The double technological effect of using calcium acetate has been proven - it is an effective degumming agent and an additive, is able to significantly reduce the viscosity of lecithins, obtained at the hydration stage, to the values at which they do not form plastic modification.

AB  - Background and aimsEndophytic fungi colonization is an eco-friendly strategy to respond to environmental stresses and confer tolerance to the host plant. Here, the responses of wheat plant inoculated with an indole acetic acid (IAA) -producing endophytic fungus to drought stress and water recovery were evaluated.MethodsThe inoculation of wheat plants with Alternaria alternata (LQ1230) was conducted to evaluate drought resistance under adequate water, water deficit and water recovery conditions by examining the growth parameters and various physiological indicators of wheat seedlings.ResultsThe LQ1230 isolated from Elymus dahuricus Turcz could secrete indole acetic acid (IAA) by both the tryptophan-dependent (319.2414.88 mu g/mL) and independent (40.12 +/- 8.59 mu g/mL) pathways. LQ1230 inoculation enhanced wheat growth and drought tolerance through regulation of antioxidant enzyme activities and the content of compatible solutes such as soluble sugars and proline. Additionally, LQ1230 inoculated plants demonstrated significantly improved photosynthesis, C and N accumulation of wheat plants, leading to a positive relationship with plant dry biomass under water deficit and re-watering conditions.Conclusions We found that the improved wheat plant growth, photosynthesis and nutrient accumulations by the inoculation of Alternaria alternata LQ1230 might be attributed to the reprogramming of wheat plant metabolism, thus enhancing wheat drought tolerance. Inoculation with fungal endophytes such as LQ1230 has the potential to increase crop drought resistance.

AB  - Advection of hot air from a warmer to a cooler surface is known to enhance evaporation through additional supply of energy, provided that water is readily available. This study investigated advection in an isolated irrigated vineyard in the Negev desert, over a period of several months under changing plant cover and environmental conditions, and for different degrees of water availability. Field, canopy, and soil energy balance fluxes were assessed, as well as likely indicators of advection such as wind speed, VPD, vertical temperature gradients between the soil, the canopy air space, and the air, and lateral temperature gradients between the vineyard and the surrounding desert. It was found that for a period from May to July, advection enhanced transpiration by 8%, where diurnal patterns suggested that most of the advection originated from within the field. At times, soil-to-canopy advection enhanced transpiration by as much as 30-40%. Wet irrigated strips likewise experienced soil-to-soil advection from drier soil, but to a much lesser degree. A surprisingly large difference was observed in the contribution of advection to transpiration between June (2%) and July (11%), which had almost identical environmental conditions. This indicates that small changes in the agro-system such as row-width and leaf area could have a large impact on within-field advection, and that row crops could potentially be managed to reduce or enhance advection.

AB  - Climate models predict widespread increases in both drought intensity and duration in the next decades. Although water deficiency is a significant determinant of plant survival, limited understanding of plant responses to extreme drought impedes forecasts of both forest and crop productivity under increasing aridity. Drought induces a suite of physiological responses; however, we lack an accurate mechanistic description of plant response to lethal drought that would improve predictive understanding of mortality under altered climate conditions. Here, proxies for leaf cellular damage, chlorophyll a fluorescence, and electrolyte leakage were directly associated with failure to recover from drought upon rewatering in Brassica rapa (genotype R500) and thus define the exact timing of drought-induced death. We validated our results using a second genotype (imb211) that differs substantially in life history traits. Our study demonstrates that whereas changes in carbon dynamics and water transport are critical indicators of drought stress, they can be unrelated to visible metrics of mortality, i.e. lack of meristematic activity and regrowth. In contrast, membrane failure at the cellular scale is the most proximate cause of death. This hypothesis was corroborated in two gymnosperms (Picea engelmannii and Pinus contorta) that experienced lethal water stress in the field and in laboratory conditions. We suggest that measurement of chlorophyll a fluorescence can be used to operationally define plant death arising from drought, and improved plant characterization can enhance surface model predictions of drought mortality and its consequences to ecosystem services at a global scale.

AB  - An efficient chiral liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry method has been developed for the determination of metoprolol (MTP) and three of its major metabolites, namely O-desmethylmetoprolol (O-DMTP), alpha-hydroxymetoprolol (alpha-HMTP) and metoprolol acid (MTPA) in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influents and effluents. The optimized analytical method has been validated with good quality parameters including resolution >1.3 and method quantification limits down to the ng/L range except for MTPA. On the basis of this newly developed analytical method, the stereochemistry of MTP and its metabolites was studied over time in effluent/sediment biotic and sterile microcosms under dark and light conditions and in influents and effluents of 5 different WWTPs. MTP stereoselective degradation was exclusively observed under biotic conditions, confirming the specificity of enantiomeric fraction variations to biodegradation processes. MTP was always biotransformed into MTPA with a (S)-enantiomer enrichment. The results of enantiomeric enrichment pointed the way for a quantitative assessment of in situ biodegradation processes due to a good fit (R-2 > 0.98) of the aerobic MTP biodegradation to the Rayleigh dependency in all the biotic microcosms and in WWTPs because both MTP enantiomers followed the same biodegradation kinetic profiles. These results demonstrate that enantiomeric fractionation constitutes a very interesting quantitative indicator of MTP biodegradation in WWTPs and probably in the environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Damietta coast is part of the Egyptian Mediterranean coast off the Nile Delta and has recently been polluted as a result of intensive human activities. The environmental parameters and protozoan community in the area were studied biweekly from January to December 2007. The results of the environmental parameters indicated low salinity, oxic and anoxic conditions, high nutrient levels and intensive phytoplankton growth. A total of 69 protozoan species were identified, belonging to Amoebozoa (8 species), Foraminifera (12 species), non-tintinnid ciliates (22 species) and tintinnids (27 species). The numerical density of protozoans was high over the whole area, with annual averages between 8.2 x 10(3) cells m(-3) and 51.4 x 10(3) cells m(-3). Spring was the most productive season for protozoans, but several distinct peaks were observed during the year at the sampling sites. The protozoan groups showed clearly different spatial patterns in both composition and abundance: whereas amoebozoans and non-tintinnid ciliates were dominant in the more polluted areas (sites IV and V), tintinnids dominated in the less polluted areas (sites, I, II and III). Several pollution indicators were recorded: amoebozoans - Centropyxis aculeata, Centropyxis sp., Cochliopodium sp., Difflugia sp.; non-tintinnids - Bursaridium sp., Frontonia atra, Holophrya sp., Paramecium sp., Paramecium bursaria, Vasicola ciliata, Vorticella sp., Strombidium sp.; tintinnids - Favella ehrenbergii, Helicostomella subulata, Leprotintinnus nordgvisti, Tintinnopsis beroidea, Stenosemella ventricosa, Tintinnopsis campanula, T. cylindrica, T. lobiancoi, Eutintinnus lusus-undae.

AB  - The family of Enterobacteriaceae is a useful indicator for hygiene conditions in food production facilities and food products. For powdered infant formula (PIF) the absence of Enterobacteriaceae in 100 g is required. Nevertheless, occasionally Enterobacteriaceae can be detected. A recent study concentrated on the occurrence of a specific foodborne pathogen out of the Enterobacteriaceae family, Cronobacter spp., in PIF manufacturing facilities in order to investigate clonal persistence and identify possible transmission routes. The aim of this study was to genotype isolates from frequently found other species within the family of Enterobateriaceae in order to elucidate and trace back transmission routes not only limited on Cronobacter spp.
   In total 216 isolates from three different species (Enterobacter (E.) cloacae, Klebsiella (K.) pneumoniae and Leclercia (L.) adecarboxylata) were genotyped. The isolates originated from raw ingredients, environment and products of an infant formula processing plant. Restriction digest with Xbal revealed discriminative PFGE patterns consisting of 10-20 bands for all three species. Heat sensitive additives could be traced back as contamination source for products. Furthermore, the production environment was found as a reservoir for persisting strains. Showing analogy to the situation described for Cronobacter spp., especially E. cloacae that can be found in the same niches as Cronobacter spp. but more frequently might therefore be used for hygiene monitoring along the processing chain. Certain genotypes of E. cloacae, that are able to persist within the factory environment, might possess special properties as e. g. enhanced desiccation tolerance enabling them to survive the harsh environmental conditions.

AB  - Soil enzyme activity can be used as an indicator of soil quality for assessing the sustainability of agricultural ecosystems. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of conservation tillage practices, such as no tillage and reduced tillage (subsoil-bedding and shred-bedding), and conventional tillage practices, such as mouldboard ploughing, on physical-chemical, biochemical and physical soil quality indicators in a degraded sorghum field under warm subtropical conditions, after a period of 3 years. An adjacent soil under native vegetation was used as a standard representing local high quality soil. Conservation tillage systems, in particular no tillage, increased crop residue accumulation on the soil surface. Soil electrical conductivity and pH were not affected by the tillage practices. In the 0 to 5 cm layer, organic matter content increased with decreasing tillage intensity and was 33% greater with no tillage compared with the average of the other tillage treatments. The no tilled soil had higher values of water soluble C, dehydrogenase, urease, protease, phosphatase and beta-glucosidase activities and aggregate stability than tilled soils, but had lower values than the soil under native vegetation. The enzyme activity and aggregate stability showed higher sensitivity to soil management practices than did physical-chemical properties. The no tillage system was the most effective for improving soil physical and biochemical qualities. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Throughout the last decades of the 20th century, the biological threat evolved from primarily a government-controlled weapon to a tool of terrorism. One of the consequences of this trend is the near impossibility of foreseeing when and how an act of bioterrorism will occur. The suitability of food products for such an act stems from the multitude of microorganisms that may be used for contamination and the vulnerability of the products during and after processing. Tests that would enable the detection of a large variety of microorganisms quickly, reliably, and economically should also provide satisfactory means to prevent acts of malicious biocontamination of food products. Until such means become available, a priority-based approach to the problem is probably the most practical. Priorities should be determined based on a systematic risk assessment to define the relative likelihood of a certain microorganism being used in an act of malicious food contamination. Criteria to be evaluated are availability, weaponization processes, delivery of an effective dose, probability of early detection, and the microorganism's resistance to the conditions to which it will be exposed. Because the results of such an assessment may vary according to prevailing conditions, the assessment must be based on the existing circumstances. The results of the assessment should then be applied to the various procedures of food processing, which should further reduce the number of potential microbial threats. Existing methods of screening food for contaminating microorganisms and existing food safety and security procedures such as hazard analysis and critical control point programs may have to be modified to become suitable for the detection of acts of bioterrorism.

AB  - Amphibians have proved to be especially useful for monitoring environmental conditions:  in fact, during their life cycle they alternate a double array of morpho-functional characters which make larvae fit for freshwater environments and adults fit for the terrestrial ones.  The low vagility of amphibian populations and the development of adaptive strategies more similar to those of invertebrates than to those of tetrapods, allow the exploitation of these organisms as sensitive bioindicators of the environmental conditions; however these same characters appear to expose them to a decline that, in the opinion of some scientists, is global, involving areas of our planet which have not yet been altered by human action.  Among the numerous adaptations that make these amphibians closely dependent on environmental factors there are some cytogenetic characters.  It is well-known that these vertebrates exhibit genome sizes covering the widest range of values in the subphylum.  Variations in their nuclear DNA amount appear to be inversely proportional to changes in their cell metabolic rate and parallel the occurrence of heterochrony during morphogenesis.  In urodeles, the largest genomes are shown by permanently neotenic species or by species involved in wide ontogenetic repatterning by progenesis.  In anurans, the range of variability is more restricted; however, the largest genomes are found in terrestrial species with direct development, undergoing progenetic processes.  Therefore, in amphibians, adaptation appears to involve also their nuclear characters; the rapid environmental changes occurring in the last decades may affect also the cytogenetic characters of these organisms, and contribute to their global decline.

AB  - Polleniferous sediments from southern Africa associated with past warm episodes before the Last Glacial Maximum, are rare. Interpretation of environmental conditions during these phases are complicated by difficulties of dating. In sediments from the northern areas, north of 28-degrees-S, the prominence of tropical woodland pollen suggests that the period between 7000 and 6500 yr B.P. was associated with optimal temperatures during the Holocene. Identifying the warmest phase in the southern high-lying grasslands and semi-arid Karoo shrublands south of 28-degrees-S is difficult, because unlike the savanna areas of the north, they do not yield good pollen indicators for changes in temperature such as those of frost sensitive trees. However, some pollen sequences from further south along the southern coast of Africa (34-degrees-S) and at Marion Island in the Southern Ocean (47-degrees-S), suggest that the Holocene temperature optimum occurred at about the same time in the sub-antarctic area in the south and the subtropical regions in the north. The advent of moister conditions in southern Africa during the early to middle Holocene, is generally recorded earlier (ca. 7500-6500 yr B.P.) in the north at ca. 26-degrees-S, than around 31-degrees-S, (ca. 5000 yr B.P.). This change is provisionally associated with a relative shift in seasonality from a predominance of all-season precipitation to a greater proportion of summer rainfall, which apparently reached the southern Karoo areas two thousand years later than the northern Bushveld region.

AB  - This paper concerns the modeling of vertical Borehole Heat Exchangers (BHEs) for Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP) applications. Focus is devoted to the analyses of Thermal Response Test (TRT) simulations aimed at understanding the main factors that influence the ground thermal conductivity and the effective borehole thermal resistance estimations. The conventional infinite line-source (ILS) model does not include any influence of the external heat transfer rate on the BHE/ground property evaluation. Analyses of numerically simulated TRTs show this omission can sometimes produce an error in the estimate of the ground thermal conductivity. The error may be between +/- 10% and +/- 22% for coaxial boreholes (800 m depth), if the ground has a significant geothermal gradient. On the other hand, for single and double U-pipe BHEs the error is less than +/- 5% under similar conditions. The parameter q(ratio) is identified as an indicator of when the error is significant. This parameter is equal to the external heat rate (injection or extraction) divided by a natural heat rate that is related to the geothermal gradient. Errors greater than +/- 10% tend to occur for coaxial boreholes with a center-pipe fluid inlet when vertical bar q(ratio)vertical bar < 1. Under the same conditions but with the annulus as the fluid inlet, the error is less than +/- 6%.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi play pivotal roles in ecosystem functioning. Here, we studied the vertical differentiation of root-associated fungi (RAF) in temperate forests. We analysed RAF assemblages in the organic and mineral soil from 150 experimental forest plots across three biogeographic regions spanning a distance of about 800 km. Saprotrophic RAF showed the highest richness in organic and symbiotrophic RAF in mineral soil. Symbiotrophic RAF exhibited higher relative abundances than saprotrophic fungi in both soil layers. Beta-diversity of RAF was mainly due to turnover between organic and mineral soil and showed regional differences for symbiotrophic and saprotrophic fungi. Regional differences were also found for different phylogenetic levels, i.e., fungal orders and indicator species in the organic and mineral soil, supporting that habitat conditions strongly influence differentiation of RAF assemblages. Important exceptions were fungal orders that occurred irrespective of the habitat conditions in distinct soil layers across the biogeographic gradient: Russulales and Cantharellales (ectomycorrhizal fungi) were enriched in RAF assemblages in mineral soil, whereas saprotrophic Polyporales and Sordariales and ectomycorrhizal Boletales were enriched in RAF assemblages in the organic layer. These results underpin a phylogenetic signature for niche partitioning at the rank of fungal orders and suggest that RAF assembly entails two strategies encompassing flexible and territorial habitat colonization by different fungal taxa.

AB  - Background and Aims: The Terminalia cloud forest is endemic to a 200 km stretch of coastal mountains in southern Arabia. This research aims to describe patterns of variation in the species composition of the Terminalia forest in Dhofar, Oman and examine causal environmental factors. Study area: The Jabal Qamar mountain range, Dhofar, Oman. Methods: Hierarchical cluster analysis and indicator species analysis were used to identify and describe variants of the Terminalia forest. Topoclimatic factors, vegetation characteristics and disturbance factors were compared between the variants using ordination and ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results: Six new variants of the Terminalia forest are described. These are the Dodonaea viscosa subsp. angustifolia shrubland variant, Cadia purpurea-Olea europaea forest variant, Euclea racemosa-Jasminum grandiflorum shrubland variant, Gymnosporia dhofarensis-Ficus sycomorus woodland variant, Jatropha dhofarica-Zygocarpum dhofarense sparse woodland variant and the Premna resinosa-Hybanthus durus forest variant. A seventh variant was identified, which was previously described by Kurschner et al. (2004); the broad-leaved Blepharispermum hirtum shrubland. The species composition and environmental conditions indicate that two variants are the result of anthropogenic disturbance, whilst the other variants are well separated along fog density and topographic position gradients. Conclusions: Distinct variants of the Terminalia forest in Jabal Qamar result from spatial variability in environmental conditions associated with the complex topography, monsoon fog distributions, and anthropogenic disturbance. The results of this study could assist practitioners to rapidly identify and prioritise these variants for conservation.

AB  - The aim of this study is to develop the land quality index (LQI) based on expert opinion and multi-criteria decision support approaches for agricultural lands The study was conducted on 8 soil series and 20 land units belonging to the lands of Ankara-Giivenc Basin, Turkey which covers about 17.5 km(2), representing the ecological conditions of a semi-arid climate. In this research, 9 main indicators were chosen including depth, slope, stoniness, bulk density (BD), texture, electrical conductivity (EC), pH, organic matter (OM) and CaCO3. Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) method was used a pairwise comparison of indicators. As a result of the LQI assessment, while 17.14% of the lands were classified as "High" and 37.41% Moderate, the agricultural quality class of 41.55% of the studies land was determined as "Low" and "Very Low" and mapped in GIS. In this study, it was determined that the final index value of the land was affected by depth (24.2%), slope (21.1%) and bulk density (16.6%) indicators with high weight coefficients. In addition, the values of the LQI were compared with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values for testing and it has been determined that land quality assessment for agricultural usage has been performed with high accuracy for NDVI (r(2) = 0.74%). Finally, the results of the study showed that the LQI was achieved for micro basin scale under semi-arid climate conditions.

AB  - In this study, a biomass-based solid oxide fuel cell integrated with a gas turbine, a reverse osmosis desalination unit, and double-effect absorption chiller is proposed for power generation, cooling and fresh water production. Accordingly, environmental contamination of the proposed system is mitigated by capturing and recycling emitted CO2 into the gasifier. Subsequently, a parametric study is performed to analyze the proposed multi generation system from energy, exergy, exergoeconomic, and environmental impact viewpoints. In addition, considering the exergy efficiency as a performance indicant (to be maximized) and total product cost as an economic indicator (to be minimized) multi-objective optimization is implemented to ascertain the best operating conditions. The results of exergy and exergoeconomic analysis reveal that gasifier is the primary source of irreversibility with exergy destruction rate of 179.8 kW and the exergoeconomic factor of the cooling system components is lower than 20%. Multi-objective optimization results show that exergy efficiency and total product unit cost of the proposed system is 38.16% and 69.47 $/GJ, respectively at the optimum operating condition. Furthermore, scatter distribution of the effective parameters demonstrates that, the stack temperature difference, gas turbine pressure ratio and CO2 recycling ratio are the most sensitive parameters, which should be kept at their lowest value.

AB  - A new optimization algorithm by coupling the mutation process to the particle swarm optimization (PSO) is developed in this paper. This algorithm, entitled particle swarm optimization with mutation similarity (PSOMS), is successfully applied to an urban water resources management problem for the large city of Tabriz, Iran. The objective functions of the optimization problem are to minimize the cost, maximize water supply and minimize the environmental hazards. The constraints are physical limits such as pipelines capacity, ground water, the demand and the impact of conservation tools. Due to the parameters uncertainty, the water supply objective is modeled with fuzzy set theory and the objectives are then combined with compromise programming. The resulted single objective is solved using PSOMS, and its efficiency is then compared with the basic PSO and two kinds of genetic algorithms. Among them, PSOMS shows rapid convergence and suitable results compared to other methods. PSOMS is also improved to provide the Pareto frontier, which is needed to proper selecting of the optimal solutions in the uncertain conditions. Finally, the diversity of solutions is checked based on an indicator of the distances between different solutions, which show the efficiency of the PSOMS algorithm with respect to the genetic algorithm. Then by using the non-symmetric Kalai-Smorodinsky method a guideline is provided for comfort selection of the most preferred solution in the Pareto frontier. Based on these outcomes, the multi-objective PSOMS provides more appropriate results needed for urban systems management. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human exploitation of intertidal organisms in South Africa is an ancient activity based principally on mussels. We studied mussel populations and patterns of exploitation along a 160-km stretch of the south coast. Photographs (100 per site) were taken of the intertidal rocks at each of 14 sites, covering a range of exploitation intensities. Percentage cover was negatively correlated with number of mussel patches and positively correlated with mean shell width. PCA analysis identified groups of sites: a) accessible and unprotected sites: low cover, small mussels, patchy distribution; b) inaccessible sites and sites next to, or within, nature reserves: high percentage cover, large animals, less patchy distributions. Affluent coastal settlements also seem to confer protection against harvesting. Harvester distribution was examined by aerial surveys and combined with information on distance to the nearest beach access point and number of households within 7 km for each site. Sites within reserves and inaccessible sites had low densities of collectors, whereas sites near urban areas and in the Ciskei had the highest densities. All correlations between indicators of human exploitation and condition of mussel populations were non-significant. However, number of collectors showed positive trends with number of patches and negative trends for the two other variables. The results indicate much lower levels of exploitation than in the neighouring Transkei region, and suggest a high degree of background variability in mussel population structure.

AB  - For the first time, a single source of cellulosic biomass was pretreated by leading technologies using identical analytical methods to provide comparative performance data. In particular, ammonia explosion, aqueous ammonia recycle, controlled pH, dilute acid, flowthrough, and time approaches were applied to prepare corn stover for subsequent biological conversion to sugars through a Biomass Refining Consortium for Applied Fundamentals and Innovation (CAFI) among Auburn University, Dartmouth College, Michigan State University, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Purdue University, and Texas A&M University. An Agricultural and Industrial Advisory Board provided guidance to the project. Pretreatment conditions were selected based on the extensive experience of the team with each of the technologies, and the resulting fluid and solid streams were characterized using standard methods. The data were used to close material balances, and energy balances were estimated for all processes. The digestibilities of the solids by a controlled supply of cellulase enzyme and the fermentability of the liquids were also assessed and used to guide selection of optimum pretreatment conditions. Economic assessments were applied based on the performance data to estimate each pretreatment cost on a consistent basis. Through this approach, comparative data were developed on sugar recovery from hemicellulose and cellulose by the combined pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis operations when applied to corn stover. This paper introduces the project and summarizes the shared methods for papers reporting results of this research in this special edition of Bioresource Technology. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Macroevolution examines the temporal patterns of biological diversity in deep time. When combined with biogeography, it can provide unique information about the historical changes in the distribution of communities and biomes. Here I document temporal and spatial changes of diversity in the genus Bursera and relate them to the origin and expansion of the tropical dry forests of Mexico. Bursera is very old, highly adapted to warm dry conditions, and a dominant member of the Mexican tropical dry forest. These characteristics make it a useful indicator of the history of this vegetation. I used a time-calibrated phylogeny to estimate Bursera's diversification rate at different times over the last 60 million years. I also reconstructed the geographic center and time of origin of all species and nodes from information on current distributions. Results show that between 30 and 20 million years ago, Bursera began a relatively rapid diversification. This suggests that conditions were favorable for its radiation and thus, very probably for the establishment of the dry forest as well. The oldest lineages diverged mostly in Western Mexico, whereas the more recent lineages diverged in the south-central part of the country. This suggests that the tropical dry forest probably first established in the west and then expanded south and east. The timing of the radiations in these areas corresponds to that suggested for formations of the mountainous systems in Western and Central Mexico, which have been previously recognized as critical for the persistence of the Mexican dry forest.

AB  - We assessed adult reproductive and nesting success, and developmental instability, survival, and condition of nestling eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) breeding in nestboxes on and off golf courses. With this information we tested hypotheses predicting that nestboxes on golf-course habitat provided poor nesting and chick-rearing environments due to pesticide pollution or other factors. Contrary to our prediction, nestboxes on golf courses received 28% more bluebird eggs and produced 17% more fledglings than nestboxes on nongolf sites. Individual nests on golf courses appeared to have slightly reduced probabilities of survival during laying and incubation, but we found no depression in the overall Mayfield survival probabilities. Surprisingly, nestling bluebirds raised in golf-course boxes exhibited 39% less fluctuating asymmetry of their tarsus bones, possibly an indicator that nestlings that survived to fledge had been under less stress during development. This may have resulted from stronger selection against asymmetrical nestlings on golf courses, or it may indicate that golf-course nestboxes provide higher-quality habitat for bluebirds. Our results suggest that for this bird species, nestboxes on the golf-course habitat we studied can provide high-quality rearing environments and may serve as population sources. This may not apply to other species, including most birds of conservation concern, which do not nest in protected artificial cavities or forage directly on turfgrass habitat.

AB  - Following cessation of fish production at a fish farm site in Loch Cretan, Scotland, a study of the recovery of the benthic environment was undertaken. Sediment samples for macrofauna and geochemical parameters (redox potential, organic carbon, oxygen flux) were collected over a period of 15 months from three stations following a gradient of impact from the former fish farm site. The data collected were analysed by a combination of uni-and multivariate statistical methods. The macrobenthic community at the two stations furthest from the fish cage site showed signs of recovery with time in terms of indicator species, number of species and abundance, being, however, still moderately to slightly disturbed at the end of this study. At the station nearest to the former fish cage site, recovery of the macrobenthic community was also evident, but this station was still highly impacted 15 months after fish production ceased, with opportunistic species dominant. Fifteen months after fallowing, highly reduced conditions were still persistent in subsurface sediments at the stations on the periphery of the former fish cage site. Bulk sediment organic carbon, although an indicator of a spatial gradient, was not found to be a significant indicator of recovery. Combinations of different environmental parameters appear to affect different stages of benthic recovery with sediment oxygen uptake as the main observed parameter conditioning early stages of macrobenthic succession.

AB  - This article reviews the evolution of local environmental policy in the context of energy transition and particularly the implementation of RES. The study concerns Krakow, whose policy has been compared with other cities and metropolises and was analysed in a timespan of about 30 years. It was hypothesised that, until recently, RES were treated in the city with reserve concerning their feasibility in local environmental and economic conditions, but since RES have been appreciated as a viable means to effectively combat low-stack emissions, the local air quality targets have been integrated with global decarbonisation goals. This launched a dedicated subsidy stream for RES installations and contributed to the sharp increase in the number of installations. Trend analysis techniques have been used to study environmental indicators in relation to the evolution of municipal policies, the expenditures, and their effects. The review confirms that the implementation of RES had not been a priority for Krakow but a complementary measure to those aimed at improving air quality. The recent integration of the environmental and RES policies has been the next step that is now helping to pursue both the city's strategic goals: further air quality improvement and climate neutrality by 2050. Krakow may serve as an example of a city that has treated RES in a manner adequate to local conditions and capabilities, thus achieving the intended goals.

AB  - The presence of H2S is an incisive indicator to assess the quality of indoor and/or outdoor air. A number of metal oxide sensors have been developed to measure the concentration levels of H2S in the environmental systems. Among such sensors, In2O3-based sensors are one of the most promising options with the enhanced potential to generate highly sensitive and specific signals in diverse physical/chemical forms (such as pristine, metal-doped/loaded, and composite). Their enhanced sensing performance has been ascribed to many excellent properties (e.g., chemisorption capabilities of oxygen, direct interactions with H2S, synergetic effect with other materials, generation of sensing signals (at ambient conditions), and capabilities to interact with hydrolyzed form of H2S). It is also noted that chemoresistive sensing of In2O3-materials is a highly preferable option in terms of the strong interactivity with H2S. Herein, we have reviewed the potential of In2O3-based materials (e.g., in pure, metaldoped/loaded, and composite form) for the sensing of H2S gas with the special emphasis on operation temperature conditions (e.g., at and above room temperature). Discussion is also extended to the H2S sensing mechanisms and synthesis procedures with the future prospects on this technology. Moreover, a careful evaluation has been made to select the best available option for the In2O3-based sensing method based on the evaluation on their performance on parallel basis.

AB  - The cultivation of fresh-cut crops is shifting from traditional systems in open fields to soilless cropping systems in greenhouses. As a result, the energy requirements of crop cultivation are increasing rapidly. In this study, we analysed the economic and energetic performance of four baby leaf species (lettuce, rocket, spinach, and lamb's lettuce) cultivated in a greenhouse under floating system. Four indicators were calculated, namely fossil energy input per unit area (Enla: sum of the direct and indirect energy input per m(2) per cycle), fossil energy input per unit product (Enlp: ratio of Enla to fresh product mass per m(2) per cycle), economic efficiency (EE: ratio of the gross income per m(2) per cycle to the Enla), and gross margin (GM: the difference between the gross income and the variable costs per m(2) per cycle). In general, the Enlas obtained in this study were high (10.2-31.6 MJ m(-2) cycle(-1)). Lettuce provided the lowest Enlp (3.0 MJ kg(-1)), and the highest EEs were attained under low nutrient conditions (0.81 and 0.48 (sic) MJ(-1) for lamb's lettuce and lettuce, respectively). The GM of lettuce (on average 1.85 (sic) m(-2)) and Iamb's lettuce (1.67 (sic) m(-2)) were high. However, the consumption of fossil energy by baby leaves cultivated under soilless conditions in a greenhouse can be reduced by adopting precise nutrient management practices. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that variations in leaf anatomy and morphology reflect their adaptability to the environmental stress. A self defense mechanism system related with the trichomes on the surface of leaves for the detoxification of Pb was observed in Phaseolus mungo and Lens culinaris through light microscopy in leaves. The presence of trichomes and increase in number of stomata in the adaxial (upper) leaf surface of both species seems to constitute an important morphological mechanism for survival that allows this species to maintain good photosystem II efficiency during the stress. Foliar morphological variability in Phaseolus mungo and Lens culinaris may be considered an adaptive advantage that enables leaves to develop and function in habitats marked by strong variations of Pb toxicity with solar radiation, air temperature and humidity. These hairs may constitute a shield against Pb pollution and act as a physical barrier for the protection of plants and can act as a biomonitor of environmental contamination and biogeochemical indicator of Pb. Enhancement in the hairs on leaves at high dose of Pb may be related with reducing evaporation of water from the surface of leaves in stress condition. The protection provided by the trichomes could afford advantages under stress conditions, especially during leaf development. The importance of the increase in the number of stomata in relation with the absorption of CO2 with increase in CK enzymatic activity, creatine, glucose and reducing sugars (p<.001) for both species under the metal stress were examined.

Soc. 136: 128-136. 2009.-Pine barrens vernal ponds (PBVP) are intermittently flooded wetlands located in rare fire-prone pine barrens and sand plains supporting uniquely adapted biotic communities. In New York State, the PBVP are scarce, difficult to classify, and often threatened by human disturbance in the landscape. We analyzed existing vascular plant data from New York PBVP to quantify overall floristic condition and help clarify floristic identity of the system. Data sets included single year vegetation surveys of current known PBVP and an intensive single year survey of PBVP, red maple swamp and shallow emergent marsh in one landscape. We found high variation in species conservatism among PBVP sites and complexes, and relatively high floristic quality because of few exotic species. Quantitative floristic classification improved the a priori field-based classification and suggested a previously overlooked PBVP occurrence. Potentially useful indicators of PBVP included buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis), steeplebush (Spiraea tomentosa), leatherleaf (Chamaedaphne calyculata), and hoary sedge (Carex canescens). Our study provides an important starting point for developing a more detailed classification and monitoring scheme for PBVP around the state and the northeastern U.S.

AB  - This is the second of two articles reporting the results of a nonlethal biomonitoring study that quantified the effects of pesticide exposure on meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) living in golf course ecosystems of the Ottawa/Gatineau region (ON and PQ, Canada, respectively). In the present article, we describe results of measurements regarding developmental instability (e.g., fluctuating asymmetry), congenital birth defects (e.g., skeletal terata), clinical hematology (e.g., differential counts), general body condition (e.g., body mass-length relationships), and blood parasite load (Trypanosoma sp. and Bartonella spp.). Voles were captured during the year 2001 to 2003 at six golf courses and two reference sites. Once voles were fully sedated using isoflurane, blood was collected, radiographs taken, and morphometric measurements recorded. Three animals from each course were euthanized to determine body burdens of historically used organochlorine (OC) and metal-based pesticides. Exposure to in-use pesticides was determined from detailed golf course pesticide-use records. None of the endpoints measured was significantly related to body burdens of OC pesticides and metals historically used, nor did any endpoint significantly vary among capture sites in relation to total pesticide application to the capture site or to the number of days since the last application of pesticide. Based on these findings, it appears that voles from golf courses were no less healthy than their conspecifics from reference sites.

AB  - Effects of recreational pack stock grazing on mountain meadows in Yosemite National Park were assessed in a 5-year study. Yosemite is a designated wilderness, to be managed such that its natural conditions are preserved. Studies were conducted in 3 characteristic meadow types: shorthair sedge (Carex filifolia Nutt.), Brewer's reed grass (Calamagrostis breweri Thurber), and tufted hairgrass [Deschampsia cespitosa (L.) Beauv]. Horses and mules grazed experimental plots at intensities of 15 to 69% utilization for 4 seasons. In all 3 meadows, grazing caused decreases in productivity. The mean reduction after 4 years of grazing was 18% in the shorthair sedge meadow, 17% in the Brewer's reed grass meadow, and 22% in the tufted hairgrass meadow. Grazing also caused shifts in basal groundcover (usually a reduction in vegetation cover and increase in bare soil cover), and changes in species composition. Productivity and vegetation cover decreased as percent utilization increased, while bare soil cover increased as utilization increased. Changes in species composition were less predictably related to differences in grazing intensity. Passive management of grazing is insufficient in wilderness areas that are regularly used by groups with recreational stock. Wilderness managers need to monitor meadow conditions and the grazing intensities that occur. Our study suggests that biomass and ground cover are more sensitive indicators of grazing impact than species composition. Managers must make decisions about maximum acceptable levels of grazing impact and then develop guidelines for maximum use levels, based on data such as ours that relates grazing intensity to meadow response.

AB  - Calcite deposits formed in limestone caves have been found to be an excellent repository of palaeoclimatic data for terrestrial environments. The very presence of a relict deposit indicates non-glacial conditions at the time of formation, and both C-14 and uranium-series methods can be used to date the deposit and, hence, the age of these climatic conditions. Variations in C-13 and O-18 content of the calcite, in H-2 and O-18 content of fluid inclusions, in trace element concentrations and, more recently, in pollen assemblages trapped in the calcite, are all potentially available as synchronous palaeoclimatic indicators.
   Previous work has tended to concentrate mainly on abundance of deposits as a palaeoclimatic indicator for the last 300,000 years. This literature is briefly reviewed here, together with the theory and methods of analysis of the U-series and stable isotopic techniques. The combined use of U-series ages and C-13 and O-18 variations in cave calcites illustrates the potential for palaeoclimate determination. Previously unpublished results of stable isotopic variations in dated calcites from caves in northern England indicate the level of detail of stable isotopic variations and time resolution that can be obtained, and the complexity of interpretation that may arise. Tentative palaeoclimatic signals for the periods 90-125 ka and 170-300 ka are presented.
   More comprehensive studies are needed in future work, especially in view of the difficulty in obtaining suitable deposits and the ethics of cave deposits conservation.

AB  - Introduction: The aim of the study was to carry out epizootic assessment of male roe deer to detect the presence of Cephenemyia stimulator larvae and determine the influence of the parasite on the carcass and antler weight in animals living in different habitats. Material and Methods: The investigations were based on post-mortem analysis of Cephenemyia stimulator infestations of the nasal passages and throat of 177 male roe deer culled between May 11 and September 30, 2020 in hunting districts of the Lublin region in Poland. The individual quality of the animals was assessed by weighing the gutted carcasses after cooling, and the antlers were weighed after dissection and their total weight was determined. Results: The parasite prevalence ranged from18 to 48% according to habitat type, with a mean value of 33%. The highest prevalence was detected in bucks living in grassland ecosystems. The presence of the parasites exerted influence on the individual condition of the animals, which was reflected in reduced carcass and antler weight. The differences were found both in young individuals and in somatically fully developed animals, but they were not statistically significant in all age groups. Conclusion: Although the parasitic infestations impaired the individual condition traits, their parametric values in most cases were not lower than those reported from other regions of Poland. Despite the Cephenemyia stimulator infestation, male roe deer from the Lublin region are characterised by high carcass and antler weight.

AB  - Within the last decade, Sustainable Intensification (SI) has emerged as a strategy to respond to future food security challenges. It incorporates increased food production without the cultivation of more land while incurring no net environmental cost. Frameworks attempting to measure SI often focus heavily on production indicators while overlooking other important indicators, such as impacts on economic, social, or human conditions. In this study, we evaluate the purposeful assemblage and management of neglected and underutilized species (NUS) in fringe areas around rural homesteads as a potential SI strategy. We use a recent SI assessment framework developed by the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Collaborative Research on Sustainable Intensification (SIIL) that incorporates five measurable domains (productivity, economic, environmental, human condition, and social). We present findings from a qualitative case study in northwest Cambodia to assess local conceptualization of wild gardening, current uses of NUS, perceived benefits and challenges to their use and management, and the potential of wild gardening as a SI strategy. The qualitative methods employed 65 key informant interviews and four focus group discussions with both men and women participants. Our results indicate that wild gardening is an important component of rural livelihoods in northeast Cambodia. However, a general lack of knowledge of strategic benefits, such as nutrition potential, inhibits its use for maximum benefits. Wild gardening addresses multiple SI domains simultaneously and demonstrates the potential to be a promising SI strategy for improving rural livelihoods in Cambodia.

AB  - Vibration prediction plays a vital role in the environmental assessment of new railway lines and the vibration analysis of new buildings near railway lines. We use theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and field experiment, which can help predict vibration with high accuracy. These methods have their own advantages, but are time-consuming or costlier. This article outlines a fast, high-accuracy prediction method combining the advantages of numerical simulation, experiment, and artificial neural network. The method takes artificial neural network as one of the supervised machine learnings, and it is founded upon a fully validated three-dimensional finite element model. First, establish a three-dimensional finite element model using ANSYS software and generate series of samples by changing field conditions. Then, create an artificial neural network and train it by the samples obtained from FEM and experiment. Finally, use the artificial neural network that has been trained to predict the level of vibration on certain conditions. The result states that the predicted method can control the maximum error below 6.41% and the average error below 2.29% when it is used to predict acceleration vibration level. An advantage of this method is that it spends zero time on predicting vibration level. A key benefit from this decreased prediction time is that it potentially reduces the detailed vibration analyses required for a new train line so that it can reduce project costs. In addition, it could also consider the effect of soil parameters.

AB  - Monitoring changes in land use intensity of grazing systems in the Amazon is an important prerequisite to study the complex political and socio-economic forces driving Amazonian deforestation. Remote sensing offers the potential to map pasture vegetation over large areas, but mapping pasture conditions consistently through time is not a trivial task because of seasonal changes associated with phenology and data gaps from clouds and cloud shadows. In this study, we tested spectral-temporal metrics derived from intra-annual Landsat time series to distinguish between grass-dominated and woody pastures. The abundance of woody vegetation on pastures is an indicator for management intensity, since the duration and intensity of land use steer secondary succession rates, apart from climate and soil conditions. We used the developed Landsat-based metrics to analyze pasture intensity trajectories between 1985 and 2012 in Novo Progresso, Brazil, finding that woody vegetation cover generally decreased after four to ten years of grazing activity. Pastures established in the 80s and early 90s showed a higher fraction of woody vegetation during their initial land use history than pastures established in the early 2000s. Historic intensity trajectories suggested a trend towards more intensive land use in the last decade, which aligns well with regional environmental policies and market dynamics. This study demonstrates the potential of dense Landsat time series to monitor land-use intensification on Amazonian pastures. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study compares two fish farms in the Jihlava River basin that differ mainly in the intensity of rearing of the nase fry and in water sources. During rearing, we observed the health condition of fry from hatching to expedition at the age of one year. Four species of parasites (i.e., Ambiphrya ameiuri, Apiosoma piscicolum, Trichodina sp., Diplostomum spathaceum) were found to infest the fish and Aeromonas hydrophila was isolated by bacterial culture. In both breeding facilities the intensity and prevalence of Ambiphrya ameiuri increased during the summer. The state of health and its development including the recognised infections was similar in both farms. Immunological indicators such as differential white cell count, absolute white cell count and the oxidative burst in autumn were evaluated in the fry samples. Although fry from both farms had similar health condition, the results on immunological indicators show that fry from farm I are more exposed to the effects of stressors. In the next phase, we confronted immunological indicators of fry from farm II and brood fish from the Jihlava River. The results show differences in immunological indicators, which could be caused by a variety of stress factors having different effects on the immune system of these two fish categories. The environment affects greatly the immunity of juvenile as well as brood fish. It reflects in the different levels of immunological indicators in the comparison of fry from two farms as well as in the comparison of fry and brood fish from the river.

AB  - Phenotypic variation, measured as the coefficient of variation (CV), is usually larger in secondary sexual characters than in ordinary morphological traits. We tested if intraspecific differences in the CV between ornamental and non-ornamental feather traits in 67 evolutionary events of feather ornamentation in birds were due to differences in (1) the allometric pattern (slope of the regression line when regressing trait size on an indicator of body size), or (2) the dispersion of observations around the regression line. We found that only dispersion of observations around the regression line contributed significantly to total variation. A large dispersion of observations around the regression line for ornamental feathers is consistent with these characters showing condition-dependence, supporting indicator models of sexual selection more strongly than a pure Fisher process. Ornamental feathers in males demonstrated negative allometry when regressed on tarsus length, which is a measure of skeletal body size. This finding is consistent with ornamental feather traits being subject to directional selection due to female mate preferences, where large body size is less important than in male-male competition. This pattern of phenotypic variation for avian secondary sexual characters contrasts with patterns of variation for insect genitalia, supposedly subject to sexual selection, since the latter traits only differ from ordinary morphology traits in allometry coefficient. The prevailing regime of selection (directional or stabilizing) and the effects of environmental factors are proposed to account for these differences among traits.

AB  - The end-Triassic extinction (ETE) is associated with rapid atmospheric CO2-driven warming amplified by positive feedbacks involving weathering, nutrient oversupply, water column anoxia and sul.fate reduction. These conditions culminated in photic zone euxinia (PZE) at least locally in the Western Tethys, but its broader extent across northwest Europe has yet to be identified. Here we present new biomarker and bulk 613Corg isotopic data that document redox and palaeoecological changes from two end-Triassic sites in the Western Tethys: Felixkirk, in the Cleveland Basin, northeast England, and Lavernock Point, in the Bristol Channel Basin, S Wales. The presence of aryl isoprenoids and Chlorobi-derived isorenieratane indicates shoaling of anoxia and toxic H2S to the photic zone caused by flooding in restricted or semi-enclosed basins. Oscillating redox conditions and severe PZE prevented a swift recovery of at least the benthic ecosystem across several British basins. Additionally, in concert with recent discoveries in the Bristol Channel Basin, in the Cleveland Basin we find that the 'initial' negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) is related to a localized change in organic matter sources. PZE in British and other European basins points towards H2S toxicity as an extinction driver for the Western Tethys, highlighting the need for a global characterization of redox changes across the end-Triassic and other extinction events.

AB  - The current environmental conditions of La Redonda lagoon favor recovery largemouth bass population. The reintroduction of the species into this lagoon will be important for recreational fishing (tourism) and economic incomes to Cuba.
   For decades, La Redonda lagoon was an excellent location for fishing the largemouth bass (Micopterus salmoides, Lacepede) in Cuba. There are indications that the species disappeared from the lagoon in 2009. Three water surveys were carried out in 2013 and 2014. Physicochemical parameters, including nutrients, were measured in all surveys. Chlorophyll a and water transparency were only measured in November 2013. Results showed that this lagoon is a fresh to brackish water system, with common salinization episodes. There were some hypoxic conditions, but mean dissolved oxygen value was above 5.0 +/- 2.8 mg L-1 for the entire survey period. The trophic state was evaluated as oligotrophic and Nitrogen and Phosphorus were limiting in most of the survey sites. The Habitat Suitability Index model (HSI) for largemouth bass had a mean value of 0.63 +/- 0.02 (moderate degree of suitability). All results showed that bass recovery could be possible in La Redonda lagoon, but management criteria are necessary. The largemouth bass recovery could help to increase visitations of American anglers to this place and a portion of the revenue could be used to conduct environmental monitoring and studies of the largemouth bass ecology in Cuba.

AB  - A critical assessment criterion for road condition assessment is the amount and severity of cracking. Cracking causes a loss of structural capacity (i.e. strength and stiffness) and if severe can cause water infiltration into the subbase and subgrade, potentially leading to more serious structural failure. The onset of cracking therefore accelerates the processes of deterioration of the road. To date the accurate and reliable automated detection of road surface cracking is still problematic.
   Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) has the potential to detect cracks in materials as they cause changes in electromagnetic reflection. This paper proposes a method of automatic detection of road surface cracks using GPR and establishes the limits of its potential regarding the detectable crack size.
   Tests were conducted on asphalt pavement samples in a controlled laboratory environment. Significant changes in diffracted signal levels were observed in the GPR image when the image was analysed using a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm for clutter reduction and a median filter to reduce noise. Moreover, a manifestly enhanced performance was achieved using a novel post-processing technique, which enabled the detection of cracks larger than 1.3 mm in width. The detected cracks were detectable irrespectively of the simulated physical conditions suggesting that the developed methodology is robust for use in practice. The experimental results indicate that the GPR system can be applied to automatically detect road cracking reliably in practice. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Akure is one of the cities undergoing rapid growth in Nigeria, which has resulted to remarkable Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. To examine the impact of this development in the city and its environs, this study derived the brightness temperatures and land use land cover (LULC) types using Landsat images between 1984 and 2016, of 190/55 path and row. Normalized Difference Built up Index (NDBI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), were used as LULC indicators for sub-pixel analysis. The results of this study revealed a remarkable change in built-up area at the expense of vegetation (forest) and bare lands. The sub-pixels analysis between land use/cover indicators and temperature revealed a strong correlation between LULC and temperature in the area. Findings revealed a 4.63 degrees C temperature increase in vegetatedareas between 1984 and 2016; and an overall temperature values ranged from about 14 to 36 degrees C, which have been categorized into six classes (<20 degrees C, 20 degrees C to<24 degrees C, 24 degrees C to<28 degrees C, 28 degrees C to<32 degrees C, and >= 32 degrees C). The temperature increase over the years and the strong correlation between temperature and land use land cover suggests, that any small undesirable change in land use land cover in the future would lead to severe environmental condition.

AB  - With the aim of assessing the effects of beneficial microorganisms on greenhouse tomato plum grown under salinity conditions, research was carried out in southern Italy from summer to winter, by comparing two arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) based formulates (Rizotech Plus, Myco Apply DR) and a non-inoculated control, in factorial combination with four soil electrical conductivities (1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 6.0 mScm(-1) EC). The highest root colonization was 83% at 3.0 mScm(-1) under AMF-based treatments and 34% at 1.5 mScm(-1) in non-treated control; the latter attained lower values than AMF treatments at any soil EC. Harvest occurred 3.5 days earlier in control plants, six days earlier under 6.0 mScm(-1) EC compared to 1.5 mScm(-1). The inoculated plants always showed higher yield than the control ones and the highest production at 4.5 mScm(-1) EC; control plants attained the highest yield under 3.0-4.5 mScm(-1) EC. The highest values of most fruit quality indicators, mineral elements and antioxidant compounds and activity were recorded under AMF-based formulates inoculation and 6.0 mScm(-1) soil EC. Beneficial microorganisms proved to be an effective environmentally friendly tool for improving tomato yield and quality performances in both normal and soil salinity conditions.

AB  - This research investigates the trend in birthweight as an indicator of living conditions in early life inside North Korea, one of the most secluded nations in the world that experienced a great famine in the 1990s. Descriptive analysis based on data taken from officially released national nutrition survey reports suggests that prevalence of low birthweight (= below 2500 g) declined from 9.0% in the famine year of 1998-5.7% in the post-famine period of 2009. Mean birthweight improved from 2800 g in 1998-2940 g in 2002, although more recent surveys await implementation. Based on raw data comprising 2495 newborns measured at birth from 2000 to 2002 from a national nutrition survey conducted in 2002, neither contingency analysis nor error bar analysis showed statistically significant improvements during the observed periods. Regression analysis indicates that there is a significant positive relation between birthweight and birthyear, but the effect is negligibly small (0.0001 g). Raw data analysis of the 2002 survey further revealed that prevalence of low birthweight hovered at around 7% from 2000 to 2002. Overall, this prevalence of low birthweight was closer to the mean percentage for industrialized nations (6%) than that of developing nations (17%), although being expectedly much higher (that is, twice the rate) compared to its "twin" in South Korea (3.5%) at that time. Some technical, biological, and socioeconomic biases affecting birthweight measurements in North Korea are discussed in a latter section of this paper.

AB  - The size of the seed is an important physical indicator of the physiological quality of the seeds, since it can affect the germination rate and initial growth of the seedlings. In this context, the present study had the objective of evaluating the effects of seed size and inoculation of Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Azospirillum brasilense on seedling emergence, root nodulation and early growth of peanut (Arachis hypogaea L., cv. IAC Tatu ST). The plants were grown in 8.0 L plastic pots filled with sandy soil and kept under greenhouse conditions. The experimental design was a randomized complete block design in a 3 x 4 factorial scheme with four replications. The treatments consisted of three seed sizes (small, medium and large) and four inoculation treatments: i) control (without inoculation); ii) seed inoculation with Bradyrhizobium japonicum; iii) seed inoculation with Azospirillum brasilense; and, iv) seed co-inoculation with B. japonicum and A. brasilense. The results reported that the use of large seeds improved root nodulation, plant growth, accumulation and dry matter partition of plants. Therefore, the implantation of the peanut crop should be carried out using larger seeds, as it provides sustainability for the peanut production system, improving the biological nitrogen fixation and growth of the plants in sandy soils. Seed co-inoculation with B. japonicum and A. brasilense improved root nodulation and plant height, however, had no effect on growth, dry matter partition and morphophysiological indexes of peanut plants when grown on sandy soils under controlled conditions.

AB  - To better interpret summer maize stomatal conductance (g(s)) variation under conditions of changing water status at different growth stages, three water stress indicators, soil water content (SWC), leaf-air temperature difference (Delta T) and leaf level water stress index (CWSIL) were employed in Jarvis model, which were J(s), J(T) and J(C) models respectively. Measurements of g(s) were conducted in a summer maize field experiment during the year 2012-2013. In the insufficient irrigation experiment, three levels of irrigation amount were applied at four different growth stages of summer maize. We constructed three scenarios to evaluate the performance of the three water stress indicators for estimating maize g(s) in a modified Jarvis model. Results showed that J(T) and J(C) models had, better simulation accuracy than the model, especially at the late growth stage (Scenario 1) or considering the plant recovery compensation effects (Scenario 2). Scenario 3 indicated that the more environmental factors were adopted, the better prediction performance would be for J(S) model. While for J(T) model, two environmental factors (photosynthesis active radiation (PAR), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD)) seemed good enough to obtain a reliable simulation. When there were insufficient environmental data, CWSIL would be the bet option. This study can be useful to understand the response of plant stomatal to changing water conditions and will further facilitate the application of the Jarvis model in various environments.

AB  - In the Mediterranean, blue whiting, Micromesistius poutassou, constitutes a traditional fisheries resource. Over several decades, blue whiting landings in the Catalan coast (northwestern Mediterranean) have displayed cyclical variations, of c. 6yrs, slightly decreased to five in the last two decades, as shown through wavelet analysis. These fluctuations have persisted under very different levels of fishing effort. This study evaluates the hypothesis that deep-water formation in the adjacent Gulf of Lions, and the enhanced primary productivity related to it, determines recruitment strength in blue whiting that results ultimately in the observed periodicity of the blue whiting landings. The link between landings and environmental drivers was explored using lagged cross-correlations, with 0- and 1-yr lag. The variables considered included large-scale indices [North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO)], Mediterranean climate indices [MO and Western Mediterranean Oscillation (WeMO)], and variables defining the local environmental conditions in the northwestern Mediterranean (sea-air heat flux, winter air temperature anomaly and Rhone river runoff). Significant correlations were only found between landings (1961-2011) and sea-air heat flux, which is generally taken as an indicator of processes of deep water convection, at 0 and 1-yr lag. These results suggest that the observed fluctuations in blue whiting landings respond to oceanographic processes taking place in the Gulf of Lions.

AB  - Organic Rankine cycles can use various working fluids. Different heat sources and working conditions lead to very different optimal working fluids. This paper presents a new quantitative criterion for selecting the optimal working fluid for open type heat sources with temperatures from 150 to 350 degrees C. The heat source recovery exergetic efficiency is used as the evaluation indicator. Over 30 working fluids with critical temperature from 71.87 to 357.65 degrees C are under evaluation. The working fluid critical temperature's influence on the heat source utilization, cycle efficiency and exergetic loss in the evaporator and condenser is analyzed to show that the critical temperature is the key parameter for selecting the optimal working fluid. The critical temperature of the optimal working fluid is determined by the heat source temperature, the pinch point temperature difference and the condensation temperature. When the cooling fluid outlet temperature is between 30 and 60 degrees C, which covers the most common natural cooling condition and the requirement of combined heat and power system, the correlation between the critical temperature of the optimal working fluid and the heat source temperature with different pinch point temperature difference is given. This correlation provides concise guidance for the optimal pure working fluids selection and mixture design. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The intracellular redox environment plays an important role in the maintenance of proper cellular homeo-stasis and functions. Disturbances in redox equilibrium of cells result in pro-inflammatory conditions, and these inflammatory conditions can induce carcinogenesis or increase the malignant potential of the tumor. Oxidative stress or tissue damage can trigger toll-like receptor (TLR) family of receptors that are involved in altering the innate immune system. The present study was aimed at evaluating the level of oxidative damage markers in breast diseases by measuring the 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), protein carbonyl (PC), malondialdehyde (MDA), and total antioxidant status (TAS) alterations in relation to expression of TLR-9. A significant increase in the level of oxidative damage markers was observed in breast carcinoma patients in comparison to benign and normal controls, which was accompanied by a significant decrease in TAS and expression of TLR-9 concentrations. 8-OHdG, PC, and MDA were negatively correlated with expression of TLR-9 and TAS levels. Altered levels of biomarkers of oxidative stress and TLR-9 among the malignant, benign, and controls suggest a correlation of oxidative stress and TLR signaling in the progression of disease in breast carcinoma patients. Receiver operating characteristic analysis depicts that expression of TLR-9 is a good indicator for distinguishing cancer patients from benign and normal controls. High accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of oxidative stress markers and expression of TLR-9 can be used as discriminatory marker/s for efficient diagnosis.

AB  - Addiction is a complex psychiatric disorder considered to be a disease of the brain's natural reward reinforcement system. Repeated stimulation of the 'reward' pathway leads to adaptive changes in gene expression and synaptic organization that reinforce drug taking and underlie long-term changes in behaviour. The primitive nature of reward reinforcement pathways and the near universal ability of abused drugs to target the same system allow drug-associated reward and reinforcement to be studied in non-mammalian species. Zebrafish have proved to be a valuable model system for the study of vertebrate development and disease. Here we demonstrate that adult zebrafish show a dose-dependent acute conditioned place preference (CPP) reinforcement response to ethanol or nicotine. Repeated exposure of adult zebrafish to either nicotine or ethanol leads to a robust CPP response that persists following 3 weeks of abstinence and in the face of adverse stimuli, a behavioural indicator of the establishment of dependence. Microarray analysis using whole brain samples from drug-treated and control zebrafish identified 1362 genes that show a significant change in expression between control and treated individuals. Of these genes, 153 are common to both ethanol- and nicotine-treated animals. These genes include members of pathways and processes implicated in drug dependence in mammalian models, revealing conservation of neuro-adaptation pathways between zebrafish and mammals.

AB  - Hydrodynamic models allow for quantitative indicators to evaluate the ecological and economic effect that different management conditions will have on aquifers before being taken to practice. However, as not to consider surface recharge as a global value, it is necessary to associate these models with another hydrological one, that allows to generate the recharge data responding to a space distribution closer to reality. The integration of the hydrological SWAT model and the hydrodynamic MODFLOW is an alternative to this necessity that presented errors between 8% at the calibration stage and 11% at that of validation, for the aquifer of the Acambay Valley. In this aquifer five scenarios were simulated: I) Current tendency; II) total conversion to a crop of high profitability (onion); III) partial conversion to a crop of high profitability; IV) total conversion to a crop of high profitability modifying the distribution of wells; V) balance scenario. Since the objective of the present work was not to generate a plan of integrated management, the scenarios are theoretical in order to highlight the potential of hydrological-hydrodynamic response of the SWAT-MODFLOW integration. Likewise, in the economic analysis, only the variable costs generated by pumping were analyzed, while the production costs are considered constant, according to the utilized crop. Based on these considerations, the scenarios III and IV are the most profitable, reducing the extraction costs, while scenario V allows to improve the current conditions without overexploiting the aquifer. The comparison of scenarios 11 and IV showed the effect of spatial and volumetric distribution for one and the same global extraction volume.

AB  - To achieve the UN 2030 Agenda Goals, and considering their complexity and multidisciplinary, Multi-criteria analysis appears to be a suitable approach to give a true support to public decision makers in defining policy lines. This study focuses on the application of the Multiple Reference Point Weak-Strong Composite Indicators (MRP-WSCI) and its partially compensatory version (MRP-PCI), to assess, in the framework of the UN 2030 Agenda, the sustainability of the 28 members of the European Union (pre-Brexit). Countries were analyzed and compared according to their conditions and progress against the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, considering three reference years: 2007, 2012 and 2017. The analysis shows that Nordic countries reach a good level of global sustainability, with values of the indicators, W-W-W and S-W-W, between 2 and 3; while the States of east Europe, in particular Romania, Bulgaria and Greece, stay at the worst levels, having overall indicators values less than 1.5. Furthermore, the results highlight how countries in the lower group have difficulties especially in social and economic sustainability. On the other hand, states with a good overall condition record the worst results in the environmental dimension, such as the Netherlands, which shows, for the year 2017, a value for this sphere less than 2, while in the other two show a good value (over 2.5).

AB  - Household well-being represents a very complex concept that allows interpretation from many perspectives such as income, wealth and environment. Poverty constitutes an aspect thereof and refers to people suffering from a lack of basic needs. Poverty is defined and measured in various ways. The approach employed in developed countries appeals to relative poverty. The poverty line is set at 60% of the national median of income. Social and demographic characteristics of households are taken into account when the equivalence scale of consumption units is used. International scales may prove inadequate for local conditions in the Czech Republic. The paper aims to estimate an appropriate scale that describes specific economies of scale of Czech households. Alternative approaches to the consumption unit scale applied in some countries arise from household expenditures. Such a method could use data from Household Budget Surveys (HBS). Another method uses the utility function of households, indirectly measured by means of subjective data of financial satisfaction. The analysis is based on data from European Income and Living Conditions Surveys (SILC). Consumption units prepared according to both approaches use regression for the estimation. Subsequently, the impact of different equivalence scales of consumption units on poverty indicators is assessed for individual types of households. The results show that the estimated scales differ from scales designed by international institutions. This paper focuses primarily on the situation in the Czech Republic but provides some comparison to other European countries as well.

AB  - Sea-cage salmon farming creates ideal conditions for ectoparasites such as the salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis, with high lice densities leading to welfare challenges for stock and increasing lice burdens on wild salmonids. New treatments with low environmental impacts and minimal handling are needed to complement existing strategies. Irradiation by ultraviolet-C light (254 nm, UVC) at specific doses renders fertilised lice eggs inviable. We tested if this treatment can be applied directly to female lice with eggstrings while attached to salmon. We treated fish with attached adult lice with UVC light while they swam freely in tanks, to achieve a cumulative dose of similar to 0.1 J cm(-2) on each side of the fish within a 6-day period. To compare to fish in tanks with no UVC (control), we collected and incubated eggstrings to measure survival of resulting larvae at the infectious copepodid stage. The UVC treatment resulted in up to a 99% reduction in copepodid production relative to the control. However, UVC negatively impacted fish welfare, and was associated with early-stage cataract-like pathologies, poorer skin condition and behaviours indicative of discomfort. While UVC is highly effective at suppressing lice reproduction, the exposure regime tested here led to unacceptable animal welfare outcomes. More conservative exposure regimes may be acceptable with careful testing and calibration, but applications that do not expose host fish are preferable.

AB  - The continental colonization process by plants is an underexplored theme in Brazil, especially concerning taphonomic studies of plants that existed during this age. This study aims to interpret the taphonomic and paleoenvironmental settings that best represent the fossil plant assemblages preserved in the upper strata of the Furnas Formation (Lower Devonian of Parana Basin), at Jackson de Figueiredo county, municipality of Jaguariaiva (Parana), clarifying the potential of these fossil plant assemblages for paleogeographic reconstructions. Taphonomic and sedimentological signatures were analyzed and submitted to multivariate statistical analyses (cluster and correspondence analyses). Two taphonomic groups were identified (Taphofacies A and B). The interpretation of the two groups allowed the visualization of: Taphofacies A, which consists of samples with a dispersed degree of packing, fragmented plant fossils, 40% mica with sizes between 0.5 and 1 mm and no trace fossils, is representative of relatively high-energy conditions; and Taphofacies B, which consists of densely packed plants with partial degree of fragmentation, 10% mica with sizes under 0.5 mm and both horizontal and vertical trace fossils, is representative of relatively low-energy conditions. Our taphonomic data are consistent with previous facies interpretations of a lagoon/interdistributary bay environment. In this context, taphofacies A represents episodic sedimentation events influenced by fluvial dynamics, yielding assemblages that are not suitable for paleogeographic interpretations, while Taphofacies B represents fossil assemblages originated in a low-energy sedimentary regime, with utility for paleogeographic reconstructions.

AB  - Recent advancements in hyperspectral remote sensing technology now provide improved diagnostic capabilities to assess vegetation health conditions. This paper uses a set of 13 vegetation health indices related to chlorophyll, xanthophyll, blue/green/red ratio and structure from airborne hyperspectral reflectance data collected around a derelict mining area in Yerranderie, New South Wales, Australia. The studied area has ten historic mine shafts with a legacy of heavy metals and acidic contamination in a pristine ecosystem now recognised as Great Blue Mountain World Heritage Area. The forest is predominantly comprised of different species of Eucalyptus trees. In addition to the airborne survey, ground-based spectra of the tree leaves were collected along the two accessible heavy metal contaminated pathways. The stream networks in the area were classified and the geospatial patterns of vegetation health were analysed along the Tonalli River, a major water tributary flowing through the National Park. Despite the inflow of contaminated water from the near-mine streams, the measured vegetation health indices along Tonalli River were found to remain unchanged. The responses of the vegetation health indices between the near-mine and away-mine streams were found similar. Based on the along-stream and inter-stream analysis of the spectral indices of vegetation health, no significant impact of the heavy metal pollution could be noticed. The results indicate the possibility of the vegetation having developed immunity towards the high levels of heavy metal pollution over a century of exposure.

AB  - Tree species diversity promotes multiple ecosystem functions and services. However, little is known about how above and belowground resource availability (light, nutrients, and water) and resource uptake capacity mediate tree species diversity effects on aboveground wood productivity and temporal stability of productivity in European forests and whether the effects differ between humid and arid regions. We used the data from six major European forest types along a latitudinal gradient to address those two questions. We found that neither leaf area index (a proxy for light uptake capacity), nor fine root biomass (a proxy for soil nutrient and water uptake capacity) was related to tree species richness. Leaf area index did, however, enhance productivity, but negatively affected stability. Productivity was further promoted by soil nutrient availability, while stability was enhanced by fine root biomass. We only found a positive effect of tree species richness on productivity in arid regions and a positive effect on stability in humid regions. This indicates a possible disconnection between productivity and stability regarding tree species richness effects. In other words, the mechanisms that drive the positive effects of tree species richness on productivity do not per se benefit stability simultaneously. Our findings therefore suggest that tree species richness effects are largely mediated by differences in climatic conditions rather than by differences in above-and belowground resource availability and uptake capacity at the regional scales.

AB  - Y Aims Functional traits are usually used to predict plant demographic rates without considering environmental contexts. However, previous studies have consistently found that traits have low explanatory power for plant demographic rates. We hypothesized that accounting for environmental contexts instead of focusing on traits alone could improve our understanding of how traits influence plant demographic rates.
   Methods We used generalized linear mixed-effect models to analyse the effects of functional traits (related to leaf, stem, seed and whole plant), environmental gradients (soil nutrients, water and elevation) and their interactions on the survival dynamics of 14 133 saplings and 3289 adults in a 9-ha old-growth temperate forest plot.
   Important Findings We found that environmental variables, neighbour crowding and traits alone (i.e. main effects) influenced plant survival. However, the effects of the latter two variables varied between saplings and adults. The trait-environment interactions influenced plant survival, such that resource conservative traits increased plant survival under harsh conditions but decreased survival under mild conditions. The elevational gradient was the most important environmental factor driving these effects in our plot. Our results support the hypothesis that functional traits influence plant survival depending on environmental contexts in local communities. These results also imply that one species with limited trait variation cannot occupy all environments, which can promote species diversity.

AB  - A mesocosm system was developed to simulate estuarine conditions characteristic of short water-residence time ecosystems of the Pacific Coast of North America, and used to evaluate the response of multiple macrophyte. metrics to gradients of NO3 loading and temperature. Replicated experiments found that few responses could be directly attributed to NO3 loading up to 6 x ambient. Some response metrics exhibited weak relationships with nutrient loading but could not be resolved with available statistical power. While direct nutrient responses were found for some species-specific metrics (e.g. green macroalgal growth and biomass, tissue N%, etc.), many patterns were confounded with temperature. Temperature generally had a larger effect on response metrics than did nutrient load. Experimental macrophyte communities exhibited community shifts consistent with the predicted effects of nutrient loading at 20 degrees C, but there was no evidence of other eutrophication symptoms (phytoplankton blooms or hypoxia) due to the short system-residence time. The Z. marina Nutrient Pollution Index (NPI) tracked the NO3 gradient at 10 degrees C, but exhibited no response at 20 degrees C, which may limit the utility of this metric in areas with marked thermal seasonality. Results suggest that teasing apart the influence of temperature and nutrients on the expression of eutrophication symptoms will require complex multi-stressor experiments and the use of indicators that are sensitive across a broad range of conditions.

AB  - Methane is a greenhouse gas having well-known impacts on global radiative forcing. However, understanding the dynamics and thresholds of methane formation in peatlands, which undergo cyclic aeration and anoxia, is currently limited even though it is crucial for reliable estimation of methane emission to the atmosphere. The purpose of this study was to estimate the optimal range and thresholds of aeration conditions, which impact methane formation in upper layers of peat originating from a natural fen (East Poland). The experiment was conducted under laboratory conditions on two groups of differently treated soils which were incubated at field water capacity. One group was incubated in air and another in helium, both at temperatures of 5, 10 and 20 A degrees C. Direct soil aeration estimation included measurements of redox potential and oxygen diffusion rate. The latter was used for the first time as an indicator of methane formation in soil. Both the aerated and anoxic groups showed that methane formation took place at ODR of below 20 mu g O-2 m(-2) s(-1) and Eh of below +240 mV which are the higher threshold levels for methanogenesis than previously reported. Maximum methanogenic activity amounted up to 71.86 mg CH4 kgDW(-1) d(-1). Aeration was capable of reducing this methanogenic activity by 28-100 %. Decreasing temperatures and aeration increased the time until the initiation of CH4 production (p < 0.05, n = 72).

AB  - Plumage coloration is an important trait used by birds in mate choice decisions and is often an indicator of social status. The two main types of color-producing mechanisms in feathers are pigment deposition (pigmentary coloration) or the coherent scattering of light reflected from keratin microstructure (structural coloration). External factors acting on the feather surface are also hypothesized to affect structural coloration. Because preening is an energy and time demanding behavior, color variation caused by soiling deposition is generally assumed to strengthen the condition signaling function of plumage coloration. To date, studies using artificial soiling have confirmed those hypotheses. However, information about how natural soiling affects plumage color are still scarce. In this paper, I investigated the effect of natural soiling on structurally-based feather color of blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus. As a method, I applied mechanical cleaning that functionally mimicked natural preening. Removal of soiling caused a decrease of ultraviolet (UV) chroma in males and decrease in brightness in females. According to visual contrast modeling, only changes in brightness should be perceived by birds. Further, more efficient chemical cleaning resulted in a significant increase in brightness in both sexes, presumably due to preen wax removal. These results suggest that the impact of natural feather soiling is not likely to modify structural coloration signaling. One possible explanation is that, under natural conditions, the amount of soil accumulating on feathers is too small to affect coloration. (C) Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2011.

AB  - A thermogram or thermal image provides a two-dimensional map of skin temperature distribution. The technique, which uses the IR radiation of objects as the source for imaging, has significantly developed since it was launched for medical imaging in the 1960s. Modern focal array equipment provides both high spatial and high temperature resolution. Body temperature measurement is a traditional approach to estimating the time of death. A number of protocols have been described for that purpose. Another application for IR imaging is the assessment of environmental conditions of detected corpses (water, cars, weather conditions). Skin burns can be easily visualized by thermal images. Thermal imaging was also used to investigate the skin temperature at the entry point after shots were fired from 0.22-0.38-calibre handguns. Whiplash injuries gained importance in liability cases after car crashes. Occasionally thermal images can provide additional information in this pathology, but this might not be always unambiguous. Thermal imaging was successfully used as an alternative to Polygraph testing. In this application, psychological effects on blood flow are investigated, and an accuracy of 78% in detecting deceptive subjects is reported. Thermal imaging can be used as a method of temperature measurement in a number of applications of forensic medicine. When used for medico-legal evidence, it is important that a standard protocol for subject preparation, image capture and analysis is used. A scheme for standardization of the latter is proposed.

AB  - Current interpretations of structures are generally based on homogeneous and steady deformation models, despite the fact that both the heterogeneity of rocks (materially, rheologically and geometrically) and the time dependence of imposed geological conditions give rise to significant heterogeneous and non-steady flow. In concert with held observations, we emphasize that the expectation of heterogeneity and non-steadiness is the key to understanding natural deformation and that in order to carry out successful structural analysis and tectonic interpretation, it is necessary to recognize the first-order distinction between imposed boundary conditions typically used to define the tectonic regime (e.g. transcurrent, transpression) and the response recorded by rocks within the zone (structures and fabrics). Using S-C fabric as an example, it is demonstrated how how with a nonzero spinning component resulting from the rheological contrasts and/or geologically realistic time-dependent boundary displacement can drastically change the 'ideal' geometric and kinematic relations between the fabric and the host zone. In agreement with both theoretical analysis and field observation, it is shown that natural flow regimes range from pure shear to pure rotation, including super-simple shear. In consideration of the heterogeneity and non-steadiness of natural deformation, kinematic analysis is justifiable only within a homogeneous domain and steady period. Flow kinematics and mechanisms are interrelated in that, firstly, mechanisms provide internal constraints on kinematics, ensuring that only certain flows are possible and, secondly, how kinematics will favour development of certain mechanisms.

AB  - Twenty-four strains of Emiliania huxleyi and two strains of Gephyrocapsa oceanica were grown at 15 degrees C under identical culture conditions to assess genetic variability in key lipid biomarker profiles (C-37-C-39 alkenones, C-36 and C-37 alkyl alkenoates, and C-31-C-38 alkenes). Under our culture conditions, little divergence in biomarker composition was detected between E. huxleyi strains from different oceanic regions or between E. huxleyi and G. oceanica even though the strains originated from biogeographical regions as diverse as the subpolar North Atlantic and subtropical Western Pacific. The major differences observed were in tetraunsaturated alkenone abundance and alkene profiles, which tended to separate neritic from open ocean strains. Different strains from the same locality were as different as strains originating from widely separated ocean basins, indicating extreme genotypic diversity within a population. Replicate cultures of the same strain showed significant variability in their biomarker profiles even though the culture temperature varied by only +/-0.3 degrees C, indicating that their synthesis ratios are influenced by environmental and/or physiological variable(s), as yet unidentified, in addition to temperature. Strong covariance in C-37 and C-38 methyl alkenone unsaturation ratios (U-37(k)' and U-38M3(k), respectively) and, in coastal strains, C-33 alkene and alkenone unsaturation ratios indicates that these compounds are biochemically linked.

AB  - Large-scale mining can alter the living conditions of surrounding communities in positive and negative ways. A health impact assessment conducted in the context of a newly developed large-scale copper mine in rural Zambia gave us the opportunity to measure changes in health determinants over time. We conducted periodic household surveys at baseline in 2011, during the construction phase in 2015 and during the operational phase in 2019. Data collected included economic indicators that were based on the standardized list of household assets used in the Zambia Demographic and Health Survey, which we subsequently converted into a wealth score using principal component analysis. We compared mean wealth scores in six communities directly impacted by the mine with comparison communities, as well as the rest of the North-Western province of Zambia. A difference-indifferences linear regression model was used to compare changes over time. Mean wealth of the communities near the mine was significantly lower at baseline than that of the North-Western province (-0.54 points; pvalue<0.001) in 2011, but surpassed the regional average in 2019 (+1.07 points; p-value <0.001). Mean wealth increased more rapidly in communities directly impacted by mine than in the comparison communities (+0.30 points, p-value <0.001). These results suggest a positive impact on living conditions in communities living near this copper mine. Our findings underscore the potential of the mining sector to contribute to economic development in Zambia.

AB  - Despite their high functional role as abundant predators, the drivers of centipede assemblages remain poorly known in forests, especially in France. Using replicated depletion quadrats, we sampled five forests distributed over the Armorican Massif. A total of 5209 individuals belonging to 20 species was collected between 2015 and 2017. Assemblage composition was surprisingly constant across parcels, with only different dominant species in the oldest parcel (Berce, Pays-de-Loire) and in the forest of Cerisy (Normandy). The latter hosted two exclusive species, likely because of both biogeographic and abiotic conditions, Geophilus truncorum and Lithobius aeruginosus. Species richness was overall close among sites and parcels, and therefore little influenced by tree age or dominant species. Individual densities varied between site pair-matched parcels, probably because of differences in temporal forest continuity rather than differences in tree ages. In quadrats, the presence of numerous ants strongly affected the number of centipedes, with global densities divided by an average factor of 7. Also at small spatial scale, we did not find a strong vertical stratification of centipede species in terms of presence-absence, with only 2 species exclusive of soil and none for litter, but with important differences in the relative abundance of dominant species. This study suggests that centipedes are important components of the forest soil and litter fauna, should be more frequently studied in French forests and have a potential of bio-indicators of local conditions in these habitats, as well as of temporal forest continuity.

AB  - Wheat grains are an important source of human food but current production amounts cannot meet world needs. Environmental conditions such as high temperature (above 30 degrees C) could affect wheat production negatively. Plants from two wheat genotypes have been subjected to two growth temperature regimes. One set has been grown at an optimum daily mean temperature of 19 degrees C while the second set of plants has been subjected to warming at 27 degrees C from two to 13 days after anthesis (daa). While warming did not affect mean grain number per spike, it significantly reduced other yield-related indicators such as grain width, length, volume and maximal cell numbers in the endosperm. Whole genome expression analysis identified 6,258 and 5,220 genes, respectively, whose expression was affected by temperature in the two genotypes. Co-expression analysis using WGCNA (Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis) uncovered modules (groups of co-expressed genes) associated with agronomic traits. In particular, modules enriched in genes related to nutrient reservoir and endopeptidase inhibitor activities were found to be positively associated with cell numbers in the endosperm. A hypothetical model pertaining to the effects of warming on gene expression and growth in wheat grain is proposed. Under moderately high temperature conditions, network analyses suggest a negative effect of the expression of genes related to seed storage proteins and starch biosynthesis on the grain size in wheat.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the productive and metabolic response in Chilota lambs grazing Calafatal or naturalized pasture. The experiment was conducted at the Experimental Station Butalcura (INIA, Chilo,) during October, November, and December 2011. Eight Chilota and six Suffolk Down 2-month-old lambs, uncastrated males, no twin, were located to graze a typical secondary succession of the Chilo, Archipelago, as a Calafatal (a secondary succession which derivates from human intervention on native forest in Chilo, Archipelago). Simultaneously, eight male 2-month-old Chilota lambs were located to graze a naturalized pasture, another secondary succession derived from human intervention on native forest in Chilo, Archipelago. Animals had free access to water sources. Measurements were performed one time a month, for three consecutive months for productive indicators: live weight, average daily gain and body condition score, and blood indicators of protein and energetic metabolism. Productive and metabolic response was similar between both types of pastures (P > 0.05). However, Chilota and Suffolk Down lambs grazing Calafatal showed higher plasma concentrations of beta OH-butyrate, but lower non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) than Chilota lambs grazing naturalized pasture (P < 0.05). Chilota lambs grazing naturalized pasture showed the highest plasma concentrations of NEFA and urea (P < 0.05). It was concluded that, under the conditions of the study, Chilota lambs grazing naturalized pasture, which had higher contents of crude protein and metabolizable energy, showed better metabolic balance, but not performance, than Chilota and Suffolk Down lambs grazing Calafatal.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity might facilitate adaptation to new environmental conditions through the enhancement of initial survival of organisms. Once a population is established, further adaptation and diversification may occur through adaptive trait evolution. While several studies have found evidence for this mechanism using phenotypic traits, much less is known at the level of gene expression. Here, we use an islands system of frog populations that show local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity to pool drying conditions in development time until metamorphoses. We examined gene expression differences in Rana temporaria tadpole livers with respect to pool drying at the source population and in response to simulated pool drying in the laboratory. Using a MAGEX cDNA microarray and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), we identified an increase in several gene transcripts in response to artificial pool drying including thyroid hormone receptor alpha and beta, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1, ornithine transcarbamylase and catalase. In addition, these gene transcripts also showed greater abundance in island populations that developed faster. Hence, the gene transcripts were related to both constitutive response (higher levels in island populations that developed faster) and plastic response (increased abundance under decreasing water levels). This pattern is in accordance with genetic accommodation, which predicts similarities between plastic gene expression and constitutive expression in locally adapted populations.

AB  - Shallow groundwater is exposed to influence from surface waters to various degrees. These can be streams as well as natural and artificial lakes, such as quarry ponds. The degree of influence can be evaluated by hydrological or hydrochemical methods. It remains unclear to date, whether around the periphery of quarry ponds - where the aquifer is exposed unprotected to the atmosphere - an impact to groundwater can be demonstrated by the composition and abundance of metazoan communities below ground. Fourteen groundwater wells around the periphery of the Burkheimer quarry pond in the Upper Rhine Valley were sampled three to four times in 2009. Samples were analyzed hydrochemically and also for their fauna. The complex hydrogeological patterns in the investigated area were best reflected by four fauna groups. However, hydrological exchange processes overlay possible effects downstream of the quarry ponds. The marked fauna groups are "stressed sites", characterized by a depleted groundwater fauna, "alluvial sites" with a species-rich fauna, showing the influence of surface water, "upwelling groundwater" that are characterized by a species-rich and abundant groundwater fauna, and "Rhine", a well situated directly beside the Rhine River, with a stable and low variance of groundwater fauna that also showed low species numbers. Results show that hydrological exchange processes can be indicated by the composition of groundwater metazoan communities. Nonetheless, this survey did not reveal any direct effects on the groundwater fauna by the quarry pond.

AB  - In an effort to predict the impact of climate change on the distribution of existing invasive species, niche-based models (NBMs) are being increasingly used to make forecasts. Here, we investigate the reliability of these models in predicting future climatic suitability for 4 invasive decapods of the Iberian Peninsula: Cherax destructor, Eriocheir sinensis, Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procambarus clarkii. From an ensemble of forecasts generated by 5 distinct algorithms (generalized linear models, artificial neural networks, support vector machines, random forests and alternating decision trees), we calculated consensus predictions for current conditions and 3 future time periods (2030, 2050 and 2080) under low and high scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions. Three criteria were examined to infer the robustness of the forecasts: ability to predict current distributions, inter-model variability and degree of environmental extrapolation. Our results indicate an overall decline in climatic suitability for the 4 invaders as time progresses. However, we also identified highly distinct levels of predictive uncertainty among species. Good indicators of reliability were found for Procambarus clarkii and Pacifastacus leniusculus, whereas the predictions for C. destructor showed low predictive performance, low inter-model agreement and wide areas of environmental extrapolation. For E. sinensis, the models also showed high variability with respect to areas projected to lose climatic suitability. Overall, our results highlight the need to consider and evaluate multiple sources of uncertainty when using NBM predictions for invaders under current and future conditions.

AB  - A simple geochemical technique using the ratio of total sulfur (TS) to total organic carbon (TOC) was successfully used to reconstruct paleoenvironments in the Jurassic-Cretaceous Tetori Group, central Japan. The TS to TOC ratio is often employed as an effective parameter to separate modern marine or brackish sediments from freshwater deposits. To test the TS/TOC method for paleoenvironmental interpretation of the Tetori Group, we first analyzed TS/TOC for samples for which depositional conditions (i.e. marine, brackish or freshwater) had been recognized paleontologically. The results indicate that the method can effectively separate sedimentary rocks deposited under freshwater from marine and brackish settings. Once we had established the effectiveness of this method, we applied it to three sections of the Tetori Group, central Japan. Stratigraphic fluctuations in TS/TOC values revealed episodic incursions of marine or brackish conditions in the dominantly freshwater depositional sequence in the middle of the Jobu Formation of the Itoshiro Subgroup at the Izumi section, Fukui Prefecture. The same paleoenvironment is also suggested to occur at the top of the Tetori Group in the Tateyama section, Toyama Prefecture. This research provides important information to paleogeographers who currently lack evidence from facies fossils to indicate if the uppermost part of the Tetori Group represents marine or brackish settings. A chemostratigraphy of TS/TOC parameters potentially could provide a correlation among Jurassic-Cretaceous sequences along continental margins over East Asia.

AB  - There is still no assessment of the impact of sediment chemicals and environmental conditions on macroinvertebrates at the scale of the St. Lawrence River. In order to assess these impacts in the fluvial section of the St. Lawrence River including the Montreal harbour, the community structure of macroinvertebrates using different taxonomic aggregations (genus and family) and taxa attributes (abundance, presence-absence, indicator taxa) was assessed. The goal of the study was to determine the indicator taxa of macroinvertebrates along the fluvial continuum and relate changes in macroinvertebrate community to sediment chemical conditions and environmental characteristics of habitats using variance partitioning. This study also evaluated which taxonomic level and taxa attributes of macroinvertebrates were the most suitable for bioassessment of quality of sediments and habitat environment in the St. Lawrence River. Four different macroinvertebrate assemblages were found distributed along the fluvial continuum using either abundance or presence-absence data and genus or family levels. Indicator taxa characteristic of the different macroinvertebrate communities were associated with the sediment contamination gradient. However, habitat environmental characteristics (water masses, sulphur and DOC in sediments) had more influence on macroinvertebrate assemblages than sediment contamination. Our study confirms that family level analysis can give information comparable to the genus level analysis using presence-absence or abundance of macroinvertebrates, yet a higher number of indicator taxa were detected at the genus level.

AB  - Large areas of formerly oak-dominated woodlands are currently managed for timber products, and if they are used in a conservation-oriented way, they are often abandoned and left to become wilderness. We focused on the situation when an oak woodland is still partly managed as an ancient game park and partly abandoned as a nature conservation amendment. We studied this effect using a multi-taxa approach with lichens, fungi and beetles and investigated their response to the changing patterns in canopy openness, dead wood distribution and host tree conditions. The study was done in the Hradec Kralov, region of the Czech Republic. We found that the maintenance of canopy openness, as determined by management, was the primary driver influencing species composition. Canopy closure led to homogenization of the beetle and lichen communities and the loss of species. Fungi were mainly driven by the amount of dead wood, and abandonment favored their species richness. The creation of a new wilderness was only profitable for fungi, and the maintenance of canopy openness was an important driver for most of the studied taxa (i.e., biodiversity maintenance). Canopy openness and the presence of veteran trees could be used as an indicator of a management history that helps conserve biodiversity. Appropriate conditions for all taxa studied could be fulfilled using wood pasturing or game keeping in combination with dead tree retention.

AB  - In conditions of global economic instability the success of electromechanical enterprises depends on their ability to react quickly to challenges of external environment. In order to create background and conditions for this ability the given enterprises refer to manufacturing activity planning, using a probabilistic approach based on forecasts that may not be true. The question of provision of more complete consideration of various internal and external factors and acceleration of decision making process and reaction to changing business environment arises before the organizations that concern more effective scheduling policy. International practice of solving such problems generally leads to qualitative discussion, whereas quantitative assessment of impact of control parameters of enterprise is not practically used, because there is no one systematic approach to manufacturing activity planning. On the basis of studying of international practices methodical guidelines of scenario approach to manufacturing activity planning with mathematical modeling of economics of producer price on electromechanical enterprises have been developed, which reasonably could be used with reference to and interaction with enterprise manufacturing program. The described approach allows solving planning problems iteratively in real-time mode concerning profit maximization, to form producer prices, to divide overhead costs according to the type of products and carry out cost accounting according to the type of a product, and it will provide functional interaction between factors and performance indicators.

AB  - The purpose of our study is to develop a decision-preparing assessment method for shore-restoration of medium- (0.5 km(2) 100 km(2)) - and large-sized (>100 km(2)) lakes, utilised primarily for recreational purposes, by the example of a Hungarian study-area (Lake Velence). For detailed assessment of the lakeshore conditions, the legal shoreline was intersected into 100 m long sections; each assessment plot covers 50-50 m from the shoreline both towards the land and the water surface. 9 indicators were defmed and divided into two groups (indicator-systems): landscape ecological conditions and land use features. The lakeshore was evaluated on basis of the assessment indicators by score-system. It was noticed that according to the two indicator-systems, the 3 integral categories involved similar quantity of plots (suitable for restoration: 11 and 16, partially suitable: 53 and 27 and not suitable: 132 and 153 plots). However, the results have made it clear that the plots, being suitable potentially for restoration, can be determined solely by combining the results of the two indicator-systems. Accordingly, just a bit more than 7% of the assessed plots are suitable, or partially suitable for shore-restoration. Though, there are relatively few plots suitable for restoration, it is still very advantageous, that there are also long, continuous sections of more hundred meters (mainly on the south-eastern shore), where all the plots have suitable features for restoration.

AB  - Consequent to the ever increasing human population and the process of urbanization solid waste management is one of the biggest recent environmental challenges. Simulating the conditions of composting in the field in the present study apple (A), banana (B), oranges (C) and potatoes peels (D) were composted in glass jars under aerobic condition. Filtered aeration was provided with the help of electric air pump. Four jars including one control (containing autoclaved substrate) for each substrate were kept at 50 degrees C for 21 days. Samples were taken at zero and every seventh day for analyses of pH, electrical conductivity (EC), ash, moisture, seed germination and bacterial C.F.U. pH and ash content of all the four compost substrates increased, while EC of the substrates B and D increased and that of A and C decreased. A significant increase in seed germination was observed for the substrate D. Significant reduction in E. coli count was observed in all samples within 14-days of composting. Provision of filtered aeration and 50 degrees C incubation temperature appeared promising in terms of reducing harmful bacterial contents, as envisaged by low E. coli C.F.U. during different phases and total absence of these indicator microorganisms at end of the composting process. Whereas 114.3% and 62.55% seed germination indices for the composted substrates D and B, respectively, indicated conversion of the wastes into value added phytotoxin free fertilizer, which can escalate the agricultural output.

AB  - In the spoil heaps, i.e. in the waste dumps of the soil removed in open-pit coal mining, the emergence and development of spontaneous vegetation is a prerequisite for "bringing them to life", i.e. for development of flora and fauna. Here, the diversity of plants is the result of locally different conditions - often extreme ones ( such as drought and overheating of the surface, toxicity of the substrate, erosion, etc.). At initial stages, phytocenoses, which are not rich in the number of species and which usually have a dominant edificator species, emerge here. The abiotic stress in the spoil heaps is a regular and predictable phenomenon. The theory of primary strategies, represented by the relations of stress, disturbance and competition, was applied. A general diagram of succession development of vegetation in the spoil heaps in the North Bohemia has been prepared; the basic concept is the concept of C-S-R strategies here. The stress-tolerant taxa are determined by the conditions of these anthropogenic areas, i.e. these species are diagnostic indicators for an environment strongly burdened with stress factors (S-strategists). On the other hand, there are species well adapted to unpredictable disturbances (R-strategists); these often include field weeds and ruderal plants. Competitive C-strategists grow in the relatively stable habitats of spoil heaps areas. They are able to resist stress and disturbance only with difficulties. The C-S-R life strategies represent intersections based on the principle of the compromise of profits and losses.

AB  - Some sexual selection models envisage exaggerated male secondary sexual characters to be costly and therefore reliable indicators of the quality of potential mates to choosy females. If male secondary sexual characters have a natural selection cost, they may be linked to each other by reciprocally constraining relationships that would prevent individual males from increasing their level of multiple signaling. Barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) males have at least two costly signals relevant to socio-sexual interactions: tail length and song. Under the hypothesis that a trade-off exists between male signals, we manipulated the maintenance cost of tail ornaments to test whether this reduced the quantity and quality of song, a condition-dependent, phenotypically plastic signal. Contrary to our expectation, tail elongation had no effect on singing activity and song complexity. However, tail-elongated males produced songs with longer terminal parts ('rattles'). Long rattles are associated with highly competitive social contexts and high circulating levels of testosterone, suggesting that tail-elongated males were more frequently involved in either male-male aggressive or inter-sexual interactions. Therefore, this study shows that males are not displaying multiple signals at the maximum possible level, implying that this system is open to unreliable communication. However, long-term trade-offs between signal expression and viability may prevent males from displaying both signals at higher rates.

AB  - This article is aimed to review the research works carried out to dare about "structurless" pig meat by three French organisations, i.e. ENVL and INRA in the Rhone Alpes region (South East), ITP and INRA in the West of France and Pen At Lan Company in Brittany. The results from the 3 groups are gathered and compared. It appears that the lesion is of a PSE type, however this syndrome recovers maybe various pathologies with different mechanisms but an identical expression. All generic types together, the rate of "structurtess " hams is of 10 to 20 % on average, with a strong variation according to slaughter series, season (more,structurless" meat in Summer); the heaviest and meatiest pigs show more defects, but this trend is not related to the growth rate. The HAL gene is a predisposing factor, but it is not the only one, as marked differences are observed among genetic types and among boars within-genetic type, although the latter observation should be confirmed. Regarding environmental factors, lairage conditions in the abattoir is noticeable, but other factors are probably involved. The biochemical mechanisms underlying the defect of,structurless" meat probably involve a deficiency in intracellular Ca++ as in PSE meat. Colour measurements appear as interesting indicators of the muscle destructuration. Moreover they have the interest to replace the subjective scoring by an objective and quantitative measure. Research is currently in progress to assess the possibility of using of video image analysis to quantify the intensity of the defect and to sort the hams in industrial conditions.

AB  - To enable the release of the encapsulated nucleic acids into the cytosol of targeted cells, the interaction of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) with endosomes is critical. We investigated changes in the physicochemical properties of LNPs containing ionizable cationic lipids that were induced by acidic pH, which reflects the conditions in the maturation of endosomes. We prepared a LNP containing an ionizable cationic lipid. The laurdan generalized polarization values, which are related to the hydration degree of the lipid membrane interface and are often used as an indicator of membrane packing, decreased with a decrease in pH value, showing that the membrane packing was decreased under acidic conditions. Furthermore, the pH-induced variation increased with an increasing percentage of ionizable cationic lipids in the LNPs. These results indicated that electrostatic repulsion between lipid molecules at acidic pH decreased the packing density of the lipids in the LNP membrane. Reducing the order of lipids could be a trigger to form a non-bilayer structure and allow fusion of the LNPs with the membrane of maturing endosomes in an acidic environment. The LNPs were used to incorporate and transport small interfering RNA (siRNA) into cells for knockdown of the expression of beta-galactosidase. The knockdown efficiency of siRNA encapsulated in LNPs tended to increase with the ratio of KC2. These results, which demonstrate the underlying phenomena for the fusion of membranes, will help clarify the mechanism of the release of encapsulated nucleic acids.

AB  - Physicochemical changes that occurred during deposition of Irati black shales were investigated via outcrop samples collected in the northeastern and central-eastern Parana Basin. Various traditional geochemical indicators were used, in addition to newly detected biomarkers: C-32 lanostane, simonellite, sempervirane, and C32-C35 benzohopanes. Bulk geochemistry parameters, mineralogy, and conventional saturated biomarkers, such as tetracyclic polyprenoids (TPPs), reflect restricted and hypersaline marine deposition with freshwater input and increased terrigenous contribution toward the top of the studied outcrops. This led to stratification of the water column, establishing euxinic conditions in the photic zone and reducing conditions at the bottom of the water column, which enhanced preservation of organic matter. Principal component and hierarchical cluster analyses were performed to group the samples according to their similar geochemical characteristics: prevailing marine environment (basal outcrop samples) and higher freshwater inflow with greater terrigenous contribution (top outcrop samples). These geochemical observations were corroborated by aromatic biomarkers such as trT aromatic steroids, trimethylnaphthalenes, simonellite, and sempervirane. The aryl isoprenoid ratio (AIR) indicates persistence of photic zone euxinia (PZE) during Irati black shale deposition. The presence of C-32 lanostane and C-32-C-35 benzohopanes is directly related to the hypersaline depositional environment of the analyzed samples. Finally, the C32-33/C32-35 benzohopane ratio is proposed as a thermal maturity proxy because variations in the ratio can be linked to the presence of a diabase sill and temperature catalyst minerals near one of the outcrops.

AB  - Variations in dissolved oxygen levels are common in the Amazonian aquatic environments and the aquatic organisms that inhabit these environments developed a variety of adaptive responses to deal with such conditions. Some Amazonian fish species are tolerant to low oxygen levels and the cichlid Astronotus ocellatus is one of the most hypoxia-tolerant species. Herein, we aimed to unveil the biochemical and molecular responses that A. ocellatus presents when submitted to hypoxia. Hypoxia indicators were measured, such as plasma glucose, plasma lactate, hepatic glycogen and relative transcript levels of prolyl hydroxylase 2 (phd2) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (hif-1 alpha) in juveniles of approximately 50 g exposed to 1, 3, and 5 hours of hypoxia (0.7 mg O-2.L-1), followed by 3 hours of recovery in normoxia (6 mg O (2).L-1). Fish exposed to hypoxia reduced liver glycogen levels within 3 hours of hypoxia, when comparing with 1 hour, and increased plasma glucose and lactate. Under the same condition, phd2 transcripts levels increased in gills, but decreased in liver. In contrast, hypoxia did not affect relative gene expression of hif-1 alpha in both tissues. Based on the transcription pattern of phd2, these results showed that liver and gills of A. ocellatus have different molecular strategies to cope with environmental hypoxia.

AB  - The changes that occur in biofilms reflect the influence of the environment. In a case study, the biofilms developed along a salinity gradient from marine to freshwater in a tropical monsoon influenced estuary (Zuari, west coast of India) were evaluated through in situ observations, and effect of translocation through microcosm experiments. The bacterial abundance was tide driven and high at the mouth of the estuary, whereas periphyton biomass, in terms of chlorophyll a was higher in the freshwater to brackish zone. These results point out de coupling of bacteria and phototrophic organisms in estuarine early stage biofilms. Vibrio spp. and faecal indicator bacteria were abundant in marine and brackish biofilms. The translocation experiments revealed that at times when marine biofilms with high total bacterial abundance were transferred to either brackish or freshwater, the abundance decreased. However, a significant increase in the bacterial abundance was observed when freshwater biofilms were transferred to either brackish or marine conditions. The microcosm experiments revealed that the influence of grazers differed with the type of biofilm and played an important role in modulating the composition of biofilms. The diagnostic pigments provided considerable insights into spatial and seasonal dynamics of periphyton groups in different biofilms and were determined by the surrounding water column communities and the availability of nutrients. Decay of freshwater periphyton in biofilms when translocated to marine and brackish conditions lead to remineralisation and higher bacterial population.

AB  - The Caicos pine is in decline in the Turks and Caicos Islands due to an invasive scale insect, Toumeyella parvicornis and climate change is likely to exacerbate this decline. We hypothesized that the rate of emission of volatiles may differ between trees at different locations and over time. Entrained volatiles were analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and six compounds were identified and included in multivariate analyses (CCA and NMDS) to distinguish between year, health condition and locations. The emissions collected from the same trees in May 2014 and May 2015 were not different. A two-way ANOVA of 2015 data alone showed that health and location interacted for individual compounds and total emissions, and it was only when data were compared separately (i.e. health condition only or location only) that trees could be resolved into distinct groups using CCA. Healthy trees from Pine Cay and Middle Caicos could be separated using emissions of beta-phellandrene. In contrast unhealthy trees from Pine Cay were characterized by higher total emissions and of all compounds except the pinene isomers, while emissions from trees from Middle and North Caicos were identical. These differences may be a reflection of genetic or environmental differences between the populations. Terpenes could be useful to monitor health where there might not be visible indicators. Refinement of these findings would depend on more samples being collected over many years.

AB  - The Asmari Formation is a predominantly carbonate lithostratigraphic unit that outcrops in the Zagros Basin. Micropaleontological studies of the Asmari Formation in the Dehdasht area led to the identification of 51 species of foraminifera taxa. Among the foraminifera, Nummulites cf. vascus, Operculin sp., Operculina complanata, Eulepidina dilatata, Eulepidina elephantine, Ditrupa sp., Miogypsina sp., Elphidium sp. 14, and Borelis melo curdica are the most important. The Lepidocyclina-Operculina-Ditrupa assemblage zone represents the Rupelian Chattian age. The Aquitanian age is also defined by co-occurrence of Miogypsina sp. and Elphidium sp. 14, and finally, the first occurrence of Borelis melo curdica represents the Burdigalian. Based on faunal assemblages, the following paleoenvironmental settings are determined for the deposition of the study section: (1) the deep, offshore settings in the aphotic zone dominated by pelagic and small benthic foraminifera; (2) the low energy, turbid and low light parts of the oligophotic zone characterized by large and flat lepidocyclinids (Eulepidina) and Nummulitidae; (3) the low turbidity, deeper part of the inner ramp dominated by Miogypsinoides, Neorotalia, Lepidocyclina, Operculina and Archias; (4) the shallow, marginal marine environment exposed to salinity fluctuations (short-term salinity fluctuations or fully marine conditions) dominated by small benthic Foraminifera (Ammonia and Elphidium); (5) highly translucent, shallowest part of the inner ramp dominated by representatives of Borelis, Meandropsina and Peneroplis. The biotic assemblages represent warm tropical waters with oligotrophic to slightly mesotrophic conditions. (C) 2015, China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University.

AB  - Present study deals with the optimization of biodiesel production using rapeseed oil as feedstock and NaOCH3 as a catalyst. Optimization of different reaction parameters, such as catalyst concentration, reaction temperature, reaction time. and alcohol to oil molar ratio, was done using response surface methodology (RSM). The optimal experimental conditions for biodiesel production were as follows: catalyst concentration (%) 0.30, reaction temperature 55A degrees C, molar ratio 6.75, and reaction time 60 min. Under these optimal conditions, 97.5 percentage yield of biodiesel was obtained. The observed and predicted values of rapeseed oil methyl esters (ROMEs) yield showed a linear relationship. The fuel properties such as specific gravity 0.876 +/- 0.01, flash point 168 +/- 0.48A degrees C, fire point 197.8 +/- 0.31A degrees C, pour point -7 +/- 0.060A degrees C, cloud point -2 +/- 0.10A degrees C kinematic viscosity 4.42 +/- 0.26 mm(2)/sec, and sulfur content 0.002 mg/Kg of the produced biodiesel show the suitability of rapeseed oil biodiesel, as fuel. Moreover, engine performance test of the Rapeseed oil biodiesel (rapeseed oil methyl esters, ROME) was examined. The results showed that CO and particulate matter (PM) emissions of the ROME were lower than those of diesel fuel. NOX emissions of the ROME were lower for B5, B20, B40, and B50, while higher for B80 and B100. These results show the environment benefits of biodiesel.

AB  - Few quantitative data exist on human virus inactivation by sunlight and the relationship between human and indicator viruses under sunlit conditions. We investigated the effects of sunlight on human viruses (adenovirus type 2, poliovirus type 3) and bacteriophages (MS2, Q-Beta SP, Fi, M13, PRD1, Phi-X174, and coliphages isolated from Avalon Bay, California). Viruses were inoculated into phosphate buffered saline or seawater, exposed to a laboratory solar simulator for <= 12 h, and enumerated by double agar layer or cell culture to derive first-order inactivation rate constants (k(obs), h(-1)). The viruses most resistant to sunlight were adenovirus type 2 (k(obs) = 0.59 +/- 0.04 h(-1)) and bacteriophage MS2 (k(obs) = 0.43 +/- 0.02 h(-1)), which suggests MS2 may be a conservative indicator for sunlight resistant human viruses in clear water when sunlight inactivation is the main removal mechanism. Reasonable agreement was observed between somatic coliphage inactivation rates measured in the solar simulator (k(mean) = 1.81 h(-1)) and somatic coliphages measured in the surf zone during a field campaign at Avalon Bay during similar sunlight intensity (k = 0.75 h(-1) at log-RMSE minimum; k(range) = 0.54 h(-1) to >1.88 h(-1); Boehm, A. B. et al. Environ. Sci. Technol. 2009, 43, (21), 8046-8052). Hence, measuring sunlight inactivation rates of viruses in the laboratory can be used to estimate inactivation in the environment under similar sunlight and water quality conditions.

AB  - Milosevic M., M. Vujakovic, D. Karagic (2010): Vigour tests as indicators of seed viability.- Genetika, Vol 42, No. 1, 103 -118.
   Seed marks the beginning of each plant production and therefore ensuring its quality is the priority of modern seed science and a prerequisite for obtaining high yields of all plant species. Determination of seed quality and its viability indicates what seed lots can be placed onto the market, and for that reason it is very important to have reliable methods and tests to be used for seed quality and seed vigour testing.
   The term vigour of viability is used to describe the physiological characteristics of seeds that control its ability to germinate rapidly in the soil and to tolerate various, mostly negative environmental factors. MCDONALD grouped vigour tests into three groups: Physical tests - determine seed characteristics such as size and mass. These tests are inexpensive, quick, can be applied to large number of samples, and are positively correlated with seed vigour. The main feature of seed development is accumulation of nutritive materials, which is also in direct correlation with vigour, i.e. with size and mass of seed; Physiological tests using germination and growth parameters. There are two types of these tests. First type, when germination is done under favourable conditions (standard laboratory germination, and test of growth intensity). Second type, when seed is exposed to unfavourable environmental conditions (cold test, accelerated aging test, and Hiltner test); Biochemical tests - are considered as indirect methods for estimation of seed value. These are Tetrazolijum test, conductometric measurements, enzyme activity and respiration.

AB  - Legendre polynomial and cubic spline functions were used in random regression models to model the change in body traits over the course of the first lactation for daughters of 954 sires. Both functions estimated similar genetic variances for d 50 to 250 across lactation for the majority of traits. The heritability of the traits was similar to other studies using univariate models as well as random regression models. There was little difference between the 2 functions in their predictive power for each of the body type traits, as measured by the absolute difference between the predicted and actual type traits and the proportion of the total phenotypic variance explained by the model. Overall, the Legendre polynomial appeared to model these traits slightly better. Plots of the fixed curves and daily sire solutions obtained from the random regression models showed that there were differences in how the traits and sires changed across lactation. The daily sire solutions were then used to predict differences in liveweight of sires' daughters across first lactation and showed that the daughters of some sires grew faster during first lactation than others. The spatial differences in the body traits that are displayed by this study could be an important indicator of the physical and biological changes that cows are undergoing in their first lactation. Information from these sire profiles could be harnessed to indicate production and functional traits later in life.

AB  - Testing of the extent to which different complex traits share common genetic control provides a means to distinguish associations that are truly diagnostic of genetic potential for improved adaptation to abiotic stress, from incidental phenotypic correlations. In two generations of progeny from a cross between Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping was used to evaluate correspondence in genetic control of selected physiological measures and productivity under water-limited and well-watered environments, respectively. A total of 33 QTLs were detected for five physiological variables [osmotic potential (OP), carbon isotope ratio (delta(13)C; indicator of water use efficiency), canopy temperature, chlorophyll a and b], and 46 QTLs for five measures of crop productivity [dry matter, seed cotton yield (SC), harvest index, boll weight, and boll number]. QTL likelihood intervals for high SC and low OP corresponded in three genomic regions, two of which mapped to homoeologous locations on the two subgenomes of tetraploid cotton. QTLs for delta(13)C showed only incidental association with productivity, indicating that high water use efficiency can be associated with either high or low productivity. Different cotton species have evolved different alleles related to physiological responses and productivity under water deficit, which may permit the development of genotypes that are better-adapted to arid conditions.

AB  - An in situ methodology based on immobilized redox indicators has been developed to determine when Fe(III)-reducing conditions exist in environmental systems. The redox indicators thionine (Thi, formal potential at pH 7 (E-7(0')) equals 66 mV), toluidine blue O (TB, E-7(0') = 31 mV), and cresyl violet (CV, E-7(0') = -75 mV) have been immobilized to 40-60 mum agarose beads via an amine- aldehyde coupling reaction. These beads were packed into a flow cell to allow spectrophotometric monitoring of the redox state of simple solutions and wastewater slurries pumped from in a bioreactor. Fe(II), a product of microbial activity, at levels observed in real systems reduces both the free (non-immobilized) and immobilized redox indicator to different degrees for samples with pH 6.5 or higher. At pH 7, immobilized Thi and TB are significantly reduced at Fe(II) concentrations greater than 0.1 and 0.3 mM, respectively. CV, with the lowest formal potential, requires Fe(II) levels in excess of 10 mM. The degree of reduction of the indicators (i.e. the fraction of indicator oxidized) observed during titrations can be qualitatively modeled with a simple equilibrium model based on ferrihydrite or lepidocrocite as the Fe(III)-solid phase. The reversibility of Fe(II)-indicator reactions was also demonstrated by showing that the reduced indicator becomes re-oxidized when Fe(II) levels decrease. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Pesticide use poses a potential hazard to wild birds that use agricultural farmland as their foraging habitat. Whereas most current pesticide studies have found residues in liver samples and single active substances, noninvasive sampling methods and data on a wide variety of agrochemicals are needed to determine pesticide exposure of living wild birds for postregistration monitoring. We collected feces during autumn migration of Eurasian skylarks (Alauda arvensis), a species that commonly forages in winter cereal crops. Birds were kept in paper bags until we measured their body condition, individually marked and released them. We analyzed the feces dropped in paper bags for the presence of 80 pesticides including rodenticides and degradation products. Nine active substances from fungicides and herbicides commonly used in grain and maize fields were detected individually, or in combination, in 25% of the samples. We found no significant differences in body condition between exposed and unexposed birds, but Eurasian skylarks without pesticide residues had a better body condtion score on average than birds with pesticide residues. Pesticide determination in noninvasively collected fecal samples allows a refined risk analysis, which takes pesticides used in the habitats of birds into account.

AB  - Exposure to continuous light at night, including night-shift work or a nocturnal lifestyle, is emerging as a novel deleterious factor for weight gain and obesity. Here, we examined whether a single bout of bright light (BL) exposure at night affects energy metabolism via changes in circadian rhythm and nocturnal melatonin production. Ten healthy young men were randomized to a two-way crossover experimental design protocol: control (< 50 lux) and BL (approximately 10000 lux) conditions, with at least seven days of interval. The participants were exposed to each condition for 3 h (21:00-24:00) before sleep (0 lux, 00:00-07:00) in a room-type metabolic chamber. On each experimental night (21:00-07:00), energy expenditure, respiratory quotient (RQ), and substrate oxidation were measured to determine the energy metabolism. BL exposure prior to bedtime altered biological rhythms, disrupted the nocturnal decline in body temperature, and suppressed the melatonin level before sleeping, resulting in an increase in sleep latency. Indirect calorimetry data revealed that BL exposure significantly decreased the fat oxidation and increased the RQ, an indicator of the carbohydrate-to-fat oxidation ratio, throughout the whole period (light exposure and sleep). We revealed that acute BL exposure prior to bedtime exacerbated circadian rhythms and substrate oxidations, suggesting that chronic BL exposure at night may lead to obesity risk due to disturbances in circadian rhythms and macronutrient metabolism.

AB  - Adsorption-based processes, such as pressure swing adsorption, because of their cyclic nature and the presence of multiple design variables, are challenging to simulate and optimize. Here, we introduce the machine-assisted adsorption process learning and emulation (MAPLE) framework, a generalized data-driven surrogate model that fully emulates operation of an adsorption process at the cyclic steady state. This framework is based on a dense feedforward neural network trained with a Bayesian regularization technique. This framework is generalized for a wide range of inputs which include the adsorbent properties, the Langmuir adsorption isotherm parameters, and operating conditions. The MAPLE framework can then be used to predict key performance indicators such as product purity, recovery, energy, and productivity for any arbitrary adsorbent and operating condition almost instantaneously. The key differentiator of the current work lies in the incorporation of the adsorption isotherm as an input, which is specifically beneficial for rapid screening of large adsorbent databases. A CO2 capture case study is used to illustrate this methodology. A relatively small computational training effort (2000 core hours) is required to train MAPLE with an average prediction accuracy (test R-Adj(2) >= 0.995) for all the four key performance indicators across a wide range of adsorbents/adsorption characteristics. The simulation and optimization time is brought down from 1500 core hours per adsorbent to <= 1 core min per adsorbent. The ability of this framework for rapid screening of adsorbents for postcombustion CO2 capture is also illustrated.

AB  - With the aim of determining the effect of response to heat stress, parity, breed and breeding region on somatic cell count (SCC) in dairy cattle, the individual test-day records of dairy cows collected from 2005 to 2012 in regular milk recording (AT4 / BT4 method) in Croatia were used. The proportional differences in log somatic cell count, and logSCC (in %) in subsequent milk recordings (1st, and 2nd) were determined in cows with a significant decrease in daily milk yield at a set temperature-humidity index, THI threshold (68, 72, and 76). The results indicate high variability in somatic cell count due to the animal's response to heat stress (heat stressed at THI in 68, 72, and 76), parity (1, 2, and 3+), breed (Holstein, and Sinunental) and breeding region (Central. and Eastern Croatia). Also, it could be pointed out that Holsteins, especially cows in higher parities (2, 3+) reared in Eastern Croatia were shown to be more sensitive to environmental stress, even in the period after heat stress (1st, and 2nd subsequent milk recording). Since SCC is not only an indicator for mastitis, but also reflects a cow's immune response to general stress situations, the high variability determined may be explained by the individual adaptation capabilities of these two breeds to breeding conditions in the analysed regions.

AB  - Differences in limnological and hydrological conditions between storage and run-of-river reservoirs caused variations in phytoplankton assemblages along the two types of reservoirs. Instead of exploring variations in phytoplankton assemblages along one type of reservoir, this study identified similarities and differences in phytoplankton assemblages along two types of reservoirs. Phytoplankton assemblages from Xiaowan (storage reservoir) and Manwan (run-of-river reservoir) reservoirs in the Lancang River, China were used as case study. Taxonomic approach and functional group method were used to compare phytoplankton assemblages at sampling sites located in impounded areas of reservoirs, free-flowing areas directly below reservoirs, and free-flowing intermediate areas between the two contrasting reservoirs. With the reduction of reservoir disturbance, phytoplankton assemblages in free-flowing intermediate areas between reservoirs will recover to rich and diverse. Because of the inoculation and dispersion of phytoplankton from the upstream reservoir, dominant functional groups at the sampling sites located in impounded areas of reservoirs and free-flowing areas directly below reservoirs were mainly represented by groups that prefer long water residence times. The functional group TB (Nitzschia lorenziana) and W2 (Strombomonas ensifera) could be used as useful indicators to determine hydrological conditions due to their strong sensitivity to water residence times. Results of the linear redundancy analysis demonstrated that phytoplankton assemblages were mainly affected by DO and flow. These results should aid river managers in acquiring better insight into the effect of cascade reservoirs on the biomass and structure of phytoplankton in the aquatic ecosystem.

AB  - Reclaiming wetlands following open pit mining for industrial oil sand extraction is challenging due to the physical and chemical conditions of the post-mined landscape. The aim of our study was to examine and compare the influence of oil sands process water (OSPW) and material (fine fluid tails or FFT) on the plant community composition of created wetlands. Compared to created-unamended and natural wetlands, the created wetlands amended with OSPW and/or FFT (created-tailings wetlands) had significantly higher water salinity, conductivity, dissolved oxygen concentration and lower oxidative-reductive potential. Water chemistry parameters of created-unamended did not differ significantly from those of natural wetlands. The sediment of created wetlands had significantly less moisture, total nitrogen, and organic content than the natural wetlands. The application of OSPW/FFT in created wetlands will likely lead to initial vegetation composition atypical of natural regional wetlands. For the objective of reclaiming vegetation composition to the status of natural regional wetlands, unamended wetlands were the best reclamation option, based on the physical and chemical parameters measured. Despite being the favored reclamation option, created-unamended wetlands' physical and chemical characteristics remain atypical of natural wetlands. Most significantly, the basin morphometry of created wetlands was significantly different from that of naturally-formed wetlands in the region, and this appears to partly explain difference in vegetation composition. We also demonstrate that species richness alone is not a useful measure in wetland monitoring. Instead, plant community composition is a better indicator of wetland conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Since European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) larvae occurred in coastal and estuarine waters at early life stages, they are likely to be exposed to reduced dissolved oxygen waters at a sensitive developmental stage. However, the effects of hypoxia at larval stage, which depend in part on fish species, remain very poorly documented in European sea bass. In the present study, the impacts of an experimental exposure to a chronic moderate hypoxia (40 % air saturation) between 30 and 38 days post-hatching on the physiological and developmental traits of European sea bass larvae were assessed. This study was based on the investigation of survival and growth rates, parameters related to energy metabolism [Citrate Synthase (CS) and Cytochrome-c Oxidase (COX) activities], and biological indicators of the maturation of digestive function [pancreatic (trypsin, amylase) and intestinal (Alkaline Phosphatase "AP" and Aminopeptidase-N "N-LAP") enzymes activities]. While condition of hypoxia exposure did not induce any significant mortality event, lower growth rate as well as CS/COX activity ratio was observed in the Hypoxia Treatment group. In parallel, intestinal enzyme activities were also lower under hypoxia. Altogether, the present data suggest that sea bass larvae cope with moderate hypoxia by (1) reducing processes that are costly in energy and (2) regulating mitochondria functions in order to respond to energy-demand conditions. Both these effects are associated with a delay in the maturation of the digestive function.

AB  - With increases in active mining and continued discharge associated with former mine operations, evaluating the health of watersheds in the Canadian Yukon Territory is warranted. Current environmental assessment approaches often employ guidelines established using sentinel species not relevant to Arctic monitoring programs. The present study focused on the successful development of a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay directed towards the indigenous Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) and examines the feasibility of using non-lethal sampling from the caudal fin as a means for evaluation of mRNA abundance profiles reflective of environmental conditions. In a proof of concept study performed blind, qPCR results from animals in an area with elevated water concentrations of cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) and higher body burdens of Cd, Zn, and lead (Pb) were compared to a reference location in the Yukon Territory. Lower condition factor and a higher abundance of hepatic and caudal fin gene transcripts encoding the metallothionein isoforms (mtalmtb), in addition to elevated heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) and catalase (cat) mRNAs in liver, were observed in fish from the test site. The strong positive correlation between metal body burden and caudal fin mta/mtb mRNA abundance demonstrates a high potential for use of the Arctic grayling assay in non-lethal environmental monitoring programs.

AB  - TV shows on any athletic event make clear that those who want gold medals cannot dispense statistics. And the statistics more appealing to champions and coachers are the extreme order statistics, and in particular maximum (or minimum) values and records. The models in statistics of extremes are usually semi-parametric or even non-parametric in nature, with the imposition of a few regularity conditions in the appropriate tail of the unknown model underlying the available data. The primordial parameter is the extreme value index, the shape parameter in the (unified) extreme value distribution. The estimation of the extreme value index is one of the basis for the estimation of other parameters of rare events, like the right endpoint of the model underlying the data, a high quantile, the return period and the probability of exceedance of a high level. In this paper, we are interested in an application of statistics of extremes to the best personal marks in a few athletic events. Due to the way data are collected, we begin with a parametric data analysis, but we pay special attention to the semi-parametric estimation of the extreme value index and the right endpoint whenever finite, the possible world record, given the actual conditions. In order to achieve a better decision we consider a few alternative semi-parametric estimators available in the literature, and heuristic rules for the choice of thresholds.

AB  - Environmental safety assessments of products using cement from co-processing of hazardous wastes in cement kilns and formulation of criteria for pollution control of the cement products are necessary in Chinese environmental management departments. This article discusses the release of heavy metals from concrete using cement from the co-processing of hazardous wastes in cement kilns. The leaching test was based on typical applications of concrete in China. Total amount of heavy metals are much greater than leachability, and the ratio of total amount to leachability was dependent on the type of heavy metal. A good linear correlation between total amount and leachability of Cd was found (R-2 is 0.994), but this was not the case for Cr, As, and Pb. pH influenced the release of heavy metals significantly, and the influences were related to the kinds of heavy metals. Diffusion control was the major release mechanism of Cr and Cd in concrete and the release curves fit very well the standard line with a slope of 0.5. Slopes of different increments were all between 0.35 and 0.65. For As and Pb, diffusion control was also the major release mechanism, although other release mechanisms were also present. In the continuous leaching condition, the cumulative release amounts of Cr, Pb, and Cd were all larger than in the intermittent wetting condition, but this was not the case for As.

AB  - As tropical forests are cleared, a greater proportion of migratory songbirds are forced to winter in agricultural and disturbed habitats, which, if Poorer in quality than natural forests, could contribute to population declines. We compared demographic indicators of habitat quality for a focal species, the American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla), wintering in Jamaican citrus orchards and shade coffee plantations with those in four natural habitats: mangrove, coastal scrub, coastal palm, and dry limestone forests. Demographic measures of habitat quality included density, age and sex ratio, apparent survival, and changes in body mass. Measures of habitat qualily for redstarts in citrus and coffee habitats were generally intermediate between the highest (mangrove) and lowest (dry limestone) measurements from natural habitats. The decline in mean body mass over the winter period was a strong predictor of annual survival rate among habitats, and we suggest that measures of body condition coupled with survival data provide the best measures of habitat quality for nonbreeding songbirds. Density, which is far easier to estimate, was correlated with these more labor-intensive measures, particularly in the late winter when food is likely most limiting. Thus, local density may be useful as an approximation of habitat quality for wintering migrant warblers. Our findings bolster those of previous studies based on bird abundance that suggest arboreal agricultural habitats in the tropics can be useful for the conservation of generalist, insectivorous birds, including many migratory passerines such as redstarts.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion of two types of waste sludge was applied in order to assess the suitability of thermophilic conditions for the stabilization of organic matter and removal of fecal coliforms and helminth eggs. Feeding sludge was taken from an activated sludge municipal facility (BS) and from an enhanced primary treatment municipal plant (EPT). As an accompanying experiment, mesophilic digesters were also operated. The four digesters (M 1, M2, T1, T2) had a 5 litre volume and an egg shape. A highly stabilized material was obtained at both temperatures with BS type of sludge, taking the reduction of volatile fraction of suspended solids (%R-VSS) as indicator (84% for M1 and 74% for T1). In general, EPT sludge was a more difficult substrate, if compared with BS sludge; thermophilic condition was better adapted than mesophilic for this kind of sludge. Satisfactory reductions on counts of fecal coliforms and helminth eggs were achieved under thermophilic digestion for both types of feeding sludge. T1 digester, fed with biological sludge, removed fecal coliforms below 1000 MPN/gTS and helminth eggs down to 0.28 HELarval/gTS, at an HRT of 20 days. As a general conclusion, anaerobic thermophilic digestion may be an appropriate option for sludge stabilization, in order to meet EPA Class A biosolids final disposal regulations. However, further research is needed in order to consistently remove helminth eggs and fecal coliforms from waste sludge at shorter hydraulic retention times.

AB  - The major impact of both genotypic and environmental factors on grain-filling efficiency of rice (Oryza sativa L.) makes evaluating cultivar's grain-filling characteristics highly complicated. To assess grain-filling characteristics, the allocation index (Alli) was defined as a novel indicator representing the pattern of resource allocation in panicles. Alli was calculated as the ratio of source of yield utilized for producing well-filled grains to the total source consumed in a panicle, using estimated grain weight distribution data. We measured the Alli of 91 Japanese rice cultivars grown under nine environments involving multiple years, cropping seasons, three sites, and flag leaf clipping. Each cultivar's stability in Alli was evaluated using the data of various sink-source balance conditions. As a result of integrated analysis of multiple cultivars, we observed a trade-off relationship between the stability of Alli and the stability of mean weight of well-filled grains (mu2). The popular high-yielding cultivars Hokuriku 193 and Takanari showed high stability of Alli and mu2 under various sink-source balance conditions. Among the 91 cultivars, Hokuriku 193 showed stable characteristics with a high sink-filling ratio. Our results demonstrate that the grain weight distribution and Alli could be used as novel indicator of grain-filling characteristics, and that the trade-off relationship between the stability of Alli and mu2 should be considered when we select cultivars for multi-environmental cultivation.

AB  - Ocean currents, multiple fecal bacteria input sources, and jurisdictional boundaries can complicate pollution source tracking and associated mitigation and management efforts within the nearshore coastal environment. In this study, multiple microbial source tracking tools were employed to characterize the impact and reach of an ocean wastewater treatment facility discharge in Mexico northward along the coast and across the Southwest United States- Mexico Border. Water samples were evaluated for fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), Enterococcus by culture-based methods, and human-associated genetic marker (HF183) and Enterococcus by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). In addition, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis was performed and the SourceTracker algorithm was used to characterize the bacterial community of the wastewater treatment plume and its contribution to beach waters. Sampling dates were chosen based on ocean conditions associated with northern currents. Evidence of a gradient in human fecal pollution that extended north from the wastewater discharge across the United States/Mexico border from the point source was observed using human-associated genetic markers and microbial community analysis. The spatial extent of fecal contamination observed was largely dependent on swell and ocean conditions. These findings demonstrate the utility of a combination of molecular tools for understanding and tracking specific pollutant sources in dynamic coastal water environments.

AB  - Water extraction from air, based on reverse cycle systems, is becoming a technology more and more diffused and various models of air to water generators (AWG) are now available, all claiming the best efficiency. To date, there is not a standard indicator stating energy efficiency for AWGs, neither in the literature nor in technical practice. The only evaluation parameter, that can be found is a sort of specific energy consumption (SEC) without any clear indications about the involved calculation terms, definition of hypotheses, or environmental conditions. The current work is a first proposal of an indicator to standardise the AWG efficiency evaluation. The indicator is called WET (Water Energy Transformation); it states water production as a useful effect of an AWG machine and calculates its energy performance with an approach similar to COP (Coefficient of Performance) and EER (Energy Efficiency Ratio) evaluation. The indicator is meant to be a normalised tool that permits comparing different AWG machines, but it is also the first part of a wider study, currently under development that is oriented to obtain a global index formulation that combines WET itself, EER and COP, and it is intended for a comprehensive evaluation of all the useful effects of a reverse cycle in integrated machines, in compliance with the current efficiency evaluation approach. The current paper presents the WET equation, with a discussion about involved terms, a set of normalised calculation conditions and some application examples, including a comparison with SEC.

AB  - As globalization unfolds, economic space opens up. The opportunities for investors to choose the most suitable location for their investment are broader. Investors do not orient the investments where it is advantageous in terms of natural conditions, but where it is more favorable tax conditions. This results in global inefficiency. Taxes are not the only decision-making criterion for investors. There are a number of factors and support from the state, which also can attract or discourage investors. The article deals with the issue of the actual corporate tax burden, through average effective tax rates (EATR). There is a presumption, the statutory tax rate is not a reliable indicator of the tax burden. The aim of the article is to analyze tax systems in The Visegrad Group and to find out the actual tax burden, which is defined by effective taxation. The efficiency of taxation was monitored for selected intangible and tangible assets for 2004 and 2018. The analysis focused on Hungary's attractiveness for foreign investors. In the V4 countries, the impact of the change in the statutory tax rate on the change in the effective average rate on capital was assessed. The result is that Hungary is the most attractive country for foreign investors (EATR - 10.6%). Next is the Czech Republic (EATR - 16.8%), Poland (EATR - 17.1%) and the least attractive country is Slovakia (EATR - 18.7%). Because of information about effective corporate taxation, it is possible to assess and determine the best position for investing capital.

AB  - Spherical TiO2 nanoparticles (npTiO(2)) were prepared by controlled hydrolysis of tetraethoxy orthotitanate under a nitrogen atmosphere. ZnO nanoparticles (npZnO) were prepared using hydrothermal methods. The crystal structure, chemical, thermal and morphological properties of npZnO and npTiO(2) were characterised using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer, enery-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscope techniques. The short- and long-term experiments were started with neonates taken from the same culture and laboratory condition. In the acute experiments, npTiO(2), npZnO, and cocktail concentrations were applied. 96h-LC50 values were 1.8, 0.7, and 0.1mgL(-1), respectively (p<.05). For the chronic experiments, different npTiO(2) concentrations were performed. 21d-LC50 value was 1.0mgL(-1) (p<.05). Morphometry became progressively worse in concentrations of more than 1mgL(-1) npTiO(2). Neonate and young individuals were more sensitive to death because of their low tolerance. This result was affected by population progeny and growth rates (p<.05). While control and 0.5mgL(-1) npTiO(2) groups were determined as growing population, 1.5 and 2mgL(-1) npTiO(2) groups had decreased population size as R-0 values. Consequently, the relationships between nanoparticle accumulation within Daphnia magna and its population structure and body morphometry for each concentration were important indicators. Its tolerance level to nanoparticles under laboratory conditions reflected its replacement and behaviour in the ecosystem.

LA  - Russian
AB  - The article analyzes the formation of new climate policy in Russia in connection with increasing energy efficiency and environmental safety on the basis of technical, technological, organizational, and institutional innovations. Such an integrated approach, creating conditions for synergistic effects, is actively used in developed countries, including EU states, NS follows from the Paris Climate Agreement (2015); however, it is still waiting for consistent application in Russia. The condition for achieving such a synergistic effect is a significant scientific justification for decisions made by regulators and business. For Russia, the regional dimension of this issue is among the most important, due to high regional differentiation of economic development, sectoral structure, and structure of energy balances. In this context, using regression models of panel data, the authors analyze the influence of factors identified as key, on the level of energy intensity of the regional economy. On this basis, the main factors influencing the intensity of environmental pollution are identified, taking into account the amount of energy used to produce GRP. As a result of the research, recommendations are developed for the harmonization of environmental, climate, and energy policies, which should be taken into account when developing the National Low-Carbon Development Strategy for 2050. Particular attention is paid to the completion of the system for recording data on GHG emissions in Russian regions, as well as on clarifying the system of indicators for the effectiveness of energy and climate policy by comparing them with results of the best regions and with international best practices.

AB  - Soils on the Alps are usually weakly developed, both because of the extensive Pleistocene glaciations, and because of slope steepness and climate enhancing erosion. However, on some stable, relict surfaces, particularly in the outermost sections of the Alpine range, some highly developed soils are apparently in contrast with Holocene soil forming conditions. In this work we assess the extent of pedogenesis in some of these soils, located under montane-level vegetation in the Ligurian Alps (SW Piemonte, Italy), and relate it to the effects of climate and parent material.
   The considered well developed profiles showed signs of extremely different pedogenetic processes on the different lithotypes. In particular, Podzols with extremely thick E horizons (up to more than 2 m thick) and very hard, thick ortstein or placic horizons were formed on quartzite. Reddish "terra rossa" Luvisols were formed on limestone. Red, extremely acidic Alisols were formed on shales. The chemical properties, the micromorphology and the clay mineralogy demonstrated high intensity pedogenic trends, and were characteristic of processes usually occurring under different climates.
   They may therefore represent excellent pedo-signatures of different specific past climatic/environmental conditions, as a response of different lithologies to specific soil-forming environments, which range from warm and humid climates typical of red Alisols and Luvisols, to cool and humid/wet climates leading to the formation of Podzols with ortstein/placic horizons.

AB  - Driver inattentiveness is one of critical factors contributing to vehicle crashes. The inter-vehicle safety warning information system (ISWS) is a technology to enhance driver attentiveness by providing warning messages about upcoming hazards using connected vehicle environments. A novel feature of the proposed ISWS is its ability to detect hazardous driving events, such as abrupt accelerations and lane changes, which are defined as moving hazards with a higher potential of causing crashes. This study evaluated the effectiveness of the ISWS in reducing vehicle emissions and its potential for traffic congestion mitigation. This study included a field experiment that documented actual vehicle maneuvering patterns for abrupt accelerations and lane changes, which were used for more realistic simulation evaluations, in addition to normal accelerations and lane changes. Probe vehicles equipped with customized on-board units consisting of a global positioning system (GPS) device, accelerometer, and gyro sensor were used to obtain the vehicle maneuvering data. A microscopic simulator, VISSIM, was used to simulate a driver's responsive behavior when warning messages were delivered. A motor vehicle emission simulator (MOVES) was then used to estimate vehicle emissions. The results show that reduction in vehicle emissions increased when the ISWS's market penetration rate (MPR) and the congestion level of the traffic conditions increased. The maximum CO and CO2 emission reductions achieved were approximately 6% and 7%, respectively, under LOS D traffic conditions. The outcomes of this study can be valuable for deriving smarter operational strategies for ISWS to account for environmental impacts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ungulate and small mammalian fauna have been recovered from Holocene deposits at Wonderwerk Cave, in the interior of South Africa, in the area of excavation 1. Statistical analyses of relative abundances of rodents and insectivores indicate that conditions were warm (between 19.1 and 19.3 degrees C) and very dry in the early Holocene in the Wonderwerk palaeo-environment, becoming moister in the mid-Holocene and still moister in the late Holocene. Temperatures in the late Holocene appear to have been about 1 A degrees C lower than conditions in the early to mid-Holocene. In terms of habitats reflected by rodents, the early Holocene is associated with an abundance of the arid-indicator species, Desmodillus auricularis. The degree of aridity subsequently decreases, associated with an increase in a woodland savanna species, Saccostomus campestris. A later increase in abundance of Mystromus albicaudatus reflects an increase in open grassland in the Late Holocene. Equids (zebras) and alcelaphines (including wildebeest and hartebeest) dominate the ungulate assemblages. Two extinct species are represented in the early Holocene, namely Equus capensis (the giant zebra) and Megalotragus priscus (a large alcelaphine). Possible causes of their extinction may include both environmental and cultural factors. Homo sapiens was probably the main agent of accumulation of the Holocene deposits at Wonderwerk, although leopards (Panthera pardus) may have temporarily used the cave in the mid-Holocene at a time when wind-blown Kalahari sands were introduced.

AB  - A multi-faceted screening programme was designed to search for the oxidases, laccase, peroxidase and tyrosinase. Actinobacteria were selectively isolated from the paunch and colon region of the hindguts of the higher termite, Amitermes hastatus. The isolates were subjected to solid media assays (dye decolourization, melanin production and the utilization of indulin AT as sole carbon source) and liquid media assays. Eleven of the 39 strains had the ability to decolourize the dye RBBR, an indicator for the production of peroxidases in actinobacteria. Melanin production on ISP6 and ISP7 agar plates served as a good indicator for laccase and/or tyrosinase production and the ability of the strains to grow in the presence of indulin AT as a sole carbon source served as a good indicator of lignin peroxidase and/or general peroxidase production. Enzyme-producing strains were cultivated in liquid media and extracellular enzyme activities measured. Strains with the ability to produce oxidative enzymes under the conditions tested were identified to genus level by 16S rRNA gene analysis and compared to known oxidase producers. A strong relationship was observed between the environment sampled (termite guts where lignocellulose degradation occurs) and the dominant type of oxidative enzyme activity detected (laccases and peroxidases), which suggests the possibility of future targeted screening protocols linking the physical properties of the target enzymes with specific operational conditions required, such as lignocellulosic degradation in the preparation of biofuel feedstocks.

AB  - Bankfull hydraulic geometry relationships relate bankfull stream dimensions, such as cross-sectional area, width, mean depth, mean velocity, width to depth ratio, and slope to bankfull discharge. These relationships can assist in determining a design discharge for stream restoration and management projects. This study assessed 27 stable streams located in the Inner Bluegrass and Outer Bluegrass regions of Kentucky. Reaches were selected based on the presence of a U. S. Geological Survey gage, as well as other conditions such as presence of readily identifiable bankfull indicators, stability indices, and site accessibility. Bankfull channel dimensions and discharges were determined, and hydraulic geometry relationships were developed for both the Inner Bluegrass and Outer Bluegrass regions. These scaling relationships for karst-influenced streams were similar to others reported in the literature for non-karst areas. Significant differences between the regions were found only for bankfull width and width-to-depth ratio. Streams in the Inner Bluegrass tended to be more narrow and deep at bankfull discharges less than 10 m(3) s(-1) and wider and shallower at bankfull discharges greater than 20 m(3) s(-1) as compared to stream in the Outer Bluegrass. It is suspected that physiographic conditions related to local geology and/or riparian vegetation at three sites in the Outer Bluegrass accounted for these differences. Results of this study indicate that in instances of geologic variation within a physiographic region, hydraulic geometry relationships may require evaluation at the watershed scale.

AB  - Micro- and mesozooplankton were studied in the Sergipe estuary, northeastern Brazil, in order to assess the temporal variability in abundance and biodiversity under stressed conditions (urban pollution). Zooplankton samples and abiotic data were collected at one station during a full tidal cycle ill July 2001 and in February 2002, corresponding to the rainy and dry seasons, respectively. The salinity regime was euhaline-polyhaline . Phosphate and dissolved Oxygen were higher ill July 2001, and nitrite, nitrate and ammonia in February 2002. Chlorophyll-a concentrations were low as a result of light limitation, with 1.18 +/- 0.88 mu g.m(-3) in February and 1.53 +/- 1.48 mu g.m(-3) in July. Fifty-nine zooplankton taxa were identified. Microzooplankton were abundant, mainly the tintinnid Fovella ehreilbergii, and ranged from 18,649 ind.m(-3) in July to 678,009 ind.m(-3) in February. Mesozooplankton ranged from 1.537 ind.m(-3) in July to 37,062 ind.m(-3) in February and were dominated by barnacle nauplii in July and by copepods in February. The Cluster analysis by taxa revealed the existence of three distinct groups: resilient species, characteristic of estuarine areas and occurring during all the yearn species mainly more abundant in July (indicators of a healthier environmental condition): and species more abundant in February (tolerant to poor water quality).

AB  - Growth in fish and other vertebrates is under endocrine control, particularly through the growth hormone (GH)-insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis. For this reason, it has been of interest to aquaculture researchers and the industry to establish endocrine biomarkers that can both reflect and predict growth rates in fish subject to various biotic and abiotic manipulations. Ultimately, by understanding the hormones that control growth and utilizing them as biomarkers, we hope to achieve optimal growth conditions in the aquaculture environment with less need for lengthy and costly grow-out trials. While the most appropriate endocrine biomarkers for growth can be both species and situation specific, IGF-I may be the most promising candidate for measuring instantaneous growth in fish. This is based on the direct contributions of IGF-I in regulating cell proliferation and ultimately somatic growth, along with its previously established correlations with the specific growth rate in fish under various conditions that alter growth. However, other endocrine indices, such as GH and IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), are also important contributors and may in some instances prove a strong corollary to growth rate. This review discusses the potential utility of GH, IGF-I, and IGFBPs as growth biomarkers for those manipulations most relevant to the aquaculture industry, namely, feeding regimen, diet composition, temperature, photoperiod, and stress.

AB  - We assess the utility of sedimentary hydrocarbons and alcohols as indicators of short-term changes in depositional conditions in the coastal Peruvian upwelling regime at 15-degrees-S.  The distribution of 35 lipids (n-alkanes, n-alkanols, hopanols, keto-ols, lycopane, phytol, stenols, stanols, sterenes, and tetrahymanol) in a 1 m dated core from 253 m water depth are interpreted by (1) a principal components analysis and (2) a consideration of individual source-specific biomarkers.  Profiles of odd-carbon-number n-alkanes (C25-C33) and even-carbon-number n-alkanols (C24-C28) reflect changes in the contribution of terrigenous sediment relative to marine sediment during deposition, as indicated by the correlations between these lipids and inorganic indicators of terrigenous clastic debris. The n-alkane carbon preference index (CPI) provides a less-sensitive record of fluctuations in the terrestrial input than the concentration profiles of the individual n-alkanes and n-alkanols, and these lipids are not well-correlated with the historical El Nino record.  The similarity of all the stenol profiles measured and the lack of concordance between these profiles and inorganic indicators of terrigenous input suggest that any fluctuations in the abundance of higher-plant stenols are obscured by the larger marine contribution of these compounds.  Similarities between the profiles of total organic carbon (TOC) and cholestanol/cholesterol are consistent with stenol hydrogenation being influenced by the sediment redox conditions.

AB  - Marine deposits are widely developed in southern China, and these areas have complex structural features. The structural style has a significant control effect on shale gas distribution. Based on this, in this paper, we use the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to systematically study the structural control characteristics of shale gas in eastern Chongqing area, China. The research results show that the static indicators such as shale reservoir sedimentary environment. TOC, and organic matter types in eastern Chongqing area are similar. But with the Qiyueshan fault as the boundary, the gas content of the shale on the west side of the Qiyueshan fault is significantly higher than that on the east side. Organic matter accumulation is easier to preserve in the shale sedimentary environment of deepwater shelf type. The average TOC value of the shale is above 2.0%, which can be defined as type I-II1, and the maturity reaches or exceeds the high maturity stage. The shale gas accumulation process in eastern Chongqing is mainly controlled by structural sealing, structural style. hydrocarbon generation history, and abnormal formation pressure. The shale reservoir has good gas bearing conditions. The results of the analytic hierarchy process show that the dark shale thickness and surrounding rock conditions in the eastern Chongqing area are generally consistent. The final set of judgments is {Poor, Medium, Good, Excellent} - {0.181, 0.258, 0.154, 0.410}.

AB  - The article considers the problem of development of power loss minimization system in asynchronous motors with asymmetric voltage supply. The subject of the research is a continuous run of asynchronous motor based on artificial adjusting of characteristics in the area of nominal slipping with better energy indicators than at a operational segment of natural mechanical characteristics. The artificial control characteristic of a drive corresponding to power loss minimization mode is calculated in advance using the solution of extreme control concern. The paper demonstrates that under conditions of electric drive supplied by an asymmetric voltage source the one should apply a phase-by-phase control. The feedback action logic is as follows: reduction of the output voltage of thyristor converter and motor currents as a reducing of the load on the asynchronous motor shaft occurs. As a result, there appears the possibility to maintain the load angle equality of all the phases of asynchronous motor to an optimal value. This allows to solve the problem of power loss minimization in an asynchronous motor due to the load angle equality to the optimal value, and the problem of symmetrization due to the load angle equality in motor phases. The most significant result of the research is the developed automated scheme of symmetrization which is not only efficient with power source voltage asymmetry, but also with asymmetry of asynchronous motor parameters themselves. The proposed functional scheme of microprocessor control and the algorithm of control increase the possibilities of automated loss minimization system.

AB  - Summer tourism is one of the most important contributors to the European GDP especially for the southern countries and is highly dependent on the climatic conditions. Changes in average climatic conditions, along with the potential subsequent changes in the physical environment, will pose stress on the favorability of the climate of European destinations for tourism and recreational activities. Here, we study the vulnerability of summer-oriented tourism due to a global temperature increase by 2 degrees C relative to the preindustrial era. We use a well-defined framework of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity indicators for a set of plausible climate (RCPs) and socioeconomic (SSPs) combinations. Our result shows that a 2 degrees C global warming will pose substantial changes to the vulnerability of the European tourism sector. Despite the general increase in exposure, the vulnerability of summer tourism is highly depended on the socioeconomic developments (SSPs). Although exposure is higher for most of the popular southern European destinations like Spain, France, South Italy, southernmost Greece, and Cyprus, they are expected to be less vulnerable than others, under specific SSPs, due to their higher capacity to adapt to a different climate. The capacity to adapt is lower for higher emission scenarios. Substantial changes are also apparent at the subnational level. Countries like France are foreseen to experience very diverse impacts and vulnerabilities within their own territories that will have consequences in terms of domestic tourism. The dynamics of these changes are expected to alter the state of the current European tourism regime.

AB  - One of the primary components of municipal sewage is organic pollution, the content of which is determined most often on the basis of its biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5). In the paper, a simple regression model was developed to estimate BOD5 values of municipal sewage in order to ensure ongoing efficiency control of the biological treatment process and possibilities for optimizing the operating conditions of biological reactors. The model was developed from the long-term monitoring data (1990-2000) on wastewater quality in the Terrence J. O'Brien Water Reclamation Plant in Chicago (USA). Statistical analysis covered the following quality indicators for the sewage material flowing into the treatment plant: pH, BOD5, total suspended solids, ammonium nitrogen, Kjeldahl nitrogen and nitrates. All calculations were made using a statistical program R with R Studio patch, version 1.0.143. Akaiki Information Criterion (AIC) and the Leaps algorithm were employed to select parameters relevant to constructing the model. Based on the results of model testing, the regression model for BOD5 values estimation in municipal wastewaters was formulated. The model employed parameters such as total suspended solids, Kjeldahl nitrogen and nitrates wastewater content. The algorithm of formulating the regression model that allows for quick generation of approximate BOD5 values in wastewater can be applied to development of similar models for other treatment plants, with no need for frequent laboratory testing and long wait for the results.

AB  - The development of current surgical treatments for intervertebral disc damage could benefit from virtual environment accounting for population variations. For such models to be reliable, a relevant description of the mechanical properties of the different tissues and their role in the functional mechanics of the disc is of major importance. The aims of this work were first to assess the physiological hoop strain in the annulus fibrosus in fresh conditions (n= 5) in order to extract a functional behaviour of the extrafibrillar matrix; then to reverse-engineer the annulus fibrosus fibrillar behaviour (n= 6). This was achieved by performing both direct and global controlled calibration of material parameters, accounting for the whole process of experimental design and in silico model methodology. Direct-controlled models are specimen-specific models representing controlled experimental conditions that can be replicated and directly comparing measurements. Validation was performed on another six specimens and a sensitivity study was performed. Hoop strains were measured as 17 +/- 3% after 10min relaxation and 21 +/- 4% after 2025 min relaxation, with no significant difference between the two measurements. The extrafibrillar matrix functional moduli were measured as 1.5 +/- 0.7 MPa. Fibre-related material parameters showed large variability, with a variance above 0.28. Direct-controlled calibration and validation provides confidence that the model development methodology can capture the measurable variation within the population of tested specimens.

AB  - This article describes the use of polymer-clay composite materials as sorbents for the purification of wastewater containing surface-active agents (surfactants). Intercalation synthesized by means of three-dimensional radical polymerization, the composite gels based on bentonite clay deposits Manyrak East Kazakhstan region and polyacrylic acid (PAA-B.) with different cross- linking, have improved strength, swelling and sorption-desorption characteristics. Therefore, they are of great interest from the point of view of their use as a sorbent materials in respect of surfactants. As a result, a number of studies of sorption-desorption BC-PAA indicators for cationic surfactants cetylpyridinium bromide (CPU). The kinetics of sorption depending composite gels in a solution of the CPU when the external conditions of the environment - the influence of temperature and pH. Based on a study of the sorption capacity acrylate-clay of composite sorbents it was found that increasing of the cross-linking agent in the composite and the change of external factors contribute to a substantial change in the properties of the sorbent. Studies suggest that an increase in temperature and pH of the medium leads to a significant increase sorption capacity gels, whereas, increased crosslinking of the gel composition leads to a reduction of the sorption performance. It was found that the optimum conditions for maximum sorption composite BC-PAA of cationic molecules CPU (up to 80-90 %) are the following: the degree of crosslinking of the composite of 0.5 % (MBAA), ambient temperature - 60 degrees C and pH environment - alkaline.

AB  - The potential threat to seagrasses of the invasive algae, Gracilaria vermiculophylla was assessed through metabolic indicators under experimental conditions Net leaf photosynthesis (LNP) and dark respiration (I.DR) were measured from leaf segments of Zostera manna shoots under different loads of G vermiculophylla (control, low 2 2 kg FW m(-2) and high 4 kg FW m(-2)) in mesocosm experiments separated in tanks at four temperatures (19, 23 5, 26 and 30 degrees C). LNP decreased in the presence of the high density G vermiculophylla mat (25% on average), being the most severe reductions at 30 degrees C (35% less in high). LDR did not respond significantly to differences in algal biomass, whereas a progressive increase was found with increasing temperatures (3 4 times higher at 30 degrees C than at 19 degrees C). Sulphide in porewater was measured weekly in order clarify the role of sediment conditions on seagrass metabolism, and increased both with algal biomass (29% in high) and temperature (from 0.5 mM at 26 degrees C to 2.6 mM at 30 degrees C), but changes in LNP and LDR were not correlated with sulphide concentrations. Seagrass survival rates showed decreasing trend with algal biomass at all the temperatures (from 74% to 21% survival) C; vermiculophylla showed harmful effects on Z. marina metabolism and survival with synergistic effects of temperature suggesting greater impact of invasive species under future higher water temperatures (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The potential influence of process principles and system conditions on shaping protozoan community structures in eight full-scale municipal wastewater treatment systems in Beijing, including four process types, i.e., anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic or anoxic/anaerobic/aerobic process (A2O), anoxic/aerobic or anaerobic/aerobic process (AO), oxidation ditch (OD) and sequencing batch reactor (SBR), was evaluated with the aid of cluster analysis and principal components analysis (PCA). The species richness and abundance distribution of protozoa varied significantly with the process types: the A2O ecosystems harbored more diverse protozoan communities with higher relative abundance of crawling and sessile ciliates than the other systems. Cluster analysis revealed that the protozoan community structures were in high coordination with the process types, i.e., different systems with the same process principles exhibited similar community structures. The A2O processes displayed a distinctively higher similarity of protozoan community structures than the AO processes, suggesting that the A2O ecosystems were more stable than those of AO. The PCA analyses demonstrated that swimming and carnivorous ciliates were correlated with poor settleability of sludge, and that amoebae were sensitive to DO level. We therefore concluded that protozoan community structures were primarily shaped by treatment process principles, whilst they were also modified by system conditions in terms of operational properties and water quality.

AB  - Estimation of biomass of a mountainous tropical forest using satellite data is an alternative approach to extensive field surveys. However, sampling of the biomass can be expensive, time-consuming, and difficult depending on the nature of field conditions. Instead of directly estimating the biomass from the satellite data when the sample size is small, it is intended to estimate the biomass of the mountainous tropical forest in Kinabalu Park, Sabah, Malaysia, using the well-established biophysical relationship between crown diameter and biomass. Landsat thematic mapper (TM) data are corrected for geometric distortion and are georeferenced to facilitate satellite data extraction. Path radiance for atmospheric correction is derived using the histogram method, and the Minnaert correction approach is employed to correct for topographic effects. Correlation and regression analyses are carried out with the six original bands and several derived satellite variables (several vegetation indices, tasseled cap transformation variables, and coefficients of pattern decomposition). When the sample size of the biomass is small, estimation using a biophysical relationship between the biomass and other structural variable such as crown diameter is more appropriate and reliable. Owing to biomass data availability, the biophysical relationship between biomass and crown diameter can only be established for closed forest. The closed forest is distinguished using percent crown cover, which is estimated from the wetness indicator. Under the closed forest condition, a significant inverse correlation between band I and crown diameter is found. Using the biophysical relationship, biomass is then estimated from crown diameter, which is estimated from band 1.

AB  - Conservation and improvement of water quality in water bodies is an important matter to maintain all of its uses as well as other human necessities like microclimate regulation and leisure. Lakes and reservoirs have a complex circulation behavior with vertical temperature profiles changes along the time, resulting in differences in water density and a vertical stratification condition. This characteristic can directly affect the water quality conditions perturbing its main indicators. This study aims to evaluate the quasi-3D models' capacity to represent the hydrodynamic behavior of a tropical lake and its effects on the main variables that characterize its water quality. To achieve this objective, high-frequency monitoring data were collected, the lake was represented in a quasi-3D model, and the accuracy of the result was evaluated by applying statistical indices. The evaluation showed good agreement between field measures and simulated results when compared with other applications. The connections between hydrodynamic behavior and water quality were seen with the simulations results analysis, which showed that mixing events and long stratification periods perturb the water quality, the first with re-suspended bed material and the second blocking the surface and bottom exchanges. The application of a 3D model gives the capacity to reproduce the reservoir spatial variability and its vertical profiles, which is necessary to study the constituents' distributions across the water column. Therefore, the hydrodynamic and water quality behavior of lakes was accurately represented by the model, as well as the importance of improving high-frequency monitoring techniques.

AB  - Goal. Checking the efficiency of the active rectifier with differences types of control systems in conditions of deep voltage distortions of a three-phase three-wire supply network. Methodology. The authors have used the Matlab/Simulink software environment to create a model of an active rectifier with various types of control systems as part of a frequency electric drive. We performed a series of simulations of the operating modes of an active rectifier with various control systems when the supply voltage is distorted. Results. When the active rectifier is operating in an unregulated mode, the distortions of the current and mains voltage exceed the maximum permissible values. The quality indicators of the mains current and mains voltage are significantly higher than the normally permissible values. In the absence of voltage distortions in the supply network, the operation of the active rectifier can effectively eliminate the distortions of the mains current, regardless of the type of control system of the active rectifier. In conditions of deep distortions of the supply network voltage, the operation of an active rectifier with a vector control system is more efficient than with a parametric control system. Originality. Criteria for determining the quality of consumed electricity at the connection point of the circuit are proposed. Practical significance. Recommendations have been developed for the use of active rectifier control systems when working with a distorted power supply voltage. References 8, tables 4, figures 11.

AB  - It is generally admitted that dispersivity is an indicator of the heterogeneity scale of porous media. This parameter is assumed to be an intrinsic property which characterizes the dispersive behavior during the transport of a tracer in a porous medium. When the medium is saturated by two fluid phases (water and air), dispersivity depends strongly on saturation. "Double-porosity" medium concept can be attributed to a class of heterogeneous soils and rocks in which a strong contrast in local pore size characteristics is observed. In this work, we characterized non-Fickian dispersivities of a double-porosity medium at different saturations, by performing numerical simulations for a series of one-dimensional experiments of tracer dispersion under different initial and boundary conditions. The physical double-porosity model was composed of solidified clayey spheres, distributed periodically in a more permeable sandy matrix. Using a two-equation macroscopic model, numerical simulations reproduced very well the experimental data, thus allowing to determine the dispersivity for different transport scenarios. For the first time, the existence of a unique dispersivity of a double-porosity medium at a given saturation was demonstrated for different transport scenarios of initial and boundary conditions. The saturation dependence of the dispersivity in the double-porosity medium was established and compared with the trends obtained for the single-porosity soils in previous studies.

AB  - Geographic variation in body size is common within many animal species. The causes of this pattern, however, remain largely unexplored in most vertebrate groups. Bats are widely distributed globally owing to their ability of powered flight. Most bat species encounter a variety of climatic conditions across their distribution range, making them an ideal taxon for the study of ecogeographic patterns in body size. Here, we used adult least horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus pusillus, to test whether geographic variation in body size was determined by heat conservation, heat dissipation, climatic seasonality, or primary productivity. We measured body mass and head-body length for 246 adult bats from 12 allopatric colonies in China. We quantified the ecological conditions inhabited by each colony, including mean maximum temperature of the warmest month, mean minimum temperature of the coldest month, temperature seasonality, precipitation seasonality, and annual net primary productivity (ANPP). Body mass and head-body length, 2 of the most reliable indicators of body size, exhibited marked differences between colonies. After controlling for spatial autocorrelation, the mean minimum temperature of the coldest month explained most of the variation in body size among colonies, regardless of sex. The mean maximum temperature, climatic seasonality, and ANPP had limited power in predicting body size of males or females in comparison with mean minimum temperature. These results support the heat conservation hypothesis and suggest adaptive responses of body size to cold climates in cave-dwelling bats.

AB  - There is increased demand for irrigation scheduling tools that support effective use of the limited supply of irrigation water. An efficient precision irrigation system requires water to be delivered based on crop needs by measuring or estimating plant water stress. Leaf temperature is a good indicator of water stress. In this study, a system was developed to monitor leaf temperature and microclimatic environmental variables to predict plant water stress. This system, called the leaf monitor, monitored plant water status by continuously measuring leaf temperature, air temperature, relative humidity, ambient light, and wind conditions in the vicinity of a shaded leaf. The system also included a leaf holder, a solar radiation diffuser dome, and a wind barrier for improved performance of the unit. Controlled wind speed and consistent light conditions were created around the leaf to reduce the effect of nuisance variables on leaf temperature. The leaf monitor was incorporated into a mesh network of wireless nodes for sensor data collection and remote valve control. The system was evaluated for remote data collection in commercial orchards. Experiments were conducted during the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons in walnut (Juglans regia) and almond (Prunus dulcis) orchards. The system was found to be reliable and capable of providing real-time visualization of the data remotely, with minimal technical problems. Leaf monitor data were used to develop modified crop water stress index (MCWSI) values for quantifying plant water stress levels.

AB  - Perfluoroalkyl adds (PFAAs) have been determined in the environment globally. However, studies on the occurrence of PFAAs in marine sediment remain limited. In this study, 16 PFAAs are investigated in surface sediments from the German Bight, which provided a good overview of the spatial distribution. The concentrations of Sigma PFAAs ranged from 0.056 to 7.4 ng/g dry weight. The highest concentration was found at the estuary of the River Ems, which might be the result of local discharge source. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) was the dominant compound, and the enrichment of PFOS in sediment might be strongly related to the compound structure itself. The geographical condition of the German Bight influenced the movement of water and sediment, resulting in complex distribution. Following normalization according to total organic carbon (TOC) content, PFAA distributions showed a different picture. Significant linear relationships were found between total PFAA concentrations and TOC (R-2 = 0.50, p < 0.01). Compared with a previous study conducted in the same area, a declining trend was presented for the concentrations of PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Compound structure, geographical condition, and organic carbon in the sediment influence the distribution of PFAAs in the German Bight. Environmental risk assessment indicated that the risk from PFOA is negligible, whereas PFOS in marine sediment may present a risk for benthic organisms in the German Bight. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Upper Miocene lignite from the Main coal seam in the D field, Kolubara basin, is a typical humic coal with huminite, liptinite and inertinite concentrations of up to 83.7 vol.%, 17.2 vol.% and 15.5 vol.%, respectively. In the huminite group, textinite and ulminite are the most abundant macerals with variable amounts of densinite and attrinite. Liptodetrinite and sporinite are the most common macerals of the liptinite group, while inertodetrinite is the most abundant maceral of the inertinite group. The mineral matter consists mostly of clay minerals. The main sources of organic matter were gymnosperms (conifers) and microbial biomass, followed by angiosperms. Based on composition of saturated and aromatic diterpenoids it has been established that coal forming plants belonged to the gymnosperm families Taxodiaceae, Podocarpaceae, Cupressaceae, Araucariaceae, Phyllocladaceae and Pinaceae. Peatification occurred in neutral to slightly acidic, fresh water environment Composition and distribution of biomarkers show that diagenetic changes of the organic matter were mainly governed by bacterial activity in a suboxic to oxic environment Based on distribution of aromatic diterpenoids a novel diagenetic pathway for transformation of abietane-type precursors under suboxic to oxic conditions is proposed. Variations in compositions of macerals and biomarkers are in concordance with pronounced seasonality during Pontian, which caused changes in the water level, redox conditions during peatification, and to some extent vegetation differences in the paleo-plant communities.

AB  - To understand the soil microbial activities and community structures in different forests in a sand-dune ecosystem, we conducted a study of 2 topographic conditions, upland and lowland, under a Casuarina forest. As well, in the lowland site, we compared forest soil microbial properties under 3 coastal forests (Casuarina, Hibiscus and mixed stand). The soil microbial biomass did not significantly differ between the upland and lowland Casuarina forest sites.
   At the lowland site, the soil microbial biomass was higher in the Hibiscus than Casuarina forest soil. Cellulase, xylanase, phosphatase and urease activities did not show a consistent trend by topography or vegetation. Analysis of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) of bacteria and actinomycetes revealed a significant difference in microbial community structure by both topography and vegetation. PLFA content was higher at upland than lowland sites in the Casuarina forest. At the lowland site, the level of PLFAs was higher in Hibiscus than Casuarina forest soil. In addition, we examined the ratios 16:10,70 6:1 omega 7c and, cy17:0/16:1 omega 7c as indicators of physiological stress; the soil in the Casuarina forest had the highest values, which suggests that the microbial community in the Casuarina forest soil is under physiological stress or starvation conditions. Comparison of soil microbial properties suggest that planting Hibiscus may help to enrich soil fertility and increase microbial activities in coastal sand-dune Casuarina forest.

AB  - Continuous lacustrine deposits of the Funza-II core from the Bogota basin, Colombia (5degreesN74degreesW) record late Pleistocene climatic variations, providing an opportunity to assess the influence of glacial-interglacial climate changes on alpine ecosystems in equatorial South America. Biogeochemical response of this tropical alpine system to climate change was inferred from changes in elemental concentrations and ratios and isotopic signatures in the upper 120 m of the lacustrine Funza core.
   Values of delta(13)C(org) exhibit eight abrupt, positive shifts that are thought to reflect rapid expansions of C-4 grasses in the tropical Andes and algal blooms. One of these excursions, interpreted to correspond to C-4 vegetation expansion, occurred in sediments accumulated during the last glaciation (similar to30,000-50,000 yr B.P.) and implies a downslope shift of the upper Andean treeline, regardless of prevailing temperatures.
   Sedimentary carbon/sulfur ratios are low and indicate significant sequestering of sulfur. Monosulfides are the dominant constituent of sedimentary sulfur during relatively humid intervals, when increased supply of iron caused by enhanced weathering favored the formation of monosulfide minerals under strongly reducing conditions. In contrast, organosulfur compounds dominate the sedimentary sulfur-species in relatively drier intervals when mildly reducing conditions and limited iron input promoted the diagenetic incorporation of sulfur in organic matter. Dry events inferred from the sulfur record typically correlate with glacial maxima, whereas glacial terminations are usually associated with wet periods. (C) 2002 University of Washington.

AB  - Diatom and coccolithophorid abundance and diatom assemblage composition found in the water column along the Portuguese margin, during upwelling and non-upwelling conditions, are compared to the distribution patterns observed in the recent sediments from the same area. The water column results indicate a one order of magnitude increase in phytoplankton biomass during upwelling conditions (summer), with diatoms being the most important contributors. Coccolithophorids, on the contrary, dominate the phytoplankton in winter (non-upwelling), The comparison of the upwelling and non-upwelling spatial distribution of these phytoplankton groups to their sedimentary record reveals the sediment record as a reflection of the upwelling situation, preserving most of its original spatial variability. The comparison between Living and fossil diatom assemblages indicates that from the two genera which dominate the summer biologic assemblage, Pseudo-nitzschia and Chaetoceros, Pseudo-nitzschia is not represented in the sediments, while Chaetoceros is the dominant form of the sediment. Thalassiosira which occurs in the same abundance in both seasons, responding to both river and upwelling nutrient input, can not be a reliable indicator of any single process. However, this genus distribution in the sediments can be used as an indicator of continuous nutrient availability.
   Such results are of great importance for paleoceanographic reconstructions since they constitute a good indication that the sediment record, even though somewhat altered with respect to assemblage composition, does reflect the water column characteristics.

AB  - Plants need a specific environment to grow and reproduce in fine fettle. Nevertheless, climatic conditions are not stable and can impact their well-being and, consequently, harvest quality. Thus, greenhouse cultivation is one of the suitable agricultural techniques for creating and controlling the inside microclimate to be adequate for plant growth. The relevance of greenhouse control is widely recognized. The prediction of greenhouse variables using artificial intelligence methods is of great interest for intelligent control and the potential reduction in energetic and financial losses. However, the studies carried out in this context are still more or less limited and several machine learning methods have not been sufficiently exploited. The aim of this study is to predict the air conditioning electrical consumption and photovoltaic module electrical production at the smart Agro-Manufacturing Laboratory (SamLab) greenhouse, located in Albenga, north-western Italy. Different supervised machine learning methods were compared, namely, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Boosting trees. We evaluated the performance of the models based on three statistical indicators: the coefficient of correlation (R), the normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) and the normalized mean absolute error (nMAE). The results show good agreement between the measured and predicted values for all models, with a correlation coefficient R > 0.9, considering the validation set. The good performance of the models affirms the importance of this approach and that it can be used to further improve greenhouse efficiency through its intelligent control.

AB  - Considering the daily stress of increased incidence of cardiovascular comorbidities, especially essential hypertension (EHTA) and type 2 diabetes (DM), with special clinical implications and the possibility of complications, and also taking into account the contraindications of spa treatments, and the need to apply some functional rehabilitation therapies, we have conducted an observational epidemiological study on the frequency of these conditions, on selected batches of patients in the Balneal and Rehabilitation Sanatorium of Techirghiol (BRST). The study was conducted prospectively on 1377 patients enrolled in BRST for specialised treatment, seeking to identify the most common associated conditions: EHTA and DM type 2 and at the same time to identify the presence of the two diseases in the same patient, by age category. The relationship of age, gender and background dependence was analysed in patients presenting as associated hypertension and type 2 diabetes. There is a direct correlation between EHTA and age (p < 0.001), respectively home environment (p = 0.035) and there is no direct correlation between EHTA and gender (p = 0.114). Also there is a direct correlation between type 2 DM and age (p < 0.001), respectively gender (p < 0.001); there is no direct correlation between the home environment and the presence of the type 2 DM (p = 0.302). There are significant correlations between certain demographic indicators and the most common comorbidities identified in patients in the EHTA and DM type 2 hospitals, which allows us to identify a pattern that can be compared with statistical data published in the literature.

AB  - We propose a framework on sample size for species sensitivity distribution (SSD) analyses, with perspectives on Bayesian, frequentist, and even nonparametric approaches to estimation. The intent of a statistical sample size analysis is to ensure that the implementation of a statistical model will satisfy a minimum performance standard when relevant conditions are met. It requires that a statistical model be fully specified and that the means of measuring its performance as a function of sample size be detailed. Defining the model conditions under which sample size is calculated is often the most difficult, and important, aspect of sample size analysis because if the model is not representative, then the sample size analysis will provide incorrect guidance. Definitive guidance on sample size requires general agreement on representative models and their performance from stakeholders in important domains such as chemical safety assessments involving government regulators and industry; the present study provides an initial framework that could be used to this end in the future. In addition, our analysis provides immediate value for understanding how well current SSD analyses perform under a few basic models, sample sizes, and quantitative performance criteria. The results confirm that many analyses are adequately sized to estimate hazardous concentration percentile values (typically the 5th percentile for chemical hazard assessments). However, on the low end of sizes seen in common practice, hazardous concentration estimates can be more than 1 order of magnitude greater than the model-defined value.

AB  - Aiming at the anti-poverty outline of China and the human-environment sustainable development, we propose a multidimensional poverty measure and analysis methodology for measuring the poverty-stricken counties and their contributing factors. We build a set of multidimensional poverty indicators with Chinese characteristics, integrating A-F double cutoffs, dimensional aggregation and decomposition approach, and GIS spatial analysis to evaluate the poor's multidimensional poverty characteristics under different geographic and socioeconomic conditions. The case study from 11 counties of Hechi City shows that, firstly, each county existed at least four respects of poverty, and overall the poverty level showed the spatial pattern of surrounding higher versus middle lower. Secondly, three main poverty contributing factors were unsafe housing, family health and adults' illiteracy, while the secondary factors include fuel type and children enrollment rate, etc., generally demonstrating strong autocorrelation; in terms of poverty degree, the western of the research area shows a significant aggregation effect, whereas the central and the eastern represent significant spatial heterogeneous distribution. Thirdly, under three kinds of socioeconomic classifications, the intra-classification diversities of H, A, and MPI are greater than their inter-classification ones, while each of the three indexes has a positive correlation with both the rocky desertification degree and topographic fragmentation degree, respectively. This study could help policymakers better understand the local poverty by identifying the poor, locating them and describing their characteristics, so as to take differentiated poverty alleviation measures according to specific conditions of each county.

AB  - The biostratigraphy and the response of calcareous nannofossils to the End Cretaceous warming are investigated in the lower boundary of Kalat formation through the record of species richness, diversity, distribution patterns, and statistical treatments. The Kalat formation comprised of coarse-grained detritus limestone with subordinate sandstone intercalations. In the studied sections, the number of ten samples were taken and prepared with smear slide. In Dobaradar, section 22 species; in Kalat, section 25 species; and in Chahchaheh, section 32 species have been determined. Based on nannoplanktons and as a result of biostratigraphic studies, the nannofossil standard zones (CC25-CC26) were identified in all of sections. According to these zones in all of sections, the age of the studied thickness is Late Maastrichtian-Late Late Maastrichtian. In these sections, the presence of Micula murus at the end of Neyzar formation and the presence of this species at the lower part of Kalat formation indicate that the investigated boundary is Late Maastrichtian in age. The paleoecological results point to warm climate. The presence of warm water indicators (M. murus and Micula prinsii) and the absence of cool water indicators (Ahmuellerella octoradiata, Kamptnerius magnificus, and Nephrolithus frequens) suggest warm surface water conditions in these areas. In the lower boundary of Kalat formation, base on Lithraphidites spp. and Watznaueria barnesae, lowered fertility condition with low productivity at the end of the Maastrichtian were suggested, and the studied area was deposited in shallow marine environment in relatively low latitude.

AB  - Modern information technologies have facilitated the collection of data to assess various aspects of rice production such as yield, quality, soil properties and growth conditions. Currently, farmers can identify any variation of these indicators within a field, between fields or with other farmers. However, a comprehensive analytical method to identify the determinants of variability has not been developed, and the data collected are not efficiently utilized to diagnose and improve the production skills of farmers. Our study focused on the development of an analytical method that can identify the determinants of rice yield and quality. The analytical method used applied cluster analysis (Ward method) to assess the data from 82 paddy fields where rice is produced in various environments and with various management styles. Initially, the 82 paddy fields were classified into 11 clusters based on five indicators of yield components and rice quality; number of panicles, number of spikelets, percentage of ripened grains, 1000-grain weight (GW) and protein content of brown rice. Then, 9 of 11 clusters (two clusters were excluded due to insufficient data to form a cluster) were divided into four groups based on yield capacity. As a result, common characteristics of fertilizer application, meteorological environment and growth conditions were extracted from each cluster. Furthermore, determinants of yield components and protein content were efficiently identified based on the common characteristics extracted. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study presents unique data on the effects of antecedent soil moisture on runoff generation in a semi-arid environment, with implications for process-based modeling of runoff. The data were collected from four small watersheds measured continuously from 2002 through 2010 in an environment where evapo-transpiration approaches 100% of the infiltrated water on the hillslopes. Storm events were generally intense and of short duration, and antecedent volumetric moisture conditions were dry, with an average in the upper 5 cm soil layer over the nine year period of 8% and a standard deviation of 3 %. Sensitivity analysis of the model showed an average of 0.05 mm change in runoff for each 1% change in soil moisture, indicating an approximate 0.15 mm average variation in runoff accounted for by the 3% standard deviation of measured antecedent soil moisture. This compared to a standard deviation of 4.7 mm in the runoff depths for the measured events. Thus the low variability of soil moisture in this environment accounts for a relative lack of importance of storm antecedent soil moisture for modeling the runoff. Runoff characteristics simulated with a nine year average of antecedent soil moisture were statistically identical to those simulated with measured antecedent soil moisture, indicating that long term average antecedent soil moisture could be used as a substitute for measured antecedent soil moisture for runoff modeling of these watersheds. We also found no significant correlations between measured runoff ratio and antecedent soil moisture in any of the four watersheds.

AB  - In order for connectivity to serve as an effective diagnostic classification tool of hydrological behavior, it clearly matters (1) how it is measured and (2) whether the chosen measures are correlated not only to catchment-scale antecedent moisture conditions but also to streamflow discharges. Previous studies have advocated that connectivity in shallow soil moisture patterns induces threshold-like changes in runoff in temperate rangeland catchments but not in temperate humid forested catchments. We argue that in the latter environments, capturing critical spatial organization in soil moisture patterns depends on the way the chosen connectivity metric is built. We therefore tested a large selection of 2-D and 3-D connectivity measures in a temperate humid forested catchment (Laurentians, Canada). Computations were based on continuous soil moisture patterns collected on 16 occasions at four soil depths and then transformed into indicator patterns using either time-variable or time-invariant thresholds. Assessments of connectivity were variable depending on the computed metric, as just a few measures were significantly correlated with both antecedent moisture conditions and catchment discharges. In particular, topography-based connectivity metrics reflected changes in catchment macrostate and stormflow response better than omnidirectional methods. Also, source-to-stream connectivity metrics were more hydrologically sensitive than metrics that did not consider the spatial linkage to the stream channel. These conclusions stress the importance of searching for the right connectivity metric for hydrologic prediction, especially in humid forested environments that exhibit much larger variability in soil hydrologic properties than temperate rangeland catchments.

AB  - This paper investigates the biological responses of Crassostrea gigas under traditional culture conditions on a mudflat in Marennes-Oleron bay. Summer mortality has been regularly observed in recent years in oysters reared using "on bottom" culture conditions. The present study attempts to provide a better understanding of the mortality phenomenon through biological parameters. Classical 'field parameters' such as mortality and growth rates, and quality index (dry meat weight/ dry shell weight x 1000) were monitored. Additional parameters, as biochemical composition of oyster meat and glucose incorporation capacity, were included as potential new bioindicators. The work highlighted a critical timing (May-June) preceding the summer mortality and characterised by an arrest in lipid synthesis and a decrease in carbohydrate content. During this period, growth (especially gonad maturation) either slowed down significantly or even stopped. The first mortality event occurred during a growth renewal period at the end of June. Short-term analysis (15 days) provided information to identify such responses which may indicate a physiological stress and demonstrating the need for further investigation. The seasonal food availability (estimated from chlorophyll a levels) did not facilitate the mortality understanding which occurred after water temperature went above 18-19 T. Nevertheless, this study shows carbohydrate anabolism contributed in the physiological stress leading to mortality events. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB  - In the fall of 2000, 34 groundwater samples were collected from beneath an active pesticide reformulating and packaging facility in coastal northeastern Florida to measure the enantiomer fractions (EFs) of alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-ACH) as an indicator of biodegradation of this chlorinated pesticide in groundwater. Concentrations of alpha-ACH as high as 500 mug/L were observed beneath the historical source area and decreased with distance downgradient. Seventy-eight percent of the EF values were greater than 0.504 and ranged up to 0.890, indicating that the (-)-alpha-HCH enantiomer is preferentially degraded relative to the (+)-alpha-HCH enantiomer at this site. Samples taken from the groundwater that flows north from the historical disposal facility to a local discharge point at a creek did not indicate enantioselective degradation (EF values ranged from 0.495 to 0.512). The acidity (pH 3.7-4.6) and short flow path to the creek for this lobe of the groundwater plume likely preclude biodegradation of alpha-ACH. In contrast, the neutral lobe of the groundwater plume, which flows eastward from the historical source area, demonstrated enantioselective degradation (EF values ranged from 0.500 to 0.890 and increased with distance from the source area). Groundwater conditions beneath this portion of the site are conducive to biodegradation of HCH owing to anaerobic reducing conditions and lengthy travel times, and the chiral signatures for alpha-HCH provide evidence that biological degradation is occurring beneath this portion of the site.

AB  - This work presents an extensive study on methodologies to calibrate electric energy consumption in buildings. A comparison between several calibration methodologies shows different approaches addressing the same issue, suggesting a lack of a unique methodology that is reproducible for every building. Additionally, no methodology fits the Brazilian public context, such as the predominance of Unitary Air Conditioning Systems (UACS) and buildings which have operated for more than 30 years. A new calibration methodology for performance simulation is proposed to deal with such features. The methodology is separated into two evidence-based steps according to the size of the Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems used to control buildings' indoor environments: the first step is dedicated to calibrating medium- and large-sized HVAC systems, and the second step is dedicated to calibrating small-sized HVAC systems. University Hospital of University of Sao Paulo (UH-USP) is used as a test bed to implement the proposed methodology. Accuracy indicators show the efficiency of the methodology in terms of calibrating a simulation of the whole UH-USP building and Chilled Water Plant on a monthly basis in terms of accuracy and the time needed to perform the calibration. However, regarding simulation of UACS, the application of the methodology was inconclusive. This study leaves open the question of the trade-off between increasing model outcome accuracy and the strictness of accuracy indicators applied to UACS and poorly automated large-sized air conditioners.

AB  - Escherichia coli, one of the primary intestinal commensal bacteria in humans and endothermic animals, is commonly considered an indicator of faecal pollution. E. coli strains were isolated from karst rivers under different hydrological conditions, from footpaths in tourist caves and from bat guano. Isolates were tested for phenotypic resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, tetracycline and trime-thoprim. The highest percentage of antimicrobial resistant E. coli was found in karst waters, followed by those from surface swabs and from bat guano. Several isolates from rivers and swabs exhibited multidrug-resistant phenotype. Environmental conditions impact the populations of E. coli; a positive correlation between dissolved oxygen and E. coli counts, and a negative correlation between conductivity and E. coli concentrations have been observed for karst rivers. Malenkica (Slovenia), a drinking water resource with an extensive catchment area, contained a relative high percentage of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli strains. None of the isolates from bat guano was resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline. Future monitoring of bats should consider a regular follow-up of indicative microbial disease indicators in fresh guano. Regular cleansing of tourist footpaths in caves and disinfection barriers at the cave entrances reduce the concentration and transmission of E. coli significantly. A future, more detailed, study on characterization of additional E. coli isolates is needed to reveal their pathogeneicity, mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, mobile genetic elements, and gene transfer frequencies to other members of the karst microbiome.

AB  - Three large training sets were investigated to determine optimal sample sizes for diatom-based inference models. The sample sets represented (1) assemblages from Great Lakes coastlines, (2) phytoplankton from the pelagic Great Lakes and (3) surface sediment assemblages from Minnesota lakes. Diatom-based weighted average models to infer nutrient concentrations were developed for each training set. Training set sample sizes ranging from 10 to the maximum number of samples were created through random sample selection, and performance of each model was evaluated. For each model iteration, diatom-inferred (DI) nutrient data were related to stressor data (e.g., adjacent agricultural or urban development) to characterize the ability of each model to track human activities. The relationships between model performance parameters (DI-stressor correlations and model r (2), error and bias) and sample size were used to determine the minimum sample size needed to optimize models for each region. Depending on the training set, at least 40-70 samples were needed to capture the variation in diatom assemblages and environmental conditions to such a degree that non-analog situations should be rare and so should provide an unambiguous result if the model was applied to any sample assemblage from the region. It is recommended that one exercises caution when dealing with smaller training sets unless there is certainty that the selected samples reflect the regional variability in diatom assemblages and environmental conditions.

AB  - We sampled 92 wetlands from four different basins in the United States to quantify observer repeatability in rapid wetland condition assessment using the Delaware Rapid Assessment Protocol (DERAP). In the Inland Bays basin of Delaware, 58 wetland sites were sampled by multiple observers with varying levels of experience (novice to expert) following a thorough training workshop. In the Nanticoke (Delaware/Maryland), Cuyahoga (Ohio), and John Day (Oregon) basins, 34 wetlands were sampled by two expert teams of observers with minimal protocol training. The variance in observer to observer scoring at each site was used to calculate pooled standard deviations (SD(pool)), coefficients of variation, and signal-to-noise ratios for each survey. The results showed that the experience level of the observer had little impact on the repeatability of the final rapid assessment score. Training, however, had a large impact on observer to observer repeatability. The SD(pool) in the Inland Bay survey with training (2.2 points out of a 0-30 score) was about half that observed in the other three basins where observers had minimal training (SD(pool) = 4.2 points). Using the results from the survey with training, we would expect that two sites assessed by different, trained observers who obtain DERAP scores differing by more than 4 points are highly likely to differ in ecological condition, and that sites with scores that differ by 2 or fewer points are within variability that can be attributed to observer differences.

AB  - This study investigates length-mass relationships for 17 families of freshwater macroinvertebrates collected in the Choghakhor Wetland (Central Iran). Body length, head width, distance between eyes and mass (dry weight and wet weight) were used to estimate biomass with linear, log-linear and exponential models. The results show better performance of the log-linear model (ANOVA,p = 0.03), as compared to the other two (ANOVA,p > 0.05). A cross-validation test demonstrated that all three models performed reasonably well, in terms of both statistics and the accuracy of prediction. However, for more than 60% of the relationships thepvalue for the log-linear model was greater than for the other two, suggesting that the accuracy of this model is in general superior. Body length was generally demonstrated to be a good indicator to estimate biomass. However, for some taxa, the measurement of sclerotized structures (i.e., the distance between the eyes and the head width) were also found to be suitable biomass indicators. The latter is beneficial for the estimation of biomass with individuals that have been kept for a long time under laboratory conditions and/or those that show damaged parts of their bodies. The present study provides the first set of length-mass relationships for macroinvertebrates in the Middle-East region, and its findings are expected to contribute to the estimation of biomass in aquatic environments that are affected by semi-arid conditions and different degrees of anthropogenic stress.

AB  - Small-scale fisheries are an important livelihood and primary protein source for coastal communities in many of the poorest regions in the world, yet many are overfished and thus require effective and scalable management solutions. Positive ecological and socioeconomic responses to management typically lag behind immediate costs borne by fishers from fishing pressure reductions necessary for fisheries recovery. These short-term costs challenge the long-term success of these interventions. However, social marketing may increase perceptions of management benefits before ecological and socioeconomic benefits are fully realized, driving new social norms and ultimately long-term sustainable behavior change. By conducting underwater visual surveys to quantify ecological conditions and by conducting household surveys with community members to quantify their perceptions of management support and socioeconomic conditions, we assessed the impact of a standardized small-scale fisheries management intervention that was implemented across 41 sites in Brazil, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The intervention combines TURF reserves (community-based territorial use rights for fishing coupled with no-take marine reserves) with locally tailored social-marketing behavior change campaigns. Leveraging data across 22 indicators and 4 survey types, along with data from 3 control sites, we found that ecological and socioeconomic impacts varied and that communities supported the intervention and were already changing their fishing practices. These results suggest that communities were developing new social norms and fishing more sustainably before long-term ecological and socioeconomic benefits of fisheries management materialized.

AB  - Large ripples with meter-scale wavelengths are ubiquitous across Mars. Curiosity's traverse of the Bagnold Dune Field revealed a morphologic diversity of large Martian ripples that helps constrain their formative mechanism. Large ripples develop in isolated fields and on dunes. They form transversely and obliquely to longitudinally to the net sand-flux direction in unimodally and bimodally distributed very fine to very coarse sand. They have either straight or sinuous crestlines. Inactive ripples are covered with dust, whereas migrating ripples are dust free. Here we present a unifying view of ripples that form in near-bed sediment-transport conditions (encompassing fluid-drag and coarse-grained ripples) to explain the range of large-Martian-ripple morphologies and expand the use of bedforms as environmental indicators.
   Plain Language Summary Large sand ripples with meter-scale crest-to-crest spacings abound on the Martian surface but are not found in terrestrial sandy deserts. Along its traverse through the Bagnold Dune Field, the Curiosity rover witnessed a rich diversity of such large ripples, both in terms of their shape and of their behavior. Rover observations help understand how these mysterious large Martian ripples form. Here we present a unifying view of ripples that form when grains are mobilized near the sediment bed by various fluids and across planets. Such an understanding of the formation mechanics of similar ripples will enable scientists to use the ripples' imprints on landscapes and in rocks to infer modern and past environmental conditions.

AB  - Fecal coliforms (FCs) are the main bacteriological indicators in the wastewater reuse. This study was conducted to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of Fe3O4@Cu nanocomposite for the FCs inactivation and to describe the inactivation mechanisms in real wastewater. Operational factors affecting the disinfectant process including pH, contact time, reagent dosage, wastewater quality, and synergic effect were studied. Results indicated iron has no synergic effect on antibacterial activity of copper but it can improve the toxicity of Cu. The inactivation of FCs until 40 min was corresponded to Cu+ and Fe+2 ions. Increasing of total suspended solids (7-20 mg/L) and organic matter (13-24 mg/L) cause decreasing of antibacterial activity of Fe3O4@Cu up to 0.384 log, therefore, the inactivation of FCs in raw wastewater (RW) was less than activated sludge effluent (ASE). Increasing of reagent dosage up to 15 mg/L increased the FCs inactivation to 0.053 and 2.13 log for RW and ASE, respectively. The FCs inactivation was raised in acidic condition compared with natural and alkali conditions and specific lethality (Delta(CW)) for Fe3O4@Cu nanocomposite was obtained 3.4 and 212 times more than those of Cu and Fe3O4. It can be concluded that the Fe3O4@Cu nanocomposite is effective antibacterial agent especially for ASE that can achieve WHO guideline and Iranian national standard limits.

AB  - ObjectiveTo review current knowledge surrounding the effects, treatment, and prognosis of hypothermia in people, dogs, and cats, as well as the application of therapeutic hypothermia in clinical medicine.
   EtiologyHypothermia may be a primary or secondary condition, and may be due to environmental exposure, illness, medications, anesthesia, or trauma. Hypothermia has been applied therapeutically in human medicine for a variety of conditions, including postcardiac arrest. In veterinary medicine, the technique has been applied in cardiac surgeries requiring bypass and in a patient with intractable seizures.
   DiagnosisHypothermia can be diagnosed based on presenting temperature or clinical signs, and appropriate diagnosis may require nontraditional thermometers.
   TherapyRewarming is the primary treatment for accidental hypothermia, with intensity ranging from passive surface rewarming to extracorporeal rewarming. The goal is to return the core temperature to a level that restores normal physiologic function of all body processes. Other supportive therapies such as intravenous fluids are typically indicated, and if cardiopulmonary arrest is present, prolonged resuscitation may be required. In cases of secondary hypothermia, reversal of the underlying cause is important.
   PrognosisThere are few prognostic indicators in human and veterinary patients with hypothermia. Even the most severely affected individuals, including those presenting in cardiopulmonary arrest, have potential for complete recovery with appropriate therapy. Therapeutic hypothermia has been shown to improve outcome in people following cardiac arrest. Further studies are needed to examine this application in veterinary medicine, as well as appropriate therapy and prognosis for cases of spontaneous hypothermia.

AB  - A passive sampler for determining the time-weighted average total ammonia (i.e. molecular ammonia and the ammonium cation) concentration (C (TWA)) in freshwaters, which incorporated a polymer inclusion membrane (PIM) as a semi-permeable barrier separating the aqueous source solution from the receiving solution (i.e. 0.8 mol L-1 HCl), was developed for the first time. The PIM was composed of dinonylnaphthalene sulfonic acid (DNNS) as a carrier, poly (vinyl chloride) (PVC) as a base polymer and 1-tetradecanol as a modifier. Its optimal composition was found to be 35 wt% commercial DNNS, 55 wt% PVC and 10 wt% 1-tetradecanol. The effect of environmental variables such as the water matrix, pH and temperature were also studied using synthetic freshwaters. The passive sampler was calibrated under laboratory conditions using synthetic freshwaters and exhibited a linear response within the concentration range 0.59-2.8 mg L-1 NH4 (+) (0.46-2.1 mg N L-1) at 20 A degrees C. The performance of the sampler was further investigated under field conditions over 7 days. A strong correlation between spot sampling and passive sampling was achieved, thus providing a proof-of-concept for the passive sampler for reliably measuring the C (TWA) of total ammonia in freshwaters, which can be used as an indicator in tracking sources of faecal contamination in stormwater drains.

AB  - Contribution of 16 grain parameters was examined in end-product quality of 60 Indian bread wheat cultivars equally representing three production conditions and five megazones of the country. Even though several grain properties were correlated with product quality, only 5-6 contributed significantly. High sedimentation volume and good grain appearance were essential in the domestic product like chapati but contribution of gluten content and test weight was negative. Low polyphenol oxidase activity and less bran content emerged as strong indicators of good chapati making. Positive contributors in bread quality of Indian wheats were gluten content, gluten index, GLU 1 score and test weight whereas good grain appearance was a hindrance. Since Indian wheats are generally hard textured, grain hardness index was not a limiting factor in defining quality standards of bread and chapati. Variability available in sedimentation volume could cater needs of chapati but it could not emerge as significant contributor in bread making as cultivars with high value are rare in India. Grain softness was the dominating trait in biscuit spread factor but this product did not require high gluten content and the physical grain superiority. Study illustrated that just three parameters i.e. high sedimentation volume, gluten index and GLU 1 score in bread; and low test weight, gluten content and grain hardness index in biscuit account for 71-72% variations in the baked products and can be used as selection criteria under Indian conditions.

AB  - We tested how ecosystem structure (macroinvertebrate community and primary producers) and functions (leaf decay and open-water metabolism) are related to water quality in the Portneuf River, southeast Idaho. This river is polluted with excess nutrients and fine sediment and simultaneously demonstrates a range of hydrologic conditions due to a variety of groundwater and spring inputs. Macroinvertebrate abundance, functional feeding group composition, and diversity responded most to hydrology due to affinity of the invasive New Zealand mudsnail for spring-influenced conditions. Macrophytes were most abundant at spring-influenced sites, while benthic periphyton standing crop was highest at sites with highest nutrient concentrations. Leaf decay rates increased by 50% at spring-influenced sites and showed no response to 3-100-fold differences in nutrient concentrations. Finally, primary production measured via open-water metabolism was highest at spring-influenced sites, which tended to have low turbidity. Community respiration, however, was greatest at the site with the highest nutrient concentrations. Therefore, open-water metabolism was a useful indicator of water quality in this nutrient-polluted river, while invertebrate community structure and leaf decay did not reflect large differences in water quality among sites. Our findings suggest that structure and function metrics provide complementary information on biotic responses to water pollution and that these metrics should be used in concert to more fully understand and monitor biotic responses to water pollution and hydrologic alterations in streams and rivers.

AB  - The relevance of laboratory tests on toxicants for field situations is often disputed given that laboratory tests are conducted under, next to the toxicant stress, optimal conditions which are not expected in held situations. In this paper we confront the results of laboratory tests on growth, reproduction and survival of earthworms, in a Polluted and a reference field soil with a field inventory of earthworms. The field inventory includes population density, biomass and demographic composition in life stages measured monthly over a period of one year. The field inventory showed that density and biomass was higher at the polluted field site, a result in conflict with the extrapolation of the laboratory tests that showed a decrease in Population growth rate by 23% at this site compared to the reference. The field inventory and laboratory derived results agreed in the demographic composition of the population with more individuals in the younger age class at the polluted site compared to the reference. Abiotic and biotic conditions that differ between sites and could possibly explain the lower earthworm biomass and density at the reference site are discussed. We suggest that predation by the two to five times higher densities of meadow birds in spring may have caused the lower density and biomass of earthworms at the reference site. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Senecio medley-woodii Hutchins., a succulent with crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) was used for the investigations reported. The same diurnal environmental conditions were maintained throughout the experiments, with the exception that irrigation was stopped at day one of the investigations. CO2 gas exchange and transpiration were monitored with a computer controlled gas exchange cuvette. With continued conditions of drought, the pattern of nocturnal CO2 fixation changed and the maximum value of CO2 fixation shifted from early to later in the night. A three-phase interrelationship between this shift of the peak Value of CO2 dark fixation and the changes in daily carbon gain and the transpirational water loss was observed. The hypothesis is advanced that the time between night fall and the occurrence of the maximum of nocturnal CO2 fixation is an indicator for the plant water status of Senecio medley-woodii. In phase I the CO2 fixation maximum occurs early in the night and coincides with a good water status of S. medley-woodii, whereas phase III with maximum values late in the night indicates severe drought stress. In phase II the shift from early to late takes place. In this phase the plant is subject to gradually increasing drought and the CAM-features are expressed most clearly (high CO2 dark fixation and stomatal closure during the light period). Data from other authors support the notion that the hypothesis might also be valid for other CAM-plants.

AB  - There are two methods of assaying for naturally occurring alpha-amylase inhibitors. In the first method, (E + I) + S, where E is the enzyme, I is the inhibitor, and S is the substrate, the enzyme and inhibitor are preincubated for a period of time and residual activity is measured by adding substrate (starch). In the second method, (I + S) + E, the inhibitor and substrate are combined and the reaction is started by addition of enzyme. Although the first method can be used to measure the concentration of alpha-amylase inhibitors in a given plant or plant structure, it may give a somewhat biased view of their in vivo activity. The second assay method may be a much more realistic way to assess the effectiveness of the inhibitors in a feeding insect, because at least in granivorous insects that feed on wheat endosperm, ingestion of starch and the proteinaceous inhibitors probably occurs simultaneously. Consequently, assays were conducted by the second assay procedure with amounts of alpha-amylase found in guts of the rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (L.), and with amounts of alpha-amylase inhibitors present in wheat endosperm. With these conditions, inhibition of enzyme activity was reduced significantly compared with the nearly complete inhibition possible with preincubation. These findings indicate that in vitro methodology should simulate in vivo conditions as closely as possible to allow a more precise evaluation of the potential of naturally occurring inhibitors as resistance factors against insects.

AB  - Microalgae-based wastewater treatment (and biomass production) is an environmentally benign and energetically efficient technique as compared to traditional practices. The present study is focused on optimization of the major treatment variables such as temperature, light-dark cycle (LD), and nitrogen (N)-to-phosphate (P) ratio (N/ P) for the elimination of N and P from tertiary municipal wastewater utilizing Chlorella kessleri microalgae species. In this regard, a hybrid support vector regression (SVR) technique integrated with the crow search algorithm has been applied as a novel modeling/optimization tool. The SVR models were formulated using the experimental data, which were furnished according to the response surface methodology with Box-Behnken Design. Various statistical indicators, including mean absolute percentage error, Taylor diagram, and fractional bias, confirmed the superior performance of SVR models as compared to the response surface methodology (RSM) and generalized linear model (GLM). Finally, the best SVR model was hybridized with the crow search algorithm for single/multi-objective optimizations to acquire the global optimal treatment conditions for maximum N and P removal efficiencies. The best-operating conditions were found to be 29.3 degrees C, 24/0 h/h of LD, and 6:1 of N/P, with N and P elimination efficiencies of 99.97 and 93.48%, respectively. The optimized values were further confirmed by new experimental data.

AB  - Climate change has been predicted to influence the marine phytoplankton community and its carbon acquisition strategy. Extracellular carbonic anhydrase (eCA) is a zinc metalloenzyme that catalyses the relatively slow interconversion between HCO3- and CO2. Early results indicated that sub-nanomolar levels of eCA at the sea surface were sufficient to enhance the oceanic uptake rate of CO2 on a global scale by 15%, an addition of 0.37 Pg C year(-1). Despite its central role in the marine carbon cycle, only in recent years have new analytical techniques allowed the first quantifications of eCA and its activity in the oceans. This opens up new research areas in the field of marine biogeochemistry and climate change. Light and suitable pH conditions, as well as growth stage, are crucial factors in eCA expression. Previous studies showed that phytoplankton eCA activity and concentrations are affected by environmental stressors such as ocean acidification and UV radiation as well as changing light conditions. For this reason, eCA is suggested as a biochemical indicator in biomonitoring programmes and could be used for future response prediction studies in changing oceans. This review aims to identify the current knowledge and gaps where new research efforts should be focused to better determine the potential feedback of phytoplankton via eCA in the marine carbon cycle in changing oceans.

AB  - Soil-test biological activity is a key indicator for soil health assessment. Methodological details may affect accuracy and precision of this indicator. Accuracy and precision of soil-test biological activity estimates were determined for 10 replications of 10 mass and volume treatments under standard laboratory conditions using an alkali trap technique with acid titration. Five soils varying in texture and organic C and N concentrations were used to assess a gradient of soil mass and volume conditions on C mineralization following rewetting of dried soil during 0-3, 3-10, and 10-24 d of incubation at 50% water-filled pore space and 25 degrees C. Soil type explained >= 90% of variation in C mineralization, but soil mass and volume treatments also had significant effects on estimates (p < .001). In sets of treatments with the same surface area exposed, increasing soil volume led to lower C mineralization across soil types. Entrapment of CO2 in soil pores may have been the main reason for lower C mineralization, since the effect diminished over time. Treatments with 50 to 100 g of soil were nearest the median estimates of C mineralization for each soil. Precision of C mineralization estimates was greatest when soil mass was <greater than or equal to>50 g of soil. A consistent surface area-to-volume of similar to 0.2 cm(-1) is suggested with sufficient soil mass to account for potentially enhanced random variation of C-enriched surface soils.

AB  - Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) can be used to characterize a woodland site by measuring structural attributes of the vegetation community. In Australia, government funded programs monitor vegetation structure using manual field surveys to assess change and ecological condition. In this study, we examined whether structural attributes commonly assessed in woodland ecology surveys can be extracted from a single TLS scan. Attributes of the ground, shrub and overstory vegetation layers were evaluated at nine open woodland sites in central Western Queensland. We used 0.1 m voxels to aggregate returns. Our results show that, compared with field assessment by highly experienced ecologists, TLS can rapidly characterize structural attributes for tree canopy cover, maximum tree height, average tree height (R-2 > 0.9) and average diameter at breast height (R-2 = 0.77). However, we could not accurately determine shrub height, shrub canopy cover, shrub average height, ground cover (grass, litter and coarse woody debris) or the number of trees per hectare (R-2 < 0.45). By analysing local minima in the histogram of the maximum height, we determined height thresholds for canopy strata, and applied these to determine the canopy layer with the most biomass - the ecologically dominant layer (EDL). While these results are promising for overstory assessment and defining canopy strata heights using TLS, they suggest that future research should focus on investigating improved classification methods to separate laser returns into shrub and tree objects for structural assessment at the plot scale.

AB  - Diverse, abundant and usually well-preserved communities of skeletal organisms occur in the lower Pleistocene (Gelasian) siliciclastic deposits of the Greek island of Rhodes. Benthic foraminifers, molluscs and bryozoans have been studied in four measured and sampled sections located in the northern part of the island. Among these bottom-dwelling organisms, numerous extant taxa are good environmental indicators and, combined with field observations and sedimentological data, they provide information on the probable conditions in which they developed. The siliciclastic deposits of the Kritika Formation have been divided into 14 different bio- and lithofacies, which have been further grouped into four facies associations corresponding to four different environmental settings: (1) continental to fluviatile; (2) brackish-water (lagoonal/deltaic); (3) infralittoral (0-20 m); and (4) upper circalittoral (depths of 20-40 m, but also down to c. 50-60 m). Among the marine facies associations, several characteristic biocoenoses have been recognized: soft-bottoms (fine to coarse sands and gravels); seagrass meadows; biogenic calcareous crusts on drowned beachrock slabs; red algal rhodoliths; and bivalve shell beds. In the studied sections, 13 superimposed genetic sequences have been documented. The repetition of similar facies associations within each sequence suggests: (1) a possibly eustasy-controlled, cyclic sedimentation; (2) a general subsidence of Rhodes during the deposition of the studied facies associations; and (3) a mostly constant range of environmental conditions (i.e. sedimentation rates and temperature) throughout the Gelasian.

AB  - Outdoor shading affects the thermal environment and human thermal comfort, thereby influencing the usage of space. The objective of this study is to establish a relationship between the thermal environment and number of people visiting an outdoor space, and to explore the utilization of outdoor space during different seasons with various shading levels. This study includes onsite investigations of the microclimate parameters of the thermal environment and attendance at a park in central Taiwan. The results in cool seasons showed a positive correlation among the air temperature, mean radiant temperature (Tmrt), and physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) of shaded areas and the number of visitors. In hot seasons, the Tmrt and PET, which also reflect solar radiation conditions, are negatively correlated with the number of visitors. In other words, the higher Tmrt/PET values indicate that fewer people visit the park during the summer. Meanwhile, a significant correlation exists between park utilization and solar radiation conditions. This study proposes the use of area-averaged sky view factor (SVFa), instead of the traditional single-point sky view factor from fisheye photographs (SVFsp), as the indicator for measuring the shading level at various areas in parks. Analytical results indicate that the lower the SVFa, the higher the park utilization. This study highlights the importance of shade design in parks located in tropical or subtropical climates. The results can serve as a reference for park design in the future. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Numerous studies have described the F-actin cytoskeleton; however, little information relevant to G-actin is available. The actin pools of bovine aortic endothelial cells were examined using in situ and in vitro conditions and fluorescent probes for G-(deoxyribonuclease 1, 0.3 muM) or F-actin (phalloidin, 0.2 muM). Cells in situ displayed a diffuse G-actin distribution, while F-actin was concentrated in the cell periphery and in fine stress fibers that traversed some cells. Cells of subconfluent or just confluent cultures demonstrated intense fluorescence, with many F-actin stress fibers. Postconfluent cultures resembled the condition in situ; peripheral F-actin was prominent, traversing actin stress fibers were greatly reduced and fluorescent intensity was diminished. Postconfluency had little influence on G-actin, with only an enhancement in the intensity of G-actin punctate fluorescence. When postconfluent cultures were incubated with cytochalasin D (15 min; 10(-4) M), F-actin networks were disrupted and actin punctate and diffuse fluorescence increased. G-actin fluorescence was not altered by the incubation. Although its unstructured nature may account for the minor changes observed, the stability of the G-actin pool in the presence of notable F-actin modulations suggested that filamentous actin was the key constituent involved in these actin cytoskeletal alterations. A separate finding illustrated that the concomitant use of actin probes with image enhancement and fluorescent microscopy could reveal simultaneously the G- and F-actin pools within the same cell.

KW  - VIRULENCE
AB  - For 7 cultures of basidiomycetous wood-decay fungi the decline of the following vitality marks were recorded over a 6-year period: (i) Consumption of sterilized beech wood substrate within a time unit as an indicator of the overall vigorousness of the fungus, (ii) decline of the competitive saprophytic ability (kratovirulence), which enables the fungus to colonize natural nonsterile substrates, (iii) capacity for sexual reproduction, (iv) several morphological features of the fungal colony. The reference strains kept growing at +1 ... 2-degrees-C on fertilized wood dust substrate retained in 5 of 7 cases all of their juvenility marks, although the wood-decay capacity gradually dropped back to 65 to 34% that of the initial value. The substrains maintained on liquid still cultures at 23-degrees-C lost their vitality marks after a period of continuous decline rather abruptly. With the loss of kratovirulence and fruiting capacity the strains were no longer viable under field conditions, and with the drop of the sterile wood-decay capacity to less than 3% by dry weight the formation of aerial mycelium and melanin pigments virtually ceased. In several fungal species the colonies segregated into coexisting sectors of extreme senescence and comparative juvenility, and a spread of senescence to the juvenile sectors did not occur. It is concluded that stock cultures of wood-decay fungi are subject to progressive senescence even under optimum conditions of strain preservation. Their current vitality should be examined in a sterile wood decay test before they are used in biotechnology or research.

AB  - The Czech Republic is gradually shifting toward a low-carbon economy. The transition process requires measures that will help to contain energy production and help to reduce emissions from the coal industry. Viable measures are seen in carbon capture technologies (CCTs). The main focus is on the environmental and economic comparison of two innovative CCTs that are integrated in the operational Czech energy units. The assessed scenarios are (1) the scenario of pre-combustion CO(2)capture integrated into the gasification combined cycle (IGCC-CaL) and (2) the scenario of post-combustion capture by adsorption of CO(2)by activated carbon (PCC-A). An environmental assessment is performed through a life-cycle assessment method and compares the systems in the phase of characterization, normalization, and relative contribution of the processes to the environmental categories. Economic assessment compares CCT via capture and avoided costs of CO(2)and their correlation with CO(2)allowance market trend. The paper concludes with the selection of the most suitable CCT in the conditions of the Czech Republic by combining the scores of environmental and economic parameters. While the specific case of IGCC-CaL shows improvement in the environmental assessment, the economic analysis resulted in favor of PCC-A. The lower environmental-economic combination score results in the selection of IGCC-CaL as the more viable option in comparison with PCC-A in the current Czech energy and economic conditions.

AB  - Permafrost is an important indicator of climate change that affects, e.g., ecosystems, hydrology, and infrastructure in cold regions. Interactions between the surface and atmosphere in permafrost regions are complex and vary seasonally due to the contrasting energy and moisture conditions of frozen versus unfrozen ground. Differences in surface-atmosphere connections have been documented between permafrost types, with significantly increased moisture feedbacks in areas of continuous Eurasian permafrost, but no such relationship in other regions. This study elucidates the processes responsible for these observed land-atmosphere feedbacks in Eurasian permafrost regions. The Weather Research and Forecasting model is used to determine the varying effects of discontinuous versus continuous permafrost on different weather scenarios. For two 72-hour periods, surface fluxes, boundary layer characteristics, and corresponding meso-to-synoptic scale meteorological features varied when comparing the two experiments: one with a saturated active layer representing continuous permafrost, and another witht1 a drier surface layer representing discontinuous permafrost. Depending on the weather regime, an increase in boundary layer moisture in response to increased latent heat fluxes over continuous permafrost increases precipitation and low-level cloudiness. The effects of changing soil conditions are evident as far aloft as 500 hPa, as a mid-level low over continuous permafrost is stronger and moves southward. Incipient moisture associated with continuous permafrost allows for different land-atmosphere interactions than over discontinuous permafrost. Continued permafrost degradation as a result of climate change may lead to increased dryness in the region, altering the surface energy balance and associated weather and climate feedbacks.

AB  - Wildlife management, conservation interventions and wildlife research programs often involve capture, manipulation and transport of wild animals. Widespread empirical evidence across various vertebrate taxa shows that handling wildlife generally induces a severe stress response resulting in increased stress levels. The inability of individuals to appropriately respond to rapidly changing environmental conditions during and after manipulations may have deleterious and long-lasting implications on animal welfare. Therefore, mitigating stress responses in the frame of conservation interventions is a key animal welfare factor. However, we have a poor understanding of the metrics to adequately assess and monitor the dynamic physiological changes that animals undergo when subjected to stressful procedures in wild or captive conditions. A growing number of studies provide good evidence for reciprocal interactions between immune processes and stress. Here, we review the existing literature on a relatively new technique-Leukocyte Coping Capacity (LCC), a proxy for stress quantifying oxygen radical production by leukocytes. We discuss the strength and weaknesses of this immunological approach to evaluate stress, the individual capacity to cope with stress and the resulting potential implications for animal welfare. Additionally we present new data on LCC in captive roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) under long-time anesthesia and free-ranging Asiatic wild asses (Kulan; Equus hemionus kulan) were LCC was used to assess stress levels in animals captured for a reintroduction project.

AB  - Two distinct nutritional syndromes have been described in temperate green orchids. Most orchids form mycorrhizas with rhizoctonia fungi and are considered autotrophic. Some orchids, however, associate with fungi that simultaneously form ectomycorrhizas with surrounding trees and derive their carbon from these fungi. This evolutionarily derived condition has been called mixotrophy or partial mycoheterotrophy and is characterized by C-13 enrichment and high N content. Although it has been suggested that the two major nutritional syndromes are clearly distinct and tightly linked to the composition of mycorrhizal communities, recent studies have challenged this assumption. Here, we investigated whether mycorrhizal communities and nutritional syndromes differed between seven green orchid species that co-occur under similar ecological conditions (coastal dune slacks). Our results showed that mycorrhizal communities differed significantly between orchid species. Rhizoctonia fungi dominated in Dactylorhiza sp., Herminium monorchis, and Epipactis palustris, which were autotrophic based on C-13 and N content. Conversely, Liparis loeselii and Epipactis neerlandica associated primarily with ectomycorrhizal fungi but surprisingly, C-13 and N content supported mixotrophy only in E. neerlandica. This, together with the finding of some ectomycorrhizal fungi in rhizoctonia-associated orchids, suggests that there exists an ecological continuum between the two syndromes. The presence of a large number of indicator species associating with individual orchid species further confirms previous findings that mycorrhizal fungi may be important factors driving niche-partitioning in terrestrial orchids and therefore contribute to orchid coexistence.

AB  - Winter oilseed rape is characterized by a low N use efficiency related to a weak leaf N remobilization efficiency (NRE) at vegetative stages. By investigating the natural genotypic variability of leaf NRE, our goal was to characterize the relevant physiological traits and the main protease classes associated with an efficient proteolysis and high leaf NRE in response to ample or restricted nitrate supply. The degradation rate of soluble proteins and D1 protein (a thylakoid-bound protein) were correlated to N remobilization, except for the genotype Samourai which showed a low NRE despite high levels of proteolysis. Under restricted nitrate conditions, high levels of soluble protein degradation were associated with serine, cysteine and aspartic proteases at acidic pH. Low leaf NRE was related to a weak proteolysis of both soluble and thylakoid-bound proteins. The results obtained on the genotype Samourai suggest that the timing between the onset of proteolysis and abscission could be a determinant. The specific involvement of acidic proteases suggests that autophagy and/or senescence-associated vacuoles are implicated in N remobilization under low N conditions. The data revealed that the rate of D1 degradation could be a relevant indicator of leaf NRE and might be used as a tool for plant breeding.

AB  - This research is focused on alcohol polyethoxylates (AEOs), nonionic surfactants used in a wide variety of products such as household cleaners and detergents. Our main objective in this work was to study the anaerobic degradation of these compounds and their main aerobic degradation products and precursors (polyethylene glycols, PEGs, which are also used for many other applications) in marine sediments, providing the first data available on this topic. First, we observed that average AEO sediment-water partition coefficients (K-d) increased towards those homologs having longer alkyl chains (from 257 L/kg for C-12 to 5772 L/kg for C-18), which were less susceptible to undergo biodegradation. Overall, AEO and PEG removal percentages reached up to 99.7 and 93%, respectively, after 169 days of incubation using anaerobic conditions in sediments ([O-2] = 0 ppm, E-h = -170 to -380 mV and T = 30 degrees C). Average half-life was estimated to be in a range from 10 to 15 days for AEO homologs (C(12)AEO(8)-C(18)AEO(8)), and 18 days for PEGEO(8). Methanogenic activity proved to be intense during the experiment, confirming the occurrence of anaerobic conditions. This is the first study showing that AEOs and PEGs can be degraded in absence of oxygen in marine sediments, so this new information should be taken into account for future environmental risk assessments on these chemicals.

AB  - Enhancing microbial reduction of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) to N-2 could be a promising strategy to mitigate emissions from soils, but N2O reduction rates are currently neither well understood nor quantified. It has been suggested that the importance of N2O reduction to N-2 could be estimated from relationships between O-18 and N-15 when N2O production and reduction occur simultaneously. We assessed the robustness of such relationships by using simple simulation models and experimental data for various scenarios, including open versus closed system isotope dynamics and collection of N2O fluxes over time with and without refreshing the headspace between sampling. We found that relationships between O-18 and N-15 vary dramatically with experimental conditions (such as headspace gas concentration and sampling scheme) and open versus closed system isotope dynamics, irrespective of N2O reduction rate. Therefore, we conclude that the simple relationships between O-18 and N-15 currently used are not robust indicators of N2O reduction to N-2 and strongly discourage graphical interpretations of O-18 and N-15 to determine N2O reduction. We recommend the development of more advanced process-based isotope models that take into account open versus closed system isotope dynamics, experimental conditions, isotope values of precursors and other biogeochemical controls on N-15 and O-18 of N2O to estimate N2O reduction rates more reliably from natural abundance isotope values of N2O.

AB  - Although aerobiological data are often used in phenological research as an indicator of flowering, airborne pollen concentrations are influenced by a number of factors that could affect pollen curves. This paper reports on a study of various aspects of reproductive biology in Q. ilex subsp. ballota, together with environmental factors influencing pollen release and transport, with a view of achieving reliable interpretation of Quercus pollen curves in Ourense (NW Spain). Aerobiological data were recorded from 2002 to 2004 at two sites in the province of Ourense. From 1st February to the end of the flowering period, phenological observations were carried out on 19 trees from the Q. ilex subsp. ballota population found in the Ourense area. Pollen production was calculated for the same trees. The chilling and heating requirements for triggering development were also calculated. The mean flowering period lasted 11-15 days. Reduced pollen output per catkin and, especially, a reduced number of catkins per tree in 2003 and 2004, prompted a marked decline in overall pollen production. Major differences observed in Q. ilex subsp. ballota pollen curves were attributed to the considerable influence both of weather conditions during pollination and pollen production. In years with high pollen production and weather conditions favouring pollen release, Q. ilex subsp. ballota contributed almost 10% to the total Quercus pollen curve. Around 20% of the pollen trapped was captured before or after flowering periods.

AB  - Mycosphaerella graminicola (anamorph, Septoria tritici), the causal agent of Septoria tritici blotch on wheat, can cause a significant yield loss for most commercially grown wheat cultivars and in many wheat-growing areas. Environmental factors which affect infection and disease development such as light intensity, temperature, and moisture have been studied extensively. Yet, reports on specific effects of temperature and leaf wetness period on the infection process are limited. The objectives of this study were to quantify the effect of temperature and duration of leaf wetness and their interaction during the infection process on major disease components, to study the dynamic characteristics of these disease components, and to derive a mathematical expression for each disease component, as a function of infection temperature and leaf wetness period. Results showed that temperature is a critical determinant of wheat infection by M. graminicola and that the optimum temperature for the infection process does not depend on leaf wetness period. Furthermore, the initial conditions of temperature and leaf wetness period following inoculation not only affect the rate of disease development but also the asymptotic level of disease severity that ultimately may be achieved. Except for lesion length, the maximum rate of increase in all disease components responds linearly to changes in leaf wetness period, and quadratically to changes in temperature. The rate of lesion length expansion is mainly influenced by postinfection conditions. Of the four components of Septoria tritici blotch of wheat studied, lesion unit (number of average-sized lesions) per square centimeter is the most sensitive indicator of a successful infection.

AB  - The occurrence of environmental disasters affects different social segments, impacting health, education, housing, economy, and the provision of basic services. Thus, the objective of this study was to estimate the relationship between the occurrence of disasters and extreme climate, sociosanitary, and demographic conditions in the Northeast region of Brazil (NEB) during the period from 1993 to 2013. Initially, we analyzed the spatial pattern of the incidence of events; subsequently, generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape were used to identify and estimate the magnitude of associations between factors. Results showed that droughts are the predominant disasters in NEB representing 81.1% of the cases, followed by events triggered by excessive rainfall such as flash floods (11.1%) and floods (7.8%). Climate conditions presented statistically significant associations with the analyzed disasters, in which indicators of excess rainfall positively contributed to the occurrence of flash floods and floods but negatively contributed to the occurrence of drought. Sociosanitary factors, such as percentage of households with inadequate sewage, waste collection, and water supply, were also positively associated with the model's estimations, that is, contributing to an increase in the occurrence of events, with the exception of floods, which were not significantly influenced by sociosanitary parameters. A decrease of 19% in the risk of drought occurrence was estimated, on average. On the other hand, events caused by excessive rainfall increased by 40% and 57%, in the cases of flash floods and floods, respectively.

AB  - Owing to their widespread use, pharmaceuticals have become important pollutants of the aquatic environment. Pharmaceuticals and parasites can affect the immunity, physiology and behaviour of target organisms, both singly and through interaction. In this study, we related pharmaceutical concentration, parasite infection and condition in brown trout (Salmo trutta m. fario) collected at localities upstream and downstream of a sewage treatment plant (STP). The sites were separated by a weir preventing fish migration. Pharmaceutical number and concentrations differed significantly between sites. Antibiotics and antidepressants were found at the highest concentrations at both localities. Though fish condition and overall parasite abundance did not differ between sites, there was a significant difference in parasite community composition. A higher abundance of monogenean ectoparasites, along with a lower abundance of endoparasites, was observed at the downstream locality. The adverse effect of pharmaceutical load on ecto- and endoparasitic species on brown trout was further confirmed at the individual level using multivariate analysis. Both the number and concentration of pharmaceuticals in fish tissues reflected their high incidence in the environment, confirming the ability of trout to bioaccumulate pharmaceuticals. This could have important consequences on fish health, particularly in small streams where STP effluent represents a high proportion of stream flow.

AB  - This study investigates the potential of PCM and natural ventilation to strengthen the thermal comfort inside the lightweight relocatable building located in Kazakhstan during the summer period. The quantification of the impact of the PCM on the thermal comfort was accomplished using the concepts of maximum operative temperature reduction and discomfort index. A novel indicator of Total Discomfort Change (TDC) was introduced to select the optimum PCM. Thereafter, the behaviour of the optimised PCM was comprehensively evaluated through activation of PCM and PCM storage efficiency. In all cities, PCM 26 + NV showed the best performance achieving the TDC values of up to 1818 and its storage efficiency values were up to 39.1%. Then, the analysis of the effect of real PCMs on the thermal comfort conditions was provided. The investigation revealed that RT 26 + NV was the most efficient in all cities achieving the TDC values of up to 1977. Thereafter, the impact of climate change under RCP 8.5 emission scenario (2095) was assessed and RT 28 + NV and RT 26 + NV were found to be optimum combinations. Overall, the optimum configuration of PCM with natural ventilation can be used for improving the thermal comfort conditions during the summertime in all cities of Kazakhstan. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Decisions on how to mitigate food safety risks associated with pre-harvest water use currently rely on genericEscherichia coli-based water quality tests, although multiple studies have suggested thatE. colilevels are not a suitable indicator of the food safety risks under all relevant environmental conditions. Hence, improved understanding of spatiotemporal variability in surface water microbiota composition is needed to facilitate identification of alternative or supplementary indicators that co-occur with pathogens. To this end, we aimed to characterize the composition of bacterial and fungal communities in the sediment and water fractions of 68 agricultural water samples collected from six New York streams. We investigated potential associations between the composition of microbial communities, environmental factors andSalmonellaand/orListeria monocytogenesisolation. We found significantly different composition of fungal and bacterial communities among sampled streams and among water fractions of collected samples. This indicates that geography and the amount of sediment in a collected water sample may affect its microbial composition, which was further supported by identified associations between the flow rate, turbidity, pH and conductivity, and microbial community composition. Lastly, we identified specific microbial families that were weakly associated with the presence ofSalmonellaorListeria monocytogenes, however, further studies on samples from additional streams are needed to assess whether identified families may be used as indicators of pathogen presence.

AB  - Regional severe haze caused by atmospheric particle explosion is one of the biggest environmental problems in China that has yet to be fully understood. This research managed to find the linkage between diversified shapes of heavy industrial stack plume (HISP) and local ground particle concentration. We used two optical methods: LIDAR and auto-shoot camera, to catch the HISP's vertical shape, and two machine leaning models: binary classification and decision tree, to find the quantitative relationship between the HISP's shape and PM2.5 concentration. The PM2.5 concentration correlated to the polygon length (PL) of HISP's shape with a logistic function. With a plume length more than twice the height of stack, the spread of HISP's shape accompanied with PM2.5 concentration decreasing to <100 mu gm(-3). The residence time of HISP's particles was longer (>20 h) under uniform offshore dispersion than that in heterogeneous wind field, when the footprint of HISP was estimated to be > 7 km. We acquired a decision tree model to yield an exact prediction of PM2.5 concentration, in which the HISP's length played a statistically significant role. Though the plume shape is just one of the easy-to-use indicators of complex meteorological condition, it is still practical for policy makers to identify the particle pollution caused by the elevated sources in the fastest way.

AB  - The connected environment provides driving aids to help drivers making efficient and safe driving decisions. The literature to date is devoid of conclusive evidences of the connected environment's impact on drivers' mandatory lane-changing (MLC) behaviour. As such, the objective of this study is to examine MLC behaviour through a driving simulator experiment using the CARRS-Q Advanced Driving Simulator. Participants with diverse background performed the experiment in randomised driving conditions: baseline (without the driving aids), connected environment with perfect communication, and connected environment with communication delay. Repeated measure ANOVA in the form of linear mixed model and Generalized Estimation Equation (GEE) are employed to analyse various driving performance indicators during MLC event. We find that drivers in the connected environment tend to wait longer, increase the initial speed, and maintain a larger spacing, compared to when they are driving in the baseline condition. In addition, drivers in the connected environment are likely to reject fewer number of gaps and select relatively bigger gap sizes. Furthermore, post-encroachment time (PET) in the connected environment is higher across different gap sizes, indicating that the connected environment makes MLC safer. The GEE model on gap acceptance suggests that the perfect communication and communication delay has positive and negative impact on the accepted gap size, respectively, and the GEE model on lane-change duration indicates that lane-change duration tends to increase in the connected environment.

AB  - The current conditions for the functioning of the Russian insurance market at a macroeconomic level cause the emergence of a complex of problems, taking into account the economic sanctions of Western countries, and the microeconomic conditions. As a consequence, the number of insurance entities is decreasing, the number of unprofitable insurers is growing, the licenses are being massively withdrawn, the financial stability of participants in the insurance market as a whole is being reduced. Reduction of financial stability occurs on a number of parameters, including the volume of transferred reinsurance, there is an increase in the amount of self-deduction by insurers. It is necessary to revise the very ideology of insurance, the value of insurance for a client, and the revision of approaches to the concept of insurance supervision. Not only the solution of market problems, but also its planned development should be seen at the heart of the goal setting in insurance supervision. Last years the vector of state regulation of insurance business in Russia is aimed at toughening of supervision and control over insurance companies. Obviously, the main goal of supervision is to ensure effective control over the subjects of insurance business in order to protect the rights of consumers, that is, policyholders. However, the task of achieving this goal should be the development of the market itself Moreover, the development of the insurance market should be determined primarily by qualitative indicators.

AB  - Studies of mate choice typically assume that individuals prefer high quality mates and select them based on condition-dependent indicator traits. In species with biparental care, mutual mate choice is expected to result in assortative mating for quality. When assortment is not perfect, the lower quality pair members are expected to compensate by increased parental investment to secure their partner (positive differential allocation). This framework has been assumed to hold for monogamous species like the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), but progress has been hampered by the difficulty to define individual quality. By combining multiple measures of causes (inbreeding, early nutrition) and consequences (ornaments, displays, fitness components) of variation in quality into a single principal component, we here show that quality variation can be quantified successfully. We further show that variation in quality indeed predicts individual pairing success, presumably because it reflects an individual's vigor or ability to invest in reproduction. However, despite high statistical power, we found no evidence for either assortative mating or for positive differential allocation. We suggest that zebra finch ornaments and displays are not sufficiently reliable for the benefits of choosiness to exceed the costs of competition for the putative best partner. To assess the generality of these findings unbiased quantification of signal honesty and preference strength is required, rather than selective reporting of significant results.

AB  - We compared three gravel-bed rivers in north-eastern Italy (Brenta, Piave, Tagliamento) having similar bioclimate, geology and fluvial morphology, but affected by different intensities of anthropogenic disturbance related particularly to hydropower dams, training works and instream gravel mining. Our aim was to test whether a corresponding difference in the interactions between vegetation and geomorphological patterns existed among the three rivers. In equally spaced and sized plots (n = 710) we collected descriptors of geomorphic conditions, and presence-absence of woody species. In the less disturbed river (Tagliamento), spatial succession of woody communities from the floodplain to the channel followed a profile where higher elevation floodplains featured more developed tree communities, and lower elevation islands and bars were covered by pioneer communities. In the intermediate-disturbed river (Piave), islands and floodplains lay at similar elevation and both showed species indicators of mature developed communities. In the most disturbed river (Brenta), all these patterns were simplified, all geomorphic units lay at similar elevations, were not well characterized by species composition, and presented similar persistence age. This indicates that in human-disturbed rivers, channel and vegetation adjustments are closely linked in the long term, and suggests that intermediate levels of anthropogenic disturbance, such as those encountered in the Piave River, could counteract the natural, more dynamic conditions that may periodically fragment vegetated landscapes in natural rivers.

AB  - Alpine plants experience high levels of insolation, as well as cold nighttime temperatures throughout the summer growth period. These two stress factors in combination are now recognized as potentially important limitations to photosynthetic carbon gain. Although likely candidates, the possible occurrence of photoinhibition in alpine plants has been reported infrequently. We measured photoinhibitory stress under natural field conditions and after high-light treatments in an herbaceous species (Caltha leptosepala DC) with structural traits that appeared especially susceptible to photoinhibition, i.e., large, broad, laminar leaves with a near-horizontal leaf orientation. Although photosynthesis declined gradually during the afternoon under natural field conditions, no evidence was found for photoinhibition of photosynthesis, despite incident sunlight levels of > 2500 A mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Also, values of (an indicator of dynamic photoinhibition) changed little (< 10 %) from early morning to late afternoon values. Moreover, an experimental test of photoinhibition was conducted in the field using artificially applied low (250 A mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) followed by unnaturally high (3500 A mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) light levels, led to only small reductions in (20 % maximum). Also, afternoon declines in photosynthesis and other gas exchange parameters were associated with significant decreases in xylem water potentials. Thus, accumulating daily water stress appeared to be a possible, greater physiological limitation than photoinhibition, even in this common, hypothetically susceptible alpine species.

AB  - The germination and early survival of tree seedlings is a critical process for the understanding of treeline dynamics with ongoing climate change. Here we analyzed the performance of 0-4 year-old seedlings of seven tree species at three sites above and below the current altitudinal treeline in the Swiss Central Alps near Davos. Starting from sown seeds, we monitored the seedling performance as proportions of living seedlings, seedling shoot height growth, and biomass allocation over 4 years to examine changes along an elevational gradient. We evaluated the relative importance of the environmental factors soil temperature, light conditions, water use efficiency, and nitrogen availability on seedling performance. During the 4 years, the proportions of living seedlings differed only slightly along the elevational gradient even in species currently occurring at lower elevations. Microsite-specific soil temperature and light availability had only little effect on the proportion of living seedlings and seedling biomass across the elevational gradient. Conversely, seedling biomass and biomass allocation correlated well with the foliar stable nitrogen isotope abundance (delta N-15) that was used as an indicator for nitrogen availability. Collectively, our results suggested that the early establishment of seedlings of a variety of tree species in the treeline ecotone was not limited by current climatic conditions even beyond the species' actual upper distribution limit. Nitrogen dynamics appeared to be an important environmental co-driver for biomass production and allocation in very young tree seedlings.

AB  - A common problem encountered in studies of gouge-bearing natural faults is the difficulty of ascertaining whether the observed gouge was sheared seismically or aseismically; this problem arises because of the scarcity of indicators of fault slip rates for gouge. Recently, clay-clast aggregates (CCAs; a CCA comprises a clastic core mantled by a rim of ultrafine particles) were proposed as a possible indicator of seismic slip in gouge, on the basis of shear experiments on gouge at seismic slip rates. To examine the processes and conditions of CCA formation, we conducted rotary shear experiments on quartz and quartz-bentonite gouges under normal stresses (0.3-3.0 MPa) and slip rates (0.0005-1.3 m s(-1)), and in both room-humidity (room-dry) and water-saturated (wet) conditions. We found that CCAs could be produced in room-dry gouges even at the lowest slip rates, which are considerably slower than actual seismic slip rates. This finding demonstrates that thermal pressurization and fluidization at elevated temperature during seismic slip are not necessarily needed for the formation of CCAs, contrary to previous views. Given the occurrence of CCAs over a wide range of slip rates, we suggest that the presence of CCAs is not an unequivocal indicator of fault slip at seismic slip rates. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) is a chronic pain condition with unclear underlying etiology. Our objectives were to determine whether psychological distress was higher in twins with urological symptoms commonly found in IC/PBS than in twins without, and if so, did familial influences contribute to this association.
   Method: Data from 1165 female twins in a community-based sample were used. Urological symptoms, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety and perceived stress were assessed with standardized questionnaires. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) regression models were used to examine the relationship between psychological distress and urological symptoms.
   Results: Compared to unaffected twins, twins with urological symptoms were more likely to report PTSD symptoms (OR=3.9; 95% CI=2.6-5.8), depression (OR=3.1; 95% CI=2.0-5.0), anxiety (OR=3.4; 95% CI=2.3-5.2) and perceived stress (OR=3.2; 95% CI=2.1-4.9). After adjusting for familial influences, the within-pair effects remained significant for PTSD symptoms (OR=2.2; 95% CI=1.2-3.8) and perceived stress (OR=2.2; 95% CI=1.2-3.8).
   Conclusion: Familial influences partially explained the relationship between indicators of psychological distress and urological symptoms. Future research should examine shared environmental and genetic mechanisms that may further explain this relationship and improve diagnosis and treatment of this unexplained clinical condition.

AB  - Epidemiological surveys are important because clinical samples are subject of several selection biases. Sociodemographic factors and clinical aspects of the morbid condition itself influence help seeking behaviors. Due to the egodystonic nature of obsessive-compulsive disorder, sufferers tend to hide their symptoms and avoid or delay treatment seeking. However most of our current knowledge about obsessive-compulsive disorder is based on clinical samples, which do not represent the totality of cases. A conventional Medline, PsychoInfo and Lilacs review of epidemiological studies on obsessive-compulsive disorder from 1980 to 2004 was conducted, using the following keywords: "epidemiology", "obsessive-compulsive disorder", "populational surveys" and "prevalence". Studies from different countries show an average point-prevalence of 1% and lifetime prevalence of 2-2.5% for obsessive-compulsive disorder. In contrast with clinical samples, most populational samples have a predominance of females and cases with only obsessions. The frequent comorbidity with other mental disorders, particularly depression and other anxiety disorders, has also been found in cases from the community, which have an association with substances misuse as well. Many sufferers are not been treated, particularly the "pure" cases, Indicators of functional incapacitation show a considerable negative impact of obsessive-compulsive disorder It is necessary to increase the awareness about obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms in the community and among health professionals, in order to increase help seeking, as well as the proper identification and treatment of this rather serious medical condition.

AB  - The "Belt and Road Initiative", an important national measure undertaken during the reform and opening-up policy of China, includes the Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. The Belt and Road Initiative involves over four billion people from more than 60 countries; therefore, it is imperative to make accurate projections of future climate changes for improved mitigation planning at the national level. Extreme heat waves may have significant impacts on several aspects of natural ecosystems and society, prompting considerable concern; thus, research is necessary with respect to potential changes in the frequency and intensity of heat waves in the context of global warming. Increasing heat wave related disasters in a potentially warmer future may pose threats to the sustainable development of the Belt and Road Region (BRR)-A region with various complex climates and a weak economic foundation. Heat wave disasters that are accompanied by high temperatures and humidity can threaten human health. Traditional research on heat waves focuses on the effects of temperature; however, taking the comprehensive effect of temperature-humidity into consideration can better explain heat stress on the human body in a high-temperature environment and better measure the intensity of heat waves. Therefore, we adopted a heat wave index (a widely used indicator for the synergistic effect of temperature and humidity) developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to characterize the health risks associated with heat waves, as well as to further project the changes in areal and population exposure to heat waves in the 21st century at different risk levels throughout the BRR under two typical climatic-socioeconomical scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-8.5). Our analysis was based on state-of-the-art global climate models that are a part of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project and a population projection dataset developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the City University of New York's Institute for Demographic Research. Our results indicated that the intensity and frequency of heat waves in most areas throughout the BRR showed various increasing trends. Under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-8.5 scenarios, the sum of the population exposure to all levels of extreme heat waves in the BRR will increase to 2.0 and 3.3 times, respectively, by the end of the 21st century compared with that of the reference period (1986-2005). Furthermore, the relative increase in population exposure will be more remarkable for heat waves associated with higher risk levels; namely, the population exposure to heat waves at low, medium, and high risk levels will increase to 1.3, 2.1, and 8.9, respectively, under SSP2-4.5 and 1.5, 2.9, and 28.2 times, respectively, under SSP3-8.5 compared with that of the reference period. Developing countries in South Asia and Southeast Asia with large populations will suffer the most prominent increase in population exposure to heat waves. Typically, climatic factors play a major role in the increase of overall population exposure and dominate the increase in population exposure to heat waves at higher risk levels. However, the relative magnitude of the contribution of climatic and demographic factors varied across the regions. Our results indicated that unlike the air temperature, changes in the heat-humidity indices were significantly greater at lower latitudes, where only slight increases in the mean may be required to substantially enhance the frequency of dangerous conditions.
   Future construction of the Belt and Road must establish an early warning system for high-risk areas based on risk evaluations for extreme heat wave events. Additionally, it will be necessary to strengthen the vulnerability assessments for different areas and industries in the BRR and to establish an effective technical system to cope with extreme events.

AB  - Equilibrium and kinetic isotope fractionations during incomplete reactions result in minute differences in the ratio between the two stable N isotopes, N-15 and N-14, in various N pools. In ecosystems such variations (usually expressed in per mil [delta(15)N]deviations from the standard atmospheric N-2) depend on isotopic signatures of inputs and outputs, the input-output balance, N transformations and their specific isotope effects, and compartmentation of N within the system. Products along a sequence of reactions, e.g. the N mineralization-N uptake pathway, should, if fractionation factors were equal for the different reactions, become progressively depleted. However, fractionation factors vary. For example, because nitrification discriminates against N-15 in the substrate more than does N mineralization, NH4+ can become isotopically heavier than the organic N from which it is derived.
   Levels of isotopic enrichment depend dynamically on the stoichiometry of reactions, as well as on specific abiotic and biotic conditions. Thus, the delta(15)N of a specific N pool is not a constant, and delta(15)N of a N compound added to the system is not a conservative, unchanging tracer. This fact, together with analytical problems of measuring 615N in small and dynamic pools of N in the soil-plant system, and the complexity of the N cycle itself (for instance the abundance of reversible reactions), limit the possibilities of making inferences based on observations of N-15 abundance in one or a few pools of N in a system. Nevertheless, measurements of delta(15)N might offer the advantage of giving insights into the N cycle without disturbing the system by adding N-15 tracer.
   Such attempts require, however, that the complex factors affecting delta(15)N in plants be taken into account, viz. (i) the source(s) of N (soil, precipitation, NOx, NH3, N-2-fixation), (ii) the depth(s) in soil from which N is taken up, (iii) the form(s) of soil-N used (organic N, NH4+, NO3-), (iv) influences of mycorrhizal symbioses and fractionations during and after N uptake by plants, and (v) interactions between these factors and plant phenology. Because of this complexity, data on delta(15)N can only be used alone when certain requirements are met, e.g. when a clearly discrete N source in terms of amount and isotopic signature is studied. For example, it is recommended that N in non-N-2-fixing species should differ more than 5 parts per thousand, from N derived by N-2-fixation, and that several non N-2-fixing references are used, when data on delta(15)N are used to estimate N-2-fixation in poorly described ecosystems.
   As well as giving information on N source effects, delta(15)N can give insights into N cycle rates. For example, high levels of N deposition onto previously N-limited systems leads to increased nitrification, which produces N-15- enriched NH4+ and N-15-depleted NO3-. As many forest plants prefer NH4+ they become enriched in N-15 in such circumstances. This change in plant delta(15)N Will subsequently also occur in the soil surface horizon after litter-fall, and might be a useful indicator of N saturation, especially since there is usually an increase in delta(15)N With depth in soils of N-limited forests.
   Generally, interpretation of N-15 measurements requires additional independent data and modelling, and benefits from a controlled experimental setting. Modelling will be greatly assisted by the development of methods to measure the delta(15)N of small dynamic pools of N in soils. Direct comparisons with parallel low tracer level N-15 studies will be necessary to further develop the interpretation of variations in delta(15)N in soil-plant systems. Another promising approach is to study ratios of N-15:N-14 together with other pairs of stable isotopes, e.g. C-13:C-12 or O-18:O-16, in the same ion or molecules. This approach can help to tackle the challenge of distinguishing isotopic source effects from fractionations within the system studied.

AB  - Biological revitalisation of highly devastated areas such as querries, depots and landfills is in Croatia, in terms of permanent green coverage, usually conducted with Austrian black pine (Pinus nigra Mill.), Until now research of other forest tree species utilization and their usage within sanation process haven't been conducted. With this objective, in the fall of 2007, test field for scientific needs was established for research of biological sanation of querry Ocura II with autochtonous tree and schrub species. Basic aim of this trial was to determine the possibility of application of autaochtonous tree and shrub species in querry revitalisation. Trial was established in the border part of Ocura II querry on already technically improved terracce. On this terracce layer of waste-rock from querry was deposed which acts as foundation. Trial was established in two repetitions which depend on the soil type (deposed agricultural or forest humus substrate (soil)). In every repetition seedlings from nursery and from surrounding forest stands were planted. Seven pedological profiles have been dug up and additional observations have been conducted with pedological sonde. For indentification of pioneer forest species which come by nature on Ocura querry locality, it was necessary to study and to determine vegetation, floristic composition of forest edges, as well as areas inside of querry on which natural vegetation begun to appear. Selection of plants for extraction was conducted in forest stands, on the top border area of querry, which was planned for clearcut in the near future with the aim of sequent exploitation of querry. Selected species were Flowering ash (Fraxinus ornus L.), Sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), Black poplar (Populus nigra L.), willows (Salix sp.), and European privet (Ligustrum vulgare L.). 546 plants od forest tree species was planted in total, which include 110 willows and poplar plants, 110 sycamore maple and 110 flowering ash plants and 216 bush species plants, which include 144 European privet and 72 Ruscus aculeatus plants. Selection of Ruscus aculeatus for this trial was based on preservation of individuall speciments of this endangered specie in the vicinity of it's habitant which will he devastated by exploitation.
   The results of test field monitoring indicate very good survival success of young plants. Outplanted plants on the test field were in very good health condition, except Ruscus aculeatus, which was planted with the aim of protection. For now conclusions about success of plants regarding the soil type could not be made, but there is a correlation between survival of plants and their breeding. At the lime of survival observation nursery seedlings had higher average survival rate then plants extracted from surrounding stands. There is no different in survival rate between plants planted oil agricultural and forest soil in first year (91,2-91,1 %) but after secund year there are differences (81,8 % on forest soil, 87,7 % on agricultural soil).
   Survival of Sycamore maple is in range from 72,0 % to 93,3 %. Sycamore plants which have been extracted from forest stands have the lowest survival rate while plants planted on forest soil have lower survival (72 %) then plants planted on agricultural soil (73,7 %). Survival of sycamore nursery seedlings is satisfatory on both soil types and it ranges from 88, 0 to 93,3 %. Flowering ash nursery seedlings have 100 % survival rate regardless of soil type, but survival of Flowering ash is different in relation to soil type. On agricultural soil this survival rate is satisfatory and amounts 93,3 %. while plants on forest soil have 56 % survival rate. Survival rate of willows and poplars ranges from 90,0 to 100 %. The best survival have plants which have been extracted from forest stands and been planted on forest soil, and plants from stands planted on agricultural soil have the lowest survival. Survival of nursery seedlings ranges from 92,0 to 90,0 %. Survival of European privet is in the range of 68,8 to 87,5 %. More successful are European privet plants planted on agricultural soil.
   The results of this research indicate that adequate species of autochtonous and pioneer forest trees and species have been selected for revitalisation of this querry, taking into account their ecological requirements and biological features.

AB  - The biosphere of planet Earth is delineated by physico-chemical conditions that are too harsh for, or inconsistent with, life processes and maintenance of the structure and function of biomolecules. To define the window of life on Earth (and perhaps gain insights into the limits that life could tolerate elsewhere), and hence understand some of the most unusual biological activities that operate at such extremes, it is necessary to understand the causes and cellular basis of systems failure beyond these windows. Because water plays such a central role in biomolecules and bioprocesses, its availability, properties and behaviour are among the key life-limiting parameters. Saline waters dominate the Earth, with the oceans holding 96.5% of the planet's water. Saline groundwater, inland seas or saltwater lakes hold another 1%, a quantity that exceeds the world's available freshwater. About one quarter of Earth's land mass is underlain by salt, often more than 100 m thick. Evaporite deposits contain hypersaline waters within and between their salt crystals, and even contain large subterranean salt lakes, and therefore represent significant microbial habitats. Salts have a major impact on the nature and extent of the biosphere, because solutes radically influence water's availability (water activity) and exert other activities that also affect biological systems (e.g. ionic, kosmotropic, chaotropic and those that affect cell turgor), and as a consequence can be major stressors of cellular systems. Despite the stressor effects of salts, hypersaline environments can be heavily populated with salt-tolerant or -dependent microbes, the halophiles. The most common salt in hypersaline environments is NaCl, but many evaporite deposits and brines are also rich in other salts, including MgCl2 (several hundred million tonnes of bischofite, MgCl2.6H(2)O, occur in one formation alone). Magnesium (Mg) is the third most abundant element dissolved in seawater and is ubiquitous in the Earth's crust, and throughout the Solar System, where it exists in association with a variety of anions. Magnesium chloride is exceptionally soluble in water, so can achieve high concentrations (> 5 M) in brines. However, while NaCl-dominated hypersaline environments are habitats for a rich variety of salt-adapted microbes, there are contradictory indications of life in MgCl2-rich environments. In this work, we have sought to obtain new insights into how MgCl2 affects cellular systems, to assess whether MgCl2 can determine the window of life, and, if so, to derive a value for this window. We have dissected two relevant cellular stress-related activities of MgCl2 solutions, namely water activity reduction and chaotropicity, and analysed signatures of life at different concentrations of MgCl2 in a natural environment, namely the 0.05-5.05 M MgCl2 gradient of the seawater : hypersaline brine interface of Discovery Basin - a large, stable brine lake almost saturated with MgCl2, located on the Mediterranean Sea floor. We document here the exceptional chaotropicity of MgCl2, and show that this property, rather than water activity reduction, inhibits life by denaturing biological macromolecules. In vitro, a test enzyme was totally inhibited by MgCl2 at concentrations below 1 M; and culture medium with MgCl2 concentrations above 1.26 M inhibited the growth of microbes in samples taken from all parts of the Discovery interface.
   Although DNA and rNA from key microbial groups (sulfate reducers and methanogens) were detected along the entire MgCl2 gradient of the seawater : Discovery brine interface, mRNA, a highly labile indicator of active microbes, was recovered only from the upper part of the chemocline at MgCl2 concentrations of less than 2.3 M. We also show that the extreme chaotropicity of MgCl2 at high concentrations not only denatures macromolecules, but also preserves the more stable ones: such indicator molecules, hitherto regarded as evidence of life, may thus be misleading signatures in chaotropic environments. Thus, the chaotropicity of MgCl2 would appear to be a window-of-life-determining parameter, and the results obtained here suggest that the upper MgCl2 concentration for life, in the absence of compensating (e.g. kosmotropic) solutes, is about 2.3 M.

   Results. The main idea of the paper is to study the issues of development of regional socioeconomic systems under the conditions of limited water resources. Considering this, the paper is aimed at studying the impact of regional water management dependence on economic growth in the region. The tasks for development of regional socio-economic systems on the basis of water efficiency are defined, as well as the concept "water-efficient regional socio-economic system" is defined. The study presents a hypothesis about the need to change the paradigm of regulation of regional development on the basis of water use efficiency and regional water management dependence. In order to trade effectively with the main crops, it is necessary to determine whether there are sufficient water supplies in a given country and its regions. For this purpose, the authors proposes to use own indicator, such as the index of regional water management dependence. The characteristic of water management dependence is given, from regions where only up to half of the water supply of the territory is used, and to regions where more than 100 % of the water supply of the territory is used. The research has updated that the expansion of knowledge and understanding of the specifics of the water sector can solve significant problems. It is proved that the economic growth of the Ukrainian economy due to the agricultural sector has its limits and is limited by the water management dependence of the territories, ie the limitation of certain territories of the regions of Ukraine in terms of water resources. The next effective economic growth is possible only through the implementation of water-efficient technologies and intensification of water-efficient activities in the region.
   Originality / scientific novelty. The study for the first time defines the concept of water-efficient regional socio-economic system, so it is a socio-economic system that provides for the restoration of water resources in the region, reducing the water intensity of gross regional product (GRP) and approaching European norms and proposes the classification of regions according to the index of regional water management dependence on the basis of its threshold values. A scientific and methodological approach to assessing the level of needs of regional socio-economic systems in water resources has been improved, based on the application of the index of regional water management dependence, which is proposed to calculate the ratio of total fresh water use in the region to the volume of available river runoff in the region (parts of the water potential). The classification of regional socio-economic systems according to the level of water supply has been improved, which is based on the definition of threshold values of the index of regional water management dependence. The methodological bases for assessing the impact of the spatial economy on regional development under conditions of limited water resources have been improved, which differ in substantiating the dependence of the level of development of regions on the available water potential of the territory.
   Practical value / implications. The results of the study allow a more comprehensive approach to the study of the problem of using water resources in Ukraine in the context of their limitation. The results of the study showed that the economic complex in most regions is water-intensive and unbalanced, as well as does not provide restoration of water resources by environmental parameters and requires the implementation of infrastructure schemes for redistribution of water resources between regions for economic activity. The results are recommended for consideration by local governments and regional administration for the development and implementation of "Regional programs for the development of water management in the region" and for the development of "Strategies for regional development until 2025-2027".

AB  - Following the marine heat wave of 2014-16, the California Current System (CCS) trended towards more typical conditions north of Point Conception, California, from mid-2017 to mid-2018, but became highly abnormal in the south by mid-2018.Two basinscale indices (Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Oceanic Nino Index) were close to neutral, but the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation was extremely low at the end of 2017 and beginning of 2018. Regional analyses demonstrated that upwelling was close to normal throughout most of the CCS with the exception of high upwelling from northern California to Washington in summer and fall of 2017. Sea surface temperature was close to normal throughout most of the CCS but warmed to record levels in summer 2018 in southern California and northern Baja California. In spring 2018, surface chlorophyll a was negatively anomalous throughout most of the US West Coast with localized hot spots around the Columbia River, in the Gulf of Farallones, and Monterey Bay. Lipid-rich copepod densities and sizes returned to normal levels in the northern CCS, and euphausiid abundances were above average in central California but below average in southern California in spring 2018. Abundances of 7 zooplankton taxa were slightly to well above average off of northern Baja California in late 2017. Pyrosomes, which are associated with warm water, were found throughout the CCS.
   The fish assemblage off Oregon and Washington was comprised of both northern and southern/offshore species. In the central region (near Monterey Bay) most fishes were close to long-term mean abundances; however, adult northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) abundance was the highest on record. The ichthyoplankton assemblage off southern California had a tropical signal similar to 2014-15 as warm-water associated mesopelagic abundances were close to record highs and cold water mesopelagics abundances were very low.Anchovy larvae abundances in southern California were the highest since the 1960s.
   Indicators that can affect salmon survival were mixed in 2018. On the one hand, several indices forecast high salmon return (moderate-high salmon yearling abundance, high larval fish (salmon prey) abundance, normal lipid-rich copepod abundances). On the other hand, low survival was predicted by high fall PDO, high abundances of offshore larval fishes, and above average abundance of lipid-poor copepods.This unusual mix of indicators makes it difficult to forecast salmon returns in upcoming years.
   Common murre (Urfa aalge) reproduction was historically low in the northern CCS in 2017 as colonies experienced complete reproductive failure both at Yaquina Head, Oregon, and Castle Rock, California. In both cases, forage was scarce, birds conducted long foraging excursions which left eggs unattended for extended periods, and many eggs were consumed by avian predators. Brandt's (Phalacrocorax peniscillatus) and pelagic (P. pelagicus) cormorants had above average reproductive success in 2017 at Yaquina Head, but Brandt's cormorant also had total reproductive failure in 2017 at Castle Rock. At Southeast Farallon Island murre, Brandt's cormorant, and pelagic cormorant productivity was close to average in 2017, and Brandt's cormorant and murre were slightly above average in 2018. Preliminary 2018 results fromYaquina Head also indicated that murre successfully produced chicks for the first time since 2014. At-sea bird surveys in the north demonstrated that sooty shearwater and common murre abundances were historically low in 2017, but increased to some of the highest values on record in 2018. By contrast, the at-sea surveys off central California found that murre densities were anomalously high in 2017 but fell to an average level in 2018.
   Improving California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) pup condition continued from 2016 into 2017 as live pup counts, pup weight, and rate of growth were above average. Augmented pup conditions in 2016-17 was likely driven by increased availability of anchovy, as anchovy remains were found in nearly 100% of sea lion scat. There were record high encounters with Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) off central California in 2018.
   Overall, much of the CCS was in more of a normal state through mid-2018 relative to the past 5 years. However, remnants of the 2014-16 marine heat wave were still resonating in the north, and another highly anomalously warm water event affected the southern part of the CCS in summer 2018. Thus, while the CCS was returning to typical conditions in the north, it was anything but normal in the south in 2018.

AB  - During waking, stimuli activate the sensory pathways giving rise to sensation and the response to such stimulation. The electrobiochemical changes and modifications in EEG rhythms event-related synchronization or event-related desynchronization, ERD or ERS) propagated in the specific and unspecific cortex are added to the changes elicited by the responses and to the new signals originated by those same responses, bringing about perception Diverse factors can alter these glialneuronal circuits, producing alterations in attention processes (ADD) and in the integration with their meaning. The inability to identify signals and integrate correct coordinated responses leads to deficiencies in responding to the environment and to associated morbidities that are added to ADD. ADD and its associated morbidities cause high social and economic impacts and, even more so, because of their persistence into adolescence and adulthood. Therefore, highly accurate diagnostic procedures ore needed for these diseases. According to the CIE-10, in the clinical selling symptoms are analyzed without studying the neuro-developmental and neurodegenerative signs that identify alterations in neuronal circuits. As is known, behavior (including motivation, memory, thoughts) results from the Central Nervous System (CNS) activity, and the EEG records the electrical activity of neurons and synapses of the cerebral cortex, where cognitive processes are most likely to take place.
   To establish more accurate diagnostic procedures for ADD, we are integrating an electronic database, considering the intensity and cerebral distribution of theta (theta), alpha (alpha), and beta (beta) rhythms We propose that the ERD of alpha and beta reflects a cortical activation that gives rise to sensory-motor coordination processes The first stimulations induce ERD, and their repetitions produce its decrement (ERS). ERD habituation In addition, this ERD to ERS change might be reversed when giving meaning to the stimulation We present herein the changes in theta, alpha, and beta rhythms induced by repealed photostimulation (RPS), with the some characteristics, that, when presented, requires the subject to press a knob.
   Hundred-twenty-four children were studied of the Instituto Nocional de Rehabililacion (INR, for its initials in Spanish) in Mexico City Children were of either gender and aged from 3 to 15 years, separated in four groups of 3-year intervals. During clinical exploration, we searched for possible delays in physical-emotional intellectual development, epilepsy, and medical at psychological treatments during the last six months, which were considered exclusion factors Parents were briefed on the study, explaining them that the procedure hod a low-risk nature and allowed for the analyzis of the electrical activity of the brain Once having understood and accepted the procedure, they signed the informed consent form prepared by the institution. Children were explained "how the batteries of the b 'ain" work and that the procedure caused no pain of all They were asked to close their eyelids during the recordings, and to remain as motionless as possible The exclusion factors left a sample cf 94 children for the habituation analysis and of 47 for the simple conditioning procedures The EEG was recorded in dorsal decuaitus position, with a digital 24-channel electroencephalograph, according to the 10/20 international system In addition, we recorded eye movements and the EKG After 5.min recordings with closed eyelids, photo-stimulation was started of 5 flashes per second during 2s, repealed 20 times (RPS), at 21 to 25 sec. intervals. After finishing the series, 5 min rest were provided, and then a round device with a knob was placed in the children's hands, telling then) to press, the knob at the start of the RPS and to release it of the end Analyses were performed with 1.6 to 40 Hz bandwidth filters. From the bipolar leads, samples recorded 2 sec. before, during, and after the 1(st), 5(th), 10(th), 20(th) associations (PS-knob pressing) were manually chosen For conditioning analyses, we also measured the response latency. The Fourier's FT was applied to the samples and the absolute potency (AP) was calculated for theta (4.0 to 7.5 Hz), alpha (8.0 to 12.5 Hz), and beta (13 to 20 Hz) The average of these frequencies was obtained for each hemisphere (Right, RH, Left, LH) and for both (BH). Wilcoon's test for related samples was used with alpha > 0.05 as significant.
   Analyses of the AP of the three frequencies in all children revealed a background activity below 10 mu V-2. The first RPS produced a decrease in the AP of theta and alpha, with an increase in beta in BH. At the 5(th) RPS, 0 and a continued to decrease along with an increase in beta At the 10(th) RPS, theta and alpha decreased less but the increase in beta persisted At the 15(th) RPS, theta continued to decrease but alpha increased in the LH and decreased somewhat in the RH, whereas beta cortinued its increase in BH. At the 20(th) RPS, the AP of theta and alpha decreased in BH, but the difference was smaller than that recorded during the. previous RPS. The AP of P continued to increase in BH The most relevant aspects are: a) in G-1 (children aged 3 to 6 years), the AP of the three frequencies is higher, predominating theta, which is twice the magnitude of that of the whale group; b the 1(st) PS produced an increase in the AP of all three frequencies, which was not recorded in the other groups (children aged 6.5 to 15 years); c) in G-4 (children 12.5 to 15 years age), the 1(st) and 5(th) PS produced a clear diminution in the AP of theta and alpha (ERD), which was smaller at file 10(th) RPS and rover sed at the 15(th) and 20(th) RPS (ERS) After indicating to the children that with each RPS they would hove to p, ass a knob, the background activity increased to 12 mu V-2. During the 1(st) association (assoc), the AP of theta and alpha decreased with a slight decrease in beta, the response latency was 930 ms. At the 5(th) assoc, theta decreased together with a small increase in alpha and beta, and the response latency decreased to 750 ms. On the 10(th) and 15(th) assoc, the three frequencies increased and the latency decreased in 650 and 640 ms, respectively. On the 20(th) assoc, the AP increase of each rhythm was smaller, and the latency increased to 750 ms.
   The EEG analysis per group revealed a higher AP for theta in the smaller children that decreased along increasing age together with a relative increase in alpha, which reached its maximal value in G-4. in the four groups, the RPS induced an undulating tendency towards a decrease in the EEG desynchronization that represents habituation, being more noticeable in G-4. Although the reached synchronization did not reflect a better inhibition, as described in adults, it suggested that, in these children, the inhibitory activity sensory control has not yet developed completely Another important finding is that in G-1, the 1(st) RPS induced and increase in theta and alpha that was ; observed in the other groups This suggests that a facilitation of the circuits predominates in this age group Children of G-4 depict the best habituation curve; however, because of the reduced number of children in this group, some data did not reach statistical significance, their clinical relevance is a strong indicator of the need to enlarge the sample size or more in-depth analyses. The knob-pressing response Improved in correlation with the chronological age, coinciding with the decrease in theta and the increase of a Surprisingly, according to our hypothesis, conditioning at the cortical level would be reflected in or. increase of the beta rhythm (DRE), which we did not register. However, we did find on inverse correlation. between the decrease or increase in theta and alpha rhythms, as well as a better motor response with interhemispheric differences, manifested more intensely in the RH, which for most of the studied population represents the non-dominant, hemisphere. The modification of theta and alpha may be explained as resulting from the functional integration of the specific and unspecific central-encephalic-thalamic-cortical sensorial circuits that may be related, in turn, to alpha rhythm generation and the limbic circuits, related to the theta rhythm, which participate in the integration of memory.

AB  - Natural capital plays a central role in urban functioning, reducing flooding, mitigating urban heat island effects, reducing air pollution, and improving urban biodiversity through provision of habitat space. There is also evidence on the role played by blue and green space in improving physical and mental health, reducing the burden on the health care service. Yet from an urban planning and development view, natural capital may be considered a nice to have, but not essential element of urban design; taking up valuable space which could otherwise be used for traditional built environment uses. While urban natural capital is largely recognised as a positive element, its benefits are difficult to measure both in space and time, making its inclusion in urban (re)development difficult to justify. Here, using a London case study and information provided by key stakeholders, we present a system dynamics (SD) modelling framework to assess the natural capital performance of development and aid design evaluation. A headline indicator: Natural Space Performance, is used to evaluate the capacity of natural space to provide ecosystem services, providing a semi-quantitative measure of system wide impacts of change within a combined natural, built and social system. We demonstrate the capacity of the model to explore how combined or individual changes in development design can affect natural capital and the provision of ecosystem services, for example, biodiversity or flood risk. By evaluating natural capital and ecosystem services over time, greater justification for their inclusion in planning and development can be derived, providing support for increased blue and green space within cities, improving urban sustainability and enhancing quality of life. Furthermore, the application of a SD approach captures key interactions between variables over time, showing system evolution while highlighting intervention opportunities.

AB  - A key aspect of contemporary fish habitat management is the need to account for losses and gains associated with development and offsetting measures while protecting high quality features. We propose an ecological accounting framework for aquatic ecosystems using habitat equivalents scaled to aquatic productivity, and using fish-to-habitat associations by life stage, based on local fish community needs. The framework uses both landscape-scale and site-level evaluations of pre- and post-project habitat changes to assign and track habitat parcels, using ecological baselines and fish-habitat target setting. Concepts of natural capital reserves and productivity-based ecotypes are used for trading losses and gains between impacts from development projects and offsets, including restoration actions, while maintaining ecologically important areas intact. Traditional accounting terms such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers are defined using scaled habitat-equivalents as the currency. Other key features of the framework include setting a service area that is ecologically meaningful, and conducting habitat transactions guided by habitat conservation, protection, and restoration (habitat CPR) principles. The nearshore area of the Toronto and Region is used as a case study to illustrate the eco-accounting framework and how habitat banking could be incorporated along with planned restoration to remediate this degraded but continually developed area. The framework represents significant advances in managing cumulative habitat effects in an integrated way, moving away from a focus on only project- or site-level assessments.

AB  - Accounting for ecosystems is increasingly central to natural capital accounting. What is missing from this, however, is an answer to questions about how natural capital is distributed. That is, who consumes ecosystem services and who owns or manages the underlying asset(s) that give rise to ecosystem services. In this paper, we examine the significance of the ownership of land on which ecosystem assets (or ecosystem types) is located in the context of natural capital accounting. We illustrate this in an empirical application to two ecosystem services and a range of ecosystem types and land ownership in Scotland, a context in which land reform debates are longstanding. Our results indicate the relative importance of private land in ecosystem service supply, rather than land held by the public sector. We find relative concentration of ownership for land providing comparatively high amounts of carbon sequestration. For air pollution removal, however, the role of smaller to medium sized, mostly privately owned, land holdings closer to urban settlements becomes more prominent. The contributions in this paper, we argue, represent important first steps in anticipating distributional impacts of natural capital (and related) policy in natural capital accounts as well as connecting these frameworks to broader concerns about wealth disparities across and within countries.

AB  - The life community of mountains, rivers, forests, farmlands, lakes and grasslands (MRFFLG) and its systemic governance are key components to build ecological civilization in China. It comprises diverse connotations in value, scientific and economic dimensions. Epistemologically, it comes from the Chinese traditional philosophy of harmonious coexistence of heaven, earth and man, and conforms to the Western ecological ethics, complex system science and environmental value theory. Methodologically, as a complex socio-ecological system in which man and nature interact and coexist, the life community of the MRFFLG should be governed coordinately from both narrow and broad views. At the policy level, from the perspectives of narrow synergy among ecological subsystems and broad synergy among the complex socio-ecological system, this paper evaluates the performance indicators of 16 pilot projects of the MRFFLG, and points out that the design of most pilot projects well reflects the narrow synergy of multiple ecological elements, but is short of attention to the broad synergy of green development and ecological civilization. There are two practical ways to promote the systemic governance of the MRFFLG. First, it needs to focus on the coordinated governance of watershed and ecological environment restoration against the background of global climate and environmental change. The goal is to restore and improve the service functions of ecological subsystems and enhance their climate adaptability. Second, in the context of new urbanization and green development transition, it requires a collaborative planning focusing on natural capital and green infrastructure investment, which is aimed at cultivating ecological dividends and realizing ecological economy.

AB  - The United States and European Union (EU) face common challenges in managing natural capital and balancing conservation and resource use with consumption of other forms of capital. This paper synthesizes findings from 11 individual application papers from a special issue of Ecosystem Services on natural capital accounting (NCA) and their application to the public and private sectors in the EU and U.S. NCA is inherently a data-integration centered exercise, aiming to draw new insights by realigning environmental and economic data into a consistent framework. Drawing primarily on papers from the special issue and other key NCA literature, we identify lessons learned and gaps remaining for NCA's development and application to decision making. In doing so, we identify eight key similarities and three major differences in NCA development, status, and application between the U.S. and EU. NCA can be highly policy relevant: special issue papers address critical issues including agriculture, water, conservation/land-use planning, climate, and corporate decision making. In both the U.S. and EU, further application is needed to drive demand for the accounts' production. Based on these experiences, the U.S. and EU can be important leaders in cross-sector, international collaboration toward next-generation environmental economic accounts that advance global NCA practice.

AB  - Drylands cover about 41% of the Earth's land surface and are inhabited by more than two billion people, who rely on the diversified ecosystem services provided by drylands for their livelihoods. Achieving sustainable livelihoods (SLs) is a key component of achieving the sustainable development goals set by the agenda in 2030. Although it has aroused extensive interest, research on SLs in drylands at a regional scale is still limited. This paper aims to address this research gap by evaluating SLs through a geographic gradient of aridity in Inner Mongolia. A sustainable livelihood index (SLI) was developed using a wide range of indicators in a sustainable livelihood framework (SLF). The weight of the indicators was determined by the entropy weight method, and the characteristics of the spatial distribution of the SLI were analyzed. The results showed that the SLI varies greatly across aridity zones. In terms of livelihood assets, the SLI in the dry sub-humid zone was 15% higher than in the arid zones, while, surprisingly, semi-arid zones were found to have the most vulnerable livelihoods (rather than the arid zones). The reason for this is that land management and planning approaches are necessary in drylands. In further detail, Moran's I index illustrated that the overall performance of the SLI of each league or city has a positive spatial correlation, while through local spatial correlation it was found that Hinggan and Chifeng are hot spot areas and Hohhot is a cold spot area. The lack of physical and social capital is an important obstacle for SLs. Based on the analysis of SLs in Inner Mongolia, the characteristics of the sustainable development of local residents were revealed. In this paper, we call for an integrated (i.e., focusing on natural and human capital) land management and planning approach for drylands to reflect the nature of the tightly coupled socio-ecological systems.

AB  - Mountain areas provide essential ecosystem services for communities living nearby. However, increasing demands for resources have led to the gradual clearing of biodiverse mountain areas worldwide. Providing an alternative and sustainable livelihood source, such as forestry, could support natural regeneration and counter this process. In order to better understand future land-use, an assessment of forestry's impact on available ecosystem services functioning needs to be conducted. This paper analyzes the cost-effectiveness of forest plantation on marginal lands to promote ecosystem services restoration in Shah Foladi Protected Area, Afghanistan, using a methodology combining ecosystem services mapping, and analysis of crucial ecosystem services. We account for timber production, fuelwood provision and carbon sequestration as important benefits of forestry in mountain areas. To our knowledge this represents the first account of ecosystem services in Afghanistan, providing an important first step in accounting for natural capital in the country, with transferable lessons to other countries in post-conflict recovery and peacebuilding setting, as well as other mountain areas worldwide. The result of the study forms a basis for economic valuation of these ecosystems services and inform land-use management decision making. Our findings show that planting trees and establishing forests would increase timber and fuelwood production and support alternative livelihood sources for communities, alleviating land degradation, which ultimately would support the conservation of the natural landscapes. The analysis reveals that planting trees on marginal land is economically justifiable at over ten years in the majority of the Shah Foladi valleys, and the result is positive even where the very conservative 9.5% discount rate is applied.

AB  - The commodity and resource markets played an important role in attaining the country's economic development via energy efficiency, economic insurance prices and sound financial development. However, the enormous pressure of human demand on natural capital exhausts many important rare earth's resources that demolished the global resource conservation agenda. This study examines the stated factors in the top 10 mineral abundant economies by using their latest available data series from 1990 to 2019. The results of the study show that ecological footprints on mineral resources confirmed the hump-shaped relationship between them. The enormous human demand for natural capital is viewed further in the environmental accounting system. Ecological footprints cause a greater extraction of mineral resources that jeopardize future stocks of rare earth's resources. The panel estimates show that insurance and financial services, massive population growth, and continued economic growth decreases mineral resource rents. In contrast, energy efficiency and trade policies increase mineral resource rents across countries. In general, the results support the economic policies that help reduce human demand for natural capital by efficient insurance services, sustainable economic growth, energy efficiency, and trade fair policies. These factors required more sustainable efforts to mitigate adverse environmental externalities by adopting the latest technology in extractive industries to prevent unsolicited mineral losses.

AB  - This study implements the ecosystem service framework to link the concepts of farming activity and ecosystem restoration within the circular economy. It proposes a method for identifying social indicators of ecosystem restoration that can be taken into account in the transition towards more circular and sustainable agricultural systems. Using a case study located in semi-arid Mediterranean landscapes, we conducted a social sampling with 350 respondents to explore how an almond tree restoration changes perceptions and preferences for ecosystem services, and how these socio-ecological changes translate into indicators of natural capital and human wellbeing. Results not only indicated that the almond tree restoration induced changes in people ' s preferences and perceptions for ecosystem services, such as an increase in ecosystem service diversity (i.e., local identity and erosion control), but they also demonstrated how the social and cultural benefits associated to ecosystem services can be used as indicators of human well-being (i.e., human health and access to goods). We suggest that the inclusion of social indicators of ecosystem restoration must be included in policies and initiatives for a transition to circular economy, and to achieve the challenges of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.

AB  - Faced with the transformation of coastal marine ecosystems and the consequent decline in ecosystem services around the world, the global knowledge about coastal ecosystem services and their values is necessary to support ecosystem-based management policies. The aim of this study is to provide an overview regarding coastal marine ecosystem services and determine the global distribution of the economic benefits provided by these ecosystems and the relation to socio-economic development indicators. We reviewed articles from the Web of Science platform and built thematic maps regarding the valuation of coastal marine ecosystem services around the world. We applied statistical analysis in order to (i) identify in which ecosystems most of the valuation, quantification and ranking studies of ecosystem services are concentrated; (ii) to inform on the protection status of these ecosystems and which kind of valuation methods are more used; and (iii) to understand the relation between the economic values of ecosystem services and socio-economic development indicators (such as GDP and HDI). It was found that wetlands and mangroves are the most quantified and valuated ecosystems. Recreation services are more valuated in Europe and coastal protection stood out in countries that suffer more from storms. The most widely used valuation methods are willingness to pay and market values. The average annual economic values ranged from US $ 1100 to US $ 77 billion. Finally, there is a positive relationship between the economic values of the ecosystem services and the GDP and HDI indicators.

AB  - South Africa is the largest emitter of CO2 and arguably the most developed and urbanised country in Africa. The country currently harbours an ecological deficit territory which could be the outcome of economic expansion, urban explosion, unsustainable resource exploration and a low level of human development. After all, environmental distortions are mainly the outcome of human activities. This study is a maiden attempt to examine the linkage between urbanisation, human capital, natural resources (NR) and the ecological footprint (EF) in South Africa. Unlike previous studies, this study employs positivist and relevant environmental indicators that accommodate built-up land, forest land, carbon footprint, ocean, grazing land and cropland. Findings from the long-run results suggest that urbanisation, economic growth and NR increase the EF, whereas human capital ensures environmental sustainability. The interaction between urbanisation and human capital mitigates environmental degradation by reducing the EF. The canonical cointegrating regression (CCR), dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) and the fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) results further confirm the nature of the relationships and linkages existing with respect to NR, urbanisation, economic growth and the EF. A bidirectional causality exists between human capital, economic growth and the EF. Policies related to NR and urban sustainability, the limitations of the study, as well as possible directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Rapid urbanization in many parts of the world has increasingly put the environment under pressure, with natural landscapes cleared to make way for built infrastructure. Urban ecosystems, and the services that they provide, can offer nature-based solutions to the challenges of urbanization. There is increasing interest in better incorporating ecosystems into urban planning and design in order to deliver greater provision of ecosystem services and enhance urban liveability. However, there are few examples of built or proposed urban developments that have been designed specifically with ecosystem services in mind-partly because there are few modeling tools available to support urban planners and designers by informing their design workflows. Through using Singapore's latest nature-centric town as a case study, this article assesses the impacts of nature-based solutions in urban design on ecosystem services performance, through a spatially explicit modeling approach. The proposed future scenario for the nature-centric town was projected to result in substantial declines in the provision of all ecosystem services, as a result of the removal of large areas of natural vegetation cover. However, the future scenario compared favourably against three older towns that have been constructed in Singapore, showing the best performance for four out of six ecosystem services. This simulation exercise indicates that designing towns with ecosystem services in mind, and incorporating nature-based solutions into urban design, can help to achieve enhanced performance in providing ecosystem services. The models developed for this study have been made publicly available for use in other tropical cities.

AB  - Understanding where ecosystem services (ES) are and quantifying their supply using stakeholders? information is key for effective sustainable management. This paper describes a participatory methodology for extracting stakeholders? ES perception for continental Portugal based on land cover using analytical hierarchy process (AHP), matrix-based approach with data visualization techniques, and scenario analysis. Results show that drought regulation was the most valued ES by stakeholders and recreation was considered the least important. Results also show that the ?Agricultural areas and ?Forests and semi-natural areas? land cover classes provide about two-thirds of the total ES for the country. An ?Economic development? scenario will yield negative values for all ES except recreation and food supply, whereas an ?Environmental development? scenario will increase all ES, except food supply. Finally, a ?Sustainable development? scenario, presents values between the previous two scenarios and is the best for food supply. This operational methodology for extracting information from stakeholders and to report information on the mapping and assessment of ES can be helpful for sustainable planning in Portugal and elsewhere.

AB  - Sustainability concerns are increasing globally. Besides, in Pakistan, these concerns are increasing day by day due to lack of education as well as redundancy among human capital, depletion of natural resources and economic growth can lead to pose severe threats to the environment. To address this concern, this study examines the phenomena that in what way natural resources, human capital, and economic growth affect two important indicators i.e., ecological footprint and carbon emission in Pakistan from 1985 to 2018 by using the dynamic autoregressive distribution lag (DARDL) approach. The outcomes of the analysis indicate that in the long run human capital and natural resource has a negative link with carbon emission whereas economic growth has a positive link with carbon emission. On the other side, in the short run, human capital and economic growth have a positive link with carbon emission while natural resources have a negative link with carbon emission. Moreover, in the long and short-run human capital and economic growth has a positive link with ecological footprint whereas natural resources have a negative link with the ecological footprint. However, the results of this study also revealed the presence of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) in Pakistan. Moreover, creating awareness among the citizens together with governmental regulatory pressures might help in solving the problems related to the environment resulting in preserving the sustainability of future generations in Pakistan.

AB  - Soil is a reservoir of natural capital that provides several ecosystem services, ensuring human well-being and sustainable socioeconomic development. Many researchers nevertheless argue that there is no consensus on practical indicators to assess soil ecosystem services (SES). As many policy decisions rely on metrics and indicators to communicate concise and relevant information, an assessment of ecosystem service indicators can help identifying gaps hindering policymakers from more fully adopting ecosystem service approaches. The aim of this study was to develop a method to quantitatively evaluate six SES using a set of indicators derived from dynamic soil and crop modelling using the STICS model developed by INRA. In a 6 775 km(2) study area in northwestern France (Brittany), 64 soil sampling points, located in agricultural areas, were selected following a stratified random sampling design based on soil parent material stratification. STICS inputs required climate data, soil property data and soil and landscape management practices. Over a baseline period from 1988 to 2018, similar crop management practices were simulated that reflected the dominant one performed by conventional farmers across the study site: applying organic and mineral fertilizers to a maize-wheat-catch crop rotation. Also, STICS outputs were used to derive six biophysical indicators characterizing six SES. Both mean and annual SES indicators were calculated and analyzed. Interrelations among SES indicators and soil properties were investigated using a Pearson correlation matrix, multivariate variance analysis and regression-based methods. The main results revealed that pedological and inter-annual variability were the main drivers of SES provision, particularly for ground water recharge, plant biomass provision, plant water provision and carbon sequestration. All SES were strongly correlated, except carbon sequestration and plant nitrogen provision, which showed weak correlations with the rest of SES. Moreover, analyzing interrelations between SES indicators and soil properties such as soil depth, soil texture and its related variables such as available water capacity played a predominant role in ensuring high levels of water-related SES indicators. Meanwhile, physicochemical soil properties were strongly correlated with carbon sequestration but less so with plant nitrogen provision. Overall, these findings characterize the effect of soil variability on SES provision using modelling and field measures of several soil properties, which can be useful for policy makers.

AB  - The maintenance of natural capital and the stability of regulation services of marine ecosystems has proved to be linked to the conservation of key species supporting the ecosystems function. Chondrichthyes are key top predators and their removal from marine ecosystems due to fishing exploitation could lead to changes in species interactions and biomass that can negatively influence the provision of ecosystems services. The ecological role of the demersal Chondrichthyes living in the marine food web of the Calabrian area in the Northern Ionian Sea (Central Mediterranean Sea) was analysed by means of ecological indicators derived from Ecopath mass balance food web models estimated in their stationary states during the periods 1995-1997, 2003-2005 and 2013-2015. The trophic web model was described by 57 functional groups (7 of which representing the demersal Chondrichthyes), which were described by their Biomass (t/km(2)), Production and Consumption rate, Diet, Landings (t/km(2)) e Discards (t/km(2)). Remarkable changes in biomass were recorded for shark and rays, as a consequence of changes in fishing patterns and oceanographic regime shift named Bimodal Oscillating Systems (BiOS).
   Demersal Chondrichthyes occupy high trophic positions in the Calabria food web showing trophic levels higher than 4.1, with the D. licha identified as the main apex predators, while E. spinax and G. melastomus as meso-predators. The pattern of the consumption flows highlighted a potential sensitivity of E. spinax and G. melastomus to the changes in deep waters circulation caused by the BiOS acting on the entire ecosystem of the Ionian Sea. D. licha was identified as the main keystone predators in all the investigated periods. The analysis of the trophic indirect and direct impacts shows the role of the demersal Chondrichthyes as beneficial predators, with positive effects on several preys. Results also showed that G. melastomus and the Shelf Elasmobranchs group (e.g. Raja asterias, Mustelus mustelus, etc....) were overexploited in 1995 and that all groups of sharks and rays underwent to a decrease of exploitation rate over time. Chondrichthyes showed medium-low values of overlap with the fishing gears (<0.50), with the more relevant values estimated between the shelf elasmobranch group and passive nets and other gears. According to the findings of this work, the protection of Chondrichthyes could combine biodiversity conservation and fisheries management objectives. Therefore it is envisaged the implementation of appropriate spatial planning and conservation measures for these top-predators to guarantee valuable and sustainable flows of ecosystem goods and services.

AB  - Biodiversity points are a quantitative measure for biodiversity. For over a decade, biodiversity points are being applied in the Netherlands for measuring the impact of roads, enclosure dams, and other water management projects on the non-use value of biodiversity. Biodiversity points are quite similar to the quality-adjusted life years used for cost-effectiveness analysis of healthcare treatments. Biodiversity points can be calculated by multiplying the size of the ecotope (e.g., number of hectare), the ecological quality of the ecotope (0-100 %), and the ecological scarcity of each type of ecotope. For many infrastructure projects, the impact on the non-use value of biodiversity can be a principal purpose or a major co-benefit or trade-off, for example, for a park, a fish sluice, a road, an ecoduct, an enclosure dam, or a marine protected area. Biodiversity points are a simple, transparent, and standardized way to aggregate and quantify the qualitative or ordinal assessments by ecological experts. For measuring the non-use value of biodiversity, they are also more informative than valuation by revealed or stated preferences methods. This paper provides the first overview of the application of this method in the Dutch practice of cost-benefit analysis. It also discusses its merits and limitations. The calculation and use of biodiversity points are illustrated by four case studies.

AB  - Rapid urbanization of the coast, growing global trade, stakeholder emancipation and ongoing depletion of natural resources mean that ports can no longer operate and develop without acknowledging and incorporating societal and environmental considerations. Drawing primarily on first-hand experiences in South African ports, supplemented with learning taken from international literature, this paper proposes a conceptual change in the position of the natural environment in port development from that of a 'green handbrake' to 'equal partner'. The argument for this conceptual change is developed in three stages. First, we merge two concepts emerging from the literature, namely natural capital (or natural infrastructure) and infrastructure systems, to embed the natural environment as an integral component or 'equal partner' in port development. We then identify practical avenues through which the profile (or value) of the natural environment can be enhanced in port development, drawing on concepts such as Building with Nature (BwN) and multi-use of natural capital. Finally, we build a framework for Integrated Port Management (IPM) by conceptually positioning and aligning environmental processes within the traditional port development cycle, as well as identifying the need for coordination across and continuity between individual environmental assessment processes.
   In essence, bridging the disconnect between natural environmental issues and port development requires early consideration of the natural environment in port development, and an acknowledgement of multi-use benefits from natural capital. Further, in the operations and maintenance phases, environmental management systems in ports should not only focus on environmental performance, but also embrace multi-use valuation of the natural environment (ecosystem services) to give purpose to the need for environmental protection. However, crucial to effective implementation of an Integrated Port Management (IPM) framework will be its integration in organisational processes, supported by collaborative institutional structures. Only then will the environment take its place as equal partner in port development.

AB  - Natural capital protection is critical to humanity because biodiversity and ecosystem provide not only goods (e.g., food, energy, water) but also services (e.g., climate regulation, cultural amenities). The article discusses the performance on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) for natural capital protection, by framing the green growth concept into four pillars (i.e. environmental quality, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction, ecosystem and biodiversity protection, and cultural and social value). Natural capital protection is one of the four dimensions of the Green Growth Index developed by the Global Green Growth Institute to measure country performance in green growth transition. The indicators selected for natural capital protection are either SDG indicators or directly contributing to SDG targets. Benchmarked against sustainability targets for the SDGs, Aichi Biodiversity, and the Paris Climate Agreement, the performance scores directly measure the distance to achieving the SDGs. Because the indicators for natural capital protection have not been explicitly framed in other global green growth indices and benchmarked against sustainability targets, hence, the article fills in an important research gap. The results revealed that many regions are performing better in environmental quality and GHG emissions reduction, but struggling to improve the low performance in biodiversity and ecosystem protection as well as cultural and social values. Many countries in Asia and Oceania face an enormous challenge of improving performance in the share of Key Biodiversity Areas covered by protected areas and the potential level of soil biodiversity. If biodiversity loss due to deforestation and intensive farming will continue, the countries will lose the ability to achieve sustainability targets in reducing GHG emissions and environmental quality. The highest average performance scores for the regions are only about 80. Thus, there is still a significant gap in achieving sustainability targets (i.e. 100) in natural capital protection, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa region.

AB  - Land plays a critical role in both economic and environmental accounting. As an asset, it occupies a unique position at the intersection of the System of National Accounts (SNA), the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting Central Framework (SEEA-CF), and (as a spatial unit) SEEA Experimental Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EEA), making land a natural starting point for developing natural capital accounts more generally. We develop a pilot set of national and subnational land accounts for the United States that are consistent with the SEEA-CF and SNA principles, quantified in both physical and monetary terms. The physical accounts utilize detailed land use (National Land Use Database) and land cover (National Land Cover Database) datasets, which provide insights into how land cover in the U.S. is changing over time. To provide aggregate estimates of land values, we use a hedonic approach that exploits fine-grain microdata ("big data" from Zillow) that contains detailed information from hundreds of millions of property transactions and their corresponding physical characteristics covering much of the U.S. Methodologically, we show that it is feasible to produce monetary accounts for land that can be directly linked to and integrated with physical land cover/use. Overall, U.S. land cover has shown declines in forests, cropland, and pasture with increases in barren, scrub/shrub, and developed classes, which are particularly concentrated in the U.S. Southeast. Nominal land values in the U.S. fell about 28% ($7 trillion) from the boom to bust periods in the prior decade, albeit with substantial regional variation, and have subsequently experienced a nearly full recovery in recent years. We estimate private land in the contiguous 48 states to be worth approximately $25.1 trillion in 2016.

AB  - Gross Ecosystem Product (GEP) is an aggregate measure of the monetary value of final ecosystem services, or the direct benefits that people derive from nature. In this study, we focus on the 'Chang-Zhu-Tan' (CZT) urban agglomeration-an emerging megacity of over 15 million people situated on the Yangtze River-as a case study of the dynamics of ecological production amidst rapid urbanization. In this study, we couple a spatial-temporal analysis of regional ecological change based on remote-sensing data with economic valuation methods (e.g. travel cost method) using official statistics and survey data. We find that while the land cover of natural ecosystems decreased slightly between 2000 and 2015, their quality-and therefore economic value-greatly improved. From 2000 to 2015, the GEP of CZT increased by 56.77%. In particular, the value of regulating services grew by 7.43% (calculated using inflation-adjusted prices). GEP can reflect nature's contribution to human well-being. At the same time, its long-term trends can serve as an indicator of the extent and quality of local and regional ecosystems, thereby providing a corrective or complement to more conventional measures of development. Although urbanization increases spatial constraints on the management of natural capital, progress in ecological protection and restoration can still improve the quality of ecosystems and the services they provide. Our study shows how GEP, and the value of natural capital it reflects, can grow amidst the pressures of rapid urbanization.

AB  - Air quality has a significant impact on human health and natural systems worldwide. China, as one of the largest developing countries, faces very much serious air pollution and requires much attention. While the influences of air pollution on human or nature have been extensively investigated, few scholars considered the two effects of air pollution on human health and nature simultaneously based on the same framework. Indeed, human and nature coexist in the same biosphere on which they depend for their development and the impacts of air pollution on human health and nature occur at the same time with different and synergic effects. Only by considering both impacts we can develop a more comprehensive understanding of air pollution impacts, in particular including SO2, NO2, CO, PM10 and PM2.5. Impacts can be looked at from the point of view of damage provided and damage repair (health recovery, replacement cost). Therefore, considering the different pollutants and sectors, the influences of air pollution on human health and nature are accounted for in this study by applying the Emergy Accounting and Life Cycle Assessment Eco-indicator 99 methods under a unified framework in 31 provinces of China taken as case study. While LCA provides an accurate assessment of the direct consequences of pollution on human and natural capital (human health and biodiversity losses), the Emergy Accounting approach quantifies the biosphere work associated to repair or replace such losses over time. Furthermore, the spatial agglomeration characteristics of emissions, human and natural capital losses analyzed by means of Moran's I index. Results show that: (1) Concerning human capital losses, the amount of emissions of PM10 and PM2.5 only account for 10% of total impacts, compared to SO2, NO2, and CO emissions, but in some provinces cause more than 70% of human capital losses. And more than 80% of PM2.5 and PM10 that cause human capital losses come from the industrial and civil sectors. (2) As far as natural capital losses are concerned, compared with SO2, the losses caused by NO2 account for 80% in most provinces. And the power, industrial and transportation sectors are the three major sources of NO2 causing natural capital losses. (3) The spatial agglomeration characteristics, such as high-high cluster, high-low cluster, low-low cluster and low-high cluster, are different for air pollution emissions, human and natural capital losses. A comprehensive and detailed understanding of the impacts of air pollution is crucial for policy makers to take informed decisions.

AB  - Worldwide, water resources are increasingly under pressure. The Water accounting approach of the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) has been developed to inform decision-makers on water supply, use, and quality. However, a critical issue in water accounting is finding data and models to populate SEEA water accounts. In particular, there are challenges in aligning hydrological models with accounting principles. Also, there is a need to test further how the SEEA water accounts can be connected to policy uses. The objective of this study is to develop water accounts with the use of a hydrological model. Specifically, we apply the SWAT hydrological model in the Buyuk Menderes Basin in Turkey to estimate the key hydrological parameters required for water accounting. To adapt and link SWAT to SEEA water accounts, we develop supply and use tables and asset accounts following the SEEA water for the year 2014 and explore how water accounts can inform policymaking. This article provides new insights into the added value of using a hydrological model in constructing water accounts for better water resources management. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Guidelines are needed to support research and action on sustainable transitions towards more resilient and adaptable agroecosystems. Here I present an operationable and simple framework with theoretical underpinning to assess to what extent agroecological transitions propend to greater resilience and adaptability. Ecosystems may transition between alternative states defined by their structural and functional characteristics. Agroecological transitions are a special type of human-mediated transitions in which the various components of the agroecosystem and their interactions are reconfigured through a process of design. The concept of the complex adaptive cycle of social-ecological systems is used to propose a set of 10 criteria to monitor resilience and adaptability in agroecological transitions using a system of scores. They comprise: self-regulation, connectivity, functional diversity and redundancy, response diversity, space and time heterogeneity, building of natural capital, social self-organization, reflective learning and human capital, autonomy and local interdependency, and capitalising on local knowledge. The framework is illustrated with an example from Brazil, where national and local level socio-political drivers have supported a 30-year process of agroecological transition. Implications for policy monitoring, research for development and political discourses are discussed.

AB  - Ecosystem service accounts require quantifying the contribution of ecosystems to the society. However, esti-mation of the ecosystem service used (actual flow) remains still very challenging for regulating services. We developed an experimental ecosystem service account for flood control delivered by ecosystems including: 1) Biophysical modelling of ecosystem service potential, demand and actual flow. 2) Translation of the actual flow in monetary terms. 3) Compilation of accounting tables. Ultimately, we analysed changes in flood control be-tween 2006 and 2012. p
   The value of flood control delivered by ecosystems in 2012 is estimated at about 16 billion euro. This value increased by 1.14% between 2006 and 2012. This increase is mainly due to the sprawl of artificial areas into floodplains that benefit from flood control delivered by ecosystems. However, the role of natural capital to control floods is slightly decreasing. This is confirmed by the increase of artificial areas not protected by eco-systems (+1.9%, unmet demand). The role of natural capital to control floods could be enhanced by restoring ecosystems upstream from this unmet demand and increase the ecosystems contribution to human well-being. The methodology makes a significant contribution to the assessment of ecosystem services flow and the ac-counting framework.

AB  - Gross domestic product (GDP) summarizes a vast amount of economic information in a single monetary metric that is widely used by decision makers around the world. However, GDP fails to capture fully the contributions of nature to economic activity and human well-being. To address this critical omission, we develop a measure of gross ecosystem product (GEP) that summarizes the value of ecosystem services in a single monetary metric. We illustrate the measurement of GEP through an application to the Chinese province of Qinghai, showing that the approach is tractable using available data. Known as the "water tower of Asia," Qinghai is the source of the Mekong, Yangtze, and Yellow Rivers, and indeed, we find that water-related ecosystem services make up nearly two-thirds of the value of GEP for Qinghai. Importantly most of these benefits accrue downstream. In Qinghai, GEP was greater than GDP in 2000 and three-fourths as large as GDP in 2015 as its market economy grew. Large-scale investment in restoration resulted in improvements in the flows of ecosystem services measured in GEP (127.5%) over this period. Going forward, China is using GEP in decision making in multiple ways, as part of a transformation to inclusive, green growth. This includes investing in conservation of ecosystem assets to secure provision of ecosystem services through transregional compensation payments.

AB  - Agriculture strongly relies on irrigation. While irrigated land accounts for roughly 20% of the global cultivated area, it contributes to about 40% of crop production. In the last few decades, the growing demand for agricultural commodities has translated into an increasing pressure on the global freshwater resources, often leading to their unsustainable use. Here we investigate the sustainability of irrigation, balancing farmers' profit generation objectives and the needs of ecological systems. We ask the question "sustainability of what?" to stress how the sustainability of irrigation is often evaluated with respect the opposing needs of humans and nature. While from the farmers' perspective irrigation is sustainable when it provides uninterrupted access to water resources at a price not exceeding the marginal revenue they generate (clearly without accounting for environmental externalities), from the standpoint of water resources, irrigation is sustainable if it does not deplete freshwater stocks or environmental flows. We invoke the notions of "weak" and "strong" sustainability to develop a novel framework for the evaluation of tradeoffs between human needs and the conservation of natural capital. Through the analysis of criteria of performance, we relate water deficit and irrigation overuse to the reliability and resilience of irrigation. This approach is applied to the case of Australia, a major agricultural country affected by water scarcity. The application of the framework to the case of Australia shows how this approach can be used to highlight areas in which irrigation contributes to a weakly sustainable use of water resources with impacts on environmental flows and groundwater stocks. Solutions, such as increasing efficiencies or reducing water applications through the adoption of deficit irrigation, can enhance water sustainability in some water scarce locations.

AB  - Circular Economy (CE) concepts and tools are getting increasing attention with regard to their implementation in agricultural, urban and industrial sectors towards innovative business models to optimize resource use, process performances and development policies. However, conventional biophysical and economic indicators hardly fit CE characteristics. Life cycle assessment, footprint and economic cost-benefit indicators, do not fully capture the specificity of a closed loop CE framework, characterized by feedbacks and resource use minimization and quality assessment Commonly used mono-dimensional indicators seem unable to successfully relate the process performance and the use of ecosystem services and natural capital, in that they do not assess the environmental quality and sustainability (renewability, fit to use, recycle potential) of resources and the complexity of interaction between agro/industrial/urban environments and socioeconomic systems, and translate into an incomplete and inadequate picture, far from an effective CE perspective.
   In this study, Emergy Accounting method (EMA) is used to design an improved approach to CE systemic aspects, focusing on the importance of new indicators capable of capturing both resource generation (upstream), product (downstream) and systems dimensions.
   This conceptual scheme is built around the case study of the City of Napoli's economy (Campania region, Southern Italy) considering the surrounding agro-industrial area with its smaller urban settlements. In order to design a reasonable and reliable CE framework, a number of already existing and innovative processes is analyzed and discussed, through a bottom-up procedure capable to account for CE development options based on the recovery of locally available and still usable resources (i.e., conversion of waste cooking oil into biodiesel, conversion of slaughterhouse residues to power and chemicals, recovery and conversion of agro-waste residues, amongst others). The result highlighted that EMA was capable to keep track of the improvement generated by the implemented circularity patterns in terms of reduced total emergy of the system. Moreover, EMA indicators suggested that, in any case, the CE business framework should be intended as a transitional strategy towards more feasible paradigms.

AB  - Natural capital accounting allows for the integration of our natural assets within economic and political decision making, can improve natural resource governance and permits the development of environmentally adjusted macroeconomic indicators to serve as complements to Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The United Nations System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (UN SEEA) is the accepted international standard for natural capital accounting, providing a framework for organizing and presenting statistics on the environment and its relationship with the economy. This paper details the different approaches to natural capital accounting related to the SEEA framework currently being undertaken across Ireland. We discuss the relationship between natural capital accounts and sustainable development measurement and provide recommendations for future work in these areas.

AB  - In the "full world" and Anthropocene, global ecological consumption is beyond natural capital's regenerative and absorptive abilities, and ecological consumption of humanity has to be reduced to have an ecologically sustainable future. To achieve the goal of ecological sustainability, influencing factors that could reduce ecological consumption need to be explored. Based on three panel datasets for the time period 1996-2015, this paper estimates the impacts of urbanization, renewable energy consumption, service industries, and internet usage on ecological consumption for all 90 sample countries, the 42 developed countries, and the 48 developing countries. Education and income are taken as control variables in the panel regressions. As a consumption-side indicator, the ecological footprint is selected to measure ecological consumption. The estimations find that (1) urbanization has negative impacts for all sample countries and the developed countries, and it is insignificant for the developing countries, (2) renewable energy consumption and service industries have negative impacts for all of the three samples, and (3) internet usage has lagged negative impacts for all sample countries, and it is an independent and significant force of reducing ecological consumption in the developing countries rather than the developed countries. It is found that there is a positive linear relationship, an inversed U-shaped relationship, and a U-shaped relationship between ecological consumption and income in all sample countries, the developed countries, and the developing countries, respectively. The estimated results provide guidance for evidence-based policymaking on reducing ecological consumption.

AB  - Ecosystem services accounts are a useful tool that provides relevant information on the role of ecosystems in delivering services, and the society benefiting from them. This paper presents the accounting workflow for ecosystem services at the European Union level adopted by the Knowledge Innovation Project on an Integrated system for Natural Capital and ecosystem services Accounting (KIP INCA) - a European Commission initiative. The workflow includes: 1) biophysical assessment of ecosystem services; 2) monetary valuation; and 3) compilation of accounting tables. Supply and use tables are presented for six ecosystem services assessed so far. The supply table shows woodland and forest, followed by wetlands, as the ecosystem types with the highest monetary value per unit area. Analyses of changes between 2000 and 2012 show an overall increase of the monetary value of ecosystem services, mainly due to an increase in demand for them. We also discuss advantages and disadvantages of adopting a fast-track approach, based on official statistics, in comparison to an accounting strategy based on spatial models. We propose a novel workflow for ecosystem services accounts, focused on assessment of the actual flow of ecosystem services, making a significant contribution to further development of the technical recommendations for ecosystem services accounts.

AB  - The World Bank computes estimates of Genuine Savings (GS), a leading indicator of sustainable development, for most countries. A well-established literature has called for methodological enhancement. This paper presents augmented estimates of Irish GS throughout a period of unprecedented economic expansion and decline (1990-2016). A time-series constructed predominantly from national sources includes the most comprehensive coverage of pollutants in the literature surveyed. We apply a novel method to aid the property rights designation assessment required for transboundary pollutant accounting. In sharp contrast to the World Bank's estimates, our findings suggest that a modern developed economy can exhibit signs of unsustainability. Furthermore, extended environmental damages drive these results suggesting expanded country specific GS may diverge considerably from the World Bank's estimates. We find rapid economic development and rapid declines in environmental damages can occur concurrently and on the transition away from an unsustainable path.

AB  - The aspirations for natural capital and ecosystem service approaches to support environmental decision-making have not been fully realised in terms of their actual application in policy and management contexts. Application of the natural capital approach requires a range of methods, which as yet have not been fully tested in the context of decision making for the marine environment. It is unlikely that existing methodologies, which were developed for terrestrial systems and are based on land cover assessment approaches, will ever be feasible in the marine context at the national scale. Land cover approaches are also fundamentally insufficient for the marine environment because they do not take account of the water column, the significant interconnections between spatially disparate components, or the highly dynamic nature of the marine ecosystem, for example the high spatial mobility of many species. Data gaps have been a significant impediment to progress, so alternative methods that use proxies for quality information as well as the opportunities for remote sensing should be explored further. Greater effort to develop methodologies specifically for the marine environment is required, which should be interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral, coherent across policy areas, and applicable across a range of contexts.

AB  - There is a strong scientific consensus that coastal marine ecosystems, and in particular the midlittoral zone, at the interface between terrestrial and marine realms, are seriously threatened by anthropogenic impacts, along with the goods and services they provide. Along Mediterranean shallow rocky reefs, brown macroalgae belonging to the Cystoseira genus (e.g. Cystoseira amentacea and Cystoseira compressa) are ecosystem engineers, locally creating a continuous fringe in the midlittoral zone, supporting high biodiversity and productivity and providing ecosystem services. A growing interest in the quantification of ecosystem relevance through their economic value aims at raising public awareness and supporting policy-makers in the process of creating new legal instruments supporting the preservation of biodiversity. In this framework, a methodology for ecological and monetary evaluation of natural capital, based on biophysical accounting and on emergy theory, is applied to the habitats of the upper midlittoral zone located above continuous and non-continuous Cystoseira fringe. The proposed approach is a quantitative measure able to analyse the overall functioning of the system and its efficiency in exploiting available resources. The mean economic value of the habitats in the midlittoral zone assessed through the present study is 1.28 emE/m(2). Higher values, but associated with a larger variability, were observed in presence of continuous C. compressa fringe. Conversely, in the presence of a continuous C. amentacea fringe, a noticeable habitat-forming species, lower natural capital values were recorded possibly due to the attractive potential of this species in its understorey rather than in the above habitats, concurrently with a lower variability of the natural capital values (lower scatter), suggesting a deterministic homogeneity effect on the above midlittoral habitats. From this study, emergy analysis is confirmed to represent an effective and operative tool to provide a synthetic monetary assessment of natural capital making complex information easily accessible to different stakeholders, from general public to territorial managers.

AB  - Natural capital accounting is a new tool in environmental management. It can be understood as a new (and better) combination of existing tools used in economic analysis with environmental data. It articulates technical and scientific understanding of the environment in economic value terms for decision-makers. The various current forms of environmental, ecosystem and natural capital accounting are described. Examples are given of natural capital accounting for the urban environment at different spatial scales, from a single park to a UK national urban account. Reliance on economic valuation of the environment also brings risks, so understanding is needed of how values are generated, good practice in presenting them (e.g. alongside physical measures for context), and what they miss (e.g. stating key unvalued issues and being aware of potential threshold effects). The structure of natural capital accounting helps mitigate these risks, and so it can be used as a positive tool to highlight the value of the natural environment as an asset to our present and future society. Building on existing understanding and tools means natural capital accounting can be relatively easy to initiate.

AB  - ContextWe address understanding of whole-system and landscape-based approaches to the ecosystem services framework by considering the supply of provisioning services and the dynamics of agricultural land use in Scotland between 1940 and 2016.ObjectivesTo characterise and understand the dynamics of change in provisioning services from agriculture in Scotland over the period 1940-2016. To identify ways in which funds of capitals and flows of inputs and output ecosystem goods are linked to land management practices and policies at a national scale.MethodsData describing agricultural land use, production, financial and energy inputs and outputs, and drivers of change in land use in Scotland are analysed with an accounting framework that links funds of natural, human, physical and financial capital, with flows of goods and services. Flow-fund ratios are used as benchmarks of system performance and dynamics.ResultsScotland's agriculture has modernised since 1940 and become more efficient in conversion of resources, with a consequent increase in delivery of provisioning goods and services. Although the energy ratio, and flow of goods per unit hectare and per unit labour have increased, the inputs necessary to maintain those flows of ecosystem goods are also increasing, even as their relative economic costs decrease. Increases in use of fertiliser suggests that production from the soil, as a natural capital fund, is not being conserved without a large, and increasing, input. Analysis of the complexity of the coupled agricultural land system also suggests that land management rather than biodiversity is a necessary subject for evaluation of provisioning services from agriculture. Understanding of ecosystem services based on accounts that integrate inputs, outputs and flows from funds of natural, human, social, financial and physical capitals, provides a process-based foundation for improved understanding of ecosystem services and human-environmental relationships.ConclusionsAdopting an accounting approach for understanding the role of agricultural land use for supply of provisioning services, and particularly examining a long time-series of accounts, enables understanding of land changes and underlying drivers, as well as the contribution of cultural and other aspects of human systems coupled with environment systems. Accounting for ecosystem services using costs as well as benefits, and use of metrics beyond financial benefit, supports debate and evaluation of trade-offs between services and has direct relevance for decision- and policy-making.

AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a universal call to action to end poverty and protect the environment. The Government of Guatemala is prioritizing the SDGs it will focus on and defining lines of action to achieve them. In this paper, we apply the Integrated Economic-Environmental Modelling (IEEM) Platform for Guatemala to evaluate the economic, wealth and environmental impacts of strategies to achieve the second SDG of zero hunger and the sixth SDG of clean water and sanitation. The analytical power of the IEEM approach is driven by its integration of the first international standard for environmental statistics, the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting introduced in an earlier edition of this journal. This integration enables the evaluation of policy alternatives from economic, wealth and environmental perspectives which is essential given the integrated nature of the SDGs. We find that significant additional investment in agricultural productivity and water and sanitation would be required to meet these SDG targets and that the overall pace of economic growth is critical. TEEM applied to the SDGs lends transparency and structure to the prioritization and agenda setting process of the policy cycle and highlights the importance of allocating adequate resources in multi-year budgets if targets are to be met. IEEM can shed light on the need for complementary policies to reconcile lines of action that can make progress toward one SDG while inadvertently moving away from another SDG, as well as identify potential win-wins, where one line of action can make progress toward multiple SDGs simultaneously.

AB  - A growing number of countries is setting up natural capital accounts (NCA) based on the system of environmental-economic accounting (SEEA); however, actually using them for better policy making turns out to be complex. This paper synthesises lessons on the institutional mainstreaming of the SEEA and its use in improving policy decisions affecting natural capital. It draws on discussions held at two Policy Forums organised by the World Bank Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services program and the United Nations Statistical Division. Practical examples of how the SEEA helps to improve policy making are explored. Emerging from the Forums were ten principles for making NCA fit for policy. These principles promote a comprehensive NCA organisation, a purposeful use of accounts, trustworthy methods and institutionalisation of NCA mechanisms in government. To put these principles into practice, six strategies are outlined: (1) assure credibility of the accounts; (2) align supply and demand for NCA; (3) assure high level support for NCA; (4) encourage cooperation between institutions so NCA and policy are mutually constructive; (5) provide evidence that natural capital is economically important and; (6) assure policy-relevant communication of NCA results.

AB  - Sustainable development requires that natural resources be exploited optimally, especially in developing countries like Chile that depend heavily on the export of non-renewable resources (ex. 55% of Chilean exports are products of copper mining). Therefore, this paper estimates a corrected version of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Chile that accounts for the depreciation of natural capital, the environmental degradation due to the emission of atmospheric pollutants and the exploration expenses of copper mining during the period between the years 1995 and 2015. The results obtained show that, on average, GDP and mining GDP are overestimated by 11.34% and 98.04%, respectively. The high magnitude of the adjustment reflects the importance of incorporating the depreciation of natural resources and environmental degradation into the traditional indicators used to measure the country's economic activity, especially for those sectors that are based on the extraction of non-renewable resources and produce strong negative externalities.

AB  - This paper presents global research trends involving highly cited articles on ecosystem services from 1981 to 2017 based on a bibliometric analysis of such articles from the SCI-E and SSCI databases of the Web of Science. The analysis revealed that there were 132 highly cited articles, most of which were published between 2005 and 2014. Based on author keywords, the term ecosystem services was strongly linked to biodiversity. The top three journals in terms of total number of highly cited articles published were Ecological Economics, PNAS, and Ecological Indicators. Despite ranking sixth overall, Science ranked first in both impact factor and total citations per article. The US, UK, Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden were the top five most productive and cooperative countries in the world based on total number of highly cited articles and co-authorship network, respectively. The US was highly connected to Canada, the Netherlands, China and the UK. Stockholm University and Stanford University were the most productive institutions in Europe and North America, respectively. Stanford University is associated with many scholars in the field of ecosystem services research because of the InVEST model. Robert Costanza was the most prolific and highly cited author, the latter being largely due to the first valuation of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital, he and his co-authors published in 1997 in Nature. Terrestrial, urban, and forest ecosystems were the top types of ecosystems assessed. Regulating and provisioning services were the major ecosystem services studied. Quantitative and qualitative assessments were the main research focus. Most of these highly cited studies on ecosystem services are done on areas geographically located in North America and Europe.

AB  - Ethiopia has experienced a long-term deforestation with broad implications for human life and economic activities, but conventional frameworks of economic accounting are not able to assess the country's economic and environmental sustainability in the face of such deforestation problem. In this study, we attempt an economic accounting of Ethiopian forests based on a welfare-economic framework, which assesses changes in the value of forests as natural capital. Our estimates suggest that the recent government re-greening efforts are yet to increase forest assets in the value term, although they have expanded the land areas covered by trees in the country.

AB  - This paper shows the common developments performed by the Institute of Thermal Technology and the Research Centre for Energy Resources and Consumption regarding the assessment of natural resource degradation. Particularly, it shows the last model of the Szargut's Reference Environment, which was updated with new geological and geochemical information not available when it was originally developed. This R.E. allows for a more precise assessment of the chemical exergy of natural resources. The paper further shows the concept of the Exergy Replacement Costs (ERC) and the model of Thanatia, a theory that serves to assess the concentration exergy of mineral resources based on their scarcity degree in Nature. The combination of the ERC concept with the Thermo-Ecological Cost method (TEC), originally proposed by Szargut to assess products considering the exergy associated to the consumption of non-renewable resources extracted directly from Nature, gave birth to the TERC methodology, to better assess the degradation of the mineral capital.

AB  - This paper extends the analytical framework for measuring multifactor productivity in order to account for environmental services. A growth accounting approach is used to decompose a pollution-adjusted measure of output growth into the contributions of labour, produced capital and natural capital. These indicators allow the sources of economic growth, and its long run sustainability, to be better assessed. Results presented here cover OECD and G20 countries for the 1990-2013 period, and account for the extraction of subsoil natural assets and emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases. The main findings suggest that growth in OECD countries has been generated almost exclusively through productivity gains, while BRIICS countries have drawn largely on increased utilisation of factor inputs to generate additional growth. Regarding natural capital, in countries such as Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Chile, reliance on subsoil assets extraction has contributed to a significant share of income growth. Results also point to a shift towards more environmentally friendly production processes in many countries. In fact, most OECD countries have decreased their emissions over the last two decades, and these pollution abatement efforts result in an upward adjustment of their GDP growth rates, allowing for a more accurate assessment of their economic performance.

KW  - Information systems
AB  - The System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) is a framework integrating information from different sources with the aim of enabling better decision making by governments, business and others. Accounting allows a wide variety of data to be synthesised so that regular information and indicators are produced and can feed into decision-making processes. The accounting recognises that while there may be discrepancies between different data sources as well as data gaps, government and business must continually make decisions. Over time both the accounts and underlying data improves across the six dimensions of data quality relevance, accuracy, timeliness, accessibility, interpretability and coherence. In individual data sources the focus is mostly on accuracy (i.e. closeness of estimate to the real number) but accounting addresses all of the six dimensions and has particular strengths in timeliness, accessibility, interpretability and coherence providing data when it is needed in a consistent format. Using examples from high and low-income countries we describe how SEEA can improve information systems and data quality for decision making and distil lessons for the development of the European Shared Environmental Information System.

AB  - While recent experimental frameworks for national ecosystem service accounting have shown substantial progress, in our view some crucial methodological issues remain that deserve further consideration before setting final standards. In response to the landmark work of Obst et al. (Environ Resour Econ 64:1-23, 2016. doi: 10.1007/s10640-015-9921-1), we provide arguments with regard to the suitability of particular valuation approaches. Generally, we agree that respective valuation methods need to produce values that are consistent with national accounting standards such as representing exchange values. However, we disagree with their conclusions regarding specific valuation techniques. Firstly, the circumstance that methods used for estimating shadow prices can also be used to derive consumer surplus does not justify the general exclusion of all shadow pricing methods for valuation of ecosystem services for national accounts, especially for public ecosystem services. Secondly, that preference-based methods can also be used to assess welfare changes does not imply that cost-based methods are generally better suited for ecosystem accounting. To the contrary, we see an essential need for preference information in accounting contexts. Thirdly, that accounting standards use a written-down replacement cost approach, does not mean ecosystem accounting requires to employ a replacement cost approach. To the contrary, we argue that assessing ecosystem degradation through restoration costs would be in line with writing down depreciation, but we also point to its limits.

AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are limited in their ability to measure progress towards environmental sustainability especially at the city level. The aim of this paper is to provide insights into an integrated assessment of urban sustainability, with emphasis on the significance of the maintenance of natural capital stocks. The use of water and land as critical natural capital in Guiyang, a southeast city in China was investigated by bringing together the ecological footprint (EF), water footprint (WF) and corresponding capacity indicators into an improved three-dimensional (i3D) model. Results showed that Guiyang has long been operating in a state of overshoot due to shortage of annual natural capital flows and accumulated depletion of stocks. This is particularly true for land use, whose stocks maintained a relatively stable level of depletion between 2000 and 2014. As of 2014, an EF depth of 6.45 was accumulated. With respect to water use, a shift in the city's role from creditor to debtor was observed in 2004. Industrial use of natural capital has more than tripled over the past 15 years and replaced agriculture to be the main driver of water unsustainability. Overall, Guiyang's economic growth did not show signs of decoupling from the EF and WE. These findings highlight the need for effective policies that would help Guiyang reduce dependency on the use of critical natural capital. Finally, this paper provided an in-depth discussion of the methodological strengths and limitations of the i3D model and concluded that it is able to track the structural and characteristic dynamics of both flows and stocks while avoiding burden shifting across various components within single forms of natural capital from a strong sustainability perspective.

AB  - Conserving and managing global natural capital requires an understanding of the complexity of flows of ecosystem services across geographic boundaries. Failing to understand and to incorporate these flows into national and international ecosystem assessments leads to incomplete and potentially skewed conclusions, impairing society's ability to identify sustainable management and policy choices. In this paper, we synthesise existing knowledge and develop a conceptual framework for analysing interregional ecosystem service flows. We synthesise the types of such flows, the characteristics of sending and receiving socio-ecological systems, and the impacts of ecosystem service flows on interregional sustainability. Using four cases (trade of certified coffee, migration of northern pintails, flood protection in the Danube watershed, and information on giant pandas), we test the conceptual framework and show how an enhanced understanding of interregional telecouplings in socio-ecological systems can inform ecosystem service-based decision making and governance with respect to sustainability goals.

AB  - National ecosystem accounting is an emerging framework for measuring the links between ecosystems and human well-being for national planning. It directly addresses Sustainable Development Goal 15.9, in which countries have agreed to integrate ecosystem values into national planning. The community of practice for national ecosystem accounting includes not only the international and national researchers who develop such a framework, but also the national analysts who implement it and the decision makers who apply it. To foster convergence within this community on such a common measurement platform, it is first necessary to understand the issues of divergence of values and preferences among the diverse and international ethical perspectives, disciplines and roles involved.
   A cluster analysis of a survey of 131 expert stakeholders in national ecosystem accounting reveals agreement within this community on the need for broadening the scope, addressing multiple decision contexts and mainstreaming national ecosystem accounting in national planning. The most important sources of divergence in this community of practice are attributed to ethical positions regarding monetization of ecosystem services, differences in the interpretation of several core concepts, such as biodiversity and ecosystem services, and the role of spatial analysis.

AB  - Natural capital is usually presented as a recent concept, used for the first time in the 1970s, adopted in an important contribution by David Pearce in 1988, and widely used by ecological economists in the early 1990s. First employed to incorporate natural constraints into the economic lexicon, and to oblige economists to take the environment into account; the concept has also been used to include the environment in narrow economic valuations. To take a global view of these controversial uses, this paper reconsiders the genesis of natural capital as an economic concept, not in its present-day form, but from its almost unknown, ancient origins in the 1900s-1910s, in the writing of Alvin S. Johnson. The article first sheds light on this historical and theoretical.moment, and then shows how it can help interpret current controversies about natural capital. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The goal of the paper is to study approaches to the assessment of natural capital of forests, especially forest resources, and the prospects for modernization of forest management in the context of green economy. We show that current socio-economic development strategies in most countries encourage rapid accumulation of physical, financial and human capital through excessive depletion and degradation of natural capital, which includes natural resources and ecosystems. In order to prevent this threat, it is necessary to move to the concept of green economy that involves effective use of natural resources, ensuring the sustainability of natural ecosystems and reducing the use of resources in production and consumption. In this regard, we study indicators and methodological approaches used for measuring and assessing forest resources in the global and domestic practice. We reveal the shortcomings and limitations of their application, which are associated with the quantitative assessment of the state of forests, without taking into account qualitative and structural changes. On this basis, we develop our own original methodology for assessing forest resources and in the future - assessing their depletion on the basis of comparing the current state with the "reference" state. An important point in this technique is the account of fragmentation in the assessment of forest resources, implemented through the analysis of spatial distribution of the sections of raw materials bases. The results of our assessment confirm a significant depletion of forest resources throughout the Komi Republic. In order to restore and preserve them, we substantiate the combined use of three basic directions: forest management activities corresponding to the potential of reforestation; rehabilitation modernization of forest management, involving the organization of forest management in the form of recurrent cycle of selective cutting; and compensatory strategies of timber processing. The prospects for further research are related to the task of developing a model for the use of forest resources in the region, ensuring the sustainability of supply of timber processing industries with raw wood.

AB  - Natural capital involvement in the management decision-making process of business entities by reforming current accounting and reporting methodology is an environmental innovation because it forces the organization's management to use such business methods that reduce the negative impact on the environment and ensure rational use of natural resources. An important part of natural capital is mineral resources, the data on which nowadays is not reflected in the accounting and reporting of organizations-subsoil users, what determines the relevance of the research topic. The purpose of this study is theoretical substantiation and recommendations for the development of mineral resources accounting methods and improving the accounting (financial) statements forms of organizations-subsoil users in the context of the natural capital concept. Among the methods used in the study, the authors identify synthesis, analysis, comparison, logical generalization, the conclusion by analogy, classification, grouping, etc. As part of accounting and reporting system development in terms of data formation about mineral resources used, the article investigates the economic essence of the concepts "minerals", "mineral reserves", "mineral resources", and "mineral raw materials", and proves their identity/non-identity. A three-dimensional classification has been developed in order to identify mineral resources from which economic benefits are expected. It has been proved that mineral resources can be an object of accounting since it is established that all criteria for recognition as an asset are fulfilled simultaneously in their relation. For accounting of natural capital use and organization's activities indicators connection, the article proposes a new dual model of accounting and reflection in accounting (financial) statements of mineral resources, which allows to present information on natural capital to interested users in two aspects: the cost of attracting mineral resources and economic potential of used mineral resources, which will eliminate the distortion of the information provided and provide information basis for relevant areas of analysis. Also, within the framework of the justified need for mineral resources accounting, the authors developed the recommendations for improving the content of accounting (financial) reporting forms of organizations-subsoil users, providing information about the organization's natural capital used and its depletion, which increases the information value of reporting, its forecast characteristics and takes on particular importance when making management decisions in the field of rational subsoil use.

AB  - Valuation of the ecosystem services of South Africa is useful for many reasons, including: 1) providing an evidence based justification for investment in ecological infrastructure by both public and private entities, 2) informing resource allocation decisions with respect to the protection, restoration, and preservation of ecosystem functioning, and 3) enhancing public appreciation for the value of nature and our societal dependence upon natural capital. We present national assessments of ecosystem services values (ESV) based on a combination of approaches. We explore assessments that are derived from global datasets (similar to 1 km) and finer resolution national datasets (similar to 30 m). The global product is classified into 11 biomes in South Africa and the finer resolution data into 35 land cover classes. We apply ecosystem service values from the TEEB database to the respective datasets via benefits transfer methodology to both spatial resolutions. We estimate the change in ESV that has taken place in South Africa over 24 years using the 30 m data set. Our initial estimates of the total value of ecosystem services in South Africa from the global data set were $(US) 497 billion/year (1 km resolution 2014 data). The findings from the finer resolution data were $675 billion/year (1990 data), and $610 billion/year (2014 data). This, most recent (2014) estimate of total ESV is roughly 1.5 times larger than South Africa's GDP ($350 billion in 2014).

AB  - We used locally-sourced and other relevant information to value ecosystem services provided by South Africa's terrestrial, freshwater and estuarine habitats. Our preliminary estimates suggest that these are worth at least R275 billion per annum to South Africans. Notwithstanding benefits to the rest of the world, natural systems provide a major source of direct income to poor households, and generate significant value in the economy through tourism and property markets, as well as providing considerable non-market benefits. Higher values correspond both to areas of higher biomass, which have higher capacity to supply ecosystem services, and areas of higher population densities, which generate demand as well as threats. The value of regulating services is higher for natural systems closer to population centres. Amenity values are highest in cities and protected areas, with the fragmented green open space areas within cities have among the highest values per ha. Even if the gaps are taken into account, our estimates are far lower than estimates based on average global values, but are likely to be more accurate, relevant and tractable to policymakers. Nevertheless, some services have large global values, the recognition of which is important in developing strategies for financing biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Mapping ecosystem services (ES) increases the awareness of natural capital value, leading to building sustainability into decision-making processes. Recently, many techniques to assess the value of ES delivered by different scenarios of land use/land cover (LULC) are available, thus becoming important practices in mapping to support the land use planning process. The spatial analysis of the biophysical ES distribution allows a better comprehension of the environmental and social implications of planning, especially when ES concerns the management of risk (e.g., erosion, pollution). This paper investigates the nutrient retention model of InVEST software through its spatial distribution and its quantitative value. The model was analyzed by testing its response to changes in input parameters: (1) the digital terrain elevation model (DEM); and (2) different LULC attribute configurations. The paper increases the level of attention to specific ES models that use water runoff as a proxy of nutrient delivery. It shows that the spatial distribution of biophysical values is highly influenced by many factors, among which the characteristics of the DEM and its interaction with LULC are included. The results seem to confirm that the biophysical value of ES is still affected by a high degree of uncertainty and encourage an expert field campaign as the only solution to use ES mapping for a regulative land use framework.

Failure to recognise the complexity of interactions across ecosystem service provision can risk the loss of other key environmental and socioeconomic benefits from the natural capital of catchment systems. In particular, the ability of soil and water to meet human needs is undermined by uncertainties around climate change effects, ecosystem service interactions and conflicting stakeholder interests across catchments. This critical review draws from an extensive literature to discuss the benefits and challenges of utilising an ecosystem service approach for integrated catchment management (ICM). State-of-the-art research on ecosystem service assessment, mapping and participatory approaches is evaluated and a roadmap of the key short-and longer-term research needs for maximising landscape-scale ecosystem service provision from catchments is proposed.

AB  - There is growing demand for information regarding the impacts of decisions on ecosystem services and human benefits. Despite the large and growing quantity of published ecosystem services research, there remains a substantial gap between this research and the information required to support decisions. Research often provides models and tools that do not fully link social and ecological systems; are too complex, specialized, and costly to use; and are targeted to outcomes that differ from those needed by decision makers. Decision makers require cost-effective, straightforward, transferable, scalable, meaningful, and defensible methods that can be readily understood. We provide illustrative examples of these gaps between research and practice and describe how researchers can make their work relevant to decision makers by using Benefit Relevant Indicators ( BRIs) and choosing models appropriate for particular decision contexts. We use examples primarily from the United States, including cases that illustrate varying degrees of success in closing these gaps. We include a discussion of the challenges and opportunities researchers face in adapting their work to meet the needs of practitioners. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The transition of the ecosystem service framework from academic discourse into practical land use management and policy guidance is in the making. Planners and decision makers seek spatial valuation data, comprehensive examples of which are few or hindered by sectoral research traditions. We present a case of linking land use to multimethod spatial ecosystem service valuation aiming at comprehensiveness and commensurability, based on a project run parallel to regional land-use planning in the Tampere region, Finland. A spectrum of ecosystem services was scrutinized, the annual value of which was estimated at ?0.8-lB. Compared to land-use planning, core areas of ecological networks proved relatively poor in terms of valuation, but hot-spots of human-nature interaction such as recreational, groundwater and landscape areas immensely valuable. Strong urban-rural trends in ecosystem service value were found, emphasizing the importance of urban nature and the context-specificity of natural capital discourse. We argue that some mismatches exist between the ecosystem service framework and its practical applicability, and that the main problem is not necessarily the transferability of tools and indicators, but the transfer of valuation and the assumptions and choices behind it. Notwithstanding its problems, the applied framework proved valuable in evaluating and guiding future land use.

AB  - Resource efficiency in wastewater treatment (WWT) is widely needed, not least in developing areas. Natural, less capital intensive processes in wastewater purification may offer developing economies an alternative to traditional biological processes. In this paper, we compare a constructed wetland (CW) based wastewater treatment plant to an activated sludge process (ASP) in Matamoros, Mexico. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are calculated using life cycle assessment (LCA) and an economic viability assessment is carried out. Based on a literature review, both treatment methods are considered to produce sufficient treatment efficiency.
   Water hyacinth was chosen as the aquatic plant in the CW due to its fast growth rate and the possibility of using it in anaerobic digestion (AD) to produce energy and fertiliser for agricultural land. In our calculations, the biogas produced from the water hyacinth biomass is the decisive factor when the two methods are compared. Direct GHG emissions from both methods are of the same order and are dominated by the GHG releases from the purification phase. However, if the water hyacinth can be used for energy production, the CW-based WWT not only fares better in economic terms, but also produces significant net climate benefits. Both methods studied have their downsides, increasing the need for risk evaluation. Although water hyacinth's fast growth rate is a crucial factor in the analysis, careful management is needed when cultivating the plant, as it has led to serious problems due to uncontrollable spreading. Furthermore, environmental and health risks must be identified and managed properly if wastewater derived digestate is to be used on arable land, as assumed in the analysis. Additionally, N2O leakages from the ASP and CH4 and N2O releases from the CW must be studied further to obtain reliable values for future analyses. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study proposes a novel regional sustainability assessment framework for integrated coastal zone management (ICZM). Various ICZM indicators have been developed, but their management insights are not always clear. Our framework integrates three separately developed approaches with an explicit reflection of stakeholders' values: Satoumi (a Japanese concept of socio-ecological production landscapes, SEPLs), ecosystem services approach (ESA), and inclusive wealth (IW). We suggest that the integration of Satoumi, a uniquely Japanese concept, with the ESA and IW complements each other and increases the effectiveness of all three approaches when applied to ICZM and decision making. Satoumi describes the desired state of a coastal zone. The ESA translates Satoumi into IW and helps explain which changes to ecosystems contribute to the asset quality (i.e., shadow prices). As a sustainability indicator, IW differs from other ecological indicators because it comprises human, natural, and manufactured capital assets and incorporates shadow prices to weigh the contribution of each asset to the present value of social welfare. Shadow prices may capture the quality of capital assets in terms of how much people value them, and can therefore be a direct management target for realizing a desired coastal zone. We propose adding two sustainability criteria, desired state and strong sustainability, to the original IW to make it operational. The framework was tested in Japan's Seto Inland Sea, and the results were analyzed in depth. Based on the outcomes, we discuss the insights for ICZM and future research. While Satoumi is a Japanese concept, the framework could be applied to other countries where similar SEPLs exist. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article shares the experiences, observations, and discussions that occurred during the completing of an ecosystem services (ES) indicator framework to be used at European Union (EU) and Member States' level. The experience base was drawn from 3 European research projects and 14 associated case study sites that include 13 transitional-water bodies (specifically 8 coastal lagoons, 4 riverine estuaries, and 1 fjord) and 1 coastal-water ecosystem. The ES pertinent to each case study site were identified along with indicators of these ES and data sources that could be used for mapping. During the process, several questions and uncertainties arose, followed by discussion, leading to these main lessons learned: 1) ES identification: Some ES that do not seem important at the European scale emerge as relevant at regional or local scales; 2) ES indicators: When direct indicators are not available, proxies for indicators (indirect indicators) might be used, including combined data on monitoring requirements imposed by EU legislation and international agreements; 3) ES mapping: Boundaries and appropriate data spatial resolution must be established because ES can be mapped at different temporal and spatial scales. We also acknowledge that mapping and assessment of ES supports the dialogue between human well-being and ecological status. From an evidence-based marine planning-process point of view, mapping and assessment of marine ES are of paramount importance to sustainable use of marine natural capital and to halt the loss of marine biodiversity.

AB  - 1. Anthropogenic pressures, including climate change, are causing nonlinear changes in ecosystems globally. The development of reliable early warning indicators (EWIs) to predict these changes is vital for the adaptive management of ecosystems and the protection of biodiversity, natural capital and ecosystem services. Increased variance and autocorrelation are potential early warning indicators and can be readily estimated from ecological time series. Here, we undertook a comprehensive test of the consistency between early warning indicators and nonlinear abundance change across species, trophic levels and ecosystem types.
   2. We tested whether long-term abundance time series of 55 taxa (126 data sets) across multiple trophic levels in marine and freshwater ecosystems showed (i) significant nonlinear change in abundance 'turning points' and (ii) significant increases in variance and autocorrelation ('early warning indicators'). For each data set, we then quantified the prevalence of three cases: true positives (early warning indicators and associated turning point), false negatives (turning point but no associated early warning indicators) and false positives (early warning indicators but no turning point).
   3. True positives were rare, representing only 9% (16 of 170) of cases using variance, and 13% (19 of 152) of cases using autocorrelation. False positives were more prevalent than false negatives (53% vs. 38% for variance; 47% vs. 40% for autocorrelation). False results were found in every decade and across all trophic levels and ecosystems.
   4. Time series that contained true positives were uncommon (8% for variance; 6% for autocorrelation), with all but one time series also containing false classifications. Coherence between the types of early warning indicators was generally low with 43% of time series categorized differently based on variance compared to autocorrelation.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Conservation management requires effective early warnings of ecosystem change using readily available data, and variance and autocorrelation in abundance data have been suggested as candidates. However, our study shows that they consistently fail to predict nonlinear change. For early warning indicators to be effective tools for preventative management of ecosystem change, we recommend that multivariate approaches of a suite of potential indicators are adopted, incorporating analyses of anthropogenic drivers and process-based understanding.

AB  - 1. Essential Biodiversity Variable, Natural Capital, Biodiversity Indicator and Ecosystem Service are four concepts that underpin the most popular frameworks currently considered for helping to coordinate and structure biodiversitymonitoring efforts worldwide. Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS) has considerable potential to inform these initiatives. To date, however, discussions on the role of SRS in supporting these frameworks have mostly evolved independently; tend to be led by different groups; sometimes target slightly different scales; and are likely to reach different audiences. Because of this, there is some confusion among environmental managers and policymakers as to what the potential of SRS is or whether there is prospect in considering and promoting the use of satellite data for biodiversity conservation. 2. Here, we provide a brief overview of the role of SRS to date in informing these frameworks. Through a case study focused on the Sahara Desert ecosystem, we also demonstrate the current potential for SRS-based methodologies to support conservation in data-deficient areas and discuss the relative applicability of SRS-based metrics to each of these frameworks. 3. The relevance and use of SRS across the four frameworks are clearly variable, due to differences and ambiguity in definitions, and due to differences in monitoring priorities. Our case study illustrates the particularly high potential for SRS approaches to provide key information relevant to the Biodiversity Indicators framework in desert ecosystems; it also identifies SRS-based metrics relevant to all frameworks. 4. Altogether, this work highlights how more dialogue is required within the biodiversity-monitoring community for SRS to reach its full potential in conservation. In particular, agreement on what is needed in priority, given the realm of what is possible, will be of paramount importance to developing SRS-based products that are used by policymakers and international conventions.

AB  - New infrastructure is needed globally to support economic development and improve human well-being. Investments that do not consider ecosystem services (ES) can eliminate these important societal benefits from nature, undermining the development benefits infrastructure is intended to provide. Such tradeoffs are acknowledged conceptually but in practice have rarely been considered in infrastructure planning. Taking road investments as one important case, here we examine where and what forms of ES information have the potential to meaningfully influence decisions by multilateral development banks (MDBs). Across the stages of a typical road development process, we identify where and how ES information could be integrated, likely barriers to the use of available ES information, and key opportunities to shift incentives and thereby practice. We believe inclusion of ES information is likely to provide the greatest development benefit in early stages of infrastructure decisions. Those strategic planning stages are typically guided by in-country processes, with MDBs playing a supporting role, making it critical to express the ES consequences of infrastructure development using metrics relevant to government decision makers. This approach requires additional evidence of the in-country benefits of cross-sector strategic planning and more tools to lower barriers to quantifying these benefits and facilitating ES inclusion.

AB  - For decades, many Australian coastal communities have been changing, in varying degrees, from traditional "fishing towns" to "mining", "tourism", or "retirement" towns. However, environmental changes, such as climate change, have increased the vulnerability of these communities and their capacity to continue to successfully adapt is unknown. A framework for the assessment of socio-ecological vulnerability is used to provide information on the response to change in Geraldton, Western Australia. Geraldton has traditionally been a port and fishing town and has recently become a hub for the expanding mining industry. An innovative historical assessment of adaptive capacity using sustainable livelihoods analysis with indicators of social, economic, human, financial, physical, and natural capital is used to calculate socio-ecological vulnerability over time. The framework integrates adaptive capacity with environmental change, resource dependence, and the socio-economic importance of the fished species during four census years: 1921, 1954, 1981, and 2011. The earlier years are characterized by high adaptive capacity and low socio-ecological vulnerability in keeping with strong economic growth and low unemployment rates following the First and Second World Wars. The years 1981 and 2011 showed markedly higher socio-ecological vulnerability and lower adaptive capacities. This result was due to progressively greater exposure to climate change and the high socio-economic importance of fished species, as well as relatively poor physical, social, and natural capital. With continuing environmental and economic change, the fishing industry and the broader Geraldton population is likely to become increasingly vulnerable. Proactive rather than passive adaptation may speed the recovery and reduce a decline in the fishing industry and local economies. The paper briefly discusses potential adaptation in Geraldton which may be useful as a guideline for other coastal communities.

AB  - An ecological economics perspective on urban sustainability embraces a biophysical view which emphasizes the dependence of cities on vast quantities of natural capital from various sources and spatial scales, and the generation of urban wastes which impact the local, regional and global systems. In recent years, several sets of urban sustainability indicators and indices have been developed. However, only a few consider the complex multi-scale interactions between the urban activities and the environment. Furthermore, most existing indices use a relative evaluation approach instead of an absolute approach that is needed when dealing with ecological thresholds. The paper introduces a new urban biophysical sustainability index whose framework includes: the city environmental quality, use of natural resources, and GHG emissions. Each contains topics for assessment related to local, regional and global scales and associated indicators. Standard and optimum values were determined for each indicator and a formula is provided for grading each indicator measurement. The integration of those grades allows for generation of a compound score of each topic, category, spatial scale and the entire urban biophysical sustainability performance. It then demonstrates the index in three major Israeli cities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - To date, Unit Emergy Values (UEVs) for crustal minerals (e.g. limestone, iron ore, etc.) have lacked thermodynamic basis and suffer from overly vague generalization (relative to most other, more certain emergy indicators). We assume a steady state crustal cycle that embodies the various forms of exergy supporting Earth system cycles. The UEV of average crust is 1.75E + 09 solar emergy joules per gram (specific emergy). The ratio of crustal specific emergy to a mineral's exergy density (exergy per mass) is the mineral's transformity. This is an important assertion as it is the dissipation of exergy which hierarchically organizes materials. Emergy accounting should be able to express every resource either a transformity or specific emergy, linked by exergy density; crustal minerals are no exception.
   Mineral transformity can be characterized using either chemical exergy or Gibb's formation energy. Both calculations use the same mixing term which depends on average crustal abundance of the mineral. Also it's possible to account mineral emergy using either total free energy (or total chemical exergy) or by accounting only the mixing exergy. Four herein proposed methods yield a wide range of specific emergies for each of the prominent mineral/metal inputs to economies. We conclude that the exergy of concentration (mixing exergy) best represents that which is destroyed in mining/extraction activities and that using Gibb's transformities better suit the emergy method due to chemical exergies being positive or negative depending on the mineral. The emergy accounting of minerals should utilize Gibb's transformities and account only the emergy of a mineral's mixing exergy because this represents the natural capital that is irrevocably destroyed in mineral harvesting.

AB  - Earth's life-support systems are in rapid decline, yet we have few metrics or indicators with which to track these changes. The world's governments are calling for biodiversity and ecosystem-service monitoring to guide and evaluate international conservation policy as well as to incorporate natural capital into their national accounts. The Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON) has been tasked with setting up this monitoring system. Here we explore the immediate feasibility of creating a global ecosystem-service monitoring platform under the GEO BON framework through combining data from national statistics, global vegetation models, and production function models. We found that nine ecosystem services could be annually reported at a national scale in the short term: carbon sequestration, water supply for hydropower, and non-fisheries marine products, crop, livestock, game meat, fisheries, mariculture, and timber production. Reported changes in service delivery over time reflected ecological shocks (e.g., droughts and disease outbreaks), highlighting the immediate utility of this monitoring system. Our work also identified three opportunities for creating a more comprehensive monitoring system. First, investing in input data for ecological process models (e.g., global land-use maps) would allow many more regulating services to be monitored. Currently, only 1 of 9 services that can be reported is a regulating service. Second, household surveys and censuses could help evaluate how nature affects people and provides non-monetary benefits. Finally, to forecast the sustainability of service delivery, research efforts could focus on calculating the total remaining biophysical stocks of provisioning services. Regardless, we demonstrated that a preliminary ecosystem-service monitoring platform is immediately feasible. With sufficient international investment, the platform could evolve further into a much-needed system to track changes in our planet's life-support systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Despite much rhetoric about the 'greening business' agenda and various initiatives to promote the valuation or ecosystem services and natural capital, the corporate sector has been slow to integrate social and environmental factors into core business models and to extend this integration across their supply chain. Our effort to narrow this thematic and methodological gap focuses on the co-benefits and positive externalities that can be generated through progressive knowledge exchange between a corporation and its suppliers. Using a case study of contract farming of malting barley in water scarce Rajasthan (India), we examine the extent to which best practice agronomic advice given by corporate farm extension workers can help small scale farmers (suppliers) to increase income, improve resource efficiency (water, fertiliser, energy) and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. findings from our desk study suggest positive results for all these variables, when compared to the regional benchmark of non-participating farmers. Under a scenario where advice is provided on all major crops (not just barley), we find a significant further increase of farm income. Our valuation of the reduced exploitation of ground water (alone) exceeds the advisors' annual salaries, suggesting that under full social and environmental accounting, the extension services are not a cost factor, but a profit making unit of the company. We discuss of our findings in relation to alternative approaches to PES and alternative investment strategies in green technologies. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As of 2010, more than half of the global population resides in urban areas and relies to some extent on the functions, services and natural capital provided by urban soils. Greater extremes in climate predicted for the coming decades will impact on these urban soil functions to varying degrees. We provide an inventory of urban soil functions based on an extension to the typology of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (i.e. we added a carrying function' to those of supporting, regulating, provisioning and cultural functions) and review the climate drivers that are likely to have the most significant impacts upon them, using urban soils of England as an exemplar. We identify knowledge gaps, as in areas such as carbon cycling and storage, disease regulation and cultural services. We assess adaptation measures, which may ameliorate these potential, climate-change-related impacts including changes in construction practices, developments in green architecture and development proposals under the planning regime. We discuss the lack of policies relating to urban soils and the problem associated with monitoring their functions, as is often the case, when large quantities of soil are removed and replaced, leading to major transformation of soil properties, which may be unrelated to pedogenic processes.

AB  - Human activity has growing impacts on the natural capital humans depend on for existence. While many of these impacts are regional, national, or international in scope, it is increasingly evident that decisions made at the local community level are also important. Yet, understanding the impacts of local decisions, as well as how to correct or mitigate these impacts, can be problematic, as communities differ in resources, priorities, dependencies on natural capital, and even opinions about whether these impacts actually affect quality of life. Every community has unique characteristics, however effective decision support at the community level requires common reference points in measures of human well-being upon which to base decision support. We have developed a community classification system that is intended to find such common ground in community characteristics and tie these common elements to measures of human well-being. This community classification system was developed in the USA with publically available data on resource dependence, socio-economic composition, and existence of natural capital. The resulting classification was applied to coastal communities at the county level and then used to predict human well-being based on an existing human well-being index. Coastal communities were separated into eight characteristics groups based on Bayesian cluster analysis. Classification groups were found to be associated with significant differences in human well-being. More importantly, significant differences in specific elements of well-being were associated with key community characteristics, such as population density and economic dependence on local natural resources. In particular, social cohesion and the leisure time were strong elements of well-being in low density communities with high natural resource dependence but this association weakened as population densities and economically diversity increased. These sorts of commonalities in community type that can be tied to differences in human well-being are important because they provide clear ties to environmental service flows, as well as a meaningful reference point from which to measure the local impacts of decisions as changes in community-specific human well-being.

AB  - Since the presentation of its international reports at the 2010 Convention on Biological Diversity Conference of Parties, TEEB (The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity) an international multistakeholder initiative has been taken up in a number of countries to initiate TEEB Country Studies (TCSs). Their common aim is to take stock of natural capital, to reveal its social and economic values and to provide a basis for policy making that fosters sustainable use of ecosystem services. Depending on national circumstances and needs, TCSs differ substantially in terms of scope, ecosystem services, stakeholder involvement, sectors and policies considered etc. Key challenges faced in implementation include policy relevance, and a number of technical, methodological and conceptual issues. Integrating TEEB into existing and emerging national to local development strategies can provide substantial synergies, and linking TCSs with international or regional ecosystem initiatives and policies may add further value to advance methodological and policy issues related to ecosystems and biocliversity. Factors and interactions are depicted in a framework for TEEB implementation at country level. With a view at its pathway, we conclude that TEEB developed from an international study to a demand driven process which supports policy development and implementation at various levels.

AB  - Progress in ecosystem service science has been rapid, and there is now a healthy appetite among key public and private sector decision makers for this science. However, changing policy and management is a long-term project, one that raises a number of specific practical challenges. One impediment to broad adoption of ecosystem service information is the lack of standards that define terminology, acceptable data and methods, and reporting requirements. Ecosystem service standards should be tailored to specific use contexts, such as national income and wealth accounts, corporate sustainability reporting, land-use planning, and environmental impact assessments. Many standard-setting organizations already exist, and the research community will make the most headway toward rapid uptake of ecosystem service science by working directly with these organizations. Progress has been made in aligning with existing organizations in areas such as product certification and sustainability reporting, but a major challenge remains in mainstreaming ecosystem service information into core public and private use contexts, such as agricultural and energy subsidy design, national income accounts, and corporate accounts.

AB  - Decisionmakers need updated, scientifically sound and relevant information to implement appropriate policy measures and make innovative commitments to halt biodiversity loss and improve human well-being. Here, we present a recent science-based synthesis on the biodiversity and ecosystem services of Mexico, intended to be a tool for policymakers. We describe the methodological approach used to undertake such an assessment and highlight the major findings. Organized into five volumes and originally written in Spanish (Capital Natural de Mexico), it summarizes the available knowledge on the components, structure, and functioning of the biodiversity of Mexico; the threats and trajectories of anthropogenic impact, together with its conservation status; and the policies, institutions, and instruments available for its sustainable management. We stress the lessons learned that can be useful for similar exercises in other megadiverse developing countries and identify major gaps and strategic actions to conserve the natural capital in light of the challenges of the Anthropocene.

AB  - The Costa Rican Program of Payments for Environmental Services (PPES) is a global pioneering financing policy mechanism for the promotion of forest protection and expansion. This program currently transfers a significant amount of money to indigenous territories; however, its performance has not been comprehensively evaluated. In this study we assessed for the first time in a comprehensive manner the performance of this national program in an indigenous territory. We created and validated, with the aid of a panel of experts, an evaluation instrument that contains social, economic, and environmental criteria and indicators. After applying the instrument in the Talamanca-Cabecar indigenous territory (TCIT), the PPES obtained 48.7 percent, accomplishing significant results in aspects framed within the goals of sustainable development. We found that the TOT allocates most of the payment money into capacity building, which has resulted in substantive improvements in their negotiation, management, and leadership skills; this in turn helps to attract investments from other public and private entities, protecting and promoting its natural capital. As similar programs are adopted in multiple countries based on the Costa Rican example, this study provides an important methodological contribution to enlighten future environmental and socioeconomic financing policies aiming to support indigenous territories.

AB  - Energy flows through economies in a hierarchical pattern with vast amounts supporting the base while each step has less and less flowing through it. Money is inextricably connected to many of these energy flows in a countercurrent. At the most aggregated scale of an economy, where its gross domestic product is measured, the mean ratio between the flows of solar emergy and money is known as the emergy-to-dollar ratio (EDR). However, the relationship between solar emergy and money is not constant along the energy hierarchy of an economy. While estimates of this dynamic relationship exist for marketed goods and services, there has been less work to estimate the relationship for nonmarketed services. We develop the "eco-price" to meet the goal of better predicting correlation between environmentally derived services and currency. It is defined as the flow of emergy of an ecosystem service relative to the money estimated to flow as a countercurrent. Twenty-nine eco-prices were estimated from cases of known exchange for water, soil, air pollution and natural resource commodities. The eco-price reconciles the biophysical value of the environment with economic value and extends the capability of emergy analysis to suggest "marketable" monetary values for the work of the environment.

AB  - Accounting information is a core element of economic decision-making at both national and corporate levels. It is widely accepted that much economic activity is dependent upon natural capital and natural resources-generically termed environmental assets in an accounting context. Environmental assets are under threat of depletion and degradation from economic activity. Consequently, the incorporation of information on environmental assets into standard accounting frameworks is an essential element in mainstreaming environmental information and broadening the evidence base for economic decisions and the assessment of sustainability. This paper describes the treatment of environmental assets within the national economic accounts and summarizes recent developments that extend the accounting approaches as described in the United Nations' System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA). The potential for implementation of accounting standards for environmental assets is shown through a description of work in Australia on environmental-economic accounting.

AB  - Since the publication of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment in 2005 there has been a surge of interest in ecological restoration (ER) to recover biodiversity, re-establish ecosystem functioning and connectivity, and reactivate the delivery of ecosystem services. In policy spheres, there have also been repeated calls for expansion of restoration efforts. In many countries, new legislation now requires some form of restoration and/or a form of offset investment. All of this will require major increases in financial allocations toward restoration science, technology, and implementation, and much more detailed valuation techniques. The economics of restoration is a new field emerging to support these needs. Our paper here starts with an analysis of the articles and reviews published on this broad subject from 1928 to 2012, as captured in the Scopus academic search platform. Our goal is to present and summarize what has been said and done in this area to date. Next, we map out one possible way forward, illustrated by examples and based on a coherent bundle of decision parameters related to the economics of ER and, more broadly, to the restoration of natural capital. The restoration of natural capital is defined as activities that integrate investment in, and replenishment of, natural capital stocks to improve the flows of ecosystem goods and services, and the preservation of biodiversity, while enhancing all aspects of human well-being. We give special attention to system dynamic approaches and other promising tools and techniques.

AB  - Natural capital (NC) is crucial to human existence and human well-being. Evaluating ecosystem services on a regional scale has presented tremendous theoretical, methodological and policy challenges. This study addresses the challenges by developing an interdisciplinary methodology, based on expert knowledge, and by focusing on the Yangtze River Delta of China. It evaluates the stock of NC, analyzes the characteristics of, and identifies the key drivers for, spatial and temporal change in NC in the deltaic region from 2000 to 2010. A main contribution is the novel incorporation of remote sensing data that explains the dynamics of the spatio-temporal change in land use and a set of ecosystem service indicators derived from it The study focuses on key indicators for key ecosystem services related to carbon sequestration, grain production and water supply. The indictors reflect the spatial heterogeneity of NC across diverse ecosystems in the region. Each indicator builds on land use configuration and land use composition information derived from 250 m 16-day MODE and Landsat TM remote sensing data for 2000 and 2010, with adjustment parameters being constructed. The regional evaluation shows an overall degradation of ecosystem services, reducing total NC by 10.4% (or 8.44 billion yuan) in 2000-2010. The spatial distribution of NC exhibits a declining pattern from the south to the north of the delta. At the city level, 15 out of 16 major cities in the region have experienced dramatic loss of NC, and this pattern is significantly correlated with rapid urbanization, population growth and industrialization. Land use/land cover change and deteriorating water quality are dominant factors causing NC depletion, while increased grain productivity and environmental policies help offset the NC losses. Outcomes of this research are useful to policy makers to mitigate the declines in NC through balancing the growth between economy and population. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - As one of the most important metropolitan areas in China, Xi'an City plays a leading role in the development of the western regions. To impede the decision and policy preferences for environmental and ecological factors, this paper took account of the natural capital depletion of Xi'an City during 1995-2011, considered in terms of constant 1990 price levels. The results are as follows. (1) Natural capital depletion in Xi'an City consistently increased from1995 to 2011, increasing from 14.31x10(8) yuan to 42.28x10(8) yuan, with an average annual growth rate of 12.22%. The primary component of natural capital depletion in Xi'an City was the cost associated with fossil fuel resource depletion, while the cost associated with ecological services contributed the least to the total cost. (2) During 1995-2011, the proportion of natural capital depletion to Xi'an City in Yanta and Lianhu districts dropped, whereas in counties such as Gaoling County, Chang'an District and Lintong District, it increased. In 2011, the proportion of natural capital depletion varied between the different counties: Yanta District (15.75%), Weiyang District and Lianhu District (10%-15%), Huxian County, Xincheng District, Beiling District, Chang'an District, Baqiao District, and Gaoling County (5%-10%), and in Lintong District, Lantian County, Zhouzhi County and Yanliang District, it was <5%. (3) The spatial pattern of natural capital depletion varied with different perspectives, for example, from a total value perspective, a nuclear pattern around the administrative center of Xi'an City was evident, whereas from a density per capita of natural capital depletion perspective, a bi-nuclear spatial distribution visible in 1995 had become a poly-nuclear distribution by 2011. Conversely, from a density per hectare perspective, a "core-edge" pattern characterized by three circles was observed. (4) The natural capital depletion relative to GDP curve was in accordance with the environmental Kuznets curve, while the proportion of natural capital depletion to GDP was the highest in circle III and the lowest in circle I.

AB  - It is commonly recognized that there are constraints to successful regional-scale assessment and monitoring of cumulative impacts because of challenges in the selection of coherent and measurable indicators of the effects. It has also been sensibly declared that the connections between components in a region are as important as the state of the elements themselves. These have previously been termed "linked" cumulative impacts/effects. These connections can be difficult to discern because of a complicated set of interactions and unexpected linkages. In this paper we diagnose that a significant cause of these constraints is the selection of indicators without due regard for their inter-relationships in the formulation of the indicator set. The paper examines whether the common "forms of capital", i.e., natural (renewable and non-renewable), manufactured, social, human and financial capitals, framework is a potential organizing structure. We examine a large region in western NSW Australia where the predominant production systems are mining and grazing for production of wool, beef and lamb. Production in both is driven by consumption of a non-renewable resource, i.e., ore for mining and topsoil for grazing, the latter on the basis that loss rate estimates far exceed soil formation rates. We propose that the challenge of identifying connections of components within and between capital stores can be approached by explicitly separating stores of capital and the flows of capital between stores and between elements within stores, so-called capital fluxes. We attempt to acquire data from public sources for both capital stores and fluxes. The question of whether these data are a sufficient base for regional assessment, with particular reference to connections, is discussed. The well-described challenge of a comparative common currency for stores and fluxes is also discussed. We conclude that the data acquisition is relatively successful for stores and fluxes. A number of linked impacts are identified and discussed. The potential use of money as the common currency for stores and fluxes of capital is considered. The basic proposition is that replacement or preservation costs be used for this. We conclude that the study is sufficiently positive to consider further research in fully-coupled models of capital stores and fluxes. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - lIn this paper we propose an ecosystem service framework to support integrated water resource management and apply it to the Murray-Darling Basin in Australia. Water resources in the Murray-Darling Basin have been over-allocated for irrigation use with the consequent degradation of freshwater ecosystems. In line with integrated water resource management principles, Australian Government reforms are reducing the amount of water diverted for irrigation to improve ecosystem health. However, limited understanding of the broader benefits and trade-offs associated with reducing irrigation diversions has hampered the planning process supporting this reform. Ecosystem services offer an integrative framework to identify the broader benefits associated with integrated water resource management in the Murray-Darling Basin, thereby providing support for the Government to reform decision-making. We conducted a multi-criteria decision analysis for ranking regional potentials to provide ecosystem services at river basin scale. We surveyed the wider public about their understanding of, and priorities for, managing ecosystem services and then integrated the results with spatially explicit indicators of ecosystem service provision. The preliminary results of this work identified the sub-catchments with the greatest potential synergies and trade-offs of ecosystem service provision under the integrated water resources management reform process. With future development, our framework could be used as a decision support tool by those grappling with the challenge of the sustainable allocation of water between irrigation and the environment.

AB  - Climate change alters the functions of ecological systems. As a result, the provision of ecosystem services and the well-being of people that rely on these services are being modified. Climate models portend continued warming and more frequent extreme weather events across the US. Such weather-related disturbances will place a premium on the ecosystem services that people rely on. We discuss some of the observed and anticipated impacts of climate change on ecosystem service provision and livelihoods in the US. We also highlight promising adaptive measures. The challenge will be choosing which adaptive strategies to implement, given limited resources and time. We suggest using dynamic balance sheets or accounts of natural capital and natural assets to prioritize and evaluate national and regional adaptation strategies that involve ecosystem services.

AB  - In spite of an increasing interest in environmental economic accounting, there is still very limited experience with the integration of ecosystem services and ecosystem capital in national accounts. This paper identifies four key methodological challenges in developing ecosystem accounts: the definition of ecosystem services in the context of accounting, their allocation to institutional sectors; the treatment of degradation and rehabilitation, and valuing ecosystem services consistent with SNA principles. We analyze the different perspectives taken on these challenges and present a number of proposals to deal with the challenges in developing ecosystem accounts. These proposals comprise several novel aspects, including (i) presenting an accounting approach that recognizes that most ecosystems are strongly influenced by people and that ecosystem services depend on natural processes as well as human ecosystem management; and, (ii) recording ecosystem services as either contributions of a private land owner or as generated by a sector 'Ecosystems' depending on the type of ecosystem service. We also present a consistent approach for recording degradation, and for applying monetary valuation approaches in the context of accounting. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - As reflected in the ecosystem approach, conservation strategies for the natural environment are responding to society's needs and the changing climate. Ecosystem assessments, particularly the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and the UK National Ecosystem Assessment, have reviewed the benefits that society gains from the natural environment, but they under-represent and undervalue the contribution of geodiversity. Geodiversity underpins and delivers many vital ecosystem services, informs their management and is an important element of natural capital. This includes the application of knowledge of physical processes and evidence from Quaternary archives of recent environmental change to help future-proof ecosystems and their services. Key principles include working with natural processes, based on understanding their spatial and temporal dynamics, and adopting where possible soft engineering practices to enable multiple benefits for nature and society. The ecosystem approach and the need for climate change adaptation require more integrated approaches to geodiversity, biodiversity and landscape conservation and management to enable a more sustainable future. Engaging with these issues will also demonstrate the wider relevance today of geodiversity and geoconservation. Contributing successfully in these critical areas requires closer partnership working, both across the geoscience and geoconservation communities, and with other sectors of nature conservation, policy makers, planners and communities, as well as other disciplines. Geoscience has an essential contribution to make in addressing knowledge gaps recognised in ecosystem assessment and in implementing robust solutions to broader environmental, economic and social issues.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to broaden the Terrestrial Transport Infrastructure (TTI) assessment process into the field of Ecosystem Services (ES), i.e., the benefits people derive from ecosystems. Taking into account ES in an ex ante assessment of public infrastructure projects is of critical importance for the improvement of transportation decision-making tools, such as Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA). For EIA, the integration of an ES based approach opens the possibility of measuring a loss in ES supply (and its economic value); this provides a means of selecting among different possible pathways for the infrastructure. For CBA, since the ES loss induced by the selected pathway is expressed in monetary terms, it can be integrated as a standard social cost in the analysis, permitting a more efficient control of natural capital loss. We illustrate these points by assessing the loss of a global climate regulation service due to the soil tillage and sealing caused by a TTI construction, using the example of a high-speed rail in Western France. We select three optional routes among the proposed routes and analyse which route has the least impact on the global climate regulation service and its economic value. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Policies at multiple levels pronounce the need to encompass both social and ecological systems in governance and management of natural capital in terms of resources and ecosystems. One approach to knowledge production and learning about landscapes as social-ecological systems is to compare multiple case studies consisting of large spaces and places. We first review the landscape concepts' biophysical, anthropogenic, and intangible dimensions. Second, we exemplify how the different landscape concepts can be used to derive measurable variables for different sustainability indicators. Third, we review gradients in the three dimensions of the term landscape on the European continent, and propose to use them for the stratification of multiple case studies of social-ecological systems. We stress the benefits of the landscape concepts to measure sustainability, and how this can improve collaborative learning about development toward sustainability in social-ecological systems. Finally, analyses of multiple landscapes improve the understanding of context for governance and management.

AB  - Natural capital and ecosystem service concepts are embodied in the ecosystems approach to sustainable development, which is a framework being consistently adopted by decision making bodies ranging from national governments to the United Nations. In the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment soils are given the vital role of a supporting service, but many of the other soil goods and services remain obscured. In this review we address this using and earth-system approach, highlighting the final goods and services soils produce, in a stock-fund, fund-service model of the pedosphere. We also argue that focusing on final goods and services will be counterproductive in the long run and emphasize that final goods and services are derived from an ecosystem supply chain that relies on ecological infrastructure. We propose that an appropriate ecosystems framework for soils should incorporate soil stocks (natural capital) showing their contribution to stock-flows and emergent fund-services as part of the supply chain. By so doing, an operational ecosystems concept for soils can draw on much more supporting data on soil stocks as demonstrated in a case study with soils data from England and Wales showing stocks, gaps in monitoring and drivers of change. Although the focus of this review is on soils, we believe the earth-system approach and principles of the ecosystem supply chain are widely applicable to the ecosystems approach and bring clarity in terms of where goods and services are derived from.

AB  - Quality of life is a multi-dimensional concept and it is essentially subjective even if we can often find objectively measurable proxies for it. High levels of quality of life are the results of the interplay of social, economic and environmental aspects that together make people satisfied with their life. People living in small islands can enhance their quality of life through appropriate programs that guarantee the conservation of natural capital, provided by ecosystems, and networks and norms that facilitate good governance and social cohesion. In this paper an integration of natural and social capital subjectively evaluated by people living in Vulcano Island (Sicily Region, Italy) is proposed as a first approximation of the perception of quality of life. This paper explores whether there are differences in such perception between permanent and seasonal residents, who live there only for tourist economic reasons. Results show that the perception of natural capital is high in both communities, while social capital and the quality of life is less perceived by seasonal respect to permanent residents. The results of this research highlight that natural capital and social capital, taken into account independently, provide only a partial vision of quality of life that is strongly dependent on the combination of both. In this respect, a list of potential subjective social-environmental indicators useful to assess the quality of life is proposed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - If we as scientists cannot decide upon what research, monitoring and technical tools should be used as a basis for policy making and management within the European context, then the politicians and other decision makers will continue to follow the line of 'weak' sustainability (applying monetary substitution rules to natural capital) instead of 'strong' sustainability (applying alternative rules such as the precautionary principle). Suitable integral indicators or indices matching the 'ecosystem approach' (EA) and thus covering ecological as well as socio-economic aspects are required. There is, however, a clear friction between what can be delivered in terms of useful '(integral) indicators' and what decision makers require us to deliver in terms of 'simple, cheap, easy to understand' while the real situation is extremely complex. This social, economic and ecological complexity has been an important impediment to the realisation of an EA that should guarantee 'sustainability'. What is missing since the publication of the Brundtland report is technical co-operation between the decision makers and the natural and social scientists. To achieve development of integral indicators we propose to make the Odum food web concepts functional by the application of ecological network analysis (ENA) and at a scale where socioeconomic and ecological information can be integrated, which is the 'habitat' level. At the habitat level ecological functioning (natural compartment), human activities (economic compartment) and ecosystem functions to humans (socio-ecological compartment) can be designated and measured. This process can further be facilitated by the use of the Driver-Pressure-State change-Impact-Response (DPSIR) approach. To facilitate weighing and decision making multi-criteria techniques can be used. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In prioritising investment in natural capital, site-scale indicators are increasingly used to capture fine-scale variation inherent in complex ecosystems. However, site assessment is costly, has high skill demand, and is time-consuming. We assess the marginal gain associated with including site-scale indicators in metrics typically used by agri-environmental stewardship schemes and payments for ecosystem services. We developed 18 landscape-scale and 14 site-scale indicators to prioritise sites for on-ground works in a real-world conservation auction in South Australia. We used the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to weight them and multi-attribute utility theory to combine them in quantifying site priority. Bid benefit was calculated as the product of impact of the proposed works and the site priority. Cost-utility analysis was used to rank and select bids with benefits calculated using: i) landscape-scale indicators, and; ii) both landscape- and site-scale indicators. We found that the inclusion of site-scale indicators has limited influence on the ranking and selection of bids for investment when cost of investment is included in the decision-making process. We suggest that, depending on the nature of costs and benefits, and if landholder engagement, information sharing, and trust-building can be achieved in more efficient ways, site assessment may not be necessary. Thereby a significant barrier to the adoption of cost-effective agri-environment schemes and payments for ecosystem services may be eliminated. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The identification of areas worthy of protection and their subsequent institution as natural parks are instruments that society uses to preserve biodiversity that, by supporting Natural Capital Flow (NCF), represents a guarantee for the maintenance of human life quality. However, the implemented strategies for the conservation of biodiversity may differ from those adopted for the maintenance of natural capital: consequently, planning for natural capital might require a different strategy from that used in conservation policies The aim of this paper is to assess the 'conservation effect' of different conservation policies on the maintenance of NCF in three natural parks in Apulia Region (southern Italy). The assessment of natural capital flow variation has been carried out investigating the temporal dynamics of land-use/land-cover mosaics, and using Costanza et al's economic coefficients as surrogates of NCF. Results showed that not all environmental conservation management strategies have played an equal role in fostering NCF This research highlights that the recognition of the natural value of a site according to the European Directives (e g NATURA 2000 network) is not sufficiently effective for the conservation of the NCF, while It is necessary to identify a management authority that can appropriately drive landscape transformations, and sets, if necessary, the appropriate limitations. In addition, the management of these areas as part of a network of natural parks seems to be more effective for the maintenance of NCF. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved

AB  - Despite the popularity of life cycle assessment (LCA) for understanding the broader implications of technological alternatives, it faces challenges due to difficulties in defining the analysis boundary, uncertain data, and ignoring the role of ecological goods and services. The latter natural capital is essential for sustainability but is only considered partially in conventional LCA. Accounting for ecological resources introduces the challenge of how to aggregate resources of widely varying qualities such as sunlight, wood, water, and coal. Methods based on mass, energy, and exergy have been proposed and are evaluated in this work. In addition, this work aims to analyze three LCA techniques with different system boundaries: conventional process-based LCA, hybrid economic input-output LCA (EIO-LCA), and hybrid ecologically based LCA (Eco-LCA). These three methods are applied to the case study of 1,3-propanediol (PDO) produced via fossil-based and bio-based feedstocks. The results of this study indicate that a hierarchical set of metrics can be useful for gaining insight into the role of ecosystem resources in a life cycle. Among aggregation methods, ecological cumulative exergy consumption seems to provide meaningful results, but more empirical studies are needed. It is also determined that bio-based PDO is more attractive than fossil-based PDO because of less nonrenewable resource consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. However, bio-based PDO does rely more on land, water, and fertile soil. By determining the impact of making the current PDO demand entirely from corn, it is found that the consumption of natural resources relative to national consumption is very low. While producing PDO alone from corn may have a negligible impact in terms of emissions and resource use, switching other products to bio-based will have an additive effect, increasing the strain on some ecological goods and services. These impacts should be addressed before promoting the large scale production of bio-based products.

AB  - There is an important analytical distinction for conservationists between the flow of ecosystem services and the stock of natural capital that underpins or constitutes them. The relationship between these two is often complex and indeterminate. Ecosystem services result from the interplay of different biological and physical processes across a variety of scales. Flows of ecosystem services may be imperfectly related to stocks of natural capital. Conservation is concerned with the protection of certain stocks of natural capital, but also with maintaining the complex web of relationships that characterize biodiversity. Despite the obvious links between ecosystem services, natural capital, and biodiversity, these are not identical. Practitioners and policy makers should be cautious in their use of the proxy indicator of ecosystem services when developing mechanisms for biodiversity conservation. Conceptual clarity is essential in order to harness the potentially important role that ecosystem service based interventions can play in mainstreaming conservation issues.

AB  - This study examines and evaluates, by means of the emergy analysis, the use of environmental resources for wastewater treatment in a Sicilian town. A traditional wastewater treatment plant coupled with a surface flow constructed wetland was considered for water purification. The surface area of the wetland was calculated by using a first order plug flow kinetic model; the area's value was a necessary parameter for the application of the emergy analysis. Water is part of the natural capital but, as water is processed through purification processes for city use, there are additional emergy and money values added. In the present application, the additional emergy value of water purification was calculated. The purpose of the analysis was to determine whether or not the installation of a constructed wetland on a Sicilian wastewater treatment plant may result in monetary savings and benefit the environment. The analysis done here shows that the proposed design not only results in savings by reducing electricity consumption, but also reduces pressure on the local environment by providing the option of recycling clean water. Furthermore, the emergy analysis which uses inputs both from natural ecosystems and the human economy, allows a quantitative evaluation of the environmental savings due to water reuse as well as the environmental impact due to the wastewater treatment process.

AB  - The development of stable markets in ecosystem services is now a major neoliberal policy initiative in the United States and elsewhere. Such markets, however, require ecosystem scientists to play a new and challenging role in certifying the value of the commodities traded, which are defined using the holistic measures of ecology rather than the uncontroversial measures of weight, volume, or time. As ecosystem science increasingly serves as a metrical technology for the commodification of ecosystem services, its fine and fragile distinctions increasingly bear the weight of capital circulation. In this paper I report on fieldwork among ecosystem assessment technicians, and suggest that this new round of the commodification of nature may overwhelm the capacity of science to provide stable representations of commodity value. The methods and techniques of ecosystem assessment must describe a nature that capital can 'see'-that has an uncontroversial measure-in order for trade to occur. However, these assessment methods currently produce unstable data that are rendered meaningful in economic terms only by dint of creative and ad hoc efforts at translation by field technicians. It is suggested that this may represent a practical limit or crisis point in the expansion of capital relations, or at least a complication in the streamlined neoliberal narratives about the commodification of ecosystem services.

AB  - In order to reconcile landscape conservation with changing demands on land use and natural resources, it is essential that the ecological. socio-cultural and economic values of the landscape be fully taken into account in planning and decision-making., This paperpresents a comprehensive framework for integrated assessment of ecological services and socio-economic benefits of natural and semi-natural ecosystems and landscapes. The framework can be applied at different scale levels to different ecosystems or landscape-units and basically consists of three steps: (1) Function-analysis: translates ecological complexity into a limited number of ecosystem (or landscape) functions, which, in turn, provide a range of goods and services; (2) Function valuation: includes ecological. socio-cultural and economic valuation methods; and (3) Conflict analysis: to facilitate the application of function-analysis and valuation at different scale levels, it is important to integrate analytical valuation methods with stakeholder participation techniques.
   The framework presented in this paper facilitates the structured assessment of the (total) value of the goods and services provided by a specific area (landscape) and to analyze the costs and benefits involved in trade-offs between various land use options. The last section of this paper gives some conclusions and recommendations for application-possibilities of function-analysis and valuation to achieve more sustainable landscape use and maintenance of our "natural capital".

AB  - The protection of natural capital, including its ability to renew or regenerate itself, represents a core aspect of sustainability. Hence, reliable measures of the supply of, and human demand on, natural capital are indispensable for tracking progress, setting targets and driving policies for sustainability. This paper presents the latest iteration of such a measure: the Ecological Footprint. After explaining the assumptions and choice of data sources on which the accounts are built, this paper presents how the newest version of these accounts has become more consistent, reliable and detailed by using more comprehensive data sources, calculating and comparing yields more consistently, distinguishing more sharply between primary and secondary production, and using procedures to identify and eliminate potential errors. As a result, this method can now provide more meaningful comparisons among nations' final consumption, or their economic production, and help to analyze the Ecological Footprint embodied in trade. With the higher level of detail, the accounts can generate sectoral assessments of an economy or, as shown in a complementary paper in this series, time trends of all these aspects.

AB  - There is an attractive analogy between nature and industry, based on the similarity of natural functions and certain industrial activities. For instance, animals ingest (eat) and digest food. Finally, there are metabolic wastes. Firms are analogous to organisms in several respects, insofar as they consume material resources, process (digest) them and produce output products and excrete wastes. Firms, like organisms, also compete with each other for resources. Curiously enough, one of the apparent differences between natural and man-made systems is actually not one; like the industrial system, the natural system does not recycle everything. However. there are at least four real and important differences between the biosphere (ecology) and the technosphere (economy). First, there is no primary producer in the economic system analogous to what photosynthesizers play in the biosphere. Inputs to the economy are mostly natural resources, capital services and labor. Second, in the economic system, output is a heterogeneous mix of manufactured products and services. Labor, in economics, is an input but not an output. The economic system recycles much less than the ecological system but utilizes a far greater suite of elements. In the biosphere, there are no products as such. Growth is tantamount to accumulation of embodied solar exergy in the form of cellulose, sugars, lipids and proteins. The biosphere produces only wastes and more of itself plus dead matter. Third, in the biosphere, there are no markets, there is no medium of exchange (like money) and there is nothing analogous to paid labor. Exchanges are involuntary (i.e., by predation, parasitism or theft.) Fourth, evolution in nature is driven by differentiation by random mutations of the genome and Darwinian selection based on reproductive success. In economics, differentiation is based on discovery, invention and innovation by intelligent economic agents and selection is based on competition at the individual or firm level. Either way, the economic system is not closely analogous to an ecosystem. Attempts to use ecological concepts in an economic context are often misleading and unjustified. The paper discusses the implications of the eco-eco mismatch for resource accounting and life cycle analysis. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The reductionist trend of equating sustainable development with sustained economic growth needs to be reversed. New accounts and balances help to operationalize the elusive notion of sustainability: they provide a coherent picture of the interaction between environment and economy. 'Greened' national accounts measure economic sustainability in terms of (produced and natural) capital maintenance; balances of material flows assess ecological sustainability as the dematerialization of production and consumption. Both concepts aim to,preserve environmental assets, but differ in scope, strength and evaluation of sustainability. First results for Germany indicate weak sustainability of the economy; strong sustainability is not in sight because of insufficient reduction of material throughput. Attaining sustainability through integrated policies needs the support of share- and stakeholders of sustainable development. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Forest exploitation in British Columbia is currently unsustainable. Economic analysis is frequently used to justify the high rate of cut by documenting the revenue, job and wage benefits of current industrial forestry. However, Hicks' definition of income implies that it is poor accounting practice to count the consumption of natural capital as income. Yet in BC, economic analysis fails to make adjustments for the consumption of forest capital. Such analysis provides society with misleading signals of future economic prospects. By reference to landscape ecology, conservation biology, forest ecology, and ecosystem-based management, this paper sets out requirements for a forest management regime that maintains forest capital intact and for determining a rate of cut that would likely maintain ecosystem structure and function. This ecologically sustainable rate of cut can be seen as an 'extraction ceiling'. Extraction beyond this ceiling is considered to involve natural capital consumption. This extraction ceiling is used to divide the proceeds from timber extraction into 'interest' and 'depletion' streams. The interest stream is consistent with maintaining capital intact, and can be considered true income. The depletion stream involves capital consumption. Basing economic analysis of the forest industry on an extraction ceiling encourages debate about defining sustainable extraction levels and about how to make the transition to sustainable forestry. It also shows that the timber industry overstates its contribution to government revenues and to the province's economic well-being. Critics of industrial forestry in BC have yet to take full advantage of how proper accounting for natural capital depletion can show the advantages to moving towards an ecoforestry approach. By insisting that economists make adjustments where natural capital depletion is projected to occur, advocates of ecoforestry can ensure a more level playing field for the comparison of industrial forestry and ecoforestry.

AB  - Conceptions of defining and measuring sustainable development can broadly be placed in two categories: weak and strong sustainability. The concept of weak sustainability is based on neo-classical economic theory and assumes that manufactured and natural capital are close substitutes. This means that costs of environmental deterioration (e.g., forest damage) can be compensated by benefits from manufactured capital (e.g., income). Thus, environmental damages are valued in monetary units. The concept of strong sustainability denies the degree of substitution that weak sustainability assumes, at least for some critical elements of natural capital. This paper pledges for strong sustainability indicators, especially for critical loads and critical levels. Since the costs and benefits of avoiding critical impacts have to be taken into account, a combination of strong and weak sustainability indicators-means a linkage of ecological (physical) and economic (monetary) approaches-should be suggested.

AB  - The development of statistics, as with any other tool, can only be understood in relation to their particular uses. This is confirmed by the development of National Income estimates and of the National Accounts. Proposals to integrate environmental costs and benefits into the National Accounts can similarly only be evaluated by considering them in the context of their likely policy use. The most important potential use is as a general measure of welfare or progress, for policy to aim to maximise. Environmentally adjusted National Accounts correspond to a very weak view of sustainability. The use of adjusted National Income as a measure of welfare essentially assumes complete substitutability between manufactured and natural capital. Problems of monetary valuation are likely to lead to huge underestimation of environmental costs. Issues of inequality and poverty, essential to a more robust view of sustainability, are ignored. Policy targeting a revised National Income will continue to aim for ever higher output while making very limited concessions to environmental concerns. Adjusting the National Accounts for environmental costs is not the only way to ensure they are allowed for in policy making. An alternative approach, more appropriate if sustainable development in the stronger sense is to be achieved, is the construction and use of a set of social and environmental indicators.

AB  - The idea of environment as capital has found widespread support in both the economic and ecological literature. It is often suggested in a related sustainability literature that natural capital should remain intact if possible. The popularity of this approach to exploring the human-environment relationship is due, in part, to the way it is seemingly legitimised by ecological theory and practice. This legitimation is important for emerging areas of human-environment study, such as ecological economics, because ecology and other natural sciences have often dismissed economic constructions of the environment. However, a closer examination of the state of contemporary ecology suggests that there are problems with an ecological legitimation of the ''environment as capital approach.'' First, ecology itself is a troubled discipline and its ability to provide a comprehensive theory of human-environment interactions is limited. Second, emerging ecological discourse tends to undermine the ecological rationale for many natural-capital-related resource management recommendations. This does not mean that the environment as capital concept is without considerable heuristic power. It does imply, however, a need to return to a social construction of the environment in which different environmental possibilities are valued in terms of their potential contribution to human well-being.

TI  - THE URGENT NEED FOR RAPID TRANSITION TO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
LA  - English
AB  - This paper outlines the concept of environmental sustainability (ES), shows why it is important to make it a top-priority goal, and why that will be difficult to attain but essential. The ES equation of impact = population x affluence x technology, is outlined. When the world approaches stability in both population size and the throughput of energy and materials per unit of production, we may indeed be approaching sustainability. As the world's population is apt to double every 40 years, and as only a few countries (e.g. Japan and Sweden) have managed so far to reduce the energy intensity or production, we are hurtling away from sustainability rather than even approaching it, Environmental sustainability can be approached by implementing four priorities: first, by using sound microeconomic means; second, by using sound macroeconomics to differentiate between use and liquidation of natural capital by means of environmental accounting; third, by using environmental assessment to incorporate environmental costs into project appraisal; and fourth - until the first three become fully achieved - by following operational guidelines for sustainability. Thus:
   1) Sound Microeconomic Aleans involve: (1) Getting the prices right: to reflect full social marginal opportunity cost; use the 'full cost' principle, or the 'cradle-to-grave' approach. (2) Repealing perverse fiscal incentives. (3) Strengthening the 'polluter pays' principles. (4) Including non-monetary values in project justification- (5) Adopting the transparency principle that markets can function efficiently only if relevant information is available at low cost. This involves the participation of people in decisions affecting them, and advertising who is polluting what and by how much.
   2) Sound Macroeconomics by Environmental Accounting is essential to discern decapitalization and to shift to using income rather than drawing down capital assets. Environmental accounting clarifies what is liquidation of natural capital from what is income. This is essential because decapitalization is frequently confused as income. Environmental accounting warns us when liquidation of potentially renewable resources exceeds their regeneration rates, such as in many forests.
   3) Environmental Assessment is part of the project selection process. The purpose of EA is to ensure that the development options under consideration are environmentally sustainable. Any environmental consequences should be addressed in project selection, planning, siting, and design. EAs identify ways of preventing, minimizing, mitigating, or compensating for, adverse impacts.
   4) Sustainability Guidelines: Until the first three rules are heeded and duly acted on, the following guidelines will be necessary: 1, Output Rule: - waste emissions from a project should be within the assimilative capacity of the local environment to absorb without unacceptable degradation of its future waste-absorptive capacity; and 2, Input Guide: - harvest rates or renewable resource inputs should be within regenerative capacity of the natural system that generates them. Depletion rates of non-renewable resource inputs should not exceed the rate at which renewable substitutes are developed by human invention and investment.

AB  - In the period 1997-2000, approximately 1 800,000 in 3 of material dredged from the Port of Leghorn was discharged into a sea dumping site located 14 miles from the coast. The red mullet (Mullus barbatus) was used as a bioindicator species for monitoring the biological impact of these discharges on a geographical and temporal scale. Organisms were sampled over three years (1998-2000) at different stations and several biomarkers, both of exposure and effect, were analyzed. Bioavailability of specific classes of pollutants was evaluated by analyzing levels of metallothioneins, the activity of cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) and of glutathione S-transferases. Among biomarkers of effect, special attention was paid to the balance between prooxidant challenge and antioxidant defenses, and to the appearance of damage caused by oxidative stress. The analyses of the main components of the antioxidant system included superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidases, glutathione reductase, glyoxalase I and 11, and total glutathione. These data were integrated with the measurement of total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC) as an indication of the overall biological resistance to toxicity of different forms of oxyradicals (peroxyl radicals, hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite). Results indicated a biological impact in organisms sampled near the disposal site; the impact was particularly evident during 1999 and mainly related to organic chemicals such as PAH. Exposure to these pollutants also caused variations in the levels and activity of several antioxidants. The analysis of TOSC, however, revealed that the overall capacity of specific tissues of organisms to absorb various oxidants was not seriously compromised when challenged with increased prooxidant pressures. Variations of single antioxidants were useful in revealing early warning "biological responses", while integration with TOSC analyses indicated if such changes also reflect a more integrated and functional "biological effect" with possible consequences at the organisms level. The red mullet appears to be a useful sentinel species for a biomarker approach to monitoring impact caused by dredged materials. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ln solution, Manganese Stabilizing Protein, the polypeptide which is responsible for the structural and functional integrity of the manganese cluster in photosystem II, is a natively unfolded protein with a prolate ellipsoid shape [Lydakis-Simantiris et al. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 404-414; Zubrzycki et al. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 13553-13558]. The C-terminal tripeptide of Manganese Stabilizing Protein was shown to be critical for binding to photosystem II and restoration of O-2 evolution activity [Betts et al. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 14230-14236]. Here, we report new biochemical, hydrodynamic, and spectroscopic data on mutants E246K, E246STOP, L245E, L245STOP, and Q244STOP. Truncation of the final dipeptide (E246STOP) or substitution of Glu246 with Lys resulted in no significant changes in secondary and tertiary structures of Manganese Stabilizing Protein as monitored by CD spectroscopy. The apparent molecular mass of the protein remained unchanged, both mutants were able to rebind to photosystem II, and both proteins reactivate Oz evolution. Manganese Stabilizing Protein lacking the final tripeptide (L245STOP), or substitution of Glu for Leu245 dramatically modified the protein's solution structure. The apparent molecular masses of these mutants increased significantly, which might indicate unfolding of the protein in solution. This was verified by CD spectroscopy. Both mutant proteins rebound to photosystem II with lower affinities, and activation of Oz evolution was decreased dramatically. Enhancement of these defects was observed upon removal of the final tetrapeptide (Q244STOP). These results indicate that Leu245 is essential to maintaining Manganese Stabilizing Protein's solution structure in a conformation that promotes efficient binding to photosystem II and/or for the subsequent steps that lead to enzyme activation. Based on an analysis of the properties of C-terminal mutations, a hypothesis for structural requirements for functional binding of Manganese Stabilizing Protein to photosystem II is presented. Effects of C-terminal mutations on the UV spectrum of Manganese Stabilizing Protein were also examined. Mutations that alter solution structure also affect a 293 nm absorption shoulder which is assigned to the only tryptophan residue, Trp241, in the protein, and this absorbance feature is shown to be a useful indicator of alterations to the Trp241 environment.

AB  - The cytosolic glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzymes serve as ideal biomarkers of organ damage as they exhibit many of the required characteristics, i.e. specific localisation, high cytosolic concentration and relatively short half-life. The role of GSTs as early indicators of organ damage is applicable to both human and animal models. Because of the regio-specific localisation of the different isoforms of GST in liver and kidney, simultaneous monitoring of classes of GSTs in biological matrices permits the identification of specific areas of damage within a particular organ. Immunoassays have been developed which quantify canine alpha GST and rodent mu GST (Yb1). The immunoassays are solid phase EIAs, where GST in the sample or standard is captured by a specific anti-GST antibody coated onto the solid phase. After washing, a specific enzyme-labelled IgG conjugate is added which binds to the captured GST. After a further washing step, substrate is added and a colour developed. The absorbance is measured on an ELISA plate reader and is directly proportional Co the amount of GST present in the sample. The assays are performed at room temperature and can be completed within 3 h. The immunoassays are specific for each GST and have a range of 0-100 mu g/l. A range of assay parameters were investigated to validate the EIAs for GST detection. The assays are sensitive and reproducible. CV for inter- and intra-assay variation were below 9% for Yb1 assay and below 20% for the canine alpha GST EIA. Recovery of spiked GST over the standard curve range was 102 and 99%, respectively. No prozone effect was observed and samples exhibited linearity of dilution in both assays. Validation has shown that using these enzyme immunoassay, Yb1 and canine aGST can be measured accurately and precisely in biological matrices, tissue homogenates and cell lines and that changes in GST levels can be detected. The use of these assays have important applications in both in vitro and in vivo toxicity studies, where GSTs serve as sensitive marker of hepatocellular and renal cell integrity.

AB  - We propose that patterns of plant functional group occurrences could be a reliable indicator of prairie vegetation quality. A method for assessing tallgrass prairie quality based on density and composition of plant functional groups was developed and tested by comparison with qualitative indices calculated from species data at 17 prairies in Illinois. Species sample data were recorded from quadrats while functional group data were recorded from segments of belt transects overlying the species sample transects. Prairies selected include remnants and restorations and represent a wide range of habitat quality including recognized natural areas, degraded remnants, and prairie plantings of varying age and success. For agglomerative clustering of prairie quality classes, a matrix of habitat indices and metrics was used based on species sample data from all sites. Three groups were identified in cluster analysis that were characteristic of high, medium, and low-quality prairies. Mean Functional Group Density (Mean FGD), an index developed based on the mean products of frequency and density among plant functional groups recorded from belt transects at each site, had the highest correlations to habitat quality indices among two other functional group indices tested. Mean FGD was highly correlated with the mean coefficient of conservatism and floristic quality index, indices calculated from species sample data that have been shown to be reliable indicators of habitat quality. In means comparison tests among prairie quality classes, Mean FGD differentiated high-quality from medium and low-quality prairies, but did not distinguish medium from low-quality sites (only two low-quality sites were identified), although rank order of Mean FGD was as predicted. There is a tradeoff in efficiency and precision between species-level and functional group sample data. Species-level data more precisely discriminate differences in low and medium-quality sites; however, functional group sampling is much more rapid requiring only 20-to-25% of the time required for collecting species-level data. Results from functional group sampling highlight differences in functional group composition among prairie quality classes. High-quality prairies are characterized by greater abundance of sedges and hemi-parasites while lower-quality prairies were affiliated more with non-native perennial forbs and annual/biennial species.

AB  - The agricultural sector faces serious environmental, social and economic challenges. In response, there has been a proliferation of labels and certifications aiming to ensure minimum farm sustainability performance. Organic agriculture (OA) a prominent example, having received substantial research attention relating to agronomic and environmental performance. While international OA movements are evolving to include broader sustainability aspirations, limited research exists on the social and economic performance of OA. To address this, we conducted a representative farm-based assessment of the Swiss organic sector to evaluate its contribution to sustainability across a wide range of themes based on the FAO Sustainability of Agriculture and Food Assessment (SAFA) Guidelines. We assessed 185 farms using the Sustainability Assessment and Monitoring RouTine (SMART) Farm Tool, chosen through stratified random sampling by farm type and agricultural zone. The results indicate that the Swiss organic sector makes a substantially positive contribution to sustainability, with average scores for theme goal achievement of 62% (Good Governance), 77% (Environmental Integrity), 70% (Economic Resilience), and 87% (Social Well-being). A set of 45 influential indicators (28 for plant production/mix farms and 30 for livestock farms) were selected based on the ability to explain variance (using Principal Component Analysis) and importance for goal achievement. The indicator sets explained a large amount of variation (ca. 70% for both farm types) and revealed a snapshot of management topics relevant to sustainability performance across the sector. These covered socio-political engagement, emissions to air and water, biodiversity, animal welfare, profitability, vulnerability, product quality, local economy, capacity building, and workplace risks. The spread of results across the sample, and comparisons to secondary data (literature and official statistics), revealed the importance of both well-studied issues (e.g., wide spread of energy consumption, variable yield levels/stability, local value chain dynamics) and more novel insights (e.g., strong political engagement, variable price premiums, lacking social security of farming families, insecure land tenure). We propose these topics as a basis for deeper analysis, designing improvement measures and conducting comparative research. This would bring much-needed breadth into the typically narrow debate surrounding the relative merits of OA.

AB  - Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is an emerging public health threat and C. difficile is the most common cause of antimicrobial-associated diarrhea worldwide and the leading cause of hospital-associated infections in the US, yet the burden of community-acquired infections (CAI) is poorly understood. Characterizing C. difficile isolated from canines is important for understanding the role that canines may play in CAI. In addition, several studies have suggested that canines carry toxigenic C. difficile asymptomatically, which may imply that there are mechanisms responsible for resistance to CDI in canines that could be exploited to help combat human CDI. To assess the virulence potential of canine-derived C. difficile, we tested whether toxins TcdA and TcdB (hereafter toxins) derived from a canine isolate were capable of causing tight junction disruptions to colonic epithelial cells. Additionally, we addressed whether major differences exist between human and canine cells regarding C. difficile pathogenicity by exposing them to identical toxins. We then examined the canine gut microbiome associated with C. difficile carriage using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and searched for deviations from homeostasis as an indicator of CDI. Finally, we queried 16S rRNA gene sequences for bacterial taxa that may be associated with resistance to CDI in canines. Clostridioides difficile isolated from a canine produced toxins that reduced tight junction integrity in both human and canine cells in vitro. However, canine guts were not dysbiotic in the presence of C. difficile. These findings support asymptomatic carriage in canines and, furthermore, suggest that there are features of the gut microbiome and/or a canine-specific immune response that may protect canines against CDI. We identified two biologically relevant bacteria that may aid in CDI resistance in canines: 1) Clostridium hiranonis, which synthesizes secondary bile acids that have been shown to provide resistance to CDI in mice; and 2) Sphingobacterium faecium, which produces sphingophospholipids that may be associated with regulating homeostasis in the canine gut. Our findings suggest that canines may be cryptic reservoirs for C. difficile and, furthermore, that mechanisms of CDI resistance in the canine gut could provide insights into targeted therapeutics for human CDI.

AB  - The ubiquitous occurring earthworm species, Eisenia fetida, were exposed to nickel chloride to determine whether the heavy metal Ni caused DNA damage, as measured by the comet (single cell gel electrophoresis) assay. Primary cell cultures of earthworm coelomocytes were exposed in vitro and whole animals either in spiked artificial soil water or in spiked cattle manure substrates. Comets formed were scored using mean tail lengths as well as comparing percentages of damage in five different damage classes. The exposure concentrations used for the in vitro exposure (2, 6, and 12 mug/ml) caused the formation of comets of which the mean tail lengths differed significantly (p < 0.05) from those of unexposed controls but not from each other. Coelomocytes from worms exposed in artificial soil water at concentrations of 0.0049, 0.0078, 0.0175, and 0.025 mg/ml formed comets of which the mean tail lengths differed significantly (p < 0.05) between the exposure groups with increasingly longer tail lengths with higher concentration (dose-related response). The tail length means of the comets of the three highest exposure concentrations also differed significantly (p > 0.05) from the controls. No dose-related response was found between comet tail lengths of the three exposure concentrations (60, 240, and 480 mg/kg) used for the worms in the cattle manure substrates, but the mean tail lengths of comets from all three exposure groups differed significantly (p > 0.05) from the controls. The comets formed in cells from animals exposed in artificial soil water and in cattle manure substrates, scored within damage classes, indicated a clear shift with increasing exposure concentrations from low to high damage. Our results indicated DNA single-strand breaks in soil invertebrate cells caused by exposure to a nickel compound, verifying previous findings for mammals which indicated that this heavy metal has genotoxic potential. These results therefore suggest that earthworms may be useful indicator organisms to assess the genotoxic risks of nickel pollution to terrestrial environments and that the comet assay is a useful tool to use as biomarker of genotoxic effects on invertebrates in soil.

AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a natural photosensitizer that contributes to the inactivation of microbial pathogens. In constructed treatment wetlands with open water areas DOM can promote sunlight disinfection of wastewater effluent, but a better understanding of DOM spectroscopic and photochemical properties and how they are impacted by different unit process wetlands is needed to inform design. The goals of this study were: (1) to investigate whether DOM isolates realistically represent the photochemistry of the source DOM in its original water and (2) to observe how changes of DOM along a treatment wetland affect its photochemistry, including pathogen inactivation. A pilot scale unit process wetland was studied that consisted of three different cells (open water, cattail, and bulrush) fed by secondary wastewater effluent. DOM was isolated using solid-phase extraction (SPE), photochemically characterized, and compared to the original water samples and standard DOMs. For MS2 coliphage, a virus indicator, the most efficient photosensitizer was the wastewater DOM isolated from the influent of the wetland, while for the bacterial indicator Enterococcus faecalis, inactivation results were comparable across wetland isolates. SPE resulted in isolation of 47% to 59% of whole water DOM and enriched for colored DOM. Singlet oxygen precursors were efficiently isolated, while some excited triplet state precursors remained in the extraction discharge. DOM processing indicators such as SUVA(254), SUVA(280), and spectral slopes including E-2/E-3 ratios were reflected in the isolates. Photoinactivation of MS2 was significantly lower in both the reconstituted water samples and isolates compared to the original water sample, possibly due to disturbance of the trans-molecular integrity of DOM molecules by SPE that affects distance between MS2 and DOM sites with locally higher singlet oxygen production. For E. faecalis, results were similar in original water samples and isolates. Higher sorption of DOM to E. faecalis was roughly correlated with higher photoinactivation rates. To enhance sunlight disinfection in unit process wetlands, there is no advantage to placing open water cells after vegetated cells, as passage through the vegetated cells led to increased light absorption and lower singlet oxygen and triplet-state quantum yields and steady state concentrations.

AB  - Phytoplankton biomass is an important indicator for water quality, and predicting its dynamics is thus regarded as one of the important issues in the domain of river ecology and management. However, the vast majority of models in river systems have focused mostly on flow prediction and water quality with very few applications to biotic parameters such as chlorophyll a (Chl a). Based on a 1.5-year measured dataset of Chl a and environmental variables, we developed two modeling approaches [artificial neural networks (ANN) and multiple linear regression (MLR)] to simulate the daily Chl a dynamics in a German lowland river. In general, the developed ANN and MLR models achieved satisfactory accuracy in predicting daily dynamics of Chl a concentrations. Although some peaks and lows were not predicted, the predicted and the observed data matched closely by the MLR model with the coefficient of determination (R (2)), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NS), and the root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.53, 0.53, and 2.75 for the calibration period and 0.63, 0.62, and 1.94 for the validation period, respectively. Likewise, the results of the ANN model also illustrated a good agreement between observed and predicted data during calibration and validation periods, which was demonstrated by R (2), NS, and RMSE values (0.68, 0.68, and 2.27 for the calibration period, 0.55, 0.66 and 2.12 for the validation period, respectively). According to the sensitivity analysis, Chl a concentration was highly sensitive to dissolved inorganic nitrogen, nitrate-nitrogen, autoregressive Chl a, chloride, sulfate, and total phosphorus. We concluded that it was possible to predict the daily Chl a dynamics in the German lowland river based on relevant environmental factors using either ANN or MLR models. The ANN model is well suited for solving non-linear and complex problems, while the MLR model can explicitly explore the coefficients between independent and dependent variables. Further studies are still needed to improve the accuracy of the developed models.

AB  - Background: Beginning in the last century, coral reefs have suffered the consequences of anthropogenic activities, including oil contamination. Chemical remediation methods, such as dispersants, can cause substantial harm to corals and reduce their resilience to stressors. To evaluate the impacts of oil contamination and find potential alternative solutions to chemical dispersants, we conducted a mesocosm experiment with the fire coral Millepora alcicornis, which is sensitive to environmental changes. We exposed M. alcicornis to a realistic oil-spill scenario in which we applied an innovative multi-domain bioremediator consortium (bacteria, filamentous fungi, and yeast) and a chemical dispersant (Corexit (R) 9500, one of the most widely used dispersants), to assess the effects on host health and host-associated microbial communities.
   Results: The selected multi-domain microbial consortium helped to mitigate the impacts of the oil, substantially degrading the polycyclic aromatic and n-alkane fractions and maintaining the physiological integrity of the corals. Exposure to Corexit 9500 negatively impacted the host physiology and altered the coral-associated microbial community. After exposure, the abundances of certain bacterial genera such as Rugeria and Roseovarius increased, as previously reported in stressed or diseased corals. We also identified several bioindicators of Corexit 9500 in the microbiome. The impact of Corexit 9500 on the coral health and microbial community was far greater than oil alone, killing corals after only 4 days of exposure in the flow-through system. In the treatments with Corexit 9500, the action of the bioremediator consortium could not be observed directly because of the extreme toxicity of the dispersant to M. alcicornis and its associated microbiome.
   Conclusions: Our results emphasize the importance of investigating the host-associated microbiome in order to detect and mitigate the effects of oil contamination on corals and the potential role of microbial mitigation and bioindicators as conservation tools. Chemical dispersants were far more damaging to corals and their associated microbiome than oil, and should not be used close to coral reefs. This study can aid in decision-making to minimize the negative effects of oil and dispersants on coral reefs.

AB  - The EU 2020 Biodiversity Strategy requires the gathering of information on biodiversity to aid in monitoring progress towards its main targets. Common species are good proxies for the diversity and integrity of ecosystems, since they are key elements of the biomass, structure, functioning of ecosystems, and therefore of the supply of ecosystem services. In this sense, we aimed to develop a spatially-explicit indicator of habitat quality (HQI) at European level based on the species included in the European Common Bird Index, also grouped into their major habitat types (farmland and forest). Using species occurrences from the European Breeding Birds Atlas (at 50 km x 50 km) and the maximum entropy algorithm, we derived species distribution maps using refined occurrence data based on species ecology. This allowed us to cope with the limitations arising from modelling common and widespread species, obtaining habitat suitability maps for each species at finer spatial resolution (10 km x 10 km grid), which provided higher model accuracy. Analysis of the spatial patterns of local and relative species richness (defined as the ratio between species richness in a given location and the average richness in the regional context) for the common birds analysed demonstrated that the development of a HQI based on species richness needs to account for the regional species pool in order to make objective comparisons between regions. In this way, we proved that relative species richness compensated for the bias caused by the inherent heterogeneous patterns of the species distributions that was yielding larger local species richness in areas where most of the target species have the core of their distribution range. The method presented in this study provides a robust and innovative indicator of habitat quality which can be used to make comparisons between regions at the European scale, and therefore potentially applied to measure progress towards the EU Biodiversity Strategy targets. Finally, since species distribution models are based on breeding birds, the HQI can be also interpreted as a measure of the capacity of ecosystems to provide and maintain nursery/reproductive habitats for terrestrial species, a key maintenance and regulation ecosystem service.

AB  - This study addressed potential land use impacts to macroinvertebrate communities and water quality from past coal mining activities in the watershed of the North Branch of the Susquehanna River (located in northeastern Pennsylvania and southern New York). Landscape tools of GIS and remote sensing (RS) were used to calculate percent land cover (forest, agriculture, barren, urban, and water) from SPOT imagery (for tributaries) and Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) data (for river sites) on 17 subcatchments in the study area. The study design included field sampling at reach locations at four first- and second-order sites with low urban and low barren (mining) land cover, four similar sized sites with high mining and high barren land cover, five sites with intermediate combinations of urban and barren, and four mainstem river sites (60% forest and 35% agriculture). Sites were sampled in early fall for macroinvertebrates (17 parameters, e. g., EPT richness, percent filterers), benthic substrates (including deposits from mine waters), and 10 water chemistry parameters. A principal component analysis (PCA) on the macroinvertebrate parameters provided plot-clustering of subcatchments based generally on the above study design groupings; river sites clustered closer to smaller streams with low mining and urban land cover. Correlations identified six macroinvertebrate parameters (e. g., EPT richness, collector-gatherers) best associated with the three major axes of the PCA; each of these six indicators was analyzed in step-wise multiple regressions as dependent variables against land cover, benthic substrate, and water chemistry parameters. The strongest regressions were for percent barren land cover that explained the greatest amount of variation in both EPT richness and taxa richness. This mining affect was confirmed with dissolved iron and sulfate concentrations and levels of sedimentation and iron deposition explaining variability across several macroinvertebrate parameters. Comparison to the published literature on mining impacts indicated advantages to using a GIS watershed approach in multivariate analyses of stream ecosystem response. Also, this appears to be the first GIS watershed assessment of mining land use affects since most published studies of land use impacts to watersheds and lotic ecosystems have focused on either agriculture or urbanization.

AB  - In order to satisfy the humanitarian information demand in ongoing- and post-crisis situations, earth observation (EO) data must be streamed through time-critical workflows. Data fusion serves as an integral segment of EO-based rapid-mapping workflows. Fused images form the basis for manual, semi-, and fully-automated classification steps in the information retrieval chain. Many fusion algorithms have been developed and tested for different remote sensing applications, however, the efficacy of data fusion is weakly assessed in the context of rapid-mapping workflows. In this research, we investigated how different fusion algorithms perform when applied to very high spatial resolution (VHSR) satellite images that encompass ongoing- and post-crises scenes. The evaluation entailed twelve fusion algorithms: Brovey transform, color normalization spectral sharpening (CN) algorithm, Ehlers fusion algorithm, Gram-Schmidt fusion algorithm, high-pass filter (HPF) fusion algorithm, local mean matching algorithm, local mean variance matching (LMVM) algorithm, modified intensity-hue-saturation (HIS) fusion algorithm, principal component analysis (PCA) fusion algorithm, subtractive resolution merge (SRM) fusion algorithm, the University of New Brunswick (UNB) fusion algorithm, and the wavelet-PCA fusion algorithm. These algorithms were applied to GeoEye-1 satellite images taken over three geographical settings representing natural and anthropogenic crises that occurred recently: earthquake-damaged sites in Haiti, flood-impacted sites in Pakistan, and armed-conflicted areas and internally displaced persons (IDP) camps in Sri Lanka. Fused images were assessed for spectral and spatial fidelity using a variety of quantitative quality indicators and visual inspection methods. Spectral quality metrics include correlation coefficient, root-mean-square-error (RMSE), relative difference to mean, relative difference to standard deviation, spectral discrepancy, deviation index, peak-signal-to-noise ratio index, entropy, mean structural similarity index, spectral angle mapper, and relative dimensionless global error in synthesis. The spatial integrity of fused images was assessed using Canny edge correspondence, high-pass correlation coefficient, and RMSE of Sobel-filtered edge images. Under each metric, fusion algorithms were ranked and best competitors were identified. Ehlers, WV, and HPF had the best scores for the majority of spectral quality indices. UNB and Gram-Schmidt algorithms had the best scores for spatial metrics. HPF emerged as the overall best performing fusion algorithm. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Semen analysis is currently performed by using two techniques. Visual assessment technique is manual observation based technique and strongly depends on the experiences of the observer. Therefore, the reliability of the results is skeptical. On the other hand, computer based expert systems are more consistent and reliable. However, they are very expensive systems, therefore, cannot be utilized in many laboratories. In this study, we proposed a hybrid expert system utilizing visual assessment environment with the computerized analyzing part to eliminate the disadvantages of each technique. In the proposed system, smartphone based data acquisition approach is used to provide more modular and practical expert system for the sperm analysis. The records are, then, transferred to the server to analyze by developed software. In this analyzing software, we proposed multistage hybrid analyzing approach in terms of video stabilization, sperm concentration and motility analysis. Each video was initially fixed by the Speed Up Robust Features based matching technique. Then, Kalman Filter was employed for sperm tracking. After tracking step, trajectories have been divided into 3 s length to prevent possible incorrect assignments due to sudden changes in sperm motions. In the experimental tests, we combined all trajectories obtained from a total of 18 videos of 6 different subjects. We clustered a total of 89438 trajectories into 4 cluster as fast progressive, progressive, non-progressive and immotile according to extracted seven features. In order to compare the results, we also analyzed the same semen sample in another expert system, SQA-Vision. The difference was measured 3.4% and 4.8% in the determination of total and motile sperm concentration, and 2.1%, 7.4%, 5.3% for progressive, non-progressive and immotile movement type analysis respectively. The significance and impact of the proposed system are capability of reporting more detailed results in a variety of situations and having more advantages than any expert systems utilized for sperm analysis in terms of portability, cost and modularity. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting use of the smartphone in an expert system for the sperm analysis in terms of data acquisition and result reporting.

AB  - Background: In contrast to studies of depression and psychosis, the first part of this study showed no major differences in serum levels of cytokines and tryptophan metabolites between healthy children and those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder of the combined type (ADHD). Yet, small decreases of potentially toxic kynurenine metabolites and increases of cytokines were evident in subgroups. Therefore we examined predictions of biochemical associations with the major symptom clusters, measures of attention and response variability.
   Methods: We explored systematically associations of 8 cytokines (indicators of pro/anti-inflammatory function) and 5 tryptophan metabolites with symptom ratings (e. g. anxiety, opposition, inattention) and continuous performance test (CPT) measures (e. g. movement, response time (RT), variability) in 35 ADHD (14 on medication) and 21 control children. Predictions from linear regressions (controlled by the false discovery rate) confirmed or disconfirmed partial correlations accounting for age, body mass and socio-economic status.
   Results: (1) Total symptom ratings were associated with increases of the interleukins IL-16 and IL-13, where relations of IL-16 (along with decreased S100B) with hyperactivity, and IL-13 with inattention were notable. Opposition ratings were predicted by increased IL-2 in ADHD and IL-6 in control children. (2) In the CPT, IL-16 related to motor measures and errors of commission, while IL-13 was associated with errors of omission. Increased RT variability related to lower TNF-alpha, but to higher IFN-gamma levels. (3) Tryptophan metabolites were not significantly related to symptoms. But increased tryptophan predicted errors of omission, its breakdown predicted errors of commission and kynurenine levels related to faster RTs.
   Conclusions: Many associations were found across diagnostic groups even though they were more marked in one group. This confirms the quantitative trait nature of these features. Conceptually the relationships of the pro-and antiinflammatory cytokines distinguished between behaviours associated more with cognitive or more with motor control respectively. Further study should extend the number of immunological and metabolic markers to confirm or refute the trends reported here and examine their stability from childhood to adolescence in a longitudinal design.

AB  - We assessed natural regeneration of longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) using the data collected from the Escambia Experimental Forest in southern Alabama. Fifteen years after the regeneration control, natural regeneration of longleaf pine remained patchy across a wide range of site and stand conditions; slightly more than half of all plots contained regeneration, but the density of seedlings and saplings varied significantly. The abundance of seedlings <= 1-year- old was positively related to stand age and time since last fire, but negatively related to overstory basal area. The abundance of seedlings and saplings was positively related to stand age, but negatively related to time since last fire and overstory basal area. The probability of achieving at least 15 000 seedlings.ha(-1) that are older than 1 year but less than 1 m tall and at least 1250 saplings.ha(-1) that are over 1 m tall was, respectively, positively related to the ratio of time since last fire to overstory basal area and the ratio of quadratic mean diameter to site index. A longer fire interval (> 2 to 3 years) should be adopted to naturally regenerate longleaf. We did not find clear zones of exclusion present in natural regeneration even though overstory trees, seedlings, and saplings tended to be repulsive spatially and >80% grass stage seedlings and saplings occurred outside tree crowns.

AB  - Adaptive algorithms for beam shaping of a phased array antenna and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system gaining importance in today's advanced wireless networks to mitigate interference effects and distortion in the receiving signal due to multipath, small scale, and large scale fading effects. This article deals with the development of reconfigurable field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based hardware for smart antenna system to explore parameter dependencies, drawbacks, and relative performance comparison of popular adaptive beamforming and interference suppression algorithms. These are least mean square, recursive least squares (RLS), and sample matrix inversion (SMI) used in real-time under laboratory environment where the existing wireless channel between transmitters and receivers is linear time-varying in nature due to presence of secondary sources giving rise to small-scale fading. For this at first, we propose a novel received signal strength indicator-based procedure to measure the radiation pattern of the antenna under an echoic indoor environment on a reconfigurable and portable FPGA system named wireless open-access research platform (WARP), controllable by generic programming codes over a user-friendly MATLAB interface. For better performance, the SMI algorithm was modified to increase block size rather than block shifting in general SMI. Later a comparative study was performed under varying conditions to observe the best utilization of three adaptive algorithms in beam shaping. In all cases, SMI performs the best with less beam shaping error and faster convergence, validating its use in a real-time fading environment.

AB  - We address the problem of designing appointment scheduling strategies in a stochastic environment accounting for patient no-shows, nonpunctuality, general stochastic service times, and unscheduled emergency walk-ins. A good appointment schedule seeks to help outpatient clinics to utilize their resources efficiently while containing patients' waiting times. The task of identifying an optimal schedule is modeled as a nonlinear integer program, where the objective function is the outcome of stochastic analysis in transient state. We maintain the discrete nature of the appointment scheduling problem by considering arrival epochs with discrete supports. By looking at discrete-time snapshots of the random evolution of a single-server queueing model, we characterize probabilistically the system's workload over time as a function of an appointment schedule, and we derive recursive expressions for the performance measures of interest. Subsequently, we unfold discrete convexity properties of the optimization problem. We prove that under general conditions the objective function is supermodular and componentwise convex. Under assumptions on patient punctuality, we prove that the optimal scheduling strategy minimizes a multimodular function, a property which guarantees that a locally optimal schedule is also globally optimal. The size of the local neighborhood, however, grows exponentially with the dimension of the problem. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to develop and implement an algorithm for minimizing locally a multimodular function over nonnegative integer vectors via submodular set-function minimization over ring families, a task that can be performed in polynomial time.

AB  - Ecological restoration is becoming mainstreamed worldwide but target ecosystems' responses to restorative interventions are not sufficiently monitored, in terms of the wide range of ecological, social, and economic attributes available. In order to highlight and better understand this problem, we conducted a literature review of the ecological, social, and economic attributes cited in the scientific literature used for monitoring the success of ecological restoration projects in Latin America and the Caribbean region, where no regional study of this kind has previously been conducted. In 84 of the 91 articles retained for the study, ecological indicators were evaluated, while only seven articles included measurements of socioeconomic indicators. Regarding the Society for Ecological Restoration Primer attributes of restored ecosystems, we only found indicators measuring attributes 1-6, with attribute 1 (species assemblages) predominating (73%), followed by physical conditions (54%) and ecological functions (51%). Brazil was the country in the region where most monitoring was being carried out (51% of the articles), and tropical rainforest (33%) and tropical dry forest (25%) were the ecosystem types where ecological restoration was most frequently monitored. Highly vulnerable ecosystems such as mangroves and paramos were underrepresented. Attributes related to ecosystem stability or to governance and education of communities were not monitored at all. More real long-term monitoring, instead of chronosequences, is needed, especially where understanding socioeconomic implications of, and barriers to, effective ecological restoration is a top priority.

AB  - This study performs a comprehensive evaluation of the objective quality of life (QOL) of the 31 provincial administrative divisions in Mainland China from 2006 to 2009 with principal component analysis (PCA). The objective QOL in China generally decreases gradually from the eastern coastal regions to the western inland regions, with a significant gap between the east and the west. Furthermore, the QOL shows an irrational developmental pattern with the natural conditions and the geographical position as the foundations, and economic development as the dominant factor. Cluster analysis is then used to analyze further the regional structural characteristics of the QOL in China. The results indicate the existence of mutual distinctions and internal differentiations among the eastern, middle, and western regions. The temporal analysis shows that the QOL in China demonstrates a continuous increase from 2006 to 2009, with a growth rate that speeds up annually. However, the increase does not mean a harmonious development in all aspects of society, but the rapid progress of socio-economic well-being, and the slow development or even deterioration of eco-environment and social security. The tendencies of the QOL in the four socio-economic regions coincide with that of the national average and the QOL of the middle and western regions increase significantly faster than that of the eastern region. However, the disparities between the eastern region and the middle and western regions expand because of the huge base of regional development differences in China.

AB  - An integrated ecotoxicological assessment of marine sediments affected by land-based marine fish farm effluents was developed using physicochemical and benthic community structure analyses and standardised laboratory bioassays with bacteria (Vibrio fischeri), amphipods (Ampelisca brevicornis) and sea urchin larvae (Paracentrotus lividus). Intertidal sediment samples were collected at five sites of the Rio San Pedro (RSP) creek, from the aquaculture effluent to a clean site. The effective concentration (EC50) from bacterial bioluminescence and A. brevicornis survival on whole sediments and P. lividus larval developmental success on sediment elutriates were assessed. Numbers of species, abundance and Shannon diversity were the biodiversity indicators measured in benthic fauna of sediment samples. In parallel, redox potential, pH, organic matter and metal levels (Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) in the sediment and dissolved oxygen in the interstitial water were measured in situ. Water and sediment physicochemical analysis revealed the exhibition of a spatial gradient in the RSP, evidenced by hypoxia/anoxia, reduced and acidic conditions, high organic enrichment and metal concentrations at the most contaminated sites. Whereas, the benthic fauna biodiversity decreased the bioassays depicted decreases in EC50, A. brevicornis survival, P. lividus larval success at sampling sites closer to the studied fish farms. This study demonstrates that the sediments polluted by fish farm effluents may lead to alterations of the biodiversity of the exposed organisms.

AB  - Dental enamel hypoplasia is a developmental defect in enamel caused by physiological stress during dental development. Previous analysis of enamel hypoplasia in sheep has demonstrated that variation in its frequency can be linked to nutrition levels, with animals suffering from malnutrition more susceptible to enamel hypoplasia formation. Variation in enamel hypoplasia frequency has also been linked to climatic and ecological factors, leading to variation in the availability of fodder supplies and, consequently, variation in nutritional intake. In this paper, the occurrence of enamel hypoplasia in two modern sheep populations is, for the first time, correlated with known seasonal physiological and nutritional stress events. Using known age-at-death data, the dental development rates for sheep are reconstructed, allowing the position of enamel hypoplasia on the tooth crown to be linked to known periods of malnutrition and physiological stress. Both populations live under identical climatic conditions but with very different diets. Clear differences are observed between the two populations, with peaks of enamel hypoplasia correlating with different seasonal periods of malnutrition as well as common physiological stressors linked to birth and weaning. This is the first time that a clear correlation has been made between seasonal variation in nutrition and the occurrence of hypoplastic enamel defects in caprine populations. As such, this study provides a baseline from which the nutritional impact of caprine foddering and husbandry practices can be determined in future archaeological studies.

AB  - Tree island ecosystems are important and distinct features of Florida Everglades wetlands. We described the inter-relationships among abiotic factors describing seasonally flooded tree islands and characterized plant-soil relationships in tree islands occurring in a relatively unimpacted area of the Everglades. We used Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to reduce our multi-factor dataset, quantified forest structure and vegetation nutrient dynamics, and related these vegetation parameters to PCA summary variables using linear regression analyses. We found that, of the 21 abiotic parameters used to characterize the ecosystem structure of seasonally flooded tree islands, 13 parameters were significantly correlated with four principal components, and they described 78% of the variance among the study islands. Most variation was described by factors related to soil oxidation and hydrology, exemplifying the sensitivity of tree island structure to hydrologic conditions. PCA summary variables describing tree island structure were related to variability in Chrysobalanus icaco (L.) canopy cover, Ilex cassine (L.) and Salix caroliniana (Michx.) canopy cover, Myrica cerifera (L.) plot frequency, litter turnover, % phosphorus resorption of co-dominant species, and nitrogen nutrient-use efficiency. This study supported findings that vegetation characteristics can be sensitive indicators of variability in tree island ecosystem structure. This study produced valuable, information which was used to recommend ecological targets (i.e. restoration performance measures) for seasonally flooded tree islands in more impacted regions of the Everglades landscape.

AB  - Diadromous faunas dominate most tropical coastal streams and rivers, but the factors controlling their distribution are not well understood. Our study documents abiotic variables controlling the distribution and abundance of the diadromous snail Neritina virginea (Gastropoda:Neritidae) in the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. An intensive survey of N. virginea density and shell size, and channel substrate, velocity, and depth was conducted at microhabitat, habitat, and reach scales of a coastal plain reach of the Rio Mameyes between August and December 2000. In addition, the inland extent of distribution (stream-network scale) and presence (regional scale) of N. virginea were surveyed in 32 coastal rivers around the island during summer 2001 and 2003. At the microhabitat scale, snail density and microhabitat electivity were greater in patches consisting of a mix of boulders and cobbles than in other types of substrate. At the habitat scale, snail density increased with depth. At the reach scale, snail density increased with fast and turbulent flows (riffle > pools > pond), whereas snail size showed the opposite pattern. At the regional scale, populations were present in 13 of 32 streams. Populations of N. virginea were not found in rivers that were disconnected from the ocean for most of the year because of channel dewatering, formation of sediment bars at their mouths, and low mean monthly discharge (Q = 0.69 m(3)/s). In contrast, rivers with N. virginea populations had a permanent (Q = 4.04 m(3)/s) or seasonal (Q = 2.88 m(3)/s) connection to the ocean over the year. At the regional scale, the inland distribution of populations was not correlated with stream gradient, but was negatively correlated with concentrations of SiO2, P, and acid neutralizing capacity of the water. Populations colonized montane reaches in only 5 rivers, all of which were forested and protected. Our study highlights the importance of taking a hierarchical approach in managing tropical coastal rivers, and the usefulness of neritid snails as biological indicators of the physical and chemical integrity of rivers.

AB  - Groundwater pollution by agrochemicals such as nitrogen fertilizers can cause complex biogeochemical transformations to take place in groundwater-dependent ecosystems. To explore the interaction between nitrogen load and groundwater-dependent, spring-fed ecosystems, a study was conducted in Latvia in an area of suspected high nitrate (NO3-) vulnerability due to its geological settings. A map of NO3- vulnerability along the margins of the carbonate aquifer in Latvia is presented. The map is based on a conceptual model that was developed during an extensive case study involving hydrological, hydrochemical, and habitat investigation of springs discharging from a karst aquifer and spring-fed ecosystems. Areas that should be prime targets for restricting fertilizer application are highlighted on the map. Although the case study revealed increased nitrogen pollution (up to 51 mg L-1, standard deviation of 9 mg L-1, in the springs discharging from the karst aquifer), no clear evidence of adverse effects due to NO3- pollution on the groundwater-dependent ecosystems using biotic indicators was found, highlighting the resilience of spring-fed ecosystems against high nitrogen inputs. In the case study, downstream groundwater-dependent ecosystems retained 70% of the reactive nitrogen during the vegetation season, but only a small proportion during the cold season. Thus, NO3- pollution can be partly mitigated by restoring wetlands along valley slopes where natural groundwater discharge takes place. The conceptual model developed for groundwater NO3- vulnerability is applicable to other areas in the Baltic region and other places with similar climatic and geological conditions.

AB  - Today, resource depletion has become a worldwide issue due to the increasing human population and related consumption. Therefore, the sustainability of renewable natural resources has recently gained great importance. To achieve a more sustainable world, sustainable development is needed. In sustainable development, the sustainable forestry holds an important part because of forests' great importance among the natural resources. Thus, the sustainable forest management (SFM) practices have been vital at this point. The present paper aims to contribute SFM applications and literature with the evaluation and interpretation of the National SFM of Turkey by calculating the importance levels (weights) of latest criteria and indicators (C&I). For this purpose, Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a hybrid approach of fuzzy logic and multi-criteria decision-making, was adopted. This adoption is due to the complex and hierarchical framework of sustainability and the suitability of the method to the subject. The present research is a case study from Kastamonu Regional Directorate of Forestry. Kastamonu holds an important part in Turkish forestry, and it has the potential to represent general condition. This study has shown that the importance attached to environment-related C&I is considerably higher than that of other SFM C&I. Furthermore, Turkey focuses more on the sustainability of wood and wood products rather than other sustainability indicators. The research has also identified that there is a classification problem for SFM indicators. The current C&I should be reviewed and localized.

AB  - Color traits are highly influenced by environmental conditions along the distributional range of many species. Studies on the variation of animal coloration across different geographic gradients are, therefore, fundamental for a better understanding of the ecological and evolutionary processes that shape color variation. Here, we address whether color lightness in velvet ants (Hymenoptera: Mutillidae) responds to latitudinal gradients and bioclimatic variations, testing three ecogeographic rules: The Thermal melanism hypothesis; the Photoprotection hypothesis; and Gloger's rule. We test these hypotheses across the New World. We used photographs of 482 specimens (n = 142 species) of female mutillid wasps and extracted data on color lightness (V). We analyzed whether variation in color is determined by bioclimatic factors, using Phylogenetic Generalized Least Square analysis. Our explanatory variables were temperature, ultraviolet radiation, humidity, and forest indicators. Our results were consistent with the Photoprotection hypothesis and Gloger's rule. Species with darker coloration occupied habitats with more vegetation, higher humidity, and UV-B radiation. However, our results refute one of the initial hypotheses suggesting that mutillids do not respond to the predictions of the Thermal melanism hypothesis. The results presented here provide the first evidence that abiotic components of the environment can act as ecological filters and as selective forces driving the body coloration of velvet ants. Finally, we suggest that studies using animals with melanin-based colors as a model for mimetic and aposematic coloration hypotheses consider that this coloration may also be under the influence of climatic factors and not only predators.

AB  - Negombo Lagoon is one of the largest lagoons in Sri Lanka. This study focused on the geochemical evaluation of poorly understood tropical subtidal sediments of the western coast, Sri Lanka. Geochemical characteristics of sediments were examined using delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotopes, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses. The chronology was determined using accelerated mass spectrometry (AMS) C-14 dates for undamaged two shells. Stratigraphic observations suggested grey to blackish fine-grained muddy clay sediments in the subtidal mudflat. The calculated organic matter and carbonate contents decrease slightly from bottom to surface sediments. Bulk C/N ratios and delta C-13 values suggested terrestrial organic matter dominant sediments such as from mangrove swamps mixed with marine dissolved organic carbon. XRD identified the crystalline phases present in sediments and thereby chemical composition was identified by the software as illite, montmorillonite, and quartz. It indicates the deposition of limited chemical weathering materials from near distance sources. FTIR identified several functional groups such as carboxylic, polysaccharide, carboxylate ions, and aliphatic substances in the lagoon sediments. The variations of carboxylic groups/carboxylate ions indicate a slow rate of decomposition of organic matter during early diagenesis. Ramification and decomposition proxies also indicate slow rates of decomposition under the anoxic condition. However, Negombo Lagoon still acts as a healthy ecosystem under the minor influence of sewage/agricultural nutrient contamination.

AB  - Alnus nitida is a monophyletic species of the Sino-Japanese belt i.e., western Himalayas and Hindu Kush region. The current study was aimed to explore vegetation structure, role of edaphic and climatic factors on distribution, plant zonation and conservation status of this Alder species in the western Himalayas and Hindu Kush parts of the Sino-Japanese region. The standard quadrat method was used for vegetation sampling. All the collected data were analyzed through Two-way Cluster Analysis, Cluster Analysis, Indicator Species Analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis using PC-ORD and CANOCO software's. Google Earth Path software (V 1.4.6) was used for the calculation of Extent of Occurrence (EOO) and Area Of Occupancy (AOO) in conjunction with IUCN red list criteria for evaluation of conservation status of Alnus nitida. A total of 146 plant species associated with Alnus nitida were reported belonging to 106 genera and 47 families from the region which clustered in 3 major zones. It was concluded that electrical conductivity, phosphorus concentration along with sandy loam soil condition and grazing pressure were the main environmental variables that play a significant role in vegetation structure, associated flora and distinct co-indicators of the Alnus nitida in the Sino-Japanese belt. The current study will provide a baseline for further comprehensive studies on Alnus nitida to explore its sustainable use and conservation priorities.

AB  - The detection and attribution of vegetation changes is a prerequisite for vegetation restoration and management. In arid and semi-arid areas, natural and anthropogenic factors interact to influence vegetation change, making it challenging to disentangle the contributions of driving forces. Here we used NDVI as an indicator of vegetation condition and analyzed its spatial and temporal changes in the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin from 2000 to 2015. Then we applied the Geodetector method, a robust spatial statistics approach, to quantify the effects of natural and anthropogenic factors on NDVI changes. NDVI across the study area showed a significant increasing trend from 2000 to 2015. Both natural and anthropogenic factors were identified as significant driving forces of NDVI change, and the factors, land use conversion type, mean annual precipitation and soil type, caused the greatest influence. The explanatory power of a single factor was often enhanced when it interacted with other factors. We also found that influencing factors often correlated with NDVI changes in a nonlinear way. Our research highlights that the Geodetector method is an effective way to disentangle the complicated driving factors of vegetation change, and our results is useful for projecting vegetation change under future environmental change and taking measures to prevent and mitigate land degradation in drylands.

AB  - Environmental agents, including socioeconomic condition, and host factors can act as causal agents and risk factors in disease. We use biomarkers and sociomarkers to study causal factors, such as overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which could play a role in disease through oxidative stress. It is therefore important to define the exact meaning of the biomarker we measure. In this review we attempt a classification of biomarkers related to oxidative stress based on their biological meaning. We define as type zero biomarkers the direct measurement of ROS in vivo in patients. Type 1 biomarkers are the most frequently used indicators of oxidative stress, represented by oxidized lipids, proteins or nucleic acids and their bases. Type 2 biomarkers are indicators of the activation of biochemical pathways that can lead to the formation of ROS. Type 3 biomarkers are host factors such as small-molecular weight antioxidants and antioxidant enzymes, while type 4 biomarkers measure genetic factors and mutations that could modify the susceptibility of an individual to oxidative stress. We also discuss whether biomarkers are actionable or not, that is if the specific blockade of these molecules can ameliorate disease or if they are just surrogate markers.
   The proposed classification of biomarkers of oxidative stress based on their meaning and ambiguities, within the theoretical framework of the oxidative stress theory of disease may help identify those diseases, and individuals, where oxidative stress has a causal role, to allow targeted therapy and personalized medicine.

AB  - We present the results of a comprehensive study of five saline rivers in the arid region of Lake Elton, including hydrobiological surveys of plankton and benthic communities. The DIABLO method was used for a statistical analysis of the associative links between the species structures of the macrozoobenthos, meiobenthos, and zooplankton communities. This method combines multidimensional ordinations based on n blocks of observations and uses special algorithms of canonical correlation. It is shown that a significant portion of the cumulative variation in the data can be explained by a consensus configuration based on information common for all the three groups of observations. The diagrams, constructed and analyzed with the use of the cluster and Generalized Procrustes analysis, enable us to isolate stable associations of taxa typical for particular biotopes with homogeneous environmental conditions. We have constructed graphs of correlation pleiades and calculated indicator significance for particular species of macrozoobenthos, meiobenthos, and zooplankton. It is shown that highly mineralized systems of arid regions are not always characterized by a pronounced specification of life forms of plankton and benthic communities. The interpenetration between benthic and plankton animals results in a high portion of mixed ecological groups. Plankton and benthic communities correlate well enough with each other, which testifies to a close relationship between them due to both biotic interactions and a mutually agreed response to changes in aquatic environment factors. These data enable us to consider the plankton and benthic communities of highly mineralized rivers a nonequilibrium dynamically changing consortia of species.

AB  - Mining of mineral resources substantially alters both the above and below-ground soil ecosystem, which then requires rehabilitation back to a pre-mining state. For belowground rehabilitation, recovery of the soil microbiome to a state which can support key biogeochemical cycles, and effective plant colonization is usually required. One solution proposed has been to translate microbial inocula from agricultural systems to mine rehabilitation scenarios, as a means of reconditioning the soil microbiome for planting. Here, we experimentally determine both the aboveground plant fitness outcomes and belowground soil microbiome effects of a commercially available soil microbial inocula (SMI). We analyzed treatment effects at four levels of complexity; no SMI addition control, Nitrogen addition alone, SMI addition and SMI plus Nitrogen addition over a 12-week period. Our culture independent analyses indicated that SMIs had a differential response over the 12-week incubation period, where only a small number of the consortium members persisted in the semi-arid ecosystem, and generated variable plant fitness responses, likely due to plant-microbiome physiological mismatching and low survival rates of many of the SMI constituents. We suggest that new developments in custom-made SMIs to increase rehabilitation success in mine site restoration are required, primarily based upon the need for SMIs to be ecologically adapted to both the prevailing edaphic conditions and a wide range of plant species likely to be encountered.

AB  - Balancing weed suppression, beneficial insect conservation, soil quality and profitability is challenging in organic cropping systems due to reliance on soil disturbance for weed control. We hypotheSied that the benefits of tillage can be retained while mitigating adverse impacts on soil quality by alternating tillage With practices that can build soil organic matter. We conducted a four-year experiment in central Pennsylvania, USA, to compare four organic feed and forage cropping systems, each differing in tillage, manure management, and cropping strategies. Each system was designed to address baseline soil quality and weed pressure conditions arising from practices implemented during the previotfs three-year transition period. To assess cumulative system effects, we established a soybean (Glycine max) uniformity trial across all systems in year four. Systems that were in perennial forage for 2 years outperformed annual crop-based systems in weed control and beneficial insect conservation, while maintaining overall profitability over the four-year study period. Soybean yields during the uniformity trial were more than 30% greater in systems that had included perennial forages than in systems with only annual crops. Labile soil carbon pools, an indicator of soil quality, were maintained over time in all systems. Our results indicate that soil quality, weed management, beneficial insect conservation, and profitability can be maintained in organic systems when periodic tillage is coupled with perennial forage crops in rotation.

AB  - Determination of time of death is a complex process taking into account numerous biological and environmental factors. These have to do with the changes taking place in the body immediately after death, mainly rigor mortis, lividity and the decrease in body temperature with the passage of time in specific ambient temperature and humidity conditions. Until recently body temperature was measured only in the rectum because the mechanisms of heat loss had been precisely established. Currently body temperature is measured in other tissues as well, including the soft tissues of the orbit. The aim of this study was to evaluate the suitability of post-mortem measurement of the decrease in temperature in the orbit for determining the time of death of an animal (a dog) while taking into account the dynamics of changes in temperature measured in the rectum.
   The carcasses of twenty dogs were examined. The temperature in the orbit and rectum was measured every half hour for 12 hours from the time of death. The body mass of the dog was found to affect the rate of the decrease in temperature in the orbital soft tissues. Because the dynamics of changes (decrease) in temperature in the orbit and rectum were uniform, temperature measurement at this site may be a valuable alternative method for determining time of death. Slight changes in ambient temperature and humidity did not affect the rate of cooling of the body.

AB  - The aim of this study is to classify the soundscape characteristics in urban parks based on perceptions of acoustic environments and to examine useful acoustic indicators to identify soundscape classifications. Both acoustic measurements and subjective evaluations of the soundscape were conducted at various locations in three urban parks. Using hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), the soundscape perceptions in urban parks were classified into three clusters characterized by the dominance of sound sources, such as traffic noise, natural and human-made sounds. Both discriminant function analysis (DFA) and artificial neural network (ANN) analysis were performed using various acoustic parameters to discern which of them best differentiate the soundscape classifications in urban parks. It was found that the indicators representing sound strength (L-Aeq), perceived pitch sensation (tau(1)) and strength of the pitch components (Phi(1)) of sound scenes could effectively identify the clusters. In particular, autocorrelation function (ACF) parameters tau(1) and Phi(1) were significantly correlated with identification of traffic noise and human sounds. It was revealed that sounds caused by various human activities in parks play an important role to influence eventfulness of soundscape perception. Soundscape perceptions were also closely correlated with esthetic quality, simplicity and sense of enclosure of landscape. Despite the fact that the results might be limited to the local conditions in Seoul, the findings could provide useful information for designing appropriate soundscapes in urban parks.

AB  - In this study, we examine the pattern of occurrence of Impatiens parviflora in Central European oak forests over time and its ecological requirements within these types of communities. Research was based on phytosociological data collected in 3776 releves. A modified TWINSPAN algorithm were used to distinguish the groups of oak forests. The ecological preferences of the I. parviflora and studied communities as well as differences between invaded and non-invaded vegetation plots were analyzed using mean weighted Ellenberg indicator values (EIVs). Finally, both the temporal pattern of I. parviflora participation and changes in its coverage in the studied communities were analyzed. Our study confirmed a high adaptability of this species with respect to temperature, moisture, soil reaction and nutrients and determined its broad ecological optimum in oak forests. However, it also revealed both a greater sensitivity of some communities within Central European oak forests to the invasion of I. parviflora and differences in habitat conditions between invaded and non-invaded vegetation plots. This suggests that the habitat niche of I. parviflora within oak forests is not accidental. The analysis of temporal changes in the frequency of I. parviflora confirmed a 20% increase in releves over the last 50 years. However, we did not identify any statistically significant rise in the coverage of I. parviflora in oak forests specifically during the studied period.

AB  - The effectiveness of spatial management strategies is typically evaluated through traditional biological measurements of size, density, biomass, and the diversity of species inside and outside management boundaries. However, there have been relatively few attempts to evaluate the processes underlying these biological patterns. In this study, we take the first step toward developing a relative index of body growth for lingcod Ophiodon elongatus using plasma insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) with the ultimate goal of measuring spatial differences in relative growth rates. Insulin-like growth factor 1 is one of the principal hormones that stimulates growth at the cellular level in all vertebrates and shows significant relationships with body growth in many fishes. In the laboratory, we found that the level of IGF1 was related to the instantaneous growth of juvenile lingcod. In the field, we measured size, condition, and plasma IGF1 level in 149 lingcod from eight locations inside and outside marine protected areas in the San Juan Islands, Washington. The IGF1 levels in wild lingcod were highly variable from site to site for both genders, and we were able to detect differences in IGF1 across space in males. Multivariate analyses showed that the spatial patterns of IGF1 differed from those of traditional biological measurements. More work is needed to validate the relationship between IGF1 and growth in larger individuals, but our research shows the potential for IGF1 to be used as an ecological indicator.

AB  - Since many soil studies have already revealed the possible risks to human health and the environment arising from contaminated soils it is therefore crucial to preserve soil quality under current and future conditions. In the last three decades a number of countries already introduced national policies and practices for the management of contaminated sites, and in 2002, an EU Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection was proposed by the European Commission.
   In this paper we review and analyse several national contaminated land policy regimes already in place in order to assess common elements and to identify specific needs in the development of national soil policies. We propose a framework that combines the D-P-S-I-R structure of policy evaluation with the Source-Pathway-Receptor approach to health risk assessment to support the development of effective country specific regulatory decisions for managing contaminated land in countries where these are yet to be implemented. The framework proposed allows decision makers to effectively use available information and to identify existing data gaps. As a result it is apparent that while there are technical aspects of site characterisation, risk assessment and remediation processes that could be commonly implemented at an EU level there are certain trans-scientific aspects that require political choices and need to be customized by EU Member States.

AB  - Tropical dry forests may be among the world's most threatened ecosystems, but few studies have objectively quantified their status and threats. This study analysed Venezuelan dry forests at multiple scales, assessing status, present threats and the policy context shaping their future. Historical and current dry forest cover at both national and local scales were contrasted, and a set of quantitative risk assessment criteria applied. While dry forests were vulnerable nationally, in northern-central locations they were endangered. Clearing for cattle ranching and for intensive and subsistence agriculture were the principal factors driving dry forest loss at the national scale, while at a local level, urbanization and fire seemed to be the primary threats. The analysis emphasized the separation of risk assessment from the very different task of establishing conservation priorities; high risk areas may not necessarily be the highest priority for investment, and policy makers may become explicitly aware of the spatial scale at which their policies are implemented, as well as how these policies may affect or be affected by the status of ecosystems beyond their area of influence. The main challenge to future dry forest conservation is a paucity of explicit policies for management and use. However, scientifically-based management can support positive dry forest policies in many ways, including identifying locations and protocols for ecological restoration, maintaining seed banks, quantifying baseline conditions, and monitoring genetic diversity and other indicators.

AB  - Debris flow alluvial fans (DFAFs) are vulnerable, although they can be used as a natural resource. The relationships between different factors related to DFAF systems and between these factors and systems are important both for identifying the risks and opportunities presented by DFAFs and for tracking system status. In this regard, resilience may be used to characterize the status of a DFAF. This study aimed to explore the processes and mechanisms of interactions among the social, economic, and ecological factors related to DFAF with respect to resilience, and to discuss potential problems in a representative DFAF. Based on the site condition and characteristics of the Awang DFAF (China) in the period 1996?2017, we formed a comprehensive indicator evaluation framework by analyzing disturbance, function, and feedback. We also established a model for evaluating resilience by integrating the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) ? an entropy evaluation method (EEM) and set pair analysis (SPA). The results showed that the system of the studied DFAF was dynamically stable. The domination of the ecological system was subsequently superseded by social and economic resilience. While disturbance had direct and immediate effects, coping ability was cumulative and characterized by hysteresis at a particular response time. Overall, resilience fluctuated within an acceptable range rather than linearly increasing or decreasing. This analysis illuminated the dynamic processes of DFAFs and contributed to the understanding and planning of system trade-offs and degraded-land utilization.

AB  - Salinity is a major environmental stress that limits plant production and portraits a critical challenge to food security in the world. In this research, the impacts of plant growth-promoting bacteria (Pseudomonas RS-198 and Azospirillum brasilense RS-SP7) and foliar application of plant hormones (salicylic acid 1 mM and jasmonic acid 0.5 mM) on alleviating the harmful effects of salt stress in rapeseed plants (Brassica napus cv. okapi) were examined under greenhouse condition. Salt stress diminished rapeseed biomass, leaf area, water content, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and chlorophyll content, while it increased sodium content, endogenous salicylic and jasmonic acids, osmolyte production, H2O2 and O-2(center dot-) generations, TBARS content, and antioxidant enzyme activities. Plant growth, nutrient content, leaf expansion, osmolyte production, and antioxidant enzyme activities were increased, but oxidative and osmotic stress indicators were decreased by bacteria inoculation + salicylic acid under salt stress. Antioxidant enzyme activities were amplified by jasmonic acid treatments under salt stress, although rapeseed growth was not generally affected by jasmonic acid. Bacterial + hormonal treatments were superior to individual treatments in reducing detrimental effects of salt stress. The best treatment in rectifying rapeseed growth under salt stress was combination of Pseudomonas and salicylic acid. This combination attenuated destructive salinity properties and subsequently amended rapeseed growth via enhancing endogenous salicylic acid content and some essential nutrients such as potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium.

AB  - There are few beneficial management practices (BMPs) with demonstrated efficacy in snowmelt-dominated regions. Small reservoirs are a BMP that can help mitigate flooding and reduce sediment transport, while reducing export of dissolved nutrients. To understand controls on nitrate removal and assess how this ecosystem service can be optimized, denitrification activity was measured in reservoirs and stream pools of the Tobacco Creek Model Watershed (Manitoba, Canada) via the chloramphenicol-amended acetylene block technique. Denitrification activity was positively correlated with nitrate and sediment organic carbon (SOC), and negatively correlated with sediment particle size and pH. Reservoirs exhibited higher denitrification activity than stream pools and were associated with higher levels of SOC, higher nitrate in early summer, and lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen. Nitrate was added to a set of samples to test for nitrate saturation, an indicator of poor ecological status, where nitrate concentrations exceed the denitrification capacity of microbes. Forty-nine percent of measurements demonstrated nitrate saturation, indicative of the need for additional remediation activity. Findings from this research suggest this BMP has higher capacity for nitrogen removal than stream pools because of higher denitrification rates and a higher apparent threshold for nitrate saturation, coupled with increased residence times. Results also inform the construction of additional reservoirs, which have been identified as a priority BMP in this region. Siting reservoirs in areas where conditions contribute to buildup of fine sediments and planting riparian vegetation to foster high organic C availability may help optimize denitrification, although tradeoffs in terms of other ecosystem services must be considered.

AB  - Everglades restoration is dependent on constructed wetlands to treat agricultural phosphorus (P)-enriched runoff prior to delivery to the Everglades. Over the last 5 years, P concentrations delivered to the northern boundary of Everglades National Park (Park) have remained higher than the 8 mu g L-1-target identified to be protective of flora and fauna. Historically, Everglades hydrology was driven by rainfall that would then sheetflow through the system. The system is now divided into a number of large impoundments. We use sodium-to-calcium ratios as a water source discriminator to assess the influence of management and environmental conditions to understand why P concentrations in Park inflows remain higher than that of the target. Runoff from Water Conservation Area 3A (Area 3A) and canal water from areas north of Area 3A are two major sources of water to the Park, and both have distinct Na:Ca ratios. The P concentrations of Park inflows have decreased since the 1980s, and from June 1994 through May 2000, concentrations were the lowest when Area 3A water depths were the deepest. Area 3A depths declined following this period and P concentrations subsequently increased. Further, some water sources for the Park are not treated and are impeding concentration reductions. Promoting sheetflow over channelized flow and treating untreated water sources can work in conjunction with constructed wetlands to further reduce nutrient loading to the sensitive Everglades ecosystem.

AB  - The evaluation of the overall performance of a green building is complex, since many construction, energy and environmental aspects have to be considered. The Umbria Region in Italy, through various public tenders, recently funded several residential buildings, innovative in terms of construction quality, green technologies and sustainable solutions, such as natural building materials, integrated sunspaces, PV (photovoltaic) modules and solar collectors, geothermal heat pumps, that had to be adopted to obtain the public contribution. The University of Perugia carried out an extended monitoring of these buildings, in order to verify the actual achievement of design objectives, to certify the real savings in terms of energy and environmental loads and to assess the indoor comfort conditions for occupants. In situ thermal, acoustical and lighting measurements were carried out for more than one year. Energy simulations were performed by means of codes which implement the algorithms required by the Italian Law. Moreover, a comparison between real consumptions and simulated energy requirements was carried out. Finally, the buildings were characterized from the environmental sustainability point of view, using the method adopted by the Umbria Region. This assessment was borrowed from ITACA (Institute for Innovation and Transparency in Government Procurement and Environmental Compatibility) procedure [an Italian procedure similar to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)] and consists of 20 worksheets, one for each different performance indicator, at the aim of carefully describing the environmental quality of the building.

AB  - The need for practical, repeatable, and technically sound ecosystem assessment methods remains essential to natural resource management. Rapid assessment methodologies determining ecosystem condition and function continue expansion, especially within wetlands. Few studies determine the accuracy of rapid assessment approaches by applying quantitative parameters, especially with respect to biogeochemical functions. Functional measurements require extensive sampling and analytical expertise, beyond financial and time constraints of most restoration projects. Further, measuring biogeochemical ecosystem functions requires the coupling of abundance measures (e.g., soil nutrient concentrations) with processing or transport mechanisms (e.g., microbial activity, flood frequency). This work assessed nutrient cycling, organic C export, and water quality improvement functions applied to >300 km(2) of restored bottomland hardwood forests, Mississippi River Valley. Assessment parameters (e.g., sapling shrub density, organic soil horizon thickness) and biogeochemical measures (e.g., microbial biomass C, potentially mineralizable N) were determined at 45 reforested areas and 21 control locations representing an 80-yr restoration chronosequence. Significantly higher rapid assessment outcomes were associated with increased ecosystem functionality (P = 0.001-0.029). These findings suggest that rapid assessment tools serve as reliable proxies for measurements of nutrient and biogeochemical cycling; validating the procedure examined. Assessment scores were also associated with increased restoration stand age (p(s) < 0.001) supporting further development of similar rapid assessments using ecosystem classification, qualitative data collection, and scaling based on reference data. The wide variety of rapid assessments in use underscores the need for validation with biogeochemical and hydrological measurements.

AB  - The increasing threat of global climate change is predicted to have immense influences on ecosystems worldwide, but could be particularly severe to vulnerable wetland environments such as the Everglades. This work investigates the impact global climate change could have on the hydrologic and vegetative makeup of Everglades National Park (ENP) under forecasted emissions scenarios. Using a simple stochastic model of aboveground water levels driven by a fluctuating rainfall input, we link across ENP a location's mean depth and percent time of inundation to the predicted changes in precipitation from climate change. Changes in the hydrologic makeup of ENP are then related to changes in vegetation community composition through the use of relationships developed between two publically available datasets. Results show that under increasing emissions scenarios mean annual precipitation was forecasted to decrease across ENP leading to a marked hydrologic change across the region. Namely, areas were predicted to be shallower in average depth of standing water and inundated less of the time. These hydrologic changes in turn lead to a shift in ENP's vegetative makeup, with xeric vegetative communities becoming more numerous and hydric vegetative communities becoming scarcer. Noticeably, the most widespread of vegetative communities, sawgrass, decreases in abundance under increasing emissions scenarios. These results are an important indicator of the effects climate change may have on the Everglades region and raise important management implications for those seeking to restore this area to its historical hydrologic and vegetative condition.

AB  - In anthropological analyses of past populations, it is very important to be able to accurately reconstruct the palaeodemographic profile in order to interpret infant mortality as an indicator of the environmental, social and cultural conditions. There are various methods to evaluate the age of immature individuals but some of these methods are strongly influenced by the different rates of skeletal development observed in populations from various geographical areas and/or from various time periods, as well as between the sexes. Clearly, there is a need for adopting a method of estimation of age at death, which will be the one most suitable for analysing the particular skeletal sample.
   In this study we investigated subadults from the Egyptian osteological collection housed in the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography of the University of Turin. For each individual, the age at death was estimated based on the degree of eruption and mineralisation of the teeth. Then the estimated age at death was correlated with the measurements of the long bones and ilium.
   We showed that greater regularity and constancy of rates of skeletal growth could be assessed with measurements, alternative to using maximum length of diaphysis. Moreover, using alternative characters, it was possible to markedly increase the number of individuals whose age at death could be estimated. Our study also showed the need to use a reference sample consistent with the sample being analysed and, which was derived from similar biological-environmental context. Therefore, our proposed method can be used for the estimation of age at death in pre/protohistorical populations from the Mediterranean region.

AB  - The knowledge of enteric bacteria survival kinetic is very important for environmental scientists. Enteric bacteria and specifically the fecal indicator bacteria are typically used to measure the sanitary quality of water for recreational, industrial, agricultural and water supply purposes. They are released into the environment with feces, and are then exposed to a variety of environmental conditions that eventually cause their death. In general, it is believed that the fecal indicator cannot grow in natural environments, since they are adapted to live in the gastrointestinal tract. Studies have shown that fecal indicator bacteria survive from a few hours up to several days in surface water, but may survive for days or months in lake-sediments, where they may be protected from sunlight and predators. We assume that pathogens similar to the fecal indicator bacteria die at the same rate as fecal indicator bacteria. Therefore, if we find relatively high numbers of fecal indicator bacteria in an environment, we assume that there is an increased likelihood of pathogens being present as well. The kinetic of enteric bacteria survival in natural waters is affected by a large number of factors. One of them is the temperature. The aim of this contribution was the experimental research of the survival kinetic of enteric bacteria applying a simple mathematical formula, which describes the survival kinetic predicting the decay phase at various temperatures. We aspire that the results will lead both to the solution of many engineering problems and to future research.

AB  - Diatom, chrysophyte cyst, benthic cladocera, planktonic cladocera, and chironomid assemblages were studied in the surface sediments of 68 small lakes along an altitudinal gradient from 300 to 2350 m in Switzerland. In addition, 43 environmental variables relating to the physical limnology, geography, catchment characteristics, climate, and water chemistry were recorded or measured for each lake. The explanatory power of each of these predictor variables for the different biological data-sets was estimated by a series of canonical correspondence analyses (CCA) and the statistical significance of each model was assessed by Monte Carlo permutation tests. A minimal set of environmental variables was found for each biological data-set by a forward-selection procedure within CCA. The unique, independent explanatory power of each set of environmental variables was estimated by a series of CCAs and partial CCAs. Inference models or transfer functions for mean summer (June, July, August) air temperature were developed for each biological data-set using weighted-averaging partial least squares or partial least squares. The final transfer functions, after data screening, have root mean squared errors of prediction, as assessed by leave-one-out cross-validation, of 1.37 degrees C (chironomids), 1.60 degrees C (benthic cladocera), 1.62 degrees C (diatoms), 1.77 degrees C (planktonic cladocera), and 2.23 degrees C (chrysophyte cysts).

AB  - Swimming pool environments may cause various diseases to swimmers due to the transmission of microbial contamination if not maintained properly. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the bacterial contaminations in four swimming pools in the east of Tehran, Iran. Samples were collected from five sampling points (low depth, regular depth, deep, hot tub, and cooling pond) twice in a month during the summer season (June-August 2019). A total number of 120 samples were taken from swimming pools, as recommended by national standards. The bacterial contamination (coliform, heterotrophic, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), together with physical-chemical parameters, was measured. Average values for residual chlorine and pH were found in accordance with the national guidelines (P > 0.05). In contrast, the mean value for turbidity was not in compliance with the national standards (P <= 0.001). Moreover, the prevalence of coliforms, heterotrophic bacteria, P. aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus was at acceptable levels of 100, 97.5, 97.5, and 90.2%, respectively. Additionally, a direct association was found between turbidity and pH (r = 0.396) as well as P. aeruginosa (r = 1.182) and S. aureus (r = 0.275). Unlike turbidity, residual chlorine showed a weak and inverse relationship with S. aureus (r = - 0.257). Results indicated that the average microbial quality of swimming pool water was at desirable levels. However, to improve the hygienic condition of pools, periodic monitoring of above-mentioned indicators and training of pool operators are necessary. Further, studies on other physical, chemical, and biological contaminations may be required.

AB  - Species diversity in a community is mainly related to the number and abundance of species that form it. N-90 is a recently developed diversity index based on the results of the similarity percentage (SIMPER) analysis that represents the number of species contributing up to ninety percent of within-group similarity in a group of samples. The calculation of N-90 is based on the Bray-Curtis similarity index and involves the number of species and abundances in a group of samples. We have explored the properties of N-90 compared to other alpha, beta and gamma diversity indices and to beta diversity measures accounting for nestedness and turnover. We have used a non-real data set to compare the values of all indices with N-90 and two real data sets of demersal fish communities along large and short depth gradients with higher influence of turnover and nestedness, respectively, to correlate the same indices with N-90. The sensitivity of N-90 to reductions in the frequency of occurrence and the evenness of the distribution of species abundances among samples allows the detection of diversity loss due to the fishing-induced retreatment of species populations to localities presenting the most favorable ecological conditions. This property, both in the identification of species replacement and species loss through SIMPER analysis, make N-90 a useful indicator to support the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries within the current context of global change.

AB  - Temporary high-elevation lakes represent vulnerable and unstable environments strongly threatened by tourism, hydrogeological transformations and climate changes. In-depth scientific knowledge on these peculiar habitats is needed, on which to base integrated and sustainable management plans. Freshwater diatoms, thanks to their high diversity and their particular sensitivity to the water chemistry, can be considered powerful ecological indicators, as they are able to reflect environmental changes over time. The aim of the present study was to analyze the diatomic diversity of the Pilato and Palazzo Borghese lakes, two small temporary high-mountain basins, falling in a protected area within the Apennine mountains chain (central Italy). Diatoms data were collected, at the same time as 12 physicochemical parameters, through six microhabitat samplings, from 17 June to 30 August 2019. In both lakes, a total of 111 diatomic species and varieties were identified. The most species-rich genera were Gomphonema, Navicula, and Nitzschia. The Pilato Lake showed a diatomic community dominated by few species, favored by more stable and predictable environmental conditions than the Palazzo Borghese Lake, which hosted a more diversified community, guaranteed by greater spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Both lakes were characterized by the presence of diatomic species typical of good quality waters. The occurrence of numerous aerial species reflected adaptation strategies adopted to colonize environments subjected to extended drought periods. Endangered diatomic species of particular conservational interest were recorded, confirming the need to preserve their habitats.

AB  - Aim. To assess the resistance of soils in the south of Russia to silver pollution using biological indicators.
   Methods. The contamination of soils in southern Russia (ordinary chernozem, grey sandy and brown forest soils) was simulated with silver under laboratory conditions. Soils were contaminated with water-soluble silver nitrate in order to reveal the maximum ecotoxicity of silver. Soil stability was assessed according to the most sensitive and informative biological parameters in dynamics of 10, 30 and 90 days after pollution.
   Results. Silver contamination inhibits the activity of oxidoreductases (catalase and dehydrogenases), reduces the total number of bacteria and the growth and development of radish. For all soils, a direct relationship was noted between silver concentration and the degree of deterioration of soil properties. The toxic effect of silver was most pronounced on the 30th day after contamination. According to their resistance to silver pollution, the soils investigated form the following sequence: ordinary chernozem> grey sandy soil >= brown forest soil.
   Conclusion. The light granulometric composition of grey sandy soils and the acidic reaction of the environment of brown forest soils, as well as the low organic matter content, contribute to the high mobility and high ecotoxicity of silver in these soils. Regional maximum permissible concentrations (MPCs) of silver content in ordinary chernozems, grey sandy and brown forest soils have been determined as - 4.4, 0.9 and 0.8 mg/kg, respectively.

AB  - Surface water contains a large number of pollutants, particularly human pathogens, organic toxicants and heavy metals. Due to the toxic nature of heavy metals towards marine organisms, its removal from the environment has been a growing issue. The biosorption of heavy metal ions from surface water using fish scales has emerged as an environmentally friendly technique. This study assessed the degree of heavy metals accumulation in the scales of Oreochromis niloticus and determining its efficiency as a bioindicator for Cu, Mn and Fe ions removal in the environment of Wewe and Owabi rivers. This study shows that the levels of Cu, Mn, Fe adsorbed from the Owabi river were 685.70 +/- 16.51, 247.06 +/- 50.46 and 892.90 +/- 96.29 mg/kg, respectively. Moreover, the levels of Cu, Mn and Fe adsorbed from Wewe river were 501.60 +/- 77.78, 300.89 +/- 54.61 and 413.04 +/- 9.92 mg/kg, respectively. Under best optimum adsorption conditions, Cu was the best removed heavy metal ions in both surface water reservoirs. Multivariate analysis showed that Cu and Mn showed association in Owabi river, while Mn and Fe were correlated in Wewe river signifying their similarities to a common anthropogenic activity. The Fourier-transform infrared spectrum revealed the existence of a nitro, amine, and carbonyl groups in the biosorption process. This study highlighted that Oreochromis niloticus scales was an efficient bio-sorbent in removing Cu, Mn and Fe ions from Owabi and Wewe rivers.

AB  - Growing environmental awareness has made customers change their attitudes and increasingly demand that the hospitality industry provides products and services that are environmentally friendly. This sector faces increasing pressure to operate in a more ecofriendly manner given its negative influence on the natural environment. Extant research demonstrates that sustainable tourism can be promoted through environmental certifications. However, little attention has been paid to the relevance of customer perceptions about these schemes and their influence on customer behavioral intentions. So that, this study attempts to explore the conditions under which perceived green image leads to favorable customer behavioral intentions towards environmentally certified hotels by considering the mediating effects of functional and emotional images. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data from hotel customers in Spain. The results indicate that green image serves as a predictor of functional image, which in turn is linked to customer behavioral intentions. This shows that the evaluation of environmental issues influences the assessment of cognitive aspects, although not the direct evaluation of affective aspects. Consequently, green image associations directly influence the cognitive responses of consumers but not their emotions. Therefore, consumers will evaluate a hotel's functional image not only by considering traditional attributes but also by taking into account environmental issues. These findings suggest that hotel companies should work to develop a green positioning strategy developing products and services possessing both greenness and high-value attributes.

AB  - Environmental gradients may influence species distributions by filtering their functional traits, resulting in a correspondence between community functional composition and local environmental conditions. We used a vegetation gradient as an indicator for environmental complexity to test whether it predicted the morphological composition of ground-dwelling ant assemblages across geographic extents. The sampling design covered 126 plots distributed across eight sampling sites along a broad environmental gradient in the Amazon Basin. Plots covered different phytophysiognomies that have a strong relation with forest biomass and, consequently, litter production. We selected six morphological traits related to ant foraging strategies and behavior. Generalized linear mixed models were used to predict how environmental complexity affects trait composition of ground dwelling ant assemblages. Structurally less complex environments (eg. Amazonian savannah) harboured more species of smaller ants, with relatively smaller mandibles and relatively larger eyes. In more complex environments (eg. dense ombrophylous forest), there were more ant species of larger size, with relatively larger mandibles and relatively smaller eyes. No relationship was detected between relative femur length and the environmental gradient investigated. The functional approach focused on individual traits may illuminate which ant foraging strategies are best adapted to a particular habitat. Our data reveal that the morphological composition of ground-dewelling ant assemblages responds clearly to environmental complexity suggesting that certain ant characteristics offer ecological advantages to particular species in particular habitats.

AB  - This paper presents lithologic and geochemical data from the sequence of the Eocene Irbit formation siliceous rocks (Transuralian Region) outcropping in a quarry in the Irbit deposit (thickness of 15m) and in a large natural outcrop, Belaya Gorka (thickness of 13m). The data show that both outcrops are composed of diatomites and clayey diatomites, both characterized by a certain degree of lithologic heterogeneity around their chemical, granulometric, and mineralogical compositions; microstructural features; and degree of diatom preservation. The values of indices important for the classification of siliceous rocks and determination of prospects for their industrial applicationSiO(2), Al2O3, Fe2O3, and clay fraction contentranged from 66% to 77%, 7% to 14%, 3.00% to 5.60%, and 23% to 50%, respectively. In all studied lithologic varieties, element abundances of V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, and Sb were two to three times higher than their respective abundances in the Earth's crust. This is probably related to these elements' involvement in the biological cycle and favorable conditions for transport. Rb, Cs, Ba, and Sr, as well as rare earth elements, are considered the most reliable indicators of lithologic and geochemical subdivision of a sequence of siliceous rocks, as they are associated mainly with clayey minerals. Variations in these indicators have recorded, with great probability, even short-term cycles and semi-cycles of silica sedimentation in the Transuralian Region, as well as tectonic regime and involvement of terrigenous influx.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms which determine the capacity of any species to adapt to changing environmental conditions is one of the foremost requirements in accurately predicting which populations, species and clades are likely to survive ongoing, rapid climate change. The polar oceans are amongst the most rapidly changing environments on Earth with reduced regional sea ice duration and extent, and their fauna's expected sensitivity to warming and acidification. These changes potentially pose a significant threat to a number of polar fauna. There is, therefore, a critical need to assess the vulnerability of a wide range of species to determine the tipping points or weak links in marine assemblages. Knowledge of the effect of multiple stressors on polar marine fauna has advanced over the last 40 years, but there are still many data gaps. This study applies ecological risk assessment techniques to the increasing knowledge of polar species' physiological capacities to identify their exposure to climate change and their vulnerability to this exposure. This relatively rapid, semi-quantitative assessment provides a layer of vulnerability on top of climate envelope models, until such times as more extensive physiological data sets can be produced. The risk assessment identified more species that are likely to benefit from the near-future predicted change (the winners), especially predators and deposit feeders. Fewer species were scored at risk (the losers), although animals that feed on krill scored consistently as under the highest risk.

AB  - Hydrological alterations in Alpine rivers have been largely increasing due to the combined effects of global climate change and local impacts. Water flow intermittency starts with a process called lentification, which leads to the transformation of the aquatic ecosystem with severe consequences on biotic communities. These consequences have a greater impact in Alpine headwater streams, which are considered important and fragile hotspots of biodiversity and a source of threatened species; the new regime creates conditions to which native biota are poorly adapted. The main aim of our work was to evaluate taxonomical, functional and structural changes of diatom communities in Alpine rivers during the lentification process that precedes a supra-seasonal drought. Contrary to what was expected, communities exposed to river shrinking showed a level of homogeneity comparable to those collected in permanent sections. We therefore hypothesized that lentification created an intermediate disturbance that favoured heterogeneity of assemblages. Conversely, ecological guilds, growth forms and eco-morphological groups varied along temporal and spatial gradients driven by the lentification process. Small, motile and medium-sized low profile species were more abundant during summer, as well as adnate and stalked ones. Lentification limited the presence of high profile guilds and mucous-forming colonies. Droughts in Alpine streams are fairly recent processes, and the dynamics of aquatic communities facing water scarcity are largely unknown. The results we obtained provide important insights towards a more refined functional classification of diatoms for evaluating hydrological alterations.

AB  - Analyses of biofilm community structure may potentially be employed for aquatic ecosystem health assessment, however, to date, biofilm diversity within urban lakes using reclaimed water has not been examined. Accordingly, the microbial community diversity and structure of biofilms from the surface of multiple matrices with varying roughness (0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 mu m) were characterized using a suite of molecular techniques including scanning electron microscopy, genetic fingerprinting and phospholipid-derived fatty acid analyses. Samples were largely comprised of inorganic particles, algae and numerous bacterial species; 12 phospholipid-derived fatty acid (PLFA) typeswere identified, significantly less than typically associated with sewage. Both growth matrix surface roughness and biofilm growth phase were shown to concur with significantly different microbial quantity and community structures. Gram-negative bacteria bacillus i15: 03OH and 18: 0 were the dominant bacterial genera, collectively comprising similar to 75 % of identified PLFA species content. Calculated species diversity (H) and species dominance (D) exhibited identical correlational patterns with measured water quality parameters; significant positive correlations were exhibited with respect toMg 2, while significant negative correlations were found for NO3, TP, BOD, COD, SP, PO4, SO4 and pH. Results indicate that analyses of biofilm formation and structure could be effectively used to undertake integrated assessments of the ecological health of lake systems using reclaimed water. Further work is required to elucidate the optimum conditions for sample collection and analytical interpretation.

AB  - Fungal diversity plays an important role in forest ecosystems stability as well in the health status of mycorrhizal forest trees. At research area in Istria, Croatia, pathogenic fungus Sphaeropsis tip blight (Sphaeropsis sapinea (Fr.) Dyko et Sutton) caused substantial damage in Austrian pine (Pinus nigra J. F. Arnold) plantations during the last decades. This research continues on previous done in Austrian pine plantations on predisposition to S. sapinea infections, where site and stress conditions were determined as key factors, but also, the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi were confirmed as biological indicators of the health status in selected plantations. We analyzed fungal diversity of Austrian pine plantations to determine the dependence of species richness and its diversity index, both for total and ECM species only, in relation to S. sapinea infection rate and crown transparency of selected trees. Fungal samples were collected during 2013 at nine permanent research plots in autumn season. Their total and ECM species richness and diversity index were correlated to Sphaeropsis tip blight infection level and crown transparency. Our results did not confirm the hypothesis that Austrian pine plantations with higher total species richness and its diversity index are more resistant to S. sapinea infection nor to crown transparency. Oppositely, ectomycorrhizal species richness and its diversity index might be used as good biological indicators of S. sapinea presence and crown transparency of studied plantations.

AB  - Biocides are critical components of hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") fluids used for unconventional shale gas development. Bacteria may cause bioclogging and inhibit gas extraction, produce toxic hydrogen sulfide, and induce corrosion leading to downhole equipment failure. The use of biocides such as glutaraldehyde and quaternary ammonium compounds has spurred a public concern and debate among regulators regarding the impact of inadvertent releases into the environment on ecosystem and human health. This work provides a critical review of the potential fate and toxicity of biocides used in hydraulic fracturing operations. We identified the following physicochemical and toxicological aspects as well as knowledge gaps that should be considered when selecting biocides: (1) uncharged species will dominate in the aqueous phase and be subject to degradation and transport whereas charged species will sorb to soils and be less bioavailable; (2) many biocides are short-lived or degradable through abiotic and biotic processes, but some may transform into more toxic or persistent compounds; (3) understanding of biocides' fate under downhole conditions (high pressure, temperature, and salt and organic matter concentrations) is limited; (4) several biocidal alternatives exist, but high cost, high energy demands, and/or formation of disinfection byproducts limits their use. This review may serve as a guide for environmental risk assessment and identification of microbial control strategies to help develop a sustainable path for managing hydraulic fracturing fluids.

AB  - Plant species in dryland ecosystems are limited by water availability and may be vulnerable to increases in aridity. Methods are needed to monitor and assess the rate of change in plant abundance and composition in relation to climate, understand the potential for degradation in dryland ecosystems, and forecast future changes in plant species assemblages. I employ nearly a century of vegetation monitoring data from three North American deserts to demonstrate an approach to determine plant species responses to climate and critical points over a range of climatic conditions at which plant species shift from increases to decreases in abundance (climate pivot points). I assess these metrics from a site to regional scale and highlight how these indicators of plant performance can be modified by the physical and biotic environment. For example, shrubs were more responsive to drought and high temperatures on shallow soils with limited capacity to store water and fine-textured soils with slow percolation rates, whereas perennial grasses were more responsive to precipitation in sparse shrublands than in relatively dense grasslands and shrublands, where competition for water is likely more intense. The responses and associated climate pivot points of plant species aligned with their lifespan and structural characteristics, and the relationship between responses and climate pivot points provides evidence of the trade-off between the capacity of a plant species to increase in abundance when water is available and its drought resistance.

AB  - In order to identify the distinctive traits of old-growth forests in a Mediterranean context, deadwood occurrence and forest stand structures were investigated in remote forests not subject to anthropogenic disturbance over the past few decades. Five study sites in south-central Italy were selected, and structural parameters were recorded in 1-ha plots. Living trees, deadwood, types, and decay stages were inventoried in the selected sites. Living tree volumes and amounts of deadwood indicated large variability among the investigated forest stands, ranging from 363 to 702 m(3).ha(-1) for living trees and from 17 to 143 m(3.)ha(-1) for deadwood. Downed deadwood was the most abundant component, due to the natural mortality occurring in the stands. Stumps were the least common among the types of deadwood. All the decay classes were present in each study site. The main structural features useful for characterizing these old-growth forest stands included a multi-sized diameter distribution of living trees, the presence of small-scale gap dynamics, tree height heterogeneity, and high values of living volume and basal area. A ratio of dead to living wood not lower than 10%, downed deadwood much more abundant than standing deadwood, and a large range of deadwood size and decay classes across all the deadwood components are useful traits for tracking old-growth stages in these Mediterranean forests.

AB  - A geo-referenced modeling system was developed in this study to investigate the spatiotemporal variability of pesticide distributions and associated ecosystem risks. In the modeling system, pesticide fate and transport processes in soil-canopy system were simulated at field scale by the pesticide root zone model (PRZM). Edge-of-field mass fluxes were up-scaled with a spatially distributed flow-routing model to predict pesticide contaminations in surface water. The developed model was applied to the field conditions of the Orestimba Creek watershed, an agriculturally-dominated area in California's Central Valley during 1990 through 2006, with the organophosphate insecticides diazinon and chlorpyrifos as test agents. High concentrations of dissolved pesticides were predicted at the watershed outlet during the irrigation season of April through November, due to the intensive pesticide use and low stream flow. Concentration violations, according to the California aquatic life criteria, were observed for diazinon before 2001, and for chlorpyrifos during the entire simulation period. Predicted pesticide exposure levels showed potential adverse effects on certain genera of sensitive aquatic invertebrates in the ecosystem of the Orestimba Creek. Modeling assessments were conducted to identify the factors governing spatial patterns and seasonal trends on pesticide distribution and contamination potentials to the studied aquatic ecosystem. Arm with high pesticide yields to surface water were indicated for future research and additional studies focused on monitoring and mitigation efforts within the watershed. Improved irrigation techniques and management practices were also suggested to reduce the violations of pesticide concentrations during irrigation seasons.

AB  - Pollution loads from land sources and their impact on the receiving waters can be predicted by using land-use and surface water quality models, respectively. In this paper details are given of the development of an integrated modelling system for managing water quality in coastal basins. The system includes a model linking the pollution input loads to land-use and a model for simulating surface flow and chemical and biological processes. The land-use model consists of two main components: a database and a model base. It uses a GIS system, namely ArcGIS, as the model platform. The database, built in the Geo-database format, includes six data sets containing information on social, economical, bathymetrical and hydrological aspects of a study area. The model base includes a series of transfer functions that link the pollution loads to key sources, including those from: industrial, domestic and agricultural inputs, and fish and animal farming. The water quality model is a numerical model which solves the governing equations representing the physical, chemical and biological processes in coastal waters. The modelling system was set up for Bobai Bay in China, with the land-use model being used to provide nutrient loadings from individual inputs and the water quality model used to predict the impact of these inputs on the receiving waters. Model simulations were also undertaken to predict the water quality conditions for various development and management scenarios. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A growing number of studies suggest that ecological quality status assessment in transitional waters should rely upon functional indicators rather than structural indices. The experimental study of decomposition rates using leaf-bags are among the former. A recent example was conducted in Ria de Aveiro, Western Portugal, and the decomposition rates of Phragmites australis obtained through the registration of the biomass decrease in leaf samples left in the estuary for fixed periods of time (7, 15, 30 and 60 days). The leaf-bags were recollected from the field and the accompanying fauna retained, for comparison to that obtained in sediment samples taken with a hand-held corer. The study was conducted in five areas covering the full salinity gradient, in three sites per area and four replicates per site. A total of 89 taxa were registered, 70 in the leaf-bags and 50 in the sediment samples. 39 taxa were sampled only in the leaf-bags, 19 only in the corers and 31 were common. From marine to freshwater areas, average abundance increased in both types of samples, and species richness and diversity diminished, except in freshwater and in the leaf-bags. Both samplers portrayed the succession from the marine to the freshwater areas, and the benthic community was found significantly different between all areas except between the two located closer to the estuarine entrance, equally by both samplers. Despite these similarities, the benthic communities sampled by the two methods were significantly different, either dominated by annelids (corers), or by arthropods (leaf-bags), amphipods in the estuary and insects in freshwater. These differences were not significant neither in the freshwater, due to paucity of the endofauna in freshwater, nor in the fully marine area, possibly due to the high variability of samples within the area. These results indicate that the estuarine benthic invertebrates upon which the taxonomic indices are calculated and those which contribute to the functional aspects based in the study of decomposition rates, are essentially very distinct.

AB  - In this work, a cascade refrigeration system operating with four different ecological refrigerant pairs was modeled. This system uses R744 (Carbon dioxide) in the low-temperature cycle and operates with R290 (propane), R1234yf (2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene), R152a (1,1-difluorethane), and R717 (ammonia) in the high-temperature cycle. Energetic, exergetic, environmental, and economic performance of the cascade system was investigated to determine the most appropriate ecological refrigerant couple. The parameters used in each mentioned performance were COP (Coefficient of Performance), eta(exergy) (Exergy Efficiency), TEWI (Total Equivalent Warming Impact), ECOP (Ecological coefficient of performance), and (C)over dot(total) (Total plant cost rate), respectively. The results showed that the cascade refrigeration system operating with R744/R717 provided the best performance for the thermodynamic conditions analyzed, presenting a COP of 2.10, eta(exergy) of 56.9%, (C)over dot(total) of 24 334 USD/year, ECOP of 4.86, and TEWI of 25.67 tons of CO2. Finally, evaluating the total plant cost rate of this cascade system, it was noted that the capital and maintenance cost rate ((C)over dot(CM)) corresponds to 89.1% of the (C)over dot(total) value, the operational cost rate ((C)over dot(op)) corresponds to 10.27% of the (C)over dot(total) value and the environmental cost rate ((C)over dot(env)) corresponds to 0.63% of (C)over dot(total).

AB  - Naturalization of the flow hydrograph and ice regime is a key step in assessment of ecological and socioeconomic impacts of regulation across large portions of Europe, Asia and North America, where many rivers are dammed for hydropower generation. Building on previous naturalization of early-freshet flows that influence the nature of breakup and jamming events, novel methodology is developed to estimate natural freezeup flows and thence determine associated water levels, also known to influence subsequent breakup events. Using reservoir inflows, the new methodology is applied to the lower portion of the regulated Peace River, Canada, which forms the northern boundary of the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD), a Ramsar wetland of international importance that partially depends on spring ice-jam flooding for recharge of its high-elevation, or "perched" basins. The PAD provides habitat for numerous aquatic, terrestrial and avian species and is vital to the maintenance of indigenous culture and lifeways. Naturalized freezeup levels in the lower Peace River are shown to be nearly always lower than corresponding regulated values, with the difference averaging similar to 1.6 m. Consistent with known physics of river ice breakup processes, the present results suggest that ice-jam flood frequency would likely have been greater under natural conditions. Though potentially adverse from the ecological standpoint, reduction of spring ice-jam flooding can benefit riverside communities. Implications of the present results to and comparison with, other Canadian and international rivers are discussed.

AB  - Background: Management practices can modify the productivity of forests and the associated microbial diversity of soil. The soil mycobiota is considered a key factor in the ecological functions of forests. Forests of Nothofagus pumilio (Poepp. & Endl.) Krasser (Nothofagaceae) are the main source of timber and one of the most important economic resources in the province of Tierra del Fuego (Argentina). However, there is no information on the impact of forest management interventions for the soil mycobiota, which can be reliable biological indicators of disturbance.
   Methods: Fungi were isolated from samples of soil collected under several Nothofagus pumilio forests subjected to different types of management and periods of time since the intervention. Types of management were represented by harvested forest with a shelter wood cutting, stockpile area and control forest without intervention and the periods of time since intervention were 1, 5-10 and 50 years. Species richness, evenness and Shannon's diversity index of the mycobiota in each condition of management were calculated. Additionally, the effect of seasonality was analysed.
   Results: The soil mycobiota was represented by 70 taxa. Richness and/or Shannon's diversity index of the mycobiota between undisturbed forest and stockpile area were higher in May (autumn) than in September or November. There were no differences in mycobiota diversity between dates in the harvested forest.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that the forest intervention per se did not negatively affect the soil culturable mycobiota composition of N. pumilio forests in Tierra del Fuego (Argentina).

AB  - Radioiodine is of health concerns in case of nuclear events. Possible pathways and rates of flow are essential information for risk assessment. Forest ecosystems could influence the global cycle of long-lived radioiodine isotope (I-129) with transfer processes similar to stable isotope (I-127). Understanding iodine cycling in forest involves study of the ecosystem as a whole. In this context, we determined the I-127 contents and distribution in soil, tree compartments and atmospheric inputs during a three years in situ monitoring of a temperate beech forest stand. The iodine cycle was first characterized in terms of stocks by measuring its concentrations in: tree, litterfall, humus, soil, rainfall, throughfall, stemflow and soil solutions. Main annual fluxes (requirement, uptake and internal transfers) and forest input-output budget were also estimated using conceptual model calculations. Our findings show that: (i) soil is the main I reservoir accounting for about 99.9% of ecosystem total stock; (ii) iodine uptake by tree represents a minor fraction of the available pool in soil (<0.2%); (iii) iodine allocation between tree compartments involves low immobilization in wood and restricted location in the roots; (iv) translocation of excess iodine towards senescing foliage appears as an elimination process for trees, and (v) litterfall is a major pathway in the I biological cycling. In our soil conditions, the input-output budget shows that the ecosystem behaves as a potential source of I for groundwater. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The amount of nanoparticles released from industrial and consumer products has increased rapidly in the last decade. These products may enter landfills directly or indirectly after the end of their useful life. In order to determine the impact of TiO2 and Ag nanoparticles on aerobic landfilling processes, municipal solid waste was loaded to three pilot-scale aerobic landfill bioreactors (80 cm diameter and 350 cm height) and exposed to TiO2 (AT) and Ag (AA) nanoparticles at total concentrations of 100 mg kg(-1) of solid waste. Aerobic landfill bioreactors were operated under the conditions about 0.03 L min(-1) kg(-1) aeration rate for 250 days, during which the leachate, solid waste, and gas characteristics were measured. The results indicate that there was no significant difference in the leachate characteristics, gas constituents, solid quality parameters, and temperature variations, which are the most important indicators of landfill operations, and overall aerobic degradation performance between the reactors containing TiO2 and Ag nanoparticles, and control (AC) reactor. The data also indicate that the pH levels, ionic strength, and the complex formation capacity of nanoparticles with Cl- ions can reduce the toxicity effects of nanoparticles on aerobic degradation processes.

AB  - One of the greatest concerns in community ecology is to find how species composition patterns are related to different environmental and spatial conditions. This approach is especially interesting when applied to high diversity heterogeneous forests such as the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest sensu lato. The present study aims to verify the existence of indicator species in four southern Atlantic Rainforest formations and identify relationships among distributions of tree species with environmental and spatial variables. For that, tree species density data of 21 phytosociological surveys were collected from the literature. The data were analyzed using indicator species and partial canonical redundancy analysis (partial RDA). Sandy coastal formation contained the greatest number of indicator species (17), followed by Atlantic rainforest (10), cloud forest (4) and Araucaria forest (3). The partial RDA analysis explained 22% of total data variation, of which 11% was assigned to the environment, 5% to space, 6% to spatial component of environment influence, and 78% remained undetermined. The forest formations present different sets of indicator species suggesting replacement of species along the forest formations. The largest and significant fraction of variation in the composition and abundance of tree species explained by environmental variables reflects the heterogeneity and complexity of habitats throughout the region of Atlantic Forest. The low spatial influence and the environmental results indicate a pattern of structured communities due to different requirements of niches by species (niche theory).

AB  - After 120 days of growth under experimental greenhouse conditions, effect of soil cadmium concentration on some agronomic variables and three growth and development indicators -photosynthetic pigments, root nodule appearance, and nodulation index- of the broad bean (Vicia faba) was evaluated; also, the Cd content in soil, root, stem, leaf, and pod were determined. A single-factor experimental design with four replications was used. The cadmium concentration this study started was of the soil, 4.1 mg/kg; then 20 and 40 mg/kg of Cd were added to the soil. The results indicate that agronomic variables showed no statistically significant differences with the controls (p<0.05). Chlorophylls a and b were significantly higher. The color of the root nodules of the plant became dark and this effect intensified with increasing concentration of cadmium in soil; there was a significant relationship between the nodulation index and the cadmium concentration (p<0.01). On the other hand, the root was the organ that absorbed more cadmium, followed by leaf, stem, and pod. As a whole plant, broad bean absorbed cadmium in the range of 8.6 to 65.2 mg/kg, concentrations toxic to humans. From the above, it is possible to set criteria for assessing the effect of Cd on broad bean because the ability to tolerate and absorb this metal is specific to each plant species. Lastly, these biological responses are excellent indicators of toxicity in plants exposed to cadmium and a tool for environmental monitoring.

AB  - Our study used 'stand structures' and 'ecological indicators' as inferences to managing dry Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco) forests for timber, biodiversity and range habitat attributes at 10-12 years after partial harvesting. Forest structures included densities and sizes of Douglas-fir and species and structural diversity of total conifers. Ecological indicators included cattle forage species in the understorey vegetation and three small mammal species: a closed-canopy specialist, the southern red-backed vole (Myodes gapperi Vigors) and two early successional species, the long-tailed vole (Microtus longicaudus Merriam) and heather vole (Phenacomys intermedius Merriam). Harvesting treatments were across a gradient of historical cut, individual tree selection and patch cut sites in the upper Interior Douglas-fir (IDFdk) biogeoclimatic zone near Summerland, British Columbia, Canada. Small mammal populations were sampled from 2006 to 2008. Closed-canopy forest structure seemed to maintain populations of red-backed voles in the harvested sites. Development of understorey vegetation in harvest-origin openings was similar across the levels of partial cutting and provided at least five plant species for cattle forage. Patches of grassland and shrubland in all treatment sites maintained viable populations of long-tailed voles and heather voles. These three small mammal indicators represent both late and early successional conditions in these IDF forests, which need to be managed for multiple objectives. Long-term monitoring of indicators will verify relationships with the components of biodiversity that they represent.

AB  - Phytoplankton abundance and biomass can be explained as a result of spatial and temporal changes in physical and biological variables, and also by the externally imposed or self-generated spatial segregation. In the present study, we analyzed contrasting-season changes in the phytoplankton communities of five subtropical shallow lakes, covering a nutrient gradient from oligo-mesotrophy to hypereutrophy, using a morphologically based functional approach to cluster the species. Six environmental variables accounted for 46% of the total phytoplankton morphological groups variance, i.e., turbidity (Secchi disk), conductivity, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, total zooplankton abundance, and herbivorous meso:microzooplankton density ratio. The differences in resource availability and zooplankton abundance among the systems were related with important changes in phytoplankton composition and structure. Within phytoplankton assemblages, adaptations to improve both light and phosphorus/nitrogen uptake were important in nutrient-poor systems; while grazing-avoidance mechanisms, such as colonial forms or bigger individuals, seemed relatively important only in eutrophic Lake Blanca, where light was not a limiting factor. However, this was not observed in the nutrient-rich Lake Cisne, where low light availability (due to clay resuspension and dark water color) was identified as the main structuring factor. Our results suggest that the composition of phytoplankton morphologically based functional groups appear to reliably describe the trophic sate of the lakes. However, other factors, such as nonbiological turbid condition, or zooplankton composition, may interact rendering interpretations difficult, and therefore, deserve further studies and evaluation.

AB  - Proton-transfer reactions across and at the surface of biological membranes are central for maintaining the transmembrane proton electrochemical gradients involved in cellular energy conversion. In this study, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy was used to measure the local protonation and deprotonation rates of single pH-sensitive fluorophores conjugated to liposome membranes, and the dependence of these rates on lipid composition and ion concentration. Measurements of proton exchange rates over a wide proton concentration range, using two different pH-sensitive fluorophores with different pK(a)s, revealed two distinct proton exchange regimes. At high pH (>8), proton association increases rapidly with increasing proton concentrations, presumably because the whole membrane acts as a proton-collecting antenna for the fluorophore. In contrast, at low pH (<7), the increase in the proton association rate is slower and comparable to that of direct protonation of the fluorophore from the bulk solution. In the latter case, the proton exchange rates of the two fluorophores are indistinguishable, indicating that their protonation rates are determined by the local membrane environment. Measurements on membranes of different surface charge and at different ion concentrations made it possible to determine surface potentials, as well as the distance between the surface and the fluorophore. The results from this study define the conditions under which biological membranes can act as proton-collecting antennae and provide fundamental information on the relation between the membrane surface charge density and the local proton exchange kinetics.

AB  - Imposex, i.e. the development of additional male sex organs (penis and/or vas deferens), in females of gonochorist marine and freshwater gastropods, is known to be caused by tributyltin (TBT), and it has been widely used as a biomonitoring tool in environmental surveys for TBT pollution assessment. In this study, we experimentally tested the potential to induce imposex by another endocrine disruptor (polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs] mixture-Aroclor 1260). Adults of Hexaplex trunculus with low imposex level, coming from an Italian Marine Protected Area, were injected separately with different doses of tributyltin chloride (TBTCl) and Aroclor 1260. The compounds were dissolved in ethanol and the organisms were narcotised by immersion in MgCl2 solution before injection. Before and after the experiment, butyltin compounds (BuTs) and PCB tissue concentrations were determined. A significant increase in imposex with respect to non-treated organisms was observed in all treatments, including artefact controls. No clear correlation was observed between BuTs and PCB tissue concentrations and indices of imposex incidence. Based on these results, no assumption can be formulated about PCB effect on imposex development. Nevertheless, they suggest that the imposex level increase, at least in H. trunculus, in laboratory conditions might not be caused by TBT only, but it would rather be a non-specific response to different stress stimuli.

AB  - This study assessed the richness and abundance of Oligochaeta in two long-term experiments in Uruguay. In one experiment, located in eastern Uruguay (UEPP, INIA Treinta y Tres) we evaluated four different rotations (continuous cropping, short rotation, long rotation, and pasture improvement) under grazing and no tillage conditions. The rotations were compared with adjacent grazed natural grassland. In the other experiment, located in northern Uruguay (UEG, INIA Tacuarembo), we compared two natural grasslands, one under grazing and the other excluded it for 9 years. The community structure differed within the different agroecosystems. At UEPP-INIA Treinta y Tres, richness and abundance were significantly higher in the four crop-pasture rotations than in the natural grassland. Pasture improvement had the highest richness while continuous cropping showed the highest density. Species 1 (Family Ocnerodrilidae) was predominant at the continuous cropping, while sp.2 (Family Lumbricidae) was absent. Both species were recorded at the pasture improvement with similar densities. At UEG-INIA Tacuarembo there were no differences between treatments for richness and total abundance. Species 3 (Family Glossoscolecidae) was the only species affected by grazing. The indicator value index (IndVal) was computed for each species: sp.1 with a value of 39, and sp.2 with a value of 61. These species were associated to continuous cropping and pasture improvement, respectively and could be regarded as detector species. Species 3 with an IndVal value of 97 was associated to the ungrazed area at the UEG-INIA Tacuarembo, and should be regarded as a characteristic species.

AB  - We analysed subfossil death assemblages of aquatic invertebrate communities in a salinity series of 35 western Uganda maar-crater lakes to evaluate their potential as biological indicators of past habitat conditions in paleo-enviromnental research. The study region encompasses the climatological and hydrological gradient between the dry floor and moist shoulders of the Edward-George branch of the East African Rift Valley, and includes mesotrophic to hyper-eutrophic, and shallow unstratified to deep meromictic lakes with a surface-water salinity range between 101 and 135 400 mu S/cm. Focusing on non-chironomid aquatic invertebrates with good fossil preservation, we found that fossil larval remains of the Dipteran families Culicidae, Ephydridae, and Stratiomyidae are good indicators of saline environments. Our data further suggest that the abundances of Bryozoan statoblasts and Chaoboridae are indicative of, respectively, the fraction of the littoral zone covered by aquatic macrophytes and of lake trophic state, but a lake reference data set more specifically designed to cover variation in these environmental factors will be needed to determine the strength of these relationships. In these small, simple lake basins, recent death assemblages recovered from a single mid-lake surface-sediment sample provides a more complete inventory of local aquatic invertebrate communities and the distribution of species among lakes than exploratory live sampling of those taxa in a selection of littoral, benthic and pelagic habitats.

AB  - Here we introduce a combined experimental and descriptive approach (termed resurrection ecology) to reconstructing historical perturbations, pointing out how direct tests with sediments and hatched resting eggs complement the traditional descriptive calculation of microfossil fluxes. In the Keweenaw Waterway, a freshwater estuary off Lake Superior, turn-of-the-century copper mining impacted the resident biota. Remain fluxes document that diatom, rhizopod, and Bosmina production all declined during stamp sand discharges but recovered rapidly after World War II, moving above background levels due to developing eutrophication. In addition to biogenic silica, we discovered that bromine flux holds promise as an indicator of diatom production and confirmed that this element is present in several genera. Fluxes of Daphnia resting eggs also increased dramatically since the 1940s, dominated by a hybrid apparently produced from crosses between offshore and interior Waterway species, after channeling promoted greater mixing of water masses. Toxicity studies with sediments and Daphnia clones directly tested recovery of environments after cessation of mining activities. The studies document that increased concentrations and fluxes of copper in the Waterway during mining discharges were toxic to invertebrates. Once stamp sand discharges ceased,the biota recovered rapidly due to a combination of decreased copper cycling and organic complexation. Although sedimentation has returned to near-background conditions and surficial sediments in much of Portage Lake are no longer toxic, eutrophication and faunal exchange with Lake superior make it unlikely that the original zooplankton community composition will return to the Waterway system.

AB  - This article is an extensive collection of scientific literature related to the impact of fertilizers on soil microbial and enzymatic activity. Due to the significance of technology in quantitative and qualitative evaluation of agricultural production, this is a basic problem for the present and future of mankind, where the scientific data being of utmost importance related to the topic. The comparison, including pedo-enzymological evaluation of minerals along with organic fertilization, highlights significant differences between mineral and organic fertilizers, confirming the superiority of complex mineral-organic fertilization. Enzymatic indicators that describe and define the soil quality resulted from enzymatic activities value and provide valuable information regarding the soil fertility status. Moreover, soil enzyme responds to soil management as well as to environmental pollutants. Changes of environmental conditions and pollutants like heavy metals and other toxic substances result in a shift in the biological activity of the soil. These changes can destabilize the soil system and cause a decrease in the nutrient pools. To ensure the improvement of fertilization techniques, the properties of nanoparticles are exploited that can efficiently release nutrients to plant cells. Numerous researches were performed in order to follow the long-term effects of incorporating nanofertilizers into the soil, obtaining an exhaustive overview of this new technology over the development of sustainable agriculture.

AB  - Among the bioactive compounds that are considered important for the food industry, anthocyanins, which are flavonoid compounds presenting antioxidant activity and are responsible for beneficial health effects, have received researchers? attention in the last decades. In addition, anthocyanins are highly reactive and can be used as indicators of foodstuff quality conditions, particularly as a packaging ingredient. Considering this line of work, the eco-friendly film is a novel packaging technology that arose from the concern to reduce non-renewable resources and their impact on the environment. These films can be vehicles for loading bioactive compounds such as anthocyanins. Among the contribution of films in the food industry, we can highlight several potential applications: i) smart film: assess food quality and safety, transmitting food information to consumers and increasing the reliability of their consumption without breaking the packaging; ii) active film: use to preserve food quality through the release of active agents; and iii) bioactive film: carry substances in desired concentrations until their controlled or rapid diffusion within the gastrointestinal tract so that they can promote its benefit to human health. Thus, this review presents anthocyanin extract?s potential as a powerful tool to improve the development of eco-friendly films, directing its purpose to the application as smart, active, and bioactive films.

AB  - Most bacterial cells in nature exhibit extremely low colony-forming activity, despite showing various signs of viability, impeding the isolation and utilization of many bacterial resources. However, the general causes responsible for this state of low colony formation are largely unknown. Because liquid cultivation typically yields more bacterial cell cultures than traditional solid cultivation, we hypothesized that colony formation requires one or more specific gene functions that are dispensable or less important for growth in liquid media. To verify our hypothesis and reveal the genetic background limiting colony formation among bacteria in nature, we isolated Escherichia coli mutants that had decreased frequencies of colony formation but could grow in liquid medium from a temperature-sensitive mutant collection. Mutations were identified in fabB, which is essential for the synthesis of long unsaturated fatty acids. We then constructed a fabB deletion mutant in a wild-type background. Detailed behavioural analysis of the mutant revealed that under fatty acid-limited conditions, colony formation on solid media was more sensitively and seriously impaired than growth in liquid media. Furthermore, growth under partial inhibition of fatty acid synthesis with cerulenin or triclosan brought about similar phenotypes, not only in E. coli but also in Bacillus subtilis and Corynebacterium glutamicum. These results indicate that fatty acids have a critical importance in colony formation and that depletion of fatty acids in the environment partly accounts for the low frequency of bacterial colony formation.

AB  - Suillus lakei is an ectomycorrhizal fungus native to North America and known in Europe, South America, and New Zealand. This contribution aims to illustrate the worldwide biogeography of S. lakei based on sporocarp records. Species distribution modeling was used to assess the suitable niche distribution of S. lakei, based on the climatic variables as well as distribution of its ectomycorrhizal partner, Douglas fir. In general, distribution of suitable niches of S. lakei greatly overlaps with the distribution of Douglas fir in North America. By spatial distribution modeling, we found that the precipitation of the coldest quarters, isothermality, and annual mean temperature are important factors influencing the potential distribution of S. lakei. Nevertheless, the most crucial factor limiting expansion of S. lakei in its invasion range is Douglas fir occurrence. This factor reached an 86.4% contribution for the S. lakei species distribution model. Additionally, we compare the aboveground and belowground presence of S. lakei based on surveys in the field. Our study shows that even extremely low abundance of ectomycorrhizas can open the possibility of using an ectomycorrhiza survey for their quantification as a good indicator of the presence of S. lakei in field conditions. Both sporocarps and ectomycorrhizas occurred only in gardens, where Douglas fir seedlings were outplanted at the beginning of the 1990s as an ornamental plant. Presumably, international trade of ornamental plants was one possible route of introduction of S. lakei to Poland.

AB  - We aimed to assess the impact of land-use structure on AFIS occurrence and evaluation of these bioindicators in urban conditions. We compiled data about forest continuity based on archival maps and forest management plans; floristic records of 79 AFIS occurrences were collected within a 1 x 1 km grid and land-use form structure in Poznan (W Poland). We tested fidelity of AFIS using chi(2) tests and effects of land-use structure using random forest models. We also checked spatial autocorrelation and its impact on AFIS distribution patterns within old and recent forests, using spatially explicit generalized linear models. We found a strong relationship between AFIS number per grid square and fraction of forests and waters in land-use structure. Relationships between AFIS distribution and land-use shows that AFIS are a good proxy describing human impact or an urbanity gradient. AFIS number per grid square shows small, but significant positive spatial autocorrelation, which suggests possibilities of migration into new forests. AFIS, treated as a bioindicative group of species, may be a useful indicator of landscape and land-use structure transformation in urban environments. Occurrence of many AFIS that are endangered at the city scale indicates the need for conservation of old forests in urban areas, to preserve biodiversity in urban environments. Thus, AFIS may act as indicators of old forests with high conservation value in cities, which need special protection.

AB  - The aquatic macrophyte Stratiotes aloides L. is regarded as a key species for valuable ditch ecosystems characterized by high biodiversity and is an important indicator for the ecological condition of these systems. Recently, a decline of the species in northwestern Germany has been observed. This study focuses on the influence of sediment pore water qualities on the vitality of S. aloides. Investigations were carried out on three grassland areas with extensive ditch systems near the city of Bremen in winter 2009. For two of the sites, Hollerland and Werderland, S. aloides populations are dominant and largely vital whereas a strong decline has been observed in the third site, Niedervieland. Results of pore water analyses revealed significant site-specific differences in some critical parameters for the vitality of S. aloides. In Niedervieland the mean ammonium concentration (541 mu mol L(-1)) was about four times higher, the orthophosphate concentrations (126 mu mol L(-1)) about 14 times higher and the alkalinity (8.5 mequiv. L(-1)) was almost twice as high as in Hollerland and Werderland. Key parameters in the pore water can have indirect (high alkalinity of the sediment pore water, eutrophication of the water layer due to high phosphate concentrations) or direct (ammonium and sulphide toxicity) negative effects on S. aloides stands. Elevated concentrations of these key parameters were present in Niedervieland, corresponding with the observed decline of S. aloides at this site.

AB  - The magnitude, duration, and return intervals of surface water flooding and dewatering of the landward extent of the hydric soil indicators muck (LM), histic epipedon (LHE), and Histosol (LH) were quantitatively defined, providing a better understanding of the hydrologic conditions maintaining these hydric soil indicators. Land surface elevations were determined for the LM, LHE, and LH at 16 lakes with long-term (30-60-yr) modeled or gauged hydrologic data. The probability of flooding and dewatering of the elevations of the LM, LHE, and LH were determined from frequency analysis of hydrologic data from each lake. The resulting hydrologic signatures for the LM, LHE, and LH are composed of magnitude and return interval of 1, 30, 90, 183, 274, and 365-d duration flooding and dewatering events. As an example, the LM, LHE, and LH were flooded for 30 continuous days with average annual probabilities of 42, 65, and 77%, respectively. As a second example, the LM, LHE, and LH were dewatered for 365 continuous days with average annual probabilities of 49, 24, and 16%, respectively. Probabilities of flooding and dewatering for the LM, LHE, and LH are presented for 1, 30, 90, 183, 274, and 365-d durations. Mean hydrologic signatures reduce variability and may be considered representative of each soil characteristic. Quantitatively defining the hydrology associated with the presence of the LM, LHE, and LH as well as other soil characteristics is essential for environmental protection, assessment of hydrologic impacts, wetlands restoration, wetlands creation, and other environmental management applications.

AB  - Measurement of visual quality is of fundamental importance to numerous image and video processing applications. The goal of quality assessment (QA) research is to design algorithms that can automatically assess the quality of images or videos in a perceptually consistent manner. Traditionally, image QA algorithms interpret image quality as fidelity or similarity with a "reference" or "perfect" image in some perceptual space. Such "full-referene" QA methods attempt to achieve consistency in quality prediction by modeling salient physiological and psychovisual features of the human visual system (HVS), or by arbitrary signal fidelity criteria. In this paper, we approach the problem of image QA by proposing a novel information fidelity criterion that is based on natural scene statistics. QA systems are invariably involved with judging the visual quality of images and videos that are meant for "human consumption." Researchers have developed sophisticated models to capture the statistics of natural signals, that is, pictures and videos of the visual environment. Using these statistical models in an information-theoretic setting, we derive a novel QA algorithm that provides clear advantages over the traditional approaches. In particular, it is parameterless and outperforms current methods in our testing. We validate the performance of our algorithm with an extensive subjective study involving 779 images. We also show that, although our approach distinctly departs from traditional HVS-based methods, it is functionally similar to them under certain conditions, yet it outperforms them due to improved modeling. The code and the data from the subjective study are available at [1].

AB  - We reviewed empirical data and hypotheses derived from demographic, optimal foraging, life-history, community, and biogeographic theory for predicting the sensitivity of species to habitat fragmentation. We found 12 traits or trait groups that have been suggested as predictors of species sensitivity: population size; population fluctuation and storage effect; dispersal power; reproductive potential; annual survival; sociality; body size; trophic position; ecological specialisation, microhabitat and matrix use; disturbance and competition sensitive traits; rarity; and biogeographic position. For each trait we discuss the theoretical justification for its sensitivity to fragmentation and empirical evidence for and against the suitability of the trait as a predictor of fragmentation sensitivity. Where relevant, we also discuss experimental design problems for testing the underlying hypotheses. There is good empirical support for 6 of the 12 traits as sensitivity predictors: population size; population fluctuation and storage effects; traits associated with competitive ability and disturbance sensitivity in plants; microhabitat specialisation and matrix use; rarity in the form of low abundance within a habitat; and relative biogeographic position. Few clear patterns emerge for the remaining traits from empirical studies if examined in isolation. Consequently, interactions of species traits and environmental conditions must be considered if we want to be able to predict species sensitivity to fragmentation. We develop a classification of fragmentation sensitivity based on specific trait combinations and discuss the implications of the results for ecological theory.

AB  - Upper Cretaceous strata in the Pasquia Hills of the northern Manitoba Escarpment, eastern Saskatchewan, Canada provide a detailed paleoenvironmental and sea-level record of the eastern margin of the Western Interior Seaway. Sediments deposited during the Cenomanian/Turonian Greenhorn marine cycle are dominantly black mudstones deposited in a stratified water column, with bottom-water anoxia recurrently reaching into the photic tune. A middle Cenomanian sea-level lowstand event followed by transgression left a series of bonebeds within the Belie Fourche Member of the Ashville Formation, indicating a sedimentary environment starved of coarse siliciclastics. Maximum sea level resulted in the formation of limestone beds within the Favel Formation, further favoured by reduced terrigenous sediment input compared to the western margin. Limestone sedimentation was: followed by a phase of increased freshwater input under lower sea level conditions, and reducing zoo- and phytoplankton diversities. During final Greenhorn regression, eastern Saskatchewan probably turned into a restricted basin severely limiting marine circulation. Poor or absent benthic foraminiferal assemblages and biomarker analysis suggest prevailing watermass stratification throughout the Cenomania/Turonian transgressive/regressive cycle. This was caused either by a freshwater lid, stratification of Boreal and Tethyan-derived watermasses, or both, to various intensities affected by changing sea level. Basin oxygenation during Niobrara time varies between localities along the eastern margin as documented by presence/absence of benthic and planktic foraminifera. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Study of Recent planktonic foraminifera from the surface sediment samples of western continental margin of India reveals the ecological preferences of the different planktonic foraminifer species in the area. Higher absolute abundance of planktonic foraminifera in the offshore associated with the lower frequencies of the productivity indicator Globigerinoides bulloides and lower absolute abundance in the nearshore with higher frequencies of G. bulloides appears to suggest that productivity does not control the absolute abundance of planktonic foraminifera in this area. In general, the difference in absolute abundance between offshore and nearshore indicates that the dilution by terrigenous and other biogenic (benthic foraminifera and diatoms) material governs the absolute abundance of planktonic foraminifera.
   Globigerinoides sacculifer shows a significant positive correlation with salinity and a negative correlation with temperature, which reflects its preference for higher salinity and lower temperature of the surface water. Globigerinoides ruber abundances are related to a distinct highly saline Persian Gulf water mass in the eastern Arabian Sea. Neogloboquadrina dutertrei shows a strong inverse relationship with surface water salinity in the eastern Arabian Sea. Therefore, the relative abundance variations of N. dutertrei in sediment cores of the southeastern Arabian Sea can be used to reconstruct the past surface water salinity, which varies according to the strength of the northeastern monsoon.
   The high diversity of planktonic foraminifera in the offshore is attributable to equitable environmental conditions. The high-salinity surface waters (> 36 parts per thousand) and terrigenous dilution in the northeastern Arabian Sea limit the diversification of species in this region.

AB  - Blue mussels, Mytilus edulis, were exposed in the laboratory for 7 days to a range of Cu concentrations (0 to 100-mu-g/liter) to test the feasibility of using the accumulation of a 60 kDa stress protein, also referred to as heat shock protein 60 (hsp60), as a molecular indicator of contaminant exposure and ecological status.  At the end of the experiment, scope-for-growth (SFG) measurements were completed to assess whole organism physiological condition.  In addition, antibodies raised against hsp60 were employed as probes for Western blot analysis and immunobinding assays of mantle tissue.
   Physiological measurements revealed a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in the SFG index for organisms at 32 and 100-mu-g/liter Cu.  Western blot analysis indicated that the abundance of hsp60 was greater in tissues exposed to elevated Cu concentrations than in controls.  Quantitation of hsp60 accumulation as determined by a dot immunobinding assay demonstrated a significant correlation between hsp60 accumulation and nominal Cu concentration in the seawater.  Significant (p < 0.1) increases in accumulation of hsp60 over controls was detected at 3.2-mu-g/liter Cu and higher, Cu concentrations which were substantially lower than that at which a significant decrease in SFG was observed.  These data suggest that hsp60 accumulation may hold promise as a molecular indicator of contaminant exposure and an early warning of adverse biological effects.

AB  - The distance that a nutrient travels as a solute before its removal from the stream water column is known as the uptake length (S-W), which is a functional indicator of environmental quality and integrity. Among nutrient enrichment methods, instantaneous nutrient addition (e.g., slug or pulse) have been proposed as an alternative to plateau and labeled nutrient approaches. Two approaches have been commonly used to estimate S-W and its associated metrics (i.e., areal uptake rate, U; and uptake velocity, V-f) from pulse additions: the spiraling approach, based on the longitudinal variation in nutrient concentrations, and the transport modeling approach, based on the advective and dispersive transport of solutes. However, little is known in how the choice of such analytical methods impacts the estimation of stream uptake parameters and the conclusions we draw from them. Here, we estimated the S-W and V-f of ammonium-nitrogen (NH4-N) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) from 16 pulsed additions conducted in four low-order streams in southeastern Brazil. We compared metrics estimated by the Tracer Additions for Spiraling Curve Characterization (TASCC) and the One-Dimensional Transport with Inflow and Storage (OTIS) methods, based on the spiraling- and transport-based approaches, respectively. The TASCC:OTIS S-W ratio averaged 0.71 for NH4-N and 1.01 for SRP, whereas the mean of TASCC:OTIS V-f ratio was 2.04 for NH4-N and 1.03 for SRP. The results showed that both S-W and V-f estimates differed significantly between methods for NH4-N, but no statistical differences were observed in SRP estimates. In our study, we highlighted the significant effects of transient storage and variable nutrient concentration on pulsed enrichments. Such information should be considered when choosing which method is appropriate to use for a particular site. Differences between modeling approaches must be addressed when comparing methods to expand our knowledge on broad temporal and spatial patterns of in-stream nutrient uptake.

AB  - The widespread usage of veterinary antibiotics results in antibiotic contamination and increases environmental risks. This study was evaluated the single and ternary competitive adsorption-desorption and degradation of three amphenicol antibiotics (AMs): chloramphenicol (CAP), thiamphenicol (TAP), and florfenicol (FF) in three agricultural soils. The adsorption capacity of amphenicol antibiotics in the soil was weak, and the K-f value was in the range of 0.15-3.59 mu g(1-1/n)L(1/n) kg(-1). In the single adsorption-desorption experiment, the ranked order of adsorption capacity was TAP > FF > CAP. However, in the ternary competitive adsorption experiment, the order was changed to be CAP > FF > TAP. The degradation of AMs in soils was performed at various conditions. All AMs were vulnerable to microbial degradation in soils. A higher initial concentration would reduce the degradation rate and enhance the persistence of AMs in soil. The degradation of AMs was positively influenced by changes in soil moisture content and culture temperatures up to 30 degrees C and decreased at higher temperatures. An equation was used to predict the leachability of AMs in soils and assess their risk to the water environment. The weak adsorption capacity and poor persistence of FF indicated that it may have a strong effect on groundwater based on the equation. It is imperative to further assess the biological impacts of FF at environmentally relevant concentrations given its mobility and extensive use in the livestock industry.

AB  - The present study provides energy density (ED) data and models for four macrobenthic invertebrate genera inhabiting freshwater lotic environments (Baetis, Hydropsyche, Rhyacophila, and Onychogomphus). Samples were collected in the hydrological freshwater network of the Region Friuli Venezia Giulia within different watercourse types (creeks, streams, rivers channels, and ditches), and energy density was directly measured using an adiabatic bomb calorimeter. Measured ED expressed in Joule g(-1) wet weight was strongly and positively correlated with percentage of dry weight (DW%) for all genera investigated (r(2) > 0.9504), allowing to obtain genus-specific predictive models based on the relationship between ED and DW%. Models were validated and showed good predictive power, as 90th percentile of observed percentage errors ranged between 4.23% and 5.18% while medians ranged between 1.32% and 2.83%. ANCOVA disclosed significant differences between the models, as those for Rhyacophila and Onychogomphus differed significantly from the others. The empirical models were used to build a dataset of estimated energy density, to assess the relationship between energy density and ecological status of the monitored riverine systems, assessed in compliance with European and Italian law by the application of four different ecological indices (ICMi, RQE_IBMR, STAR_ICMi, and LIMeco). Information regarding ED levels for freshwater macrobenthic invertebrates is still neglected in biomonitoring programs, but it could be useful to interpret some ecological situations in the context of ecological status assessment, especially in relation to the trophic condition of the investigated riverine systems.

AB  - Rapid urban development increases the consumption of materials, energy, and water, resulting in an overproduction of waste and emissions. These cause many environmental threats, such as ozone layer depletion and rain acidification, leading to climate change. Therefore, the question arises on how to improve the effectiveness of tools that strengthen environmental protection. This discursive article presents an approach stressing the role of landscape in environmental protection in Poland. It indicates that landscape protection is an ecological, not just an aesthetic activity, as it is often considered in Poland. The landscape reflects all changes occurring in individual elements of the environment resulting from urban development. Through landscape transformations, one can track the growth and accumulation of adverse effects in the chain of environmental changes. Knowledge regarding the dynamics and scope of these transformations can improve ecological design and technologies. Therefore, the landscape condition should be treated as an indicator of sustainable development. If so, one could hypothesise that effective landscape protection contributes to minimising environmental and climate changes. The relationships between the landscape and environmental/climate threats discussed in this article prompt combining some tools related to these threats, which may ensure both effective landscape protection and sustainable development, leading to reduced climate change. The possibilities and benefits of integrating these tools are presented here as well. General considerations are supplemented with references to the situation in Poland to support the need for implementing a more policy-oriented and interdisciplinary approach to landscape protection.

AB  - Direct indicators of diet and predator-prey relationships are exceedingly rare in the fossil record [1, 2]. However, it is through such traces that we can best understand trophic interactions in ancient ecosystems [3], confirm dietary inferences derived from skeletal morphologies [4], and clarify behavioral and ecological interpretations [5]. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized lizard species in the abdomen of a specimen of Microraptor zhaoianus, a small, volant dromaeosaurid (Paraves) with asymmetrical flight feathers on both its forelimbs and hindlimbs from the Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota [6-8]. The lizard is largely complete and articulated, confirming the current perception of Microraptor as an agile opportunistic predator that, like extant reptiles, including raptorial birds, ingested small prey whole and head first [9]. The lizard can be readily distinguished from previously recognized Early Cretaceous species based on its unusual widely spaced and brachydont dentition. Phylogenetic analysis suggests Indrasaurus wangi gen. et sp. nov. is a basal scleroglossan closely related to the slightly older Liushusaurus [10]. Comparison of ingested remains preserved across Paraves suggests that dromaeosaurids retained the plesiomorphic condition in which ingested prey were fully digested, rather than egested, as has been demonstrated was the case in the probable troodontid Anchiornis [11]. This supports a closer relationship between Ayes and Anchiornis [12, 13] and suggests that flight did not precipitate the evolution of pellet egestion in Paraves and that the evolution of the "modern avian" digestive system in paravians was highly homoplastic [14]. A preliminary Jehol food web is reconstructed from current data.

AB  - BACKGROUND Although the biopharmaceutical market grows rapidly, the environmental impacts of biopharmaceutical manufacturing have been hardly evaluated. The aim of the study is to comprehensively assess the environmental sustainability of a biologically-produced active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturing process. For this purpose, an exergy analysis and an (exergetic) life cycle assessment were performed using primary (foreground system) and modeled data (background system). Infliximab, a monoclonal antibody, was considered. RESULTS The fermentation and its raw materials' supply chain was determined to have the highest environmental impact, since the culture media requires chemicals and complex compounds such as animal-derived materials (ADMs). The total impact per 100 mg of API produced ranged between 18.6 and 101.8 MJ(ex) and 2.0-3.1 kg CO2-eq, mainly as a function of the ADMs' source. A comparison of infliximab and ustekinumab, a biopharmaceutical produced without ADMs, showed that eliminating these materials can reduce the cumulative resource consumption of monoclonal antibody manufacturing by up to 7.5 times. The fermentation is the process taking the longest and the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system which support fermentation areas consumes approximately 75% of all plant electricity use. CONCLUSIONS Culture media nutrients and cleanroom requirements are driving factors in the environmental impact of biological API manufacturing. Obtaining more precise data of the bioprocesses behind these nutrients' supply chain is crucial to corroborating this study's results. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Several advanced treatments, such as ozonation or activated carbon adsorption, are currently considered for the removal of organic micropollutants (OMPs) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). However, little is known on the overall performances of a WWTP upgraded with those processes and the benefits provided regarding the elimination of multiple families of OMPs. In this study, 5 sampling campaigns were performed to determine the removal of 48 OMPs in a WWTP followed by an activated carbon pilot. The primary treatment had no effect on OMPs (removals < 20%), whereas the biological treatment removed OMPs that can be easily sorbed onto sludges or biodegraded (>60%). The additional elimination provided by the advanced treatment was not significant (<10%) for OMPs already well removed in the WWTP) but was substantial (>30%) for recalcitrant OMPs. Removals higher than 60% were obtained for all OMPs (except azithromycin and sulfamethoxazole) over the WWTP and the activated carbon pilot. The adsorption conditions (10 g/m(3) fresh activated 'Carbon addition) were not sufficient to achieve the 80% removal targeted in Switzerland for compounds suggested as indicator substances for wastewater treatment. A higher dose of activated carbon or the combination with another advanced treatment should be used to achieve a satisfactory removal of those compounds. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban Environmental Quality (UEQ) can be treated as a generic indicator that objectively represents the physical and socio-economic condition of the urban and built environment. The value of UEQ illustrates a sense of satisfaction to its population through assessing different environmental, urban and socio-economic parameters. This paper elucidates the use of the Geographic Information System (GIS), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Geographically-Weighted Regression (GWR) techniques to integrate various parameters and estimate the UEQ of two major cities in Ontario, Canada. Remote sensing, GIS and census data were first obtained to derive various environmental, urban and socio-economic parameters. The aforementioned techniques were used to integrate all of these environmental, urban and socio-economic parameters. Three key indicators, including family income, higher level of education and land value, were used as a reference to validate the outcomes derived from the integration techniques. The results were evaluated by assessing the relationship between the extracted UEQ results and the reference layers. Initial findings showed that the GWR with the spatial lag model represents an improved precision and accuracy by up to 20% with respect to those derived by using GIS overlay and PCA techniques for the City of Toronto and the City of Ottawa. The findings of the research can help the authorities and decision makers to understand the empirical relationships among environmental factors, urban morphology and real estate and decide for more environmental justice.

AB  - Environmental changes such as ocean warming or sea-level rise have a profound impact on shallow-water coastal environments. Benthic foraminifera have long been successfully used as indicators for ecologic responses. The propagule method is a useful tool to evaluate the reactions of entire assemblages of foraminifera when exposed to different environmental conditions. Here we present results from growth experiments of foraminiferal assemblages from three sites in coastal Georgia and Florida (USA) under different temperatures (18, 24 and 30 degrees C) and salinities (15 and 35). Results show that assemblages grown at the higher temperatures had greater abundances of foraminifera, whereas salinity was the primary factor in shaping the composition of the experimentally grown assemblages from the three sites. We also show that experimentally grown assemblages contain high numbers of exotic' species that result from successful propagule recruitment from outside of the original environments (e.g. the open shelf). Overall, opportunistic and previously termed pioneer species' proved to be the most successful constituents of the experimental assemblages, showing that reactions of foraminiferal assemblages to environmental changes can appear remarkably quickly (e.g. in the course of several weeks). Our observations on the faunal reactions to different temperatures and salinities indicate that ongoing environmental alterations of coastal areas will likely result in significant changes in the shallow-water foraminiferal assemblages of the coasts of Georgia and Florida. As such, our study provides general insights into the ecologic effects of current climate change.

AB  - Fluorescence by naturally occurring dissolved organic matter (FDOM) is a sensitive indicator of ballast water source, with high FDOM in coastal ballast water decreasing typically dramatically when replaced by oceanic seawater during ballast water exchange (BWE). In this study, FDOM was measured in 92 ships arriving at Pacific ports on the US west coast and in New Zealand, and used to assess their compliance with ballast water regulations that required 95% replacement of port water to minimize invasive species risks. Fluorescence in many ships that reported BWE was significantly higher than is usual for oceanic seawater, and in several cases, significantly higher than in other ships with similar provenance and ballast water management. Pre-exchange source port conditions represented the largest source of uncertainty in the analysis, because residual coastal FDOM when highly fluorescent can significantly influence the fluorescence signature of exchanged ballast water. A meta-analysis comparing the intensities of FDOM in un-exchanged ballast tanks with calculated pre-exchange intensities assuming that ships all correctly implemented and reported BWE revealed notable discrepancies. Thus, the incidence of high-FDOM port waters was seven times lower in reality than would be expected on the basis of these calculations. The results suggest that a significant rate of reporting errors occur due to a combination of factors that may include inadequate BWE and unintentional or deliberate misreporting of ballast water management.

AB  - Land-use change in the US Great Plains since agricultural settlement in the second half of the nineteenth century has been well documented. While aggregate historical trends are easily tracked, the decision making of individual farmers is difficult to reconstruct. We use an agent-based model to tell the history of the settlement of the west by simulating farm-level agricultural decision making based on historical data about prices, yields, farming costs, and environmental conditions. The empirical setting for the model is the period between 1875 and 1940 in two townships in Kansas, one in the shortgrass region and the other in the mixed grass region. Annual historical data on yields and prices determine profitability of various land uses and thereby inform decision making, in conjunction with the farmer's previous experience and randomly assigned levels of risk aversion. Results illustrating the level of agreement between model output and a unique and detailed set of household-level records of historical land use and farm size suggest that economic behavior and natural endowments account for land change processes to some degree, but are incomplete. Discrepancies are examined to identify missing processes through model experiments, in which we adjust input and output prices, crop yields, agent memory, and risk aversion. These analyses demonstrate that how agent-based modeling can be a useful laboratory for thinking about social and economic behavior in the past.

AB  - It is not well understood how the ecological status and microbial community composition of spruce swamp forests (SSF) relate to those found in bogs and fens. To clarify this, we investigated biogeochemical parameters and microbial community composition in a bog, a fen and two SSF using high throughput barcoded sequencing of the small ribosomal subunit (SSU) variable region V4. The results demonstrated that the microbial community of SSF is positioned between those of bogs and fens, and this was confirmed by in silico predicted metabolic potentials. This corresponds well with the position of SSF on the trophic gradient and reflects distinct responses of microbial communities to environmental variables. Species richness and microbial diversity increased significantly from bog to fen, with SSF in between, reflecting the variation in pH, nutrient availability and peat decomposability. The archaeal community, dominated by hydrogenotrophic methanogens, was more similar in SSF and the bog compared with the fen. The composition of the bacterial community of SSF was intermediate between those of bog and fen. However, the production of CO2 (an indicator of peat decomposability) did not differ between SSF and bog, suggesting the limiting effect of low pH and poor litter quality on the functioning of the bacterial community in SSF. These results help to clarify the transitional position of SSF between bogs and fens and showed the strong effect of environmental conditions on microbial community composition and functioning.

AB  - The tenets of ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) now occupy centre stage in our efforts to maintain the sustainability of fisheries and rebuild marine ecosystems. The paper discusses how an EAF can be adopted for data limited fisheries and uses the northern South China Sea fishery as an example to demonstrate the selection and use of indicators for determining the states of the fishery and its relevant ecosystem to provide advice on management. Implementing EAF management requires indicators and models that address the impact of fishing across entire ecological communities and determine management actions to be taken to achieve the preset objectives according to decision rules. Data limited fisheries necessarily have limited resources for data collection and scientific studies and therefore could not support complex models. To overcome the data limitation and absence of modelling support, simple indicators have to be, used to assess the current state and monitor changes of the fishery and its ecosystem. Such indicators should: (1) be observable and understandable by all stakeholders, (2) be based on easily obtainable and reliable data, (3) adequately reflect the condition of the resource, and (4) have associated reference values and responsive management measures. The paper also reviews the recent development and use of indicators and harvest strategies in both conventional and EAF management to better understand the differences and to shed light on the challenges of EAF, in particular for data limited fisheries.

AB  - Bats may exhibit different patterns of activity, considering aspects concerning niche dynamics as well as the establishment and permanence of the communities in the ecosystems. In this way, the present study analyzed the time and seasonal patterns of activity in different species of frequent phyllostomid bats in remnants of the stational semidecidual forest from the Upper Parana River, Southern Brazil. Captures were performed between January and December, 2006, using 32 mist nets set above the soil along the nocturnal period during the four seasons of the year. The daily and seasonal patterns of activity of each species was modeled using generalized linear models with Poisson error. The best model was selected using Akaike's Information Criterion (AICc). Artibeus planirostris (Spix, 1823) did not exhibit a conspicuous time pattern, whereas A. lituratus (Olfers, 1818) was more frequent after the sixth hour and A. fimbriatus Gray, 1838 had an activity increase along the night. Platyrrhinus lineatus (E. Geoffroy, 1810) was registered during all sampling hours. Carollia perspicillata (Linnaeus, 1758) and Sturnira lilium (E. Geoffroy, 1810) were the most active during the first four hours. Concerning seasonal pattern, the highest activity of these species was verified during the summer. These data contribute to the information about the ecology of bats in the region, highlighting the high adaptive potential of the species studied in relation to the use of space throughout the night and in to variations in environmental conditions.

AB  - In autumn 1997 approximately 320 000 m of sand were extracted from a site located ca 2 5 km off Wustrow Germany Western Baltic Sea The physical Impacts of dredging on the sea floor are assessed on the basis of side scan sonar sediment texture and oxygen profile approaches Benthic macrofaunal effects are analysed in terms of species abundance and biomass (SAB) addressing the responses of sensitive and non sensitive species
   Seabed modification was patchy within the dredging site Morphology texture and oxygen characteristics returned to pre-dredging conditions over most of the site during the first year of post-dredging A smaller part of the area deepened by ca 5 m and caused by multiple dredge furrows was altered more drastically During the year following the extraction a shift to finer sediments with a higher organic carbon content and reduced oxygen levels was observed at this location Sensitive benthic species abundance did not recover to pi e impact levels within a year after dredging Slow recovery of the sensitive species can be overlooked easily by common environmental assessment measures such as the SAB approach Related to benthic habitats environmentally sound dredging practices should consider the various impacts that the creation of deep pits can have on the seabed and compared those of shallow and isolated furrows

AB  - The paper contains results of investigations carried out in crop fields within the protected area, which is an important refuge of species diversity in grounds dominated by large-area farms. The segetal vegetation is represented by 13 plant communities, the development of which is influenced by various tillage manipulations. As a result, the segetal flora of the Sleza Landscape Park is heavily threatened and the structure and species richness of phytocoenoses are distinctly transformed. This is reflected in the frequency of weed occurrence in crops (i.e. there is a small group of common species and a very numerous group of species with I or 2 localities), as well as in values of biocoenotic indicators, e.g. the values of diversity indicator H vary between 1 and 3.5. An analysis of archaeophytes participation (frequency and numbers) in ATPOL squares indicates their significant connection with archaeological sites of the Neolithic settlement. Particular adherence to the early Neolithic settlement areas shows a group of species from the Caucalidion alliance. The richness and diversity of the Park vegetation, conditioned by many hundreds of years of agriculture, are now strongly transformed and have become impoverished. Establishing the Landscape Park, in order to preserve the natural-landscape character of the environment and its cultural and historical values, does not ensure the protection of both the species and the phytocoenotic diversity of this area.

AB  - Background: Chitin ranks as the most abundant polysaccharide in the oceans yet knowledge of shifts in structure and diversity of chitin-degrading communities across marine niches is scarce. Here, we integrate cultivation-dependent and -independent approaches to shed light on the chitin processing potential within the microbiomes of marine sponges, octocorals, sediments, and seawater.
   Results: We found that cultivatable host-associated bacteria in the genera Aquimarina, Enterovibrio, Microbulbifer, Pseudoalteromonas, Shewanella, and Vibrio were able to degrade colloidal chitin in vitro. Congruent with enzymatic activity bioassays, genome-wide inspection of cultivated symbionts revealed that Vibrio and Aquimarina species, particularly, possess several endo- and exo-chitinase-encoding genes underlying their ability to cleave the large chitin polymer into oligomers and dimers. Conversely, Alphaproteobacteria species were found to specialize in the utilization of the chitin monomer N-acetylglucosamine more often. Phylogenetic assessments uncovered a high degree of within-genome diversification of multiple, full-length endo-chitinase genes for Aquimarina and Vibrio strains, suggestive of a versatile chitin catabolism aptitude. We then analyzed the abundance distributions of chitin metabolism-related genes across 30 Illumina-sequenced microbial metagenomes and found that the endosymbiotic consortium of Spongia officinalis is enriched in polysaccharide deacetylases, suggesting the ability of the marine sponge microbiome to convert chitin into its deacetylated-and biotechnologically versatile-form chitosan. Instead, the abundance of endo-chitinase and chitin-binding protein-encoding genes in healthy octocorals leveled up with those from the surrounding environment but was found to be depleted in necrotic octocoral tissue. Using cultivation-independent, taxonomic assignments of endo-chitinase encoding genes, we unveiled previously unsuspected richness and divergent structures of chitinolytic communities across host-associated and free-living biotopes, revealing putative roles for uncultivated Gammaproteobacteria and Chloroflexi symbionts in chitin processing within sessile marine invertebrates.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that differential chitin degradation pathways, utilization, and turnover dictate the processing of chitin across marine micro-niches and support the hypothesis that inter-species cross-feeding could facilitate the co-existence of chitin utilizers within marine invertebrate microbiomes. We further identified chitin metabolism functions which may serve as indicators of microbiome integrity/dysbiosis in corals and reveal putative novel chitinolytic enzymes in the genus Aquimarina that may find applications in the blue biotechnology sector.

AB  - Cell walls are not only a protective barrier surrounding protoplasts but serve as signaling platform between the extracellular environment and the intracellular physiology. Ions of heavy metals and trace elements, summarized to metal ions, bind to cell wall components, trigger their modification and provoke growth responses. To examine if metal ions trigger cell wall sensing receptor like kinases (RLKs) of the Catharanthus roseus RLK1-like (CrRLK1L) family we employed a molecular genetic approach. Quantitative transcription analyses show that HERCULES1 (HERK1), THESEUS1 (THE1), and FERONIA (FER) were differently regulated by cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), and lead (Pb). Growth responses were quantified for roots and etiolated hypocotyls of related mutants and overexpressors on Cd, copper (Cu), Ni, Pb, and zinc (Zn) and revealed a complex pattern of gene specific, overlapping and antagonistic responses. Root growth was often inversely affected to hypocotyl elongation. For example, both HERK genes seem to negatively regulate hypocotyl elongation upon Cd, Ni, Zn, and Pb while they support root growth on Cd, Cu, and Ni. The different THE1 alleles exhibited a similar effect between roots and hypocotyls on Ni, where the loss-of-function mutant was more tolerant while the gain of function mutants were hypersensitive indicating that THE1 is mediating Ni specific inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in the dark. In contrast hypocotyl elongation of the knock-out mutant, fer-4, was hypersensitive to Ni but exhibited a higher tolerance to Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn. These data indicate an antagonistic action between THE1 and FER in relation to hypocotyl elongation upon excess of Ni. FERs function as receptor for rapid alkalinization factors (RALFs) was tested with the indicator bromocresol purple. While fer-4 roots strongly acidified control and metal ion containing media, the etiolated hypocotyls alkalized the media which is consistent with the already shorter hypocotyl of fer-4. No other CrRLK1L mutant exhibited this phenotype except of the THE1:GFP overexpressor on Ni suggesting that THE1 might be involved in Ni induced and hypocotyl specific RALF signaling and growth regulating pathway. Overall, our findings establish a molecular link between metal ion stress, growth and the cell wall integrity sensors of the CrRLK1L family.

AB  - We describe a process for evaluating proposed ecosystem restoration projects intended to improve survival of juvenile salmon in the Columbia River estuary (CRE). Changes in the Columbia River basin (northwestern USA), including hydropower development, have contributed to the listing of 13 salmon stocks as endangered or threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Habitat restoration in the CRE, from Bonneville Dam to the ocean, is part of a basin-wide, legally mandated effort to mitigate federal hydropower impacts on salmon survival. An Expert Regional Technical Group (ERTG) was established in 2009 to improve and implement a process for assessing and assigning "survival benefit units" (SBUs) to restoration actions. The SBU concept assumes site-specific restoration projects will increase juvenile salmon survival during migration through the 234 km CRE. Assigned SBUs are used to inform selection of restoration projects and gauge mitigation progress. The ERTG standardized the SBU assessment process to improve its scientific integrity, repeatability, and transparency. In lieu of experimental data to quantify the survival benefits of individual restoration actions, the ERTG adopted a conceptual model composed of three assessment criteria-certainty of success, fish opportunity improvements, and habitat capacity improvements-to evaluate restoration projects. Based on these criteria, an algorithm assigned SBUs by integrating potential fish density as an indicator of salmon performance. Between 2009 and 2014, the ERTG assessed SBUs for 55 proposed projects involving a total of 181 restoration actions located across 8 of 9 reaches of the CRE, largely relying on information provided in a project template based on the conceptual model, presentations, discussions with project sponsors, and site visits. Most projects restored tidal inundation to emergent wetlands, improved riparian function, and removed invasive vegetation. The scientific relationship of geomorphic and salmonid responses to restoration actions remains the foremost concern. Although not designed to establish a broad strategy for estuary restoration, the scoring process has adaptively influenced the types, designs, and locations of restoration proposals. The ERTG process may be a useful model for others who have unique ecosystem restoration goals and share some of our common challenges. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Managing of business processes is done based on decision making and performance of workers in management positions who utilize business information systems as a necessary support tool. Business processes and business data form a coherent unit as business processes need relevant data for their execution while business data should fully serve to business processes. A change of the information system as a whole or a modification of a partial module of the information system are initiated exclusively by changes in the flow of instances of the business flow; this means either external changes such as customers' requirements, change in suppliers' approach or internal changes such as a change in activity flow or change in work activities as such. Current information systems are developed on the platform of relation database systems with the basic principle of relation data model. Analysis and design of a relation data model requires application of specialized methods leading to definition of relation schemes including integrity constraints. For development of a data model technical expertise is necessary which cannot be delegated on actors of working activities or managers of business processes. However, only the actors in process instances and managers of the process know their needs in relation with execution of the process, therefore, they should characterize their requirements on the module of the information system by identifying the data content.
   Information system serves as support for carrying out particular business process. Composition of indicators is changeable together with methods of measuring and evaluating and also the process itself changes as a result of its improvements. When controlling the values of indicators, it is necessary to take into account that within one process it is possible to measure indicators and then evaluate the same process or it is possible to measure indicators which provide data about quality or lack of quality of another process. The composition of indicators for measuring and evaluating quality of process performance or any change in the method of controlling should be an impulse for change of information environment. Therefore, development of each data model should be preceded by identification of data content with exact characteristics of requirements of composition and relation between measuring indicators.

AB  - Marine pollutants such as heavy metals are well-known due to their bioaccumulative nature, toxicity and persistence in the marine environment. The present research aims to evaluate the bioaccumulation of three metals (Cd, Zn and Cu), individual mean (multimetal) bioaccumulation index (IMBI) and metal pollution index (MPI) as an assessment tool in Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincis), based on the full factorial central composite face centered (CCF) design. Mussels were exposed to different sub-lethal concentrations (0-10%-72h-LC50 -72h-mg.L-1) of studied heavy metals for three days. At the end of exposure cycle, the bioaccumulations of heavy metals content in mussels were determined. Multiple regressions were used to fit experimental data to a second-order polynomial equation, which was then examined using variance analysis (ANOVA). The results revealed that the indexes IMBI and MPI depend on the type and concentration of metals and also on the metals combination. Accordingly, the toxicological metal-metal interactions were found not linear meaning supra-additive (synergistic), infra-additive (antagonistic) or no/zero interaction. The optimization of experimental data was used to determine the optimal conditions for the heavy metal bioaccumulation.

AB  - Alpine life zones exist at the cold edge above the tree line in mountains where tree species do not grow, however, a large plant diversity thrives due to alpine climate adaptations to short growing seasons and low temperatures. Keeping this phenomenon in view, study was designed to determine the influential environmental variables responsible for structuring the plant communities in the alpine pastures and cold desert of Northwestern Himalayas, Pakistan. The vegetation of the aforementioned study area was quantified by following the Line transect (50 meters) method along the geographic, slope, edaphic and climatic gradients. All the recorded data of plant species and environmental variables were analyzed by various statistical softwares' (i.e., PCORD, CANOCO and R 3.6.1). Thirty-nine species recorded in 13 stands were grouped into two major plant communities (i.e., Poa-Bistorta-Primula and Bistorta-Poa-Primula). Poa-Bistorta-Primula community has the highest number of plant species (39 species) as well as the highest value of alpha and beta diversity (2.785 and 0.916, respectively) and Pielou's evenness (0.865) in Bistorta-Poa-Primula community. Due to the high elevation, severe low temperature is the feature throughout the growing season. Such severe climatic environment is worsened by xeric conditions which led to very short growing season from July to September. The recognized indicators of such harsh environment might be useful in monitoring variations in plant communities resulted in response to environmental changes.

AB  - This study estimates the technical, economic and environmental impact of decarbonization strategy on Romanian fossil power generation sector. Two post-combustion decarbonization options are considered either for existing power plant retrofit or new investment based on current conventional designs: a technological and commercial mature chemical scrubbing process using methyl-diethanol-amine (MDEA) and one more innovative and energy-efficient gas-solid process using calcium looping (CaL). Considering the Romanian power generation sector conditions, natural gas, hard coal and lignite were assessed as fuels. The decarbonized designs have 1000 MW net electricity output to permit an easier scale-up calculation with 90% CO2 capture rate. The non-decarbonized designs are also assessed to quantify the decarbonization energy and economic costs. It was shown that the decarbonization of Romanian fossil-fired electricity plants has significant benefits in term of increasing overall energy efficiency (from current 30-33% for coal and lignite and 35-39% for natural gas to 32.5-36% and 48-52% respectively) as well as reducing the cost of electricity (from current 80-120 euro/MWh to 55-85 euro/MWh). The investment effort to replace all fossil fleet (both gas and coal) with new modern units is foreseen to be substantial (about 11.2-14.9 billion Euro). A detailed environmental analysis was provided to assess the overall impact of decarbonization. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Monitoring changes in eukaryotic microbial communities is critical for understanding ecosystem dynamics, trophic interactions and the impacts of climate change. Long-term time series are an important tool for monitoring changes in ecological communities, but time series from a single location may not be representative of regional dynamics. In the German Bight, the Helgoland Roads time series is such a long-term series. Here, we consider the spatial dynamics of the eukaryotic microbes as an indicator of the representativeness of the Helgoland Roads site for the coastal German Bight, which is located in the North Sea. The eukaryotic microbial community in the German Bight was analysed at Helgoland Roads and two coastal stations (Cuxhaven and Wilhelmshaven) between March and October 2016 using metabarcoding. In addition, an oceanographical model was used to check for potential hydrological connectivity between the stations during the sampling period. Our results showed that the communities were different at the three stations. Helgoland was dominated by dinoflagellates, whereas the coastal stations had more diverse communities. Furthermore, differences were observed in the dinoflagellate and diatom communities between the three stations. Lagrangian particle tracking applied to the model results, showed limited connectivity between Helgoland and the coastal stations in 2016. The differences between Helgoland and the coastal stations were correlated with the different hydrological regimes and associated nutrient contents. Our observations suggest the presence of different eukaryotic microbial communities separated by complex hydrological conditions in the coastal German Bight.

AB  - Patterns of lateral intrabiogeocenotic (between separate elementary biogeoranges) and interbiogeocenotic variability in the content of secondary metabolites and nutritional elements in the different-age needles of spruce (Picea abies ssp. obovata (Ledeb.) Domin) have been studied along the geochemical transect in spruce forests in northern taiga (Kola Peninsula). The perennial needles of spruce undergrowth (30-40 years) are characterized by a higher concentration of carbon, lignin, high-molecular-weight phenolic compounds, bounded tannins, and wide ranges of lignin/cellulose and lignin/N ratios compared to trees older than 100 years. The needles of spruce trees older than 100 years have significantly more bounded tannins and low-molecular-weight phenols in transitional and accumulative sites than in automorphic locations. The concentration of lignin and lignin/N ratio was significantly higher in the 5-7-year-old needles of spruce trees growing in automorphic conditions, while spruce forests in transitional and accumulative sites have the maximum values of these indicators for the current-year needles. Changes in the chemical composition of spruce needles along the geochemical transect are determined by (1) different concentrations of nutritional elements and secondary metabolites in soils; (2) increased soil moisture from automorphic to accumulative sites; (3) the features of the microbiological activity of soils; and (4) environmental factors (light, temperature, etc.).

AB  - The American lobster supports the most economically valuable fishery in the Gulf of Maine and Atlantic Canada. Across much of its range, ocean temperatures have increased at rates faster than almost anywhere in the world. Studies of warming effects on larvae have largely focused on survival and development, but rarely have examined sub-lethal effects that could influence settlement and subsequent recruitment to the fishery. We explored how warming influences rate of development, survival, stress, and developmental stability of larval lobsters reared under four nominal temperatures: 14, 16, 18, and 22 degrees C. Our study is the first to evaluate the use of fluctuating asymmetry as a biomarker for developmental instability in larval American lobster. We also recorded total hemocyte counts in postlarvae as an indicator of stress, a novel technique for work in larval lobster. Development proceeded significantly faster as temperature increased, and cumulative survival was significantly positively correlated with temperature. However, postlarvae reared under temperature extremes exhibited elevated hemocyte counts and had significantly lower levels of variance in midline asymmetry compared to intermediate temperature groups. Together, this suggests that warmer temperatures may facilitate faster growth at the expense of increased physiological stress and a loss of genetic diversity, potentially affecting the species' ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Fluctuating asymmetry could prove to be a useful bioindicator for population resilience.

AB  - Knowledge-driven management for wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) performance becomes increasingly important considering the globally growing production of wastewater and the rising demand of clean water supply. Even though the potential of microbial organisms (bacteria and protists) as bioindicators for WWTP performance is well known, it is far from being fully exploited for routine monitoring programs. Therefore, we here used massive sequencing of environmental (e)DNA metabarcodes from bacterial (V3-V4 region of the SSU rRNA gene) and eukaryote (V9 region of the SSU rRNA gene) communities in 21 activated sludge samples obtained from full-scale municipal WWTPs in Germany. Microbial community patterns were compared to standard WWTP operating parameters and two traditionally used WWTP performance indicators (Sludge Biotic Index and Sludge Index). Both indices showed low concordance and hardly correlated with chemical WWTP performance parameters nor did they correlate with microbial community structures. In contrast, microbial community profiles significantly correlated with WWTP performance parameters and operating conditions of the plants under study. Therefore, eDNA metabarcode profiles of whole microbial communities indicate the performance of WWTP and can provide useful information for management strategies. We here suggest a strategy for the development of an eDNA metabarcode based bioindicator system, which can be implemented in future standard monitoring programs for WWTP performance and effluent quality.

AB  - Oyster or rock oyster (Striostrea prismatica) is a bivalve mollusk highly appreciated among traditional seafood in several Latin American countries. Uncontrolled capture and lack of techniques for its culture, threaten their growth and conservation, as a decrease in its population has been reported. This review highlights critical aspects of its biology, ecology, catching activity and potential use in aquaculture. Its presence is registered as a fossil, and its identification is crucial because of its similarity to other species of ostreids. The population structure and its abundance in natural banks are associated with depth, substrate, dynamics of exposure and local environmental conditions. The reproductive activity and gametogenesis vary from an annual increase to continuous reproduction related to its location latitude. The size at first maturity is similar in both sexes and achieves about nine cm in less than a year. In culture experiments, diets in breeding stocks have been studied, resulting in trochophore larvae and "D" larvae, at 12 and 24 h after fertilization. Shell fixation has been achieved in natural collectors, but their culture has not been developed yet. The species is used as an indicator of pollution, associated with microalgae causing harmful outcrops. There are no precise records of its catch, as it is reported in combination with other ostreids species. For its conservation and sustainable exploitation, it is necessary to increase research on its biology to implement management programs and developing culture techniques.

AB  - River damming causes a decrease in water current velocity which leads to an increase in richness and abundance of organisms atypical for running waters. Zooplankton is a representative example of such organisms. The influx of zooplankton from carp ponds is an additional factor that increases richness and abundance of zooplankton in rivers. We hypothesized that zooplankton dispersing from the carp ponds colonize the impoundments in river and the richness of zooplankton increase in impoundments by development of new species, not observed in the upstream. The zooplankton was collected monthly from April to September of 2013 and 2014. Sampling sites were located in the Barycz river (in the lotic sections and in the dam impoundments), as well as in its tributaries, which are the outlets of carp ponds. The most changes in zooplankton richness and abundance were observed at sites located within the dam impoundments, especially in relation to the lower values of the current velocity. Since the abundance of pelagic rotifers, cladocerans and copepods in the carp pond outlets was similar to that at lower sites in the Barycz, the influence of the carp pond outlets on the abundance in the dam and lotic sections was significant. The river itself in its impounded sections provides advantageous conditions for retention and colonization by a high abundance of zooplankton dispersing from the carp ponds, and for the development of species not occurred in the upstream, which, in turn, increases richness.

AB  - This study examines the effects of increasing salinity on fish assemblage structure in the Casamance Estuary, Senegal. using a series of indices. The study data were derived from commercial fishery surveys conducted between April and July 2005. Analysis of within-trophic-group diversity in the Casamance Estuary shows a significant drop in the diversity of apex predators in the upper. more saline reaches of the estuary. By contrast. primary consumers adapted well to salinity changes and exhibited higher taxonomic diversity in the upper reaches of the estuary than in the lower reaches. The findings also indicate decreases in average sizes of the landed species and the trophic levels among fish catches in the direction of the upper reaches. However, the catch per unit effort (CPUE) was globally higher in the upstream area of the estuary as compared with the downstream area. This increasing CPUE trend from the lower towards the upper reaches is attributed to (i) the high primary productivity in the upper Casamance Estuary; (ii) the increasing abundance of euryhaline fish species in an upstream direction: and (iii) 'telescoping' of the food chain through the presence of mostly herbivorous fishes in the upper reaches. Such a situation likely facilitated high fish production in the upstream area of the estuary, though multimetric indices indicated unfavourable living conditions for many fish taxa in this area.

AB  - In increasingly fragmented landscapes tree plantations are thought to help maintain forest continuity among native patches. Epiphytic lichens are one of the most sensitive groups to change in forest conditions, but the effects of this management practice are still poorly studied in temperate regions. In this study we compared epiphytic lichen diversity among small patches of old, native oaks (Quercus pyrenaica) and young, planted chestnuts (Castanea sativa) and Monterey pines (Pinus radiata) in a major forestry area in northwestern Spain. Our results showed that the richness of epiphytic lichens was higher in C. sativa than Q. pyrenaica, but that the latter had more lichen species typical of mature forests, including macrocyanolichens. Overall, C. sativa plantations had more species typical of well-lit, dry environments than Q. pyrenaica or P. radiata, which is likely caused by the natural architecture of each tree species, and to differences in forest age and management. At the tree level, Q. pyrenaica had the highest total richness including all species of conservation interest, which were exclusively found on this species. On a corollary, this study shows that Q. pyrenaica forests had the best preserved epiphytic lichen communities but with marked signs of forest fragmentation. In this fragmented landscape, young plantations of C. sativa and P. radiata seem to be of limited help for providing connectivity to epiphytic lichens among old native forest patches.

AB  - Sustainable land use of watershed is an important aspect for the development and conservation of nature. Unconcerned use of the resources may lead to irreversible consequences and overall misbalance. The main aim of the research was to create a software, which could be useful for estimation of the catchment's nature conditions and assessment of changes on the basis of which the prediction of possible consequences can be made. In the given work, the influencing factors have been considered: precipitation and temperature analysis and land cover change over the last 30 years. With the help of the developed model based on the provided data, the representation of changes in climate, land cover and water dynamics were calculated. As a result, the software establishes the characteristics of the catchment area and makes it possible to see the changing pattern of the selected factors. The primary and secondary outcomes of the model provide precise calculation of surface runoffs, interception losses, and transpirations. In order to assess the effectiveness of the model, the results of the model and the river discharge were compared with estimation of the possible error rate. Different territories with similar characteristics can implement developed software for daily use on the local level. However, for successful applying in a new area the model has to be localized. Further evolvement is necessary in order to make the model applicable to any different location with specific features which can be different from the original example provided.

AB  - Changes of carbon stocks in agricultural soils, emissions of greenhouse gases from agriculture, and the delivery of ecosystem services of agricultural landscapes depend on combinations of land-use, livestock density, farming practices, climate and soil types. Many environmental processes are highly non-linear. If the analysis of the environmental impact is based on data at a relatively coarse-scale (e.g. farm, country, or large administrative regions), conclusions can be misleading. For an accurate assessment of agri-environmental indicators, data of agricultural activities and their dynamics are needed at high spatial resolution. In this paper, we develop and validate a spatial model for predicting the agricultural land-use areas within the homogenous spatial units (HSUs). For the EU-28 countries, we distinguish about 1.5 x 10(5) HSUs and we consider 30 possible land-uses to match with the classification used in the Common Agricultural Policy Regionalized Impact (CAPRI) model. The comparison of model predictions with independent observations and with a simple rule-based approach at HSU level demonstrates that the predictions are generally accurate in more than 75 % of HSUs. The frequent crops or land-use are better predicted. For non-frequent crops and/or crops requiring specific cultivation conditions, the model needs further fine-tuning. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB  - The unicellular freshwater alga Micrasterias denticulata is an exceptional organism due to its complex star-shaped, highly symmetric morphology and has thus attracted the interest of researchers for many decades. As a member of the Streptophyta, Micrasterias is not only genetically closely related to higher land plants but shares common features with them in many physiological and cell biological aspects. These facts, together with its considerable cell size of about 200 tom its modest cultivation conditions and the uncomplicated accessibility particularly to any microscopic techniques, make Micrasterias a very well suited cell biological plant model system. The review focuses particularly on cell wall formation and composition, dictyosomal structure and function, cytoskeleton control of growth and morphogenesis as well as on ionic regulation and signal transduction. It has been also shown in the recent years that Micrasterias is a highly sensitive indicator for environmental stress impact such as heavy metals, high salinity, oxidative stress or starvation. Stress induced organelle degradation, autophagy, adaption and detoxification mechanisms have moved in the center of interest and have been investigated with modern microscopic techniques such as 3-D- and analytical electron microscopy as well as with biochemical, physiological and molecular approaches. This review is intended to summarize and discuss the most important results obtained in Micrasterias in the last 20 years and to compare the results to similar processes in higher plant cells.

AB  - The fate and effect of nanomaterials in the environment has raised concern about their environmental risk to aquatic organisms. Silica nanoparticles (SiO2-NPs) find its uses in various fields and are inevitably released into the environment. However, the ecotoxicological effects of SiO2-NPs on the freshwater fish remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different concentrations (1, 5 and 25 mg L-1) of SiO2-NPs on certain hematological, ionoregulatory and enzymological profiles of a freshwater teleost fish Labeo rohita. Hematological parameters such as hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) values were altered in SiO2-NPs treated groups. Likewise, plasma electrolytes such as plasma sodium (Na+), potassium (K+) and chloride (Cl) levels and Na+/K+ ATPase activity in gill of SiO2-NPs treated groups were altered in all concentrations throughout the study period (96 h). The alterations of these parameters were found to be dependent on dose and exposure period. The results of the present study indicate that the alterations of these parameters may relate to physiological stress system to SiO2-NPs toxicity and also demonstrate that manufactured metal oxide NPs in aquatic environment may affect the health condition of the aquatic organisms.

AB  - Pesticide mixtures are common in streams with agricultural or urban influence in the watershed. The Pesticide Toxicity Index (PTI) is a screening tool to assess potential aquatic toxicity of complex pesticide mixtures by combining measures of pesticide exposure and acute toxicity in an additive toxic-unit model. The PTI is determined separately for fish, cladocerans, and benthic invertebrates. This study expands the number of pesticides and degradates included in previous editions of the PTI from 124 to 492 pesticides and degradates, and includes two types of PTI for use in different applications, depending on study objectives. The Median-PTI was calculated from median toxicity values for individual pesticides, so is robust to outliers and is appropriate for comparing relative potential toxicity among samples, sites, or pesticides. The Sensitive-PTI uses the 5th percentile of available toxicity values, so is a more sensitive screening-level indicator of potential toxicity. PTI predictions of toxicity in environmental samples were tested using data aggregated from published field studies that measured pesticide concentrations and toxicity to Ceriodaphnia dubia in ambient stream water. C. dubia survival was reduced to <= 50% of controls in 44% of samples with Median-PTI values of 0.1-1, and to 0% in 96% of samples with Median-PTI values >1. The PTI is a relative, but quantitative, indicator of potential toxicity that can be used to evaluate relationships between pesticide exposure and biological condition. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Evaluation of Bare Ground on Rangelands Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: A Case Study
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
LA  - English
KW  - COVER
AB  - Attention is currently being given to methods that assess the ecological condition of rangelands throughout the United States. Bare ground is being considered by a number of agencies and resource specialists as a key indicator that can be evaluated over a broad area. Traditional methods of measuring bare ground rely on field technicians collecting data along a line transect or from a plot. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide an alternative to collecting field data, can monitor a large area in a relatively short period of time, and in many cases, can enhance the safety and time required to collect data. In this study, both fixed-wing and helicopter UAVs were used to measure bare ground in a sagebrush steppe ecosystem. The data were collected with digital imagery and read using the image analysis software, Sample-Point. The approach was tested over seven different plots and compared against traditional field methods to evaluate accuracy for assessing bare ground. The field plots were located on the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) site west of Idaho Falls, Idaho, in locations where there is very little disturbance by humans and the area is grazed only by wildlife. Mean fixed-wing and helicopter UAV bare ground values were within 1% of field estimates. This study shows that if a high degree of detail and data accuracy is desired, a helicopter UAV may be a good platform. If the data collection objective is to assess broad-scale landscape level changes, the collection of imagery with a fixed-wing system is probably more appropriate.

AB  - The phylogenetic diversity of Bacteria and Archaea in water retrieved from a Dutch oil field and units of the associated oil-water separation site were determined using two culture-independent methods. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments was used to scan the microbial diversity in (1) the oil-water emulsion produced, (2) two different oil-water separator tanks, (3) a wash tank and (4) a water injector. Longer 16S rRNA gene fragments were amplified, cloned and sequenced to determine the diversity in more detail. One of the questions addressed was whether the detected microorganisms could serve as indicators for the environments from which they were retrieved. It was observed that the community found in the production water resembled those reported previously in oil reservoirs, indicating that these ecosystems harbor specific microbial communities. It was shown that changes, like a decrease in temperature, cause a distinctive shift in these communities. The addition of SO32- to the wash tank as ammonium bisulphite, used in the oil industry to scavenge oxygen, resulted in a complete community change, giving rise to an unwanted sulphate-reducing community. The fact that these changes in the community can be linked to changes in their environment might indicate that these tools can be used for the monitoring of changing conditions in oil reservoirs upon, for example, water flooding.

AB  - Soil electrical conductivity (EC) is a useful indicator in managing agricultural systems, but tools for convenient and inexpensive measurements in the field are generally lacking. Handheld conductivity probes were designed to evaluate in-field naturally occurring and human-induced total soluble electrolyte levels in soil and water. The probes were used to survey and monitor EC in the field and to assess soil and water quality as related to environmental stability and sustainable food production. A pencil-sized 16-cm probe (PP) was connected to a handheld Hanna (DiST WP 4) conductivity meter, resulting in an economical, compact, and easy to use device. The tool provided accurate and precise results compared with laboratory instrumentation under standardized conditions of soil water content and temperature. Soil samples, varying widely in texture and organic matter content, and having ECs ranging from 0.13 to 2.32dSm(-1) were used for comparison. Mean values and coefficients of variation were similar for the PP and the commercial laboratory EC meter with 2 values determined with the two instruments being strongly correlated (r(2) = 0.96-0.99). The handheld and PP probes effectively replaced expensive and cumbersome laboratory and field instruments used to measure EC in water and soil samples. The probe measurements were useful alternatives to conventional methods as they enabled accurate and precise measurement of EC, were a manageable size for field use, and were reliable and economic. The utility of EC as an indicator of soil health, plantavailable N, and environmental quality is also presented.

AB  - Fishes in the superorder ostariophysi possess specialized epidermal cells that contain an alarm cue. Fish associate novel odours, such as the odour of a predator, with predation risk after a single, simultaneous exposure to the novel odour and alarm cue. Thereafter, the novel cue is recognized as an indicator of risk and its presence induces antipredator behaviour. Two common antipredator behaviours are reduction in activity and movement to the bottom. This phenomenon has been demonstrated many times in the laboratory setting for a variety of aquatic taxa. In nature however, the detection of novel predator odour may be time-shifted with respect to the detection of alarm cues. Is there a critical period immediately upon the detection of alarm cue in which associative learning can occur? We presented zebra danios, Danio rerio, with the odour of northern pike, Esox lucius, 5 min after presenting them with either alarm cue or water (control). During a predation event, 5 min is a long time. When later retested with pike odour alone, zebra fish conditioned with alarm cue significantly increased antipredator behaviour in terms of decreased activity and movement towards the bottom. Control fish did not recognize pike odour as dangerous when retested. These data show that learned recognition of predation risk is sufficiently robust to accommodate ecologically realistic temporal shifts in stimulus presentation.

AB  - Physical and biological variables affecting juvenile Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) in Prince William Sound (PWS) from 1995 to 1998 were investigated as part of a multifaceted study of recruitment, the Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) program. Though more herring larvae were retained in eastern PWS bays, ages-0 and -1 herring used bays throughout PWS as nursery areas. Water transported into PWS from the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) contributed oceanic prey species to neritic habitats. Consequently, variations in local food availability resulted in different diets and growth rates of herring among bays. Summer food availability and possible interspecific competition for food in nursery areas affected the autumn nutritional status and juvenile whole body energy content (WBEC), which differed among bays. The WBEC of age-0 herring in autumn was related to over-winter survival. The limited amount of food consumption in winter was not sufficient to meet metabolic needs. The smallest age-0 fish were most at risk of starvation in winter. Autumn WBEC of herring and winter water temperature were used to model over-winter mortality of age-0 herring. Differences in feeding and energetics among nursery areas indicated that habitat quality and age-0 survival were varied among areas and years. These conditions were measured by temperature, zooplankton abundance, size of juvenile herring, diet energy, energy source (GOA vs. neritic zooplankton), WBEC, and within-bay competition.

AB  - Information on the probability distribution and variability of soil properties at a regional stale could improve the ability of the USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to monitor soil condition using the National Resources Inventory (NRI). Our objective was to evaluate the hypothesis that the probability distribution of 17 physical, chemical, and biological soil properties are: (i) normally distributed, or (ii) log-normally distributed at a regional stale, and to estimate the magnitude of change that may be detected assuming either a normal or log-normal distribution. Samples were collected irrespective of soil series from two Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs) (no. 9 and 105), and from the Ascalon (fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Argiustoll) and Amarillo (fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Aridic Paleustalf) soils in MLRA 67 and 77, using the NRI sampling design. Most soil properties were non-normally distributed, with the frequency of non-normality varying between MLRAs. Confining sampling to a single soil series did not consistently improve the precision with which soil properties were estimated. Log transformation resulted in normal distributions for most soil properties and reduced variability two- to threefold. However, a few soil properties remained non-normally distributed. Soil pH may be monitored at the regional scale with a high degree of precision. Small changes in soil C content (3-8% of the regional mean) may be detected using Log, transformed total organic C as the indicator. Sampling soil properties as part of the NRI should improve NRCS' ability to monitor soil rendition on a regional stale.

AB  - Leaf Area Index (LAI) plays a prominent role as an indicator of forest ecosystem condition in research on change detection. For this, rapid and reliable estimation of the effective LAI (LAIe) - this is the ratio of the total one-sided area of vegetation elements over the unit ground area) - at various scales is of utmost importance. We used the Licor LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer (PCA) for the acquisition of point LAI values within small (about 1 ha) stands. Canopy influences, external to the stand for which LAI was being assessed, and direct sunlight were excluded from respectively the LAIe computations and the fields of view of the PCA sensors by the use of a 270 degrees viewcap. The effect of sampling scheme and data aggregation method on LAIe was quantified by means of a Monte Carlo simulation. The methodology presented is generalized and can be applied to forest stands with different canopy architectures. Our results show that for our study area the LAIe populations are normally distributed. A power function relationship was shown to exist between the relative accuracy of the acquired LAIe value and the sampling intensity. Based on this information, an appropriate sampling scheme can be selected for a predetermined relative accuracy. The method allowed us to quantitatively assess LAIe in small stands often occurring in very heterogeneous environments, which is typically the case for large parts of Western Europe.

AB  - The expressions of factorial (sigma(s)2) and stochastic (sigma(s)2) components of phenotypic variance of bilateral characters are given, regarding simple connection of the latter to the fluctuating asymmetry indicator, being traditionally used for assessment of developmental stability.  The values of both components were calculated for 5 meristic characters in 172 samples of bream collected over most of its geographic range.  The sigma(s)2 values were to indicate possible effects of genetic disbalance and to measure environmental stress, while sigma(f)2 was regarded as a rough estimate of the genetical heterogeneity.  It was found that sigma(s)2 values tended to grow in following situations:  a) zones of interpopulational contacts or in populations with unusual morphology; b) zones of increased anthropogeneous pollution, in particular in the lower parts of the artificial reservoirs as compared to the upper parts and the majority of rivers and lakes.  On the other hand, sigma(f)2 values in lakes appeared to be lower than in rivers, probably due to comparatively low genetic heterogeneity of the lake populations.  The whole set of samples exhibits another clear trend:  negative correlation between sigma(s)2 and sigma(f)2, which seems to illustrate a well-known connection between developmental homeostasis and heterozygosity.  A conclusion may be made that the phenotypic variance components are useful in ecological and genetical monitoring of large population systems, although the data are often difficult to interpret properly for separate populations.

AB  - Amazonia harbours a vast biotic and ecological diversity, enabling investigation of the effects of microevolutionary processes and environmental variation on species diversification. Integrative approaches combining phenotypic and genetic variation can improve our knowledge on diversification processes in megadiverse regions. Here, we investigate the influence of environmental and geographic variation on the genetic and morphological differentiation in the Amazonian Boana calcarata-fasciata (Anura: Hylidae) species complex. We analysed the variation of one mtDNA gene from individuals of different forest environments, and assessed their phylogenetic relationships and species limits to define the lineages to perform a phenotypic-environmental approach. We collected morphological data (head shape and size) using 3D models and investigated the phylogenetic signal, evolutionary model and influence of environmental variables on morphology. We verified associations between environmental and geographical distances with morphological and genetic variation using distance-based redundancy analyses and Mantel tests. We found an even higher cryptic diversity than already recognized within the species complex. Body size and head shape varied among specimens, but did not present phylogenetic signal, diverging under a selective evolutionary model. Our results show that diverse factors have influenced morphological and genetic variation, but environmental conditions such as vegetation cover, precipitation and climate change velocity influenced morphological diversification. Possible population-level mechanisms such as parallel morphological evolution or plastic responses to similar environments could account for such patterns in these typical Amazonian treefrogs.

AB  - The community composition of betaproteobacterial ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (ss -AOB) in the River Elbe Estuary was investigated by high throughput sequencing of ammonia monooxygenase subunit A gene (amoA) amplicons. In the course of the seasons surface sediment samples from seven sites along the longitudinal profile of the upper Estuary of the Elbe were investigated. We observed striking shifts of the ss -AOB community composition according to space and time. Members of the Nitrosomonas oligotropha-lineage and the genus Nitrosospira were found to be the dominant ss -AOB within the river transect, investigated. However, continuous shifts of balance between members of both lineages along the longitudinal profile were determined. A noticeable feature was a substantial increase of proportion of Nitrosospira-like sequences in autumn and of sequences affiliated with the Nitrosomonas marina-lineage at downstream sites in spring and summer. Slightly raised relative abundances of sequences affiliated with the Nitrosomonas europaea/Nitrosomonas mobilis-lineage and the Nitrosomonas communis-lineage were found at sampling sites located in the port of Hamburg. Comparisons between environmental parameters and AOB-lineage (ecotype) composition revealed promising clues that processes happening in the fluvial to marine transition zone of the Elbe estuary are reflected by shifts in the relative proportion of ammonia monooxygenase sequence abundance, and hence, we propose ss -AOB as appropriate indicators for environmental dynamics and the ecological condition of the Elbe Estuary.

AB  - Large sulfur bacteria of the genus Achromatium are exceptional among Bacteria and Archaea as they can accumulate high amounts of internal calcite. Although known for more than 100 years, they remain uncultured, and only freshwater populations have been studied so far. Here we investigate a marine population of calcite-accumulating bacteria that is primarily found at the sediment surface of tide pools in a salt marsh, where high sulfide concentrations meet oversaturated oxygen concentrations during the day. Dynamic sulfur cycling by phototrophic sulfide-oxidizing and heterotrophic sulfate-reducing bacteria co-occurring in these sediments creates a highly sulfidic environment that we propose induces behavioral differences in the Achromatium population compared with reported migration patterns in a low-sulfide environment. Fluctuating intracellular calcium/sulfur ratios at different depths and times of day indicate a biochemical reaction of the salt marsh Achromatium to diurnal changes in sedimentary redox conditions. We correlate this calcite dynamic with new evidence regarding its formation/mobilization and suggest general implications as well as a possible biological function of calcite accumulation in large bacteria in the sediment environment that is governed by gradients. Finally, we propose a new taxonomic classification of the salt marsh Achromatium based on their adaptation to a significantly different habitat than their freshwater relatives, as indicated by their differential behavior as well as phylogenetic distance on 16S ribosomal RNA gene level. In future studies, whole-genome characterization and additional ecophysiological factors could further support the distinctive position of salt marsh Achromatium.

AB  - Understanding nutrient dynamics in non-typical soil materials such as bauxite-processing residue sand (pH > 10; EC > 30 dS m(-1)) is critical for developing fertilizer strategies and evaluating ecological restoration performance. Indices relating nitrogen (N) concentration in soil to plant N uptake are well-established for natural soils but their application to non-typical soils has received little attention. This study investigated a range of soil-based methods [i.e. 2 M KCl extractable inorganic N (NH4+, NO3-), potentially mineralizable nitrogen (PMN), and 0.01 M CaCl2 extractable N] to identify their suitability for describing soil-plant N relations in highly alkaline bauxite-processing residue sand. Nitrogen availability indices were measured under laboratory (pot trial) and field conditions. Pot trial was established using residue sand that had been amended (10%, v/v, basis) with various organic (greenwaste compost, biochar and biosolids) and inorganic (zeolite) materials. Both the field study and pot trial showed that 2 M KCl extractable NO3--N was most highly correlated with plant biomass N compared with the other N availability indices. Findings from this study suggest that 2 M KCl extractable NO3--N can be used as a soil quality indicator in developing fertilizer management strategies and assessing ecological status of the residue storage areas.

AB  - Hopanoids methylated at the C-3 position are a subset of bacterial triterpenoids that are readily preserved in modern and ancient sediments and in petroleum. The production of 3-methylhopanoids by extant aerobic methanotrophs and their common occurrence in modern and fossil methane seep communities, in conjunction with carbon isotope analysis, has led to their use as biomarker proxies for aerobic methanotrophy. In addition, these lipids are also produced by aerobic acetic acid bacteria and, lacking carbon isotope analysis, are more generally used as indicators for aerobiosis in ancient ecosystems. However, recent genetic studies have brought into question our current understanding of the taxonomic diversity of methylhopanoid-producing bacteria and have highlighted that a proper interpretation of methylhopanes in the rock record requires a deeper understanding of their cellular function. In this study, we identified and deleted a gene, hpnR, required for methylation of hopanoids at the C-3 position in the obligate methanotroph Methylococcus capsulatus strain Bath. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the taxonomic distribution of HpnR extends beyond methanotrophic and acetic acid bacteria. Phenotypic analysis of the M. capsulatus hpnR deletion mutant demonstrated a potential physiological role for 3-methylhopanoids; they appear to be required for the maintenance of intracytoplasmic membranes and cell survival in late stationary phase. Therefore, 3-methylhopanoids may prove more useful as proxies for specific environmental conditions encountered during stationary phase rather than a particular bacterial group.

AB  - In order to assess the condition of heavy metal pollution in the Yellow River, Lanzhou section, China, and to quantify heavy metal (copper, lead, zinc, and cadmium) contents in tissues (liver, kidney, gills, and muscles) of two fish species (Triplophysa pappenheimi and Gobio hwanghensis), levels of these four metals in the water body, sediment, and tissues of the two fish were measured using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry. The metal levels from this study were compared with the threshold values in the guidelines of water, sediment, and food given by the National Environmental Protection Agency of China, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of America, and the National Standards Management Department of China. We found the mean concentrations of Cu, Pb, Zn, and Cd in THE water body, sediment, and muscles of two fish species were far below the values in guidelines. We also found that the type of metals present and their concentrations varied in different tissues and species. The results suggested that (1) Cu, Pb, Zn, and Cd did not contaminate the aquatic ecosystem severely and did not threaten the safety of human consumption in the Yellow River, Lanzhou section, and (2) organs that are sensitive to accumulating heavy metals may be useful to develop bioindicators for monitoring metal contamination. Considering environmental variables, further study is necessary before deciding which fish species or tissue could be the ideal bioindicators for aquatic pollution.

AB  - Fen peatlands are specific wetland ecosystems containing high soil organic carbon (SOC). There is a general lack of knowledge about the microbial communities that abound in these systems. We examined the microbial activity and community structure in two fen soils differing in SOC content sampled from the Ljubljana Marsh under different seasonal conditions. Substrate-induced respiration and dehydrogenase activity were used as indicators of total microbial activity. Both methods indicated higher microbial activities in the fen soil with the higher SOC content on all dates of sampling. To determine whether the differences in microbial activity were associated with differences in the microbial community structures, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of bacterial 16S rRNA genes was performed. Comparison of the T-RFLP profiles revealed very similar community structures in both fens and in the two seasonal extremes investigated. This suggested a stable community structure in the two fens, which is not affected by the SOC content or seasonal variation. In addition, a bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene based clone library was prepared from the fen soil with the higher SOC content. Out of 114 clones analysed, approximately 53% belonged to the Proteobacteria, 23% to the Acidobacteria, 21% to a variety of other taxa, and less than 3% were affiliated with the Firmicutes.

AB  - Drought is a creeping natural hazard commencing from lack of rainfall and generally associated with various climatic aspects. Drought-related water deficiency has severe consequences upon environmental processes and socioeconomic activities. In the past few decades, a number of drought indices have been developed for assessing the extent, onset, duration and intensity of drought. The Bundelkhand region located in the central part of India has been affected by recurrent drought events during the past few decades. This study seeks to examine hydrometeorological drought stress of that area using remote sensing and meteorological indicators, i.e., standardized precipitation index (SPI), hydrology-based rainfall anomaly index (RAI) and standardized water-level index (SWI). Daily rainfall data from Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) were integrated with station-based groundwater datasets (1998-2015) to analyze the hydrometeorological drought condition of the area. In addition, groundwater datasets were used to evaluate the long-term hydrological drought situation and compared with meteorological drought indices. The study reveals a good agreement among all hydrometeorological drought indices distinctly in few years (2002 and 2013). However, the findings were not coherent in all years due to high rate of runoff and poor groundwater recharge. In spite of having normal rainfall, the undulating terrains of this rugged land confine the infiltration process and cause hydrological drought stress in several parts of the area.

AB  - Coal is the most important energy in China, and sustainability of Chinese coal cities is critical to the socioeconomic development and energy security of the country. Identifying the characteristics and patterns of coal city sustainability is of great importance to promoting the sustainable development of coal cities. After constructing an Indicator System for Coal City Sustainability (ISCCS) and collecting data from 55 prefecture-level coal cities, we analyzed the patterns and characteristics of sustainability of Chinese coal cities by using a data mining method - decision tree modeling. Through comprehensive analysis of the models, we not only attained an overall understanding on the patterns and characteristics of sustainability of Chinese coal cities, but also discovered some novel, implicit, and previously unknown patterns and characteristics of sustainability: most mature coal cities present signs of resource curse, while declining coal cities present two obviously different development patterns: resource curse and resource blessing patterns; northeastern coal cities have relatively good sustainability, the environmental quality, especially air quality, of northern coal cities is bad, northwestern coal cities have rapid economic growth but undeveloped economy conditions and the fragile environmental carrying capacity is ignored. To promote the sustainability of Chinese coal cities, it is necessary to change the traditional conception of urban decay with mineral depletion, to make and implement effective plans of sustainable development for coal city from the early development stages, and to pay more attention to coal cities' regional characteristics and differences.

AB  - The methodological approach to the comprehensive assessment of the recreational territories resource potential which implies an integral index use that takes into account the system of indicators according to the following components: nature and resource, historical and cultural, social and economic and ecological ones, has been made on the basis of the analytical generalizations and identified problems in the recreational resources study. Applying the proposed methodological approach according to type and component principle will enable to identify regions with similar natural properties, social and economic state, infrasfructure support with the purpose of effective spatial planning of the recreational sphere development, as well as to determine the strategic directions of the recreational territories resource potential implementation. On the basis of the developed methodical approach, an assessment of the level of the recreational territories resource potential in Ukraine has been done. According to the calculations of the integral index, conducted in the regions of Ukraine, they have been grouped as to the following levels of the recreational territories resource potential: high, medium, low and very low. It is established that the Autonomous Republic of Crimea (final assessment 0.78) has the optimal conditions for the implementation of resource potential and the development of recreational territories among the regions of Ukraine. The potential is lower in Lviv (index - 0.61), Odesa (0.54) and Transcarpathian (0.51) regions. At the same time, most regions of Ukraine have a low level of the recreational territories resource potential compared to the best analogs in the country.

AB  - Biocontrol agents (BCA) effectively suppress soil-borne disease symptoms using natural antagonistic prokaryotes or eukaryotes. The main issue associated with the application of BCA is that disease reduction effects are unstable under different field conditions. In order to identify potentially effective BCA among several fields, we compared prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities in soil with and without tomato bacterial wilt from three different fields, each of which had the same field management and similar soil characteristics. Soil samples were collected from three fields and two depths because bacterial wilt pathogens were present in soil at a depth greater than 40 cm. We classified soil samples based on the presence or absence of the bacterial phcA gene, a key gene for bacterial wilt pathogenicity and tomato disease symptoms. Pyrosequencing of the prokaryotic 16S rRNA gene and eukaryotic internal transcribed spacer region sequences showed that the diversity and richness of the communities mostly did not correlate with disease symptoms. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic community structures were affected more by regional differences than the appearance of disease. Several prokaryotes and eukaryotes were more abundant in soil that lacked disease symptoms, and eight prokaryotes and one eukaryote of this group were commonly detected among the three fields. Some of these taxa were not previously found in disease-suppressive soil. Our results suggest that several prokaryotes and eukaryotes control plant disease symptoms.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine whether infrared thermography is a useful tool for the recognition of dairy cows in a state of thermal heat stress, as well as to identify the best region of the animal to be evaluated for this recognition. Physiological variables, including rectal temperature, respiratory frequency, cardiac frequency, and panting score were recorded in 38 lactating cows. For the assessment of environmental parameters, a digital black globe thermometer (TGD-200 model) was used. Thermographic photographs of different regions of the body of cows were taken using an infrared camera (FLIR (R) System T300) and indicated respective superficial temperature. Physiological variables and superficial body temperature in different regions varied between genetic groups (Girolando: 1/2 Holstein x 1/2 Gir and 1/2 Holstein x 1/4 Gir; purebred Holstein). The environmental temperature ranged from 20.7 to 37.9 degrees C with a relative humidity reaching 95%. The mean rectal temperature (40.84 degrees C), respiratory frequency (111.36 breaths/min), and cardiac frequency (99.22 beats/min) were higher for pure Holstein than for Girolando cows. Positive correlations were found between the physiological parameters and thermographic measures. The highest positive correlation (0.74) was found between the temperature in the lateral region of the udder and rectal temperature. Thermography is a good indicator of thermal comfort. The best region to identify heat stress in cows using thermography is the lateral region of the udder.

AB  - The development of genetically engineered plants that employ RNA interference (RNAi) to suppress invertebrate pests opens up new avenues for insect control. While this biotechnology shows tremendous promise, the potential for both non target and off-target impacts, which likely manifest via altered mRNA expression in the exposed organisms, remains a major concern. One powerful tool for the analysis of these un-intended effects is reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, a technique for quantifying gene expression using a suite of reference genes for normalization. The seven-spotted ladybeetle Coccinella septempunctata, a commonly used predator in both classical and augmentative biological controls, is a model surrogate species used in the environmental risk assessment (ERA) of plant incorporated protectants (PIPs). Here, we assessed the suitability of eight reference gene candidates for the normalization and analysis of C. septempunctata v-ATPase A gene expression under both biotic and abiotic conditions. Five computational tools with distinct algorisms, geNorm, Norrnfinder, BestKeeper, the Delta C-t method, and RefFinder, were used to evaluate the stability of these candidates. As a result, unique sets of reference genes were recommended, respectively, for experiments involving different developmental stages, tissues, and ingested dsRNAs. By providing a foundation for standardized RT-qPCR analysis in C. septempunctata, our work improves the accuracy and replicability of the ERA of PIPs involving RNAi transgenic plants.

AB  - Indicator models of sexual selection predict that females mating with the most ornamented males should produce offspring with enhanced expression of fitness-related traits, such as overall vigor and viability. Empirical support for this prediction, however, is limited. We quantified the effects of a heritable and condition-dependent secondary sexual trait on offspring performance traits in Drosophila bipectinata Duda (Diptera: Drosophilidae). Forty-eight genetic (isofemale) lines were extracted from a natural population, reared in a common environment, and characterized in terms of sex comb size. We measured pupal viability and adult mating success among the progeny of the 5 lines with the largest combs (high line category) and the 5 lines with the smallest combs (low line category). The high line category produced offspring that were significantly more viable than the low line category, and this advantage held across 2 developmental temperatures. In contrast, there was no effect of line category on male mating success, although at the individual-level, comb size was significantly positively correlated with mating success. Our results indicate that the relative size of the D. bipectinata sex comb taps genotypic properties that enhance offspring fitness in a trait-specific manner. Thus, distinct proximate mechanisms likely underlie relationships between secondary sexual trait expression and different performance traits in offspring, offering a possible explanation for inconsistent support for the existence of indirect benefits in sexual selection.

AB  - The complex nature of plant resistance to adverse environmental conditions, such as salinity and drought requires a better understanding of the stress-induced changes that may be involved in tolerance mechanisms. Here we investigate stress-related morpho-physiological effects during vegetative and reproductive growth in two Japonica rice cultivars (Bomba and Bahia) exposed to a range of NaCl concentrations from the seedling stage. The stress-related detrimental effects were observed either earlier or to a higher extent in cv. Bomba than in Bahia. Damages to the photosynthetic apparatus were related to loss of chlorophyll (Chl) and to a decrease of the maximum potential efficiency of PSII (F-v/F-m), affecting negatively net CO2 assimilation rate (P-N). Stress-related leaf anatomical alterations were analysed during the vegetative and reproductive stages. The size of bulliform cells as well as dimensions related to the vascular system increased under mild stress but decreased in the longer term or under higher stress level. The pattern of the anatomical alterations observed at the reproductive stage under 20 mM NaCl was reflected in poor panicle development and yield loss, with effects more pronounced in cv. Bomba than in Bahia. In summary, our results show that some physiological and, particularly, leaf anatomical responses induced by NaCl stress are distinctive indicators of sensitivity to salt stress in rice cultivars.

AB  - Aims: Routine procedures for monitoring viruses in water samples have not been drawn up for the water-microbiology screening panel. Enteric viruses, including astroviruses, are able to persist under environmental conditions and may cause public health problems by contaminating natural and drinking water resources. The aim of this study was to detect human astroviruses (HAstVs) from raw wastewater samples.
   Methods and Results: To obtain data on whether human astroviruses are shed in the environment, 35 raw sewage samples from 22 sewage plants in different regions of Baranya County, Hungary were tested for astrovirus using a polyethylene glycol method for concentration and a guanidinium thiocyanate-silica procedure for extraction of viral RNA. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with HAstV-specific primer pairs was used for amplification and the specificity of amplicons was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Among the 35 raw sewage samples, 15 (43%) contained HAstV and by sequence analysis, 10 genotype HAstV-1 and one genotype HAstV-2 were identified.
   Conclusions: The high detection rate of astroviruses we encountered in this study provide convincing evidence that HAstVs circulate at a relatively high frequency in the Hungarian population. No correlation between the standard indicators of faecal pollution and the presence of HAstVs was found.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: Our study is the first report on detection of HAstV in sewage in Hungary and suggests that HAstV might be potent indicators of viral pollution in environmental specimens.

AB  - A field study was conducted to evaluate the protozoan colonization patterns on artificial substrates in relation to organic pollution within a tropical harbour. The composition of protozoans and their succession rates on artificial substrates( polyurethane foam units) were compared between two field stations(A and B), and their presence were considered with regards to the prevailing water quality wnditions at the study sites. Altogether 44 genera of flagellates and ciliates were documented. The common genera of flagellates encountered included Monas, Polytoma, and Chromalina. Among the ciliates, the predominant genera were Tetrahymena, Vorticella, Lagynophyra, and Heloiphyra. These groups exhibited characteristic successional patterns in relation to ambient water quality. At Station A, located close to the sewage outfall, the water quality parameters included poor Secchi-disc transparency(0.48m), dissolved oxygen of 1.93 mg/ml; salinity of 18 psu, and temperature 31.3 degreesC: Here, the nanoflagellates (spumella) colonized first, followed by microcilliate(Tetrahymena,) and sessile form(Vorticella). Station B, located on the seaward side, was characterized by relatively less-stressed environmental conditions with transparency 1.85m and dissolved oxygen value of 6.04 mg/ml. Salinity of 27.27 psu, and mean temperature of 30 degreesC were recorded at "B". At this,station, the nanoflagellate Polytoma was first documented to colonize on the substrates, followed by microcilliate(Lagynophrya) and suctorid(Heliophyra). These findings support the use of protozoans as indicator species for evaluating the hazards posed by organic pollution to natural estuarine communities.

AB  - This review considers the potential for DNA strand breaks, particularly as measured by the comet assay, to act as a biomarker of genetic toxicity in fish and other aquatic species. The background need for such biomarkers is introduced in relation to carcinogenicity, reproductive effects and other adverse effects of pollution. Sensitive measurements of DNA strand breakage can be achieved, e.g., by alkaline elution, alkaline unwinding or by single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) techniques. The DNA damage can be a reflection, not only of direct strand breakage, but also of alkali-labile sites and of repair enzyme-mediated breakage (i.e., is non-specific). A range of genotoxic chemicals (both with and without the requirement for metabolic activation) give positive effects in various eel; types of vertebrate and invertebrate aquatic species, following in vitro and in vivo exposures under laboratory conditions. A limited number of analyses of organisms exposed to polluted waters or sediments in the field have implicated DNA strand breakage as a relatively sensitive, rapid and broad specificity indicator of genotoxic pollutant exposure. The comet assay deserves f'urther exploitation to assess inter-individual and inter-cell variability in response to pollutants and naturally occurring genotoxic stimuli, and to assess the persistence of these effects.

AB  - The percentage contribution of heart rate (f(H)) to change in oxygen consumption (Vo(2)) was examined in relation to body weight and across the metabolic scope of pike. Also the consequences of variability around the regression relating Vo(2) and f(H) for estimating Vo(2) were considered. The percentage contribution of f(H) was calculated using two equations, one that ignored and one that included an estimate for oxygen consumed by the gills and absorbed across the skin (Vo(2s)). Using both equations the percentage contribution of f(H) calculated using maximum and resting values for f(H) and Vo(2) decreased with weight of pike. The omission of Vo(2s)-resulted in erroneously high estimates of the percentage contribution of f(H) for pike of any given weight. The omission of Vo(2s) resulted in erroneously high estimates of the percentage contribution of f(H) over the region of the metabolic scope where f(H) is related linearly to Vo(2), whereas the equation that included Vo(2s), resulted in the expected value of 100%. Assuming zero experimental error and under normoxic conditions, the 95% confidence limits for single estimates of Vo(2) from 30-60-min readings of heart rate are +/-39% at a heart rate of 30 beats min(-1). Averaged over longer periods the error decreases, and used over several days to estimate meal size the error is of the order of 1%.

AB  - Concentrations of faecal coliforms and Escherichia coli in environmental waters have historically been used to establish recreational water quality standards. When these bacteria are used as indices of water quality, it is assumed that there are no significant environmental sources of these bacteria which are unrelated to direct faecal contamination. However, we have previously reported that in tropical island environments such as in Hawaii, these faecal indicators are consistently found at high concentrations in all streams and the source of these faecal bacteria is the soil. To become so well established in soil we hypothesized that these faecal bacteria must have the ability to multiply in the natural soil environment at ambient temperature (23-25 degrees C). Three lines of evidence support this hypothesis: (1) E. coli was shown to grow on 10% soil extract agar, (2) populations of faecal coliforms and E, coli from sewage were shown to immediately increase by about three logs when simple nutrients (glucose and salts) were added to natural soil and (3) faecal coliforms and E. coli increased by two logs within 24 h when a minimal amount of sewage was added to cobalt-irradiated soil. These results indicate that tropical soil environments provide sufficient means to support the growth of faecal coliforms and E. coli. However, under natural soil conditions, indigenous soil microorganisms are much more efficient in obtaining nutrients and we hypothesize that faecal bacteria grow sporadically in response to available nutrients.

AB  - The N-15 natural abundance method was used to assess the intermittent occurrence of denitrification in the Kiryu watershed in Shiga Prefecture, Japan. The concentration and isotopic composition (delta(15)N) of NO3--N, as well as some physical and chemical variables that potentially affect denitrification, were measured along the flow path from precipitation to stream water via soil solution and groundwater. High maximum groundwater level promoted a decrease in NO3--N concentration that was associated with an increase in the delta(15)N of NO3--N with soil depth; i.e., denitrification occurred in the soil due to increasing soil moisture. While the maximum level of groundwater fell, no such changes were observed. Dissolved oxygen (DO) and Mn2+ concentrations in soil solutions indicated that strong anaerobic condition did not occur during the study period. These results suggested that denitrification was occurring temporarily in anaerobic microsites such as waterlogged soil aggregates. Upward expansion of groundwater zone thus appeared to play an important role in promoting such microanaerobic sites, resulting in the intermittent occurrence of denitrification. Based on these data, a schematic model for assessing denitrification was proposed based on a NO3--N/Cl- - delta(15)N of NO3--N map for soil-water systems. Our data showed that variations of NO3--N concentration and delta(15)N value are useful indicators for elucidating nitrogen dynamics as affected by water mixing, plant uptake, nitrification, and denitrification in forested ecosystems.

AB  - Lithopone pigments are an important group of white inorganic pigments, with production exceeding 240,000 tons/year in China. Nevertheless, our understanding of its environmental behavior is still limited. In this work, we reported the fast and extensive release of Zn2+ from the commercial lithopone pigment under solar exposure. The lithopone pigment released 40.97% of its total Zn within 24-h simulated sunlight exposure, generating a significant amount of nanoparticles. The commercial lithopone pigment had bandgap energy of 3.63 eV. It can be excited within the solar spectrum (wavelength <342 nm). As suggested by the photocurrent and surface photovoltage results, the pigment generated electrons and holes with good separation and transfer efficiency upon solar irradiation. The pigment also produced hydroxyl radical and superoxide by the oxidation of surface-bound OH- and H2O by the holes and direct transfer of the electrons to oxygen molecules. The photogenerated holes can oxidize the pigment, leading to its photo-dissolution and consequently the release of Zn2+. The water chemistry, including pH, coexisting anions, and organic carbons, influenced the photo-dissolution kinetics of the pigment by changing the valence band edge, forming stable precipitates, competing for the holes, and screening effect. The release of Zn2+ from the commercial lithopone pigment was fast and extensive under natural conditions, with 35.16% Zn released within 6-h solar exposure. Our results highlighted the crucial role of photochemistry in the environmental risk assessments and regulations of commercial lithopone pigments.

AB  - The search for environmental descriptors of fish stock production is ongoing. Al-though numerous correlations between environmental variables such as food abundance or sea surface temperature have been proposed in the past, few are operational in a fisheries management context today. Reasons for this may include many-but spurious-correlations, the use of higher-level climate-change indicators, and misconceived perception of causal relationships. In the present study, we demonstrate how modelled oceanographic data describing local conditions, combined with a simple probabilistic risk assessment, can be used to forecast fish recruitment. We used the lesser sandeel Ammodytes marinus in the North Sea as an example, and focussed on the circulation patterns experienced by the first-feeding larvae on the Dogger Bank. A strong link between the net direction of water transport at the surface and unusually strong year-classes of sandeel was found. For example, the most extreme recruitments only took place in years with a particular type of flow regime in February, which may be associated with the occasional reversals of the North Sea circulation. Using risk ratios, we show the potential for using flow regime in probabilistic short-term forecasts of unusually strong year-classes. Lastly, we propose a hypothesis for recruitment in sandeel which could be extended to other species, and thereby contribute to future studies of predictors in recruitment forecasting.

AB  - Waste from the global paper life cycle can be a lost economic opportunity and a risk to the natural environment and human health. This study assesses the recovery potential of major waste flows in the global paper life cycle to support improvements in material use. The "recovery potential" indicator shows the technical possibility for extracting value from waste through recycling and other forms of recovery. The potential is identified through a review of recovery technologies that are currently applied or likely to be commercially available by the year 2050, The analysis compares current material use in the global paper life cycle with an ideal scenario in which the recovery potential of all major waste flows is fulfilled. In the ideal scenario, the Recycled Input Ratio (RIR) is increased from 38% to 67%-73% and the landfill intensity is reduced from 331-473 kg/t paper to 0-2.6 kg/t paper. The reduction in required landfill space is achieved mainly through increased consumer waste recycling. Better management of industrial waste from the paper sector has a rather limited impact on the RIR and landfill intensity, The conditions for successful recovery of waste are discussed separately. The analysis shows that the recovery potential indicator can be usefully applied to estimate potential improvements in complex material systems and the findings may inform policies for resource efficiency and the circular economy.

AB  - Today, different tools are associated with environmental protection context, which ca include, among others: environmental programmes, objectives and targets, training, incentive schemes, audit frequency, site inspections, administration and community relations. The assessment of different aspects of environmental quality and protection, in a qualitative or quantitative manner is based on various indicators, addressing the three components of sustainability: economic, social, environmental.
   The main objective of our article is the establishment and analysis of specific categories of environmental performance indicators. These indicators are able to provide a scientific basis for decision making in environmental management. This paper presents and make a short analysis of the main environmental performance indicators as they are perceived and developed by our research group. Although cost-effective, these indicators are tailored so as to fit well with the size and type of the assessed organization, and according to its prerequisites and priorities. Besides, having in mind that any organization should use in an optimal way the environmental information it collects, our article presents the main performance indicators we consider opportune in decision making process, like: comparability, balance between problematic ( bad) and prospective ( good) areas, continuity, timeliness. Based on these measuring tools, the management of any interested organization can make the most appropriate decision relative to its environmental performance. More than that, it will be able to provide accurate information to stakeholders. The set of diagnostic indicators ensure the necessary conditions to obtain real data regarding the ecological status

AB  - Scientific fisheries surveys routinely identify a large diversity of commercial and non-commercial benthic megainvertebrates that could provide useful information for Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) descriptors. Species is obviously the basic taxonomic level to which most ecological studies and theories refer. Identification at this level of organization is indeed always preferred over any other taxonomic level. Nevertheless, aggregation of species to higher taxonomic levels may be unavoidable sometimes, since errors of identification are known or suspected to occur in many surveys. Using analyses of taxonomic sufficiency (identification of organisms at various taxonomic resolutions) and groups of morphospecies (taxa identified easily by non-experts on the basis of evident morphological traits), this study aims to quantify the loss of ecological information incurred by partial identification of benthic megafauna in bottom trawl surveys in order to put such data to good use. The analyses were conducted on five scientific surveys representing a large range of geographical areas (from 150 km(2) to 150 000 km(2)) and environmental conditions. Results show that genus, family and, particularly, morphospecies are good surrogates for species identification in community analyses. We suggest that bottom trawl surveys can provide reliable megafauna data that may usefully complete those obtained by grab surveys. The use of morphospecies could lead to new strategies, combining different datasets to provide indicators for MSFD descriptors (e.g. D6). (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The assessment of aquatic ecosystems requires information on biological and disturbance gradients in order to evaluate quality. As a result decision makers need improved monitoring tools for characterizing relationships between invasive species infestation and disturbance to make informed choices regarding wetland condition and management plans. The overarching goal of this research was to assess invasive plant infestation and disturbance gradients using a GIScience approach. The study was conducted in a fresh-water, coastal wetland in the Muskegon River watershed, Michigan, USA. Airborne hyperspectral imagery (20 bands, 440-880 nm) was classified for Phragmites australis distribution using the Spectral Angle Mapper algorithm. Indicator semivariograms were utilized to define landscape structure and associated spatial scales, and assist in creating a transect scheme to generate landscape pattern metrics quantifying valued ecosystem attributes. Hydrological modifications, as measured by an area-weighted fractal dimension index, served as a proxy for human disturbance and was found to moderately influence Phragmites percent cover (R (2) = 0.4, n = 40), mean patch size (R (2) = 0.5), and patch shape (R (2) = 0.5). A general conclusion was that increased hydrological disturbances were correlated with increased infestation magnitude. The systematic approach executed in this study outlined how geospatial monitoring tools can be used as an assessment framework to provide more meaningful information that lends itself to comprehensive wetlands assessment.

AB  - Given the urgent need for ecologically relevant toxicity tools specific to estuarine systems, the main goal of the present study was to develop and evaluate the potential of an in situ algal assay for estuarine sediment-overlying water toxicity evaluations using the microalga Phaeodactylum tricornutum immobilized in alginate beads. With its simple and cost-effective design, the assay apparatus, coupled with the use of microalgae immobilized in alginate beads, allowed rapid and easy deployment as well as retrieval of assay chambers. The effectiveness of the proposed in situ assay was investigated by deploying it at two reference and six contaminated Portuguese estuaries. By deploying open chambers both with and without an artificial nutrient source and closed chambers with an artificial seawater medium, it was possible to discriminate toxic effects from those caused by differences in temperature, light, and nutrient conditions across sites. A reduction in algal growth was found at contaminated sites relative to reference sites. The strontium alginate beads used for microalgae immobilization were found to be appropriate to perform in situ assays, showing no signs of disruption or dissolution after up to 8 d of exposure in estuarine sediment-overlying waters. The proposed in situ assay was shown to be a useful tool for estuarine sediment-overlying water toxicity testing to provide relevant data concerning primary production to estuarine ecological risk assessment studies.

AB  - Dentaria enneaphyllos L. is a characteristic herb of species-rich temperate forests of Central Europe. Because the mountain forest ecosystems in the North of the Czech Republic were profoundly changed during the last decades, decline of this sensitive species was expected. Historical (before 1980) and recent distribution and habitat types of Dentaria enneaphyllos in Rychlebske hory Mts, a typical Central-European mountainous area are compared. Ecological preferences of the species within the Czech Republic are viewed using information from main phytosociological overviews, and calibrating ELLENBERG indicator values for 646 phytosociological releves with Dentaria enneaphyllos from the years 1930-2000. Historical distribution in Rychlebske hory Mts covered a greater part of the study area, with common bedrocks as granites and gneiss. Recent populations occur almost exclusively in the southernmost part, which is marked by a specific bedrock, phyllite and crystalline limestone. Recent localities are leeward valleys and foothills, whereas historical localities often were wind-exposed slopes. Ecological preferences within the Czech Republic did not change during 1930-2000; the species is quite strictly confined to specific conditions. Interestingly, ELLENBERG's indicator values for the species Dentraria enneaphyllos differ from the calibrated values for releves in five of six parameters. The probable cause of the species retreat in Rychlebske hory Mts is soil acidification and nutrient leaching induced with acid industrial deposits. The only acceptable habitats remained the sites with both accumulation of nutrients (along water courses) and capacity to buffer the acid deposits (calcareous bedrock).

AB  - Attractive landscapes are diverse and resilient landscapes that provide a multitude of essential ecosystem services. The development of landscape policy to protect and improve landscape attractiveness, thereby ensuring the provision of ecosystem services, is ideally adapted to region specific landscape characteristics. In addition, trends in landscape attractiveness may be linked to certain policies, or the absence of policies over time. A spatial and temporal evaluation of landscape attractiveness is thus desirable for landscape policy development. In this paper, landscape attractiveness was spatially evaluated for Flanders (Belgium) using landscape indicators derived from geospatial data as a case study. Large local differences in landscape quality in (i) rural versus urban areas and (ii) between the seven agricultural regions in Flanders were found. This observed spatial variability in landscape attractiveness demonstrated that a localized approach, considering the geophysical characteristics of each individual region, would be required in the development of landscape policy to improve landscape quality in Flanders. Some trends in landscape attractiveness were related to agriculture in Flanders, e.g., a slight decrease in total agricultural area, decrease in dominance of grassland, maize and cereals, a decrease in crop diversity, sharp increase in the adoption of agri-environmental agreements (AEA) and a decrease in bare soil conditions in winter. The observed trends and spatial variation in landscape attractiveness can be used as a tool to support policy analysis, assess the potential effects of future policy plans, identify policy gaps and evaluate past landscape policy.

AB  - Eutrophication is a prominent component of global environmental change in aquatic ecosystems and usually triggers the aggressive growth of free-floating aquatic plants. An overload of nutrients, including nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), causes eutrophication. However, the effects of water nutrient stoichiometry on aquatic plants under eutrophic conditions have been understudied. The present study subjected Salvinia natans (L.) All., a free-floating fern, to shifted water nutrient stoichiometric regimes, and indicators for plant growth, including biomass accumulation and relative growth rate, and resource use functional traits, including specific leaf area, leaf area ratio, specific length of root-like leaves, specific area of root-like leaves, chlorophyll content and maximal fluorescence, were evaluated. We found that water nutrient stoichiometry affected plant growth traits rather than functional traits. In particular, P eutrophication profoundly facilitated the growth of S. natans. Therefore, P rather than N appeared to determine the growth of S. natans. However, the functional traits were unresponsive to the shift in the water nutrient stoichiometric regime. A decoupling between plant growth and functional traits in response to water nutrient stoichiometric change existed for S. natans generally. Since S. natans infests rice paddy agriculture in southern China, the regulation of P addition, for instance, curtailing the use of P-enriched pesticides and fertilizers in agriculture, may benefit the control of this nuisance species.

AB  - The purpose of this study is providing an appropriate and basic solution to prevent the mixing of hospital plastic waste, to collect the suspended and floating waste from marine environments, and to manage the floating solid waste. The method used in this research consists of four sections: library studies, field visits, and the collection and aggregation of data and information. Then, based on the existing problems, the design and construction of a safe device for infectious hospital waste was performed by vertical cutting of waste and chemical and mechanical combination of closed reactor. Different samples were selected and used to determine the appropriate composition from different compounds of sodium hydroxide with lime and sodium carbonate with lime. Also, the indicator used in microbial tests was Bacilius subtilis. The results of this study showed that the safe vertical cutting machine for infectious waste is chemically and mechanically effective according to the results of tests performed on the elimination of 98% of bacterial, fungal and infections. The rate of neutralization of bacterial contamination of total and focal coliforms and pathogens of Bacillus subtilis Salmonella and Shigella using the ratio of 30% was related to the chemical compounds of lime and sodium hydroxide, lime and sodium carbonate, respectively. Temperature, humidity and pH played an important role in the composition and effect of chemicals on shredded infectious waste. Therefore, in the designed device, the best conditions of temperature, humidity and pH were determined equal to 15 degrees Celsius, 45% and 12.5, respectively.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate microphytoplankton dynamics and environmental parameters in the estuary of the Curupere River, located in an Amazonian mangrove ecosystem. Ten sampling sites, where occupied to obtain surface water samples for qualitative and quantitative microphytoplankton analyses, chlorophyll-a, temperature, turbidity, salinity, and pH. Samplings were conducted in four months: in February, May, August and November/2015; the first two months corresponding to rainy season and the last two to dry season. Significant spatiotemporal differences were observed, for diversity, equitability and specific dominance of the microphytoplankton community. In total, 212 taxa were identified and this community was dominated by Bacillariophyta (149 taxa), followed by Myzozoa (29 taxa). The abundance varied from 7,700 ind L-1, (May, sampling site 1) to 343,800 ind L-1, in August (sampling site 4). The diatom Cymatosira belgica was the dominant species, followed by Dimeregramma minor (major peaks of 180,600 ind L-1 and 120,400 ind L-1, respectively) in August at point 4. Phytoplankton biomass indicates an eutrophic estuary as Chlorophyll-a varied from 13.01 to 112.88 mg m(3), probably due to marine shrimp farm effluents. It was possible to identify species strongly indicative of the environment, through analysis of indicator species (IndVal), and their relations with the main environmental conditions (pH, salinity and rainfall), determined by canonical redundancy analysis (RDA).

AB  - Fluvial terraces are considered key relief markers to understand environmental changes in the nature time scale, acting as paleo-indicators of morphogenetic processes occurred during the Quaternary, especially the Holocene. The absolute dating method through Luminescence has been considered very effective for obtaining the ages of the material constituting fluvial terraces, once it can be applied to several materials, in different environmental conditions and through different techniques. Therefore, the aim of this study is to provide information on the evolution of the relief during the Quaternary, analyzing the sector of the Peripheral Depression, countryside of Sao Paulo state. For this, the geochronological evolution of the fluvial terraces of Passa Cinco River Upper Basin, located in the municipalities of Ipeuna and Itirapina, was interpreted through the analysis of Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) data, granulometry of the material composing the deposits, and comparison with academic studies which performed dating methods in the fluvial terraces of Parana Sedimentary Basin. The ages of 6 fluvial terrace samples were obtained, these results allowed the proposal of a geochronological sequence of 4 phases for Passa Cinco River Upper Basin: 1) between 37,700 and 32,250 years B.P.; 2) between 3,000 and 2,000 years B.P.; 3) 1,470 years B.P; and 4) 600 years B.P. Considering the proposal of other authors for the region, it was evaluated that part of these phases were developed in drier climates than the current, demonstrating the quaternary dynamics of evolution of the basin.

AB  - Global warming is emerging as one of the most critical threats to terrestrial and marine species worldwide. This study assessed the effects of simulated warming events in culture on two seagrass species, Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa, which play a key role in coastal ecosystems of the Mediterranean Sea. Changes in fatty acids as key metabolic indicators were assessed in specimens from two geographical populations of each species adapted to different in situ temperature regimes. Total fatty acid (TFA) content and composition were compared in C. nodosa and P. oceanica from natural populations and following exposure to heat stress in culture. After heat exposure, individuals of C. nodosa and P. oceanica adapted to colder temperatures in situ accumulated significantly more TFA than controls. For both species, the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) decreased, and the percentage of saturated fatty acids (SFA) increased significantly after the heat treatment. These results highlight that populations of both species living at warmest temperatures in situ were more thermo-tolerant and exhibited a greater capacity to cope with heat stress by readjusting their lipid composition faster. Finally, exposure of seagrasses to wanner conditions may induce a decrease in PUFA/SFA ratio which could negatively affect their nutritional value and generate important consequences in the healthy state of next trophic levels.

AB  - Understanding aggregation dynamics of forage species is important for evaluating biophysical scaling in marine ecosystems and heterogeneity of trophic interactions. In particular, zooplankton aggregations are fundamental units of many pelagic systems, but are difficult to observe continuously through space and time. Using an established modeling framework that encompasses a coupled regional oceanographic and individual-based modeling system, we test the hypothesis that persistence (duration) of krill aggregations is dependent on their size, intensity, and location of formation within the coastal upwelling region of the California Current. In support of this hypothesis, we found that aggregation size is positively related to intensity, whereas persistence has a parabolic response to aggregation size and intensity, indicating the likelihood that large and highly persistent aggregations are rare. Persistence of krill aggregations also depends on formation location within coastal upwelling areas. We found that krill aggregations were more likely to form near a major seabird colony and that some coastal upwelling areas act as sources of aggregations for other areas. Observations of seabird aggregations were used to evaluate the potential structural realism of predicted krill aggregations. Seabird aggregations displayed marked coherence with predicted krill aggregations in space, providing important criteria on the scaling and availability of krill aggregations to breeding and migratory species. Predicting scales of krill aggregation dynamics will benefit ecosystem assessments, and numerical modeling of predator foraging and marine spatial management aimed at ensuring protection of ecologically important areas.

AB  - In the present study, the toxic effect of decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209), an important brominated fire retardant, on soil was evaluated by amending with different concentrations (0 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 500 mg/kg dry wt) for 40 d. The activities of 3 soil enzymes (urease, catalase, and alkaline phosphatase) were measured as the principal assessment endpoints. Meanwhile, the effects of natural environmental factors, such as light conditions and soil biota, on BDE-209 intoxication were studied. For the latter, 30 earthworms (Metaphire guillelmi) with fully matured clitella or ryegrass (Lolium perenne) with fully matured leaves were exposed in soil amended with BDE-209. The activities of the soil enzymes were adversely affected by BDE-209, especially for the high-concentration treatments, with greater adverse effects in the dark than in the light. The presence of earthworms reduced toxicity to BDE-209, whereas ryegrass did not. The calculated integrated biomarker response index, which provides a general indicator of the health status of test species by combining different biomarker signals, further validated these findings. Moreover, the antioxidant status (oxidant-antioxidant balance) of these 2 biota was assessed. Results indicated that BDE-209 significantly affected the activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase and catalase) and enhanced the levels of malondialdehyde in both species. The present study may facilitate a better understanding of the toxicity of BDE-209 toward the soil environment. (C) 2015 SETAC

AB  - Prolonged droughts severely affect the economic, social, and environmental sectors in Mexico. The interest in reducing the costs of drought is now focused on prevention by means of vulnerability reduction. The present study proposes a methodology to estimate vulnerability and risk to drought, considering the physical, economical, and social factors that make regions of Mexico prone to experiencing hydrological and agricultural droughts. Recognizing that there is no universally accepted way to describe vulnerability, the proposed method defines the object under study, the natural hazard, and vulnerability factors by means of indicators. The vulnerability factors are related to water infrastructure, the condition of aquifers or water reservoirs, the levels of wastewater treatment, water productivity in agriculture, hydraulic infrastructure, and water tariffs. A drought vulnerability model for each Hydrological Administrative Region ( RHA) in Mexico is obtained by combining the vulnerability indicators. The product of vulnerability and hazard results in risk estimates that are compared with impact data to validate the approach. Information on agricultural or hydrological drought is used as impact data. The validation process is an important step in the methodology, since it allows examination of the causes of disasters by the vulnerability factors and leads to risk management strategies. It is found that although vulnerability to meteorological drought in the agricultural and hydrological sectors in Mexico has decreased in recent years, the drought risk is still high and results in severe economic losses, such as those registered in central and northern Mexico during the 2011-12 prolonged drought.

AB  - The tree bark is a valuable component to diagnose heavy metal air pollution. In bark of P. laevigata and S. molle presence of eleven heavy metals was evaluated, as indicator of environmental impact in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. Based on the presence of both species on a soil system fragmented agricultural uses, rural settlements, trade and services, urban settlements and mineral uses, bark samples were taken during summer, autumn, winter and spring seasons. In each species thirty exemplars were sampled. Concentrations of Al, As, Co, Cu, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, Ti, V and Zn were determined by applying the ICP-MS technique, and for data analysis the General lineal model was applied. Results indicated that the average concentrations vary according to Ni>Al>Zn>Pb >Cu>As>Ti>V>Cd> Cr>Co. The presence of heavy metals was determined by the species effect, land use and season, and the relationship between these factors. The pepper tree bark was found to have higher concentrations of Al, As, Co, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb and Ti. The highest concentrations of Al, Cu, Cr, Co and Ni were in the fall season. The urban settlement showed higher concentrations of Al, Co, Cr, Ni, Ti and V; meanwhile in the mining soil use Cu, Cd, Zn and Pb were relevant. The potential bio-indicator value of bark of both species was evidenced. Consequently, it is convenient to continue with these studies to increase knowledge of the environmental conditions of the San Luis Potosi.

AB  - Construction of potential natural vegetation (PNV) poses particular challenges in landscapes heavily altered by human activity and must be based on transparent, repeatable methods. We integrated the concept of ancient forest (AF) and ancient forest species (AFS) into a four-step procedure of PNV mapping: 1) classification of forest vegetation relev,s; 2) selection of those vegetation types that can serve as PNV units, based on AF and AFS; 3) merging of selected vegetation types into five PNV units that can be predicted from a digital morphogenetic soil map; 4) mapping of three additional PNV units based on additional environmental data. The second step, concerning the selection of reference forest vegetation, is of particular interest for PNV construction in Flanders (northern Belgium), where forest cover has been subject to temporal disruption and spatial fragmentation. Among the variety of extant forest recovery states, we chose as PNV units those vegetation types for which a high proportion of relev,s had been located in AF and that contained many AFS. As the frequency of AFS depends on site conditions, we only compared and selected vegetation types that are found on similar sites according to average Ellenberg indicator values. While succession is irrelevant for the definition of PNV, colonization rates of AFS can be used to estimate the time required for PNV to be restored in a site.

AB  - In the present context of global warming and increasing long-range transport of oil and goods by sea potentially resulting in oil spills, more knowledge on the toxicological interactions between temperature and oil components on marine organisms is urgently needed. Therefore, the effects of temperature increase on the toxicity of three polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH; anthracene, phenanthrene and naphthalene) to the marine planktonic algae Tetraselmis chuii were investigated under laboratory conditions. T. chuii cultures were exposed for 96 h to different concentrations of each of the test substances at both 20 and 25 degrees C. Effect criterion was the inhibition of culture growth assessed at 24 h intervals. All the PAHs significantly reduced T. chuii growth after 96 h of exposure with 20% inhibition concentrations between 0.052 and 1.124 mg L-1 at 20 degrees C, and between 0.048 and 0.831 mg L-1 at 25 degrees C. At both temperatures, the ranking, in order of decreasing toxicity based on the 50% inhibition concentration, was phenanthrene> naphthalene> anthracene. The increase of temperature by 5 degrees C significantly increased the toxicity of all the PAHs tested. These findings highlight the importance of considering temperature variation in the ecological risk assessment of oil and other chemical spills in the marine environment, and the need of more research on the toxic effects of multiple stressors on marine organisms.

AB  - To study the sustainability of arable agricultural systems we examined a wide range of biological, physical and chemical properties associated with changes in soil quality. We integrated these using a qualitative multi-attribute model supported by the software tool DEXi to achieve a holistic estimation of soil quality. We tested the relative changes in soil quality attributes resulting from the incorporation of cattle slurry or green-waste compost, or from including a ley phase in the production of arable crops. We measured: abundances and biodiversity of the soil biota, physical properties and nutrient concentrations: twice in 2006 and thrice in 2007. These data were used to generate a model of soil quality, which showed that the addition of organic matter or a ley phase did increase soil quality. However, to fully understand the soil system results should be derived from a number of functionally related observations as there were opposing trends in individual observations. Increases in some beneficial attributes (such as decomposition, soil nutrient status and physical condition) were associated with an increased risk of nutrient losses from leaching and gaseous emissions. Assessing soil quality with only a few indicators may not identify these trade-offs. The multi-attribute modelling approach could identify the pathways responsible for changes in soil quality and identify possible environmentally detrimental effects. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Many herbaceous forest plant species are endangered and suffer from habitat loss and fragmentation, especially in agricultural landscapes. Hedgerow networks represent a forested habitat that may serve as a refuge for forest herbs, even though also hedges have recently been strongly reduced in number and size. It is yet disputed to which extent hedgerows offer a suitable environment for forest herbs and which environmental factors may affect the frequency of these species in hedgerows. To develop an effective conservation strategy for forest herbs in hedgerows on a larger spatial scale, we aimed to combine a set of ecological and life history traits for predicting the frequency of these species in a local data set. A literature data set was used to examine the regional differences in the species composition of forest herbs and environmental conditions in hedgerows along a climate gradient across north-western Europe. Contrary to our expectations, the chosen set of variables in combination had a lower ability of predicting the local frequency of forest herbs in hedgerows than the single variable light availability. An ordination of species lists in the literature data set showed pronounced regional differences in the species pools of forest herbs in hedgerows, the floristic gradient being closely related to climatic continentality. Hedgerows in more continental regions had lower proportions of chamaephytes and, according to an indicator species analysis, drier and less acid soils.

AB  - A molecular biological tool based on an organism-specific DNA sequence does not necessarily indicate in situ activity but serves important functions of evaluating the potential for biodegradation and mapping the distribution of an organism. Currently, DNA-based probes are accepted as evaluative tools for site assessment. However, these techniques are far from standardized, and information on precision is usually lacking. Here, we present the development and evaluation of a DNA probe for Polaromonas sp. strain JS666, a bacterium that couples growth to aerobic oxidation of cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE), and is therefore a promising candidate for bioaugmentation at sites where cDCE has accumulated in aerobic zones. The DNA probe was used in conjunction with quantitative polymerase chain reaction to track the abundance of JS666 in microcosms. This series of studies has allowed explicit resolution of the accuracy and precision of the probe and its correlation with variations in microcosm performance. We determined that the method is sufficient to monitor distribution of JS666 at bioaugmented sites. We found within environmental, mixed cultures, that the DNA target does not persist long after cell death, demonstrating that positive result from the probe is a strong indicator that degradation can occur in suitable environmental conditions. Finally, in the absence of suspected predation, the probe accurately and precisely tracks growth. Collectively, the studies appear to validate the utility of the molecular probe for site assessment in a bioaugmentation context.

AB  - This paper documents the events leading to the imminent collapse of an attempt to rehabilitate a degraded ecosystem in central Tanzania, focusing on the consequences of the failure to systematically monitor socio-economic and environmental indicators. A decision was taken in 1979 to evict all grazing livestock from a 1200 km(2) semi-arid area, the so-called Kondoa Closed Area, in central Tanzania due to their destructive effect on contour ridges and bunds that had been constructed in an attempt to arrest land degradation. Although the closure was successful in that the vegetation quickly regenerated and soil erosion was arrested, the evictions resulted in severe hardship for the agro-pastoralists in the area. As a result, it was decided a decade later to allow the reintroduction of cattle on condition that they were totally confined and were of improved dairy breeds. Although performance and economic data have generally been positive, the top-down approach to the introduction of the cows, the lack of baseline data, followed by the withdrawal of external funding, have resulted in increased illegal free-grazing and the near collapse of the attempt to convert a degraded ecosystem to sustainable use. It is concluded that the probable collapse of the ecosystem in the Kondoa Closed Area is a result of the initial top-down approach to the introduction and implementation of the project, inadequate monitoring of socio-economic and environmental indicators, and ultimately to the withdrawal of donor funding.

AB  - We present a regional-scale integrated modeling system (IMS) that includes Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC), Weather Research and Forecast (WRF), Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ), and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models. The centerpiece of the IMS is the Fertilizer Emission Scenario Tool for CMAQ (FEST-C), which includes a Java-based interface and EPIC adapted to regional applications along with built-in database and tools. The SWAT integration capability is a key enhanced feature in the current release of FEST-C v1.4. For integrated modeling demonstration and evaluation, FEST-C EPIC is simulated over three individual years with WRF/CMAQ weather and N deposition. Simulated yearly changes in water and N budgets along with yields for two major crops (corn grain and soybean) match those inferred from intuitive physical reasoning and survey data given different-year weather conditions. Yearlong air quality simulations with an improved bidirectional ammonia flux modeling approach directly using EPIC-simulated soil properties including NH3 content helps reduce biases of simulated gas-phase NH3 and NH4+ wet deposition over the growing season. Integrated hydrology and water quality simulations applied to the Mississippi River Basin show that estimated monthly streamflow and dissolved N near the outlet to the Gulf of Mexico display similar seasonal patterns as observed. Limitations and issues in different parts of the integrated multimedia simulations are identified and discussed to target areas for future improvements.

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is a widely used tool to detect developmental instability and plants under stressful conditions are expected to exhibit increased values of asymmetry, as well as higher levels of herbivory.This study evaluated whether dust from roads can cause major deviations in the axis of symmetry of leaves of the pioneer plant species Cecropia pachystachya Trecul (Urticaceae). It was also investigated whether plants exposed to dust have greater nitrogen content and higher levels of herbivory levels. Ten leaves of 20 individuals of C. pachystachya were collected on two roads with different levels of dust deposition and a control area. FA was calculated as the size-scaled difference between the right (RW) and left (LW) leaf widths and leaf area removed was determined by the ratio between leaf area removed and total leaf area. C. pachystachya plants in areas under strong influence of dust pollution exhibited the highest FA values (0.279 cm), whereas plants in the control area exhibited the lowest. A positive relationship between levels of leaf area removed by insects and a gradient of dust pollution was also observed. Differences in foliar nitrogen concentration among sampling areas indicated differences in leaf quality and influenced herbivory levels of Cecropia. This study indicated that FA can be used as an indicator of developmental instability of plants and those individuals under the impact of road dust and pollution might be more susceptible to insect attack.

AB  - Some hydric soils present a unique set of problems associated with their identification, including morphological features not reflective of current hydrology and/or masked redoximorphic features. A simple, reliable tool to identify reduced soil environments is IRIS (Indicator of Reduction in Soil) tubes and panels. In saturated, anaerobic soils with substantial sulfur (S) contents, a commonly observed phenomenon is the reduction of S to form black iron monosulfides (FeS). The objective of this experiment was to document S reduction on polyvinylchloride surfaces coated with synthesized iron (Fe) oxides to simplify the identification of hydric soils wetlands containing moderate to high S concentrations. The IRIS panels were installed in soil mesocosms containing varying concentrations of sulfate and saturated for 11 wk. Oxidation-reduction potential and pH were measured weekly throughout the study. At the termination of the experiment, the IRIS panels were removed and analyzed quantitatively for percentage of oxidized iron (Fe3+) remaining, reduced iron (Fe2+) removed, and reduced S (FeS) precipitated onto the panel. When IRIS panels displayed 2% FeS precipitate, 77% of the panels met the National Technical Committee for Hydric Soil criteria using reduced Fe removal from IRIS panels, and 100% of the panels met the criteria established using measured oxidation-reduction potential. The strong visual observation of FeS is a simple, quick determination of highly reduced conditions. Wetlands are a valuable natural resource that can be challenging to delineate, and the incorporation of a visual S reduction criteria on IRIS surfaces is beneficial for the timely and accurate identification of hydric soils.

AB  - Polychaete worms have been suggested as a commercially valuable, extractive species to use in Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) to remove organic materials (fish feces) released from salmon aquaculture. However, pesticides used to control parasitic sea lice infestations on salmon are also released from fish farms and non-target organisms may be exposed to these chemicals. In laboratory studies, the polychaete Nereis virens was exposed via water and sediment to the anti-sea lice pesticide AlphaMax (R) (active ingredient, deltamethrin). Worms exposed in water for 48 h exhibited mortality and impaired mobility in up to 100% of organisms, only at greater than 2-times the prescribed aquaculture treatment concentration. This would suggest negligible risk to worms from acute environmental exposure to AlphaMax (R) in water. Low mortality (<= 20%) occurred in 7- or 30-d tests with sand or sediment spiked at relatively high concentrations (up to 0.72 mu g deltamethrin/g), but sublethal effects related to burrowing behavior and worm condition were observed at concentrations as low as 11 mu g/g. Therefore, the long-term survival, growth, and ability of worms to perform their ecosystem function of processing organic waste could be affected, depending on the extent of deltamethrin accumulation in sediment. Environmental concentrations of deltamethrin in sediment near aquaculture sites are not presently known and are needed to assess risk to non-target organisms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The metazoan parasite fauna and feeding ecology of 165 Sprattus sprattus (L., 1758) was studied from different geographic regions (Baltic Sea, North Sea, English Channel, Bay of Biscay, Mediterranean Sea). A total of 13 metazoan parasite species were identified including six Digenea, one Monogenea, two Cestoda, two Nematoda and two Crustacea. Didymozoidae indet., Lecithocladium excisum and Bomolochidae indet. represent new host records. The parasite species richness differed according to regions and ranged between 3 and 10. The most species-rich parasite fauna was recorded for sprats from the Bay of Biscay (North Atlantic), and the fishes from the Baltic Sea contained the lowest number of parasite species. More closely connected geographical regions, the North Sea, English Channel and Bay of Biscay, showed more similar parasite component communities compared with more distant regions. From the examined stomachs of S. sprattus, a total of 11 different prey items were identified, including Mollusca, Annelida, Crustacea and Tunicata. The highest number of prey organisms belonged to the crustaceans. The variety of prey items in the stomach was reflected by the parasite community differences and parasite species richness from the different regions. The feeding ecology of the fish at the sampled localities was responsible for the observed parasite composition and, secondarily, the zoogeographical distribution of the parasites, questioning the use of the recorded sprat parasites as biological indicators for environmental conditions and change.

AB  - Dolomitic soils characteristically contain high levels of magnesium and calcium, and have a low water holding capacity. Such constraints enhance plant speciation and the emergence of endemic species. Thymus granatensis is an example of an endemic species from Southern Spain (Mediterranean climate) and a bioindicator of dolomitic soils that can be found in the Sierra de Baza Natural Park on pure dolomite (PD) soils (those containing more than 90% dolomite). Acknowledging the beneficial role of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis against abiotic stress factors, this research was established to ascertain the importance of the AM community in supporting the growth of T. granatensis in PD soils. To study this, another Thymus species i.e., T. mastichina, was chosen for comparison. T. mastichina does not grow naturally in PD soils, but it is able to grow in a wide range of soil types including those having lower dolomite content. The results showed that: (i) AM establishment increases the biomass production of both species; (ii) the AM fungal community from PD soil might be fundamental for the growth of T. granatensis in the PD soil, particularly under drought conditions; (iii) the inoculation with AM fungi from the PD soil lowered the shoot Mg and Ca concentrations of both Thymus species growing in PD soil. Accordingly, AM fungi management could be used as a biotechnological tool to address the restoration and conservation of Mediterranean dolomitic habitats. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mining is widely regarded as having adverse effects on environment of both magnitude and diversity. Some of these effects include erosion, formation of sinkhole, biodiversity loss and contamination of groundwater by chemical from the mining process in general and open-pit mining in particular. As such, a repeatable process to evaluate these effects primarily aims to diminish them. This paper applies Folchi method to evaluate the impact of open-pit mining in four Iranian mines that lacked previous geo-environmental assessment. Having key geologic resources, these mines are: Mouteh gold mine, Gol-e-Gohar and Chogart iron mines, and Sarcheshmeh copper mine. The environmental components can be defined as public health and safety, social relationships, air and water quality, flora and fauna hence, various impacting factors from the mining activities were estimated for each environmental component. For this purpose, each impacting factor was first given a magnitude, based solely on the range of possible scenarios. Thereafter, a matrix of weighted factors was derived to systematically quantify and normalize the effects of each impacting factor. The overall impact upon each individual environmental component was then calculated by summing the weighted rates. Here, Folchi method was applied to evaluate those environmental conditions. Based on the acquired results, the present paper finally concludes that amongst four case histories in Iran, Sarcheshmeh copper mine significantly affects the environment, with critical level of air pollution there.

AB  - In this study, 119 meadows distributed across the Yorkshire Dales National Park were re-surveyed and changes in the overall vegetation and the landscape structure over the last two decades were investigated with a particular emphasis on the influence of management practices. To study the effects of fragmentation on a particular species, this study focused on changes in the occurrence of the perennial herb Geranium sylvaticurn as this is accepted as an indicator of the good ecological condition of British upland hay meadows.
   Results indicated that there has been a general impoverishment in the vegetation with a decrease in diversity, species richness and habitat quality and meadows have become 10 times more isolated than 20 years ago. Habitat quality was positively associated with agri-environment schemes that encourage extensive management practices, low grazing intensity and organic fertiliser application. G. sylvaticum has disappeared from 40% of the fields where it used to be and its occurrence was influenced by habitat quality and the connectivity of the fields in 2003.
   For perennial plants that do not have specialised reproduction and dispersal mechanisms like G. sylvaticum, changes at the local scale may have stronger effects on survival than changes at the wider landscape scale. It is thus of utmost importance to maintain and encourage traditional management practices in remaining hay meadows, especially hay making practices that would facilitate the exchange of seeds between fields and improve landscape connectivity.

AB  - Over the last years there has been an increasing interest in measuring well-being at local level. This is mainly due to the fact that socio-economic indicators at country level do not provide a complete picture of the living conditions in a territory. Moreover, the temporal dimension is also a fundamental aspect that allows analysing the trends of local well-being over time. The aim of this paper is to provide a more in-depth analysis of territorial disparities, inequalities and divergences across the Italian territories. In particular, this paper is one of the first attempts to analyse the overtime trend of the Italian well-being at provincial level (NUTS3) using a subset of indicators recently provided by ISTAT to measure the Equitable and Sustainable Well-being (BES) at local level. We apply a Bayesian latent variable model to construct three composite indicators related to the three main pillars of well-being, namely economic, social, and environmental. These composite indicators have been estimated for all the years between 2004 and 2016 for each Italian province. Results suggest that in the period of analysis the economic well-being has worsened in almost all provinces, with weak signs of recovery starting from 2014. On the contrary, social well-being improved in almost all provinces, with some exceptions in the South. The environmental well-being has increased over time as well, more in the Northern and Central provinces than in the South.

AB  - Agriculture is one of the most vulnerable sectors to climate change. The current vulnerability assessments through traditional fragmented sectoral methods are insufficient to capture the effects on complex agricultural systems. Therefore, the traditional methods need to be replaced by integrated approaches. The objective of this study is to propose a holistic vulnerability assessment method for agricultural systems. By aggregating both agro-ecological and socio-economic information, we develop an agricultural systems vulnerability index (ASVI) which allows for (i) a classification of geographical units according to their vulnerability level, (ii) an identification of key determinants of vulnerability for each unit and (iii) an assessment of adaptation policy scenarios considering their effects on the sustainability of the analysed systems. The proposed method is applied in the Khorezm region of Uzbekistan-a representative irrigated agricultural region in the lower Amu Darya river basin. A decision support tool is used to facilitate multi-criteria decision analysis, including the computation of the index and performing sensitivity analysis of the results. The assessment for Khorezm reveals significant spatial differences of vulnerability levels due to a variation of contributing factors, e.g. natural resources, water productivity, rural-urban ratio. It reveals also that feasible land and water management policies could reduce the vulnerability in Khorezm, particularly in the districts with the poorest agro-ecological conditions. Overall, the proposed method could support national and local authorities in the identification of sustainable adaptation policies for the agriculture sector.

AB  - Development of a standard monitoring protocol for assessing the impacts of REDD+ (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) projects on biodiversity is desirable. Drawing on the conservation literature and our personal experience, we review whether such a one-size-fits-all approach is justifiable on scientific and practical grounds. We conclude that achieving a model biodiversity monitoring protocol suitable for use in all potential REDD+ sites is probably an unrealistic objective, owing to the huge differences among the world's forests in terms of structure, species composition, ecological interactions and ecosystem services provided. Moreover, to provide useful feedback for conservation managers, ecological monitoring programmes must be designed around a project's conservation goals, which will vary from project to project, owing to these differences in forest ecology and human threats faced. Thus, site-specific biodiversity monitoring programmes are needed. No single monitoring method is likely to be optimal, or even suitable for use, in all REDD+ forests. Instead, we suggest that a standard approach be adopted, in which ecological monitoring research is (i) designed to reflect a project's biodiversity conservation goals; (ii) based upon scientifically-tractable, policy-relevant questions regarding the impacts of management interventions on the ecosystem; (iii) founded on detailed knowledge of the habitat type in question; (iv) includes monitoring of a number of indicators, as appropriate to the project; and (v) defines appropriate reference/baseline conditions against which progress can be assessed.

AB  - The aim of this study is to classify and describe plant communities of mountain woodlands in the western half of Crete and to relate their species composition to environmental factors with particular reference to grazing. From a total of 232 original phytosociological releves we classified eight plant communities (plus several subunits). The plant communities were assigned to associations of the class Quercetea ilicis, herein specifically to the alliances Erico-Quercion ilicis, Quercion calliprini and Accri-Cupression sempervirentis. Correspondence analysis revealed a separation of the chiefly calcifuge Quercus ilex and Q. pubescens associations with more favourable water supply from the woodlands dominated by Q. coccifera, Acer sempervirens, Cupressus sempervirens and Pinus brutia, growing on hard limestone under drier conditions. Species composition in the latter group of woodlands follows an altitudinal gradient, expressing favourable moisture and, on Plattenkalk, nutrient supply at higher elevations. An ecogram was drawn displaying the relative ecological range of each community along moisture and temperature gradients. Silvopastoral impact was different at species response level, and 'tolerators', 'indicators', and 'avoiders' of grazing may be distinguished. Floristic differentiation related to wood-pasture within given associations was not found, indicating high grazing pressure throughout the stands. In most wood-pastures, especially broadleaved (semi-)evergreen, stands are structurally unbalanced, lack tree rejuvenation and require periods of regeneration from browsing. To allow regeneration and monitoring, we advocate sets of sizable exclosures in different areas and elevations, representing all relevant associations.

AB  - The use of essential oils extracted from native aromatic plants is perceived as a promising alternative to protect stored cowpeas in West Africa. However the optimal conditions for their efficiency remain to be determined. A study was therefore carried out to compare the biological activity and temperature-related persistence of four selected essential oils towards Callosobruchus maculatus, the main pest of stored cowpeas. Essential oil extracted from Ocimum americanum proved to be very toxic towards C. maculatus adults (LC50= 0.23 mu l/l) while the oils from Hyptis suaveolens, Hyptis spicigera and Lippia multiflora exhibited higher LC50 values (1.30 mu l/l; 5.53 mu l/l and 6.44 mu l/l respectively). The persistence of the biological activity of the four oils was variable and that from O. americanum was most persistent. Fourteen days post-application, this oil was still as active on C. maculatus adults as it was immediately after its application. Exposure of this oil to a high temperature, close to temperatures occurring during storage in Burkina Faso in the dry season, however, resulted in a rapid decrease in its efficacy. Our results emphasize the need to take into account environmental factors such as temperature to optimize the use of promising essential oils for controlling stored-product pests in West Africa.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the potential utility of Allium cepa L. as a bioindicator organism for measuring copper bioaccumulation and toxicity in laboratory conditions. Onions were exposed to increasing concentrations of the metal (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5 and 10gmL-1) for 7 days. Root and leaf development were chosen as biological endpoints, while bioaccumulation was evaluated in roots, bulbs and leaves. Copper caused inhibition of root elongation with increasing effects at the higher doses, growth being reduced by almost 60% at 0.1gmL-1 and up to 95% at 10gmL-1. The elongation of leaves was significantly lower only in specimens exposed at 0.5gmL-1, but a total absence of newly formed tissues was observed at 10gmL-1. A marked bioaccumulation of copper was measured in roots, with values increasing up to almost four orders of magnitude compared to controls; only slight or even no significant differences were observed for copper levels in leaves and bulbs of treated A. cepa. Multiple linear correlations revealed a significant inverse relationship between copper concentrations and tissue length in both the roots and leaves, evidencing a sensitive responsiveness of this biological model. The overall results suggest the suitability of A. cepa as a robust species for easy and simple ecotoxicological bioassays to test the toxic effects and bioavailability of environmental pollutants, especially trace metals.

AB  - Vibrio spp. are ubiquitous members of aquatic microbial food webs that can be pathogenic to humans and a range of other organisms. Previously published predictive models for Vibrio spp. concentrations in estuarine and coastal waters, based only on salinity and temperature, are 70 to 75% accurate during 'normal' conditions (e.g. not during storms or drought). We have conducted a preliminary comparison of the output from this type of model to the natural concentrations of both total Vibrio spp. and the potentially pathogenic Vibrio vulnificus when measured during tropical storms. Water samples were collected in situ from a deployed platform in the Neuse River Estuary (NRE), North Carolina, USA, during 2 storm events: Hurricane Ophelia and Tropical Storm Ernesto. Total Vibrio spp. concentrations were measured using culture-based methods and V vulnificus levels were determined using a newly developed, rapid quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) assay. Results were analyzed in relation to environmental parameters and to concentrations of the fecal indicator bacteria Escherichia coli (EC) and Enterococcus spp. (ENT). Total concentrations of Vibrio spp. in the NRE were often orders of magnitude higher than those predicted by a previously published model. These large deviations from model predictions may indicate contributions from storm forcing (e.g. resuspension, surges) that are missing from the calm weather observations used to build these models.

AB  - Thirty-one meadows were investigated within five sites representing various farming styles found in Austrian cultural landscapes. The meadows were analysed regarding (a) biodiversity (vascular plant and bryophyte species richness), (b) land-use practices (fertiliser input, mowing intensity, the use of silage), and (c) economic aspects (variable costs, profit margin and subsidies per ha). There were significant negative correlations between plant species richness and mowing intensity and intensity of fertiliser application. Bryophytes were good indicators of low nutrient regimes, having high species richness at low fertiliser input. Vascular plants showed highest species richness at an intermediate nitrogen supply. The total plant species richness decreased with increasing nitrogen supply. Intensive silage production was also negatively correlated with plant diversity. Species with a very narrow ecological niche of soil moisture and nutrients declined, whereas species adapted to wider ecological conditions increased. Profit margin and variable costs correlated negatively with plant species richness, with meadows that offered low or no profit margins showing highest species richness. There was no significant relationship between species richness and the amount of subsidies invested at the study meadows. Estimated costs of maintaining a species are shown. It is concluded that if plant species richness are to be maintained in these meadows, farmers have to receive increased financial incentives through agro-environmental subsidies for appropriate meadow management, and these have to be linked to clearly defined measures.

AB  - The aim was to assess fungal communities associated with living needles and soil of Pinus sylvestris in managed and unmanaged forest stands to get a better understanding of whether and how different intensities of forest management affects fungal diversity and community composition under the north temperate forest zone conditions. The study was carried out in three national parks in Lithuania. Each included five study sites in managed stands and five in unmanaged stands. At each site, three random soil cores and five random last-year needle samples were collected. Following DNA isolation, a DNA fragment of the ITS2 rRNA gene region of each sample was individually amplified and subjected to high-throughput sequencing. Analysis of 195,808 high-quality reads showed the presence of 1909 fungal taxa. Richness and composition of fungal taxa were similar in each substrate (needles and soil) in managed vs. unmanaged sites. The most common fungi in needles were Coleosporium campanulae (12.4% of all fungal sequences), Unidentified sp. 3980_1 (12.4%), Unidentified sp. 3980_4 (4.1%) and Sydowia polyspora (3.1%). In soil: Unidentified sp. 3980_21 (8.6%), Umbelopsis nana (8.2%), Archaeorhizomyces sp. 3980_5 (8.1%) and Penicillium spinulosum (6.3%). The results demonstrated that managed and unmanaged P. sylvestris stands support similar diversity and composition of fungal communities associated with living needles and soil.

AB  - A decade long study was conducted to investigate the ecological, biological, and temporal conditions that affect concentrations of Vibrio spp. bacteria in a well-studied lagoonal estuary. Water samples collected from the Neuse River Estuary in eastern North Carolina from 2004-2014 (with additional follow-up samples from Fall of 2018) were analyzed to determine Vibrio spp. concentrations, as well as the concentrations of inorganic and organic nutrients, fecal indicator bacteria, phytoplankton biomass, and a wide range of other physiochemical estuarine parameters. A significant increase in Vibrio spp. was observed to occur in the estuary over the examined period. Strikingly, over this long duration study period, this statistically significant increase in total culturable Vibrio spp. concentrations does not appear to be correlated with changes in salinity, temperature, or dissolved oxygen, the three most commonly cited influential factors that predict estuarine Vibrio spp. abundance. Furthermore, shorter term (similar to 3 years) data on specific Vibrio species (V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus) show that while Vibrio spp. are increasing overall as a genus, the numbers of some key potentially pathogenic species are decreasing as a part of the total population, further supporting the concept that quantification of the entire genus is not a worthwhile use of resources toward predicting levels of specific potentially pathogenic species of public health concern. The significant increase in this concentration of Vibrio spp. in the studied estuary appears to be related to nitrogen and carbon in the system, indicating a continued need for further research.

AB  - The aquatic larvae of the Diptera are often the most abundant and most diverse group of the benthic macroinvertebrate fauna. They are able to survive in and colonise practically all freshwater habitats, and some species can tolerate harsh environmental conditions. They are therefore both a qualitatively and quantitatively important group of biological indicators for assessing freshwater systems. On the other hand their determination at the species level is very difficult. This is in part due to a lack of taxonomic work in the group, but also the absence of comprehensive determination keys, that meet the needs of water managers. As a result, the aquatic larvae of the Diptera often play a subordinate role in water management. In light of the EU Water Framework Directive the present work is a first step in improving the integration of the important group of the Diptera in water management practice: a comprehensive determination key, which is geared at water managers. The key includes 60 taxa, largely at the family and genus level. In contrast to already existing keys the present work tries to differentiate the taxa on the basis of simple and user-friendly characters. Numerous figures allow for easy checking of determination results. The key is applicable in Germany, Scandinavia. Great Britain and the Benelux states. Mainly taxa from running water systems are considered, but the key can also be used at the family level to determine taxa from standing water bodies.

AB  - Monitoring of desertification processes by satellite remote sensing is an important task in China and other and regions of the world. We used a full year 2000 (1 January 2000 31 December 2000) time-series of SPOT VEGETATION images with 1 km spatial resolution to produce a land cover map with special emphasis on the detection of sparse vegetation as an indicator of areas at risk of desertification. The study area covered 2000 x 3500 km in North China extending from temperate forests to the Gobi desert to the Tibet high plateau. A classification approach for different land cover types with special emphasis on sparse vegetation cover was developed which was able to resolve problems related to seasonal effects and the highly variable natural conditions. The best classification results were obtained by exploiting seasonal effects detectable in time-series of optimized Normalized Difference Vegetation Index images calculated from 10-day composites. Compared to the Global Land Cover 2000 and MODIS Vegetation Continuous Field classification, more sparsely vegetated land was detected by this approach. The areas at risk of desertification were modelled, and the result suggests that 1.60 million km(2) are areas at risk of desertification. Due to the wide swath and sensitivity to vegetation growth SPOT VEGETATION imagery should be very useful to detect large-scale dynamics of environmental changes and desertification processes.

AB  - The ecological and survival characteristics of bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens vary under environmental conditions, indicating that probably no single indicator organism can predict the presence of all enteric pathogens for all types of waters and different host-associated fecal pollution. if there are true correlations between indicator organisms and pathogens, it is necessary to find out to what extent and under which circumstances these organisms can be used as reliable indicators of fecal pollution.
   Application of conventional and alternative fecal indicators has greatly enhanced our abilities to predict and reduce health risk associated with the use of surface waters. New molecular-based techniques have shown that combined use of conventional and alternative indicators for fecal pollution increases both the detection sensitivity and specificity of fecal pollution and associated pathogens. in this review, we, therefore, summarize the advantages and limitations of conventional and alternative fecal indicators in terms of predicting pathogen presence as well as current and future methodologies for direct pathogen monitoring in environmental waters. This manuscript is mainly focused on the relationships between microbial fecal indicators and the presence of pathogens, which have not previously been summarized yet and could nicely supplement with recent literature reviews on microbial source tracking.

AB  - We studied cryptogamic epiphytes in a river valley in northern Belgium in order to investigate the effects of potential environmental and ecological determinants on epiphyte diversity. The study was done on ecotope level. In practice different habitat types, historical variables (forest history, tree age) and ecological indicator values of the epiphytes were used as explaining variables. The environmental variables were linked with ecological indicator values by means of canonical correlation analysis. Thereby correlations between indicator values and epiphyte diversity were calculated in a qualitative as well as in a quantitative sense. Classification and regression trees were applied to study the importance of the different environmental variables for epiphyte diversity. Cryptogamic epiphyte diversity of old forests proved to be low, contradicting the 'ecological continuity' hypothesis, while forests or shrubs with a high quantity of young trees were most suitable for epiphytes. These woodlands have a short forest history and are situated on alluvial soils in the centre of the valley, on former pastures. Main reasons for a high diversity in the young forests are elevated (air) humidity levels as well as the prominent presence of (several types of) wet broad-leaved forests, causing a high (micro)habitat diversity and diverse site conditions. As also structural aspects are important for the a-diversity of cryptogamic epiphytes, right actions should be implemented in management practices. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding how soil fertility changes due to environmental conditions and stand-age-dependent forest attributes is important for local-scale forest restoration. We evaluated the effects of stand-age-dependent forest attributes (plant community composition and litter stock) on soil and technosol fertility across two second-growth Atlantic forests (SGF) after the deposition of mining tailings in Mariana, southeastern Brazil. We hypothesized that technosol fertility in the SGF tailings is positively affected by plant community composition variability, stand age, and litter stock. We used total exchangeable bases and organic matter as fertility indicators for technosol and soil, and species composition and litter stock as stand-age-dependent forest attributes. Our results showed significant differences in the stand-age-dependent forest attributes and soil chemical properties between the two forest patches (SGF tailing and SGF non-tailing) evaluated. Thus, there was a marked gradient of litter storage and fertility between soil and technosol that can be important forest recovery indicators for the affected plant communities. Furthermore, according to the tested models, we corroborated the hypothesis that technosol fertility is positively affected by stand age, plant community composition variability, and litter stock, which may contribute considerably to forest recovery on tailings. Our results demonstrate that the fertility predictors analyzed to explain the forest recovery on tailings can also be considered as ecological indicators for assessing forest restoration in areas impacted by mining tailings in Mariana.

AB  - Across the water sector, Escherichia coli is the preferred microbial water quality indicator and current guidance upholds that it indicates recent faecal contamination. This has been challenged, however, by research demonstrating growth of E. coli in the environment. In this study, we used whole genome sequencing to investigate the links between E. coli and recent faecal contamination in drinking water. We sequenced 103 E. coli isolates sampled from 9 water supplies in rural Kitui County, Kenya, including points of collection (n = 14) and use (n = 30). Biomarkers for definitive source tracking remain elusive, so we analysed the phylogenetic grouping, multi-locus sequence types (MLSTs), allelic diversity, and virulence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes of the isolates for insight into their likely source. Phylogroup B1, which is generally better adapted to water environments, is dominant in our samples (n = 69) and allelic diversity differences (z = 2.12, p = 0.03) suggest that naturalised populations may be particularly relevant at collection points with lower E. coli concentrations (< 50 / 100mL). The strains that are more likely to have originated from human and/or recent faecal contamination (n = 50), were found at poorly protected collection points (4 sites) or at points of use (12 sites). We discuss the difficulty of interpreting health risk from E. coli grab samples, especially at household level, and our findings support the use of E. coli risk categories and encourage monitoring that accounts for sanitary conditions and temporal variability.

AB  - Building retrofitting plays a critical role in achieving sustainable development and is an efficient way to improve the indoor air quality (IAQ) of existing spaces. The IAQ in classrooms has a significant impact on the health and academic achievement of students. However, improving the IAQ of existing classrooms is challenging if minimum architectural modifications are allowed. Different natural ventilation retrofitting techniques were proposed to improve the IAQ in existing classrooms at Jordan University of Science and Technology, which is located in a hot arid region. Computer simulations were used to analyze the ventilation rate, indoor operative temperature, relative humidity, and CO2 concentration in the base Case classroom and after the implementation of the proposed retrofitting techniques. Simulation results were compared with those obtained in the base case to determine the most efficient natural ventilation retrofitting technique. The best results were obtained by using a solar chimney to assist a wind tower, which resulted in an increase in the comfort hours during the occupation time, an improvement in the average monthly ventilation rate range, a decrease in the CO2 concentration, and an improvement in the relative humidity ratio. An energy-saving of 39% would be achieved compared with the use of split unit air condition systems. Economic assessment of the proposed system using net present value indicates positive economic viability.

AB  - Heavy metals are one of the most infamous air pollutants. They do not deteriorate easily in nature and they tend to bioaccumulate in nature. Because of their significance in terms of potential damage to human and environmental wellbeing, the monitoring of heavy metal pollution and identifying risk-prone regions is of great importance. Bioindicators are the most important determinants of the change in the concentration of heavy metals in the atmosphere. While plants play the biggest and most important role in reducing pollution in all of its types, they are also the ideal bioindicators. However, some plant species are better equipped to detect heavy metal accumulation than others. This study aims to determine the usability potential of Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris) in monitoring traffic-based heavy metal concentrations. For this purpose, samples of Scotch pine individuals were collected from one of the busiest highways in Turkey (along the Ankara-Istanbul route) from refuges at roadsides and at distances of 3m, 10m, 30m, 50m, and 100m from the roadside. Some of the branches and needles of the samples were also subjected to washing processes and the changes of Ni, Cr and Zn concentrations were determined for these samples. The change of Ni, Cr and Zn concentrations depending on the distance to the road, washing conditions and organelle were evaluated separately. We determined that Scotch pine is a good biomonitor - especially for monitoring changes in Cr concentrations.

AB  - Identification and mapping of small-scale physical and biogenic structures in sand has been a challenge to sedimentologists and ichnologists. Under natural conditions, biogenic activity (trampling tracks, burrows) alter primary sedimentary structures, but also serve as important paleoenvironmental indicators of geotechnical properties of sediments, omission surfaces, and ecosystem dynamics. Therefore, the ability to recognize such structures as anomalies in shallow subsurface, especially when using indirect non-invasive methods, such as geophysical imaging, is an important aspect of assessing their relative contribution to the overall erosional-depositional record. This study presents experimental evidence of the viability of two high-resolution geophysical methods in detecting sediment deformation that mimics shallow animal traces. High-frequency (800 MHz) ground-penetrating radar (GPR) imaging aided in visualizing a buried depression produced by a deer hoofprint cast indenter, with high-amplitude reflection return enhanced by a heavy-mineral concentration (HMC). Bulk in situ low-frequency (930 Hz), low-field magnetic susceptibility (MS) experiment supported the theoretical pattern of a decrease in MS over the thickest cover sand (maxim um indentation depth) to similar to 0 mSI and the highest values over raised HMC horizon (marginal ridge; >8 mSI). Because both methods are affected by the presence and relative abundance of heavy minerals, the present approach can be applied in most siliciclastic settings. This study demonstrates the promise of extending the 2D visualization of subsurface targets to 3D datasets, with potential implications for sedimentological, ichnological, archaeological, and geoecological research that involves animal-sediment interaction at different scales.

AB  - This paper investigates the relationship between economic development and water pressures using a global Multiregional Input-Output model (MRIO) dataset that takes into account the increasingly connected global supply chains underlying the economic systems. In particular, we analyse differences in water indicator outcomes by income level among European Union countries (EU27) from 1995 to 2008, focusing specifically on production and consumption-based water metrics for the member states. We use panel fixed effects regressions to study the dynamics of adjustment of water resources alongside controlling for individual country heterogeneity. Our main results indicate that the effects differ substantially depending on the approach used for measurement, especially when we conditioned on the country economic development, indicating opposite trajectories of water consumption and-per capita gross domestic product (GDP). Furthermore, the analysis of the main components associated to water indicators highlight the role of water embodied in trade flows as the transmission mechanisms of the main effects. In particular, our estimates suggest that the growth path followed by the most developed areas in the EU27 is based on the externalisation of the environmental burden over the less developed European partners, and external developing countries. On the policy front, our findings call for the implementation of integrated water resources management, technological specific policies and the corresponding environmental regulation to combine the conservation of water ecosystems and sustainable economic growth at the national, supranational and global levels.

AB  - Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), marine areas in which human activities are restricted, are implemented worldwide to protect the marine environment. However, with a large proportion of these MPAs being no more than paper parks, it is important to be able to evaluate MPA success, determined by improvements to biophysical, socio-economic and governance conditions. In this study a systematic literature review was conducted to determine the most frequently used indicators of MPA success. These were then applied to a case study to demonstrate how success can be evaluated. The fifteen most frequently used indicators included species abundance, level of stakeholder participation and the existence of a decision making and management body. Using the indicator framework with a traffic light system, we demonstrate how an MPA can be evaluated in terms of how well it performs against the indicators using secondary data from,the literature. The framework can be used flexibly. For example, where no MPA data currently exist, the framework can be populated by qualitative data provided by local stakeholder knowledge. This system provides a cost-effective and straightforward method for managers and decision -makers to determine the level of success of any MPA and identify areas of weakness. However, given the variety of motivations for MPA establishment, this success needs to be determined in the context of the original management objectives of the MPA with greater weighting being placed on those objectives where appropriate.

AB  - Background: Manure can provide a favourable environment for pathogens' survival. De-contamination may be conducted by extended storage, until field conditions are suitable for application to land as source of agricultural nutrients.
   Results: The hygienic evaluation of manure and slurry coming from a plant that collects cattle livestock wastes from a big slaughterhouse was carried out. Samples were even collected from spillages in the area around the plant. Microbial analyses highlighted the massive presence of faecal indicators in all samples: mean counts of Escherichia coli and enterococci were always above EU limits for marketable processed manure products. Cultures referable to the genus Brucella spp. were recorded in two samples of fresh manure but not in the aged ones. Conventional isolation techniques failed to detect members of the Mycobacterium genus, while by means of IS900 and F57 PCR real-time system on DNA directly extracted from environmental samples, the pathogen was detected in all cases.
   Conclusions: Thoughtful design of manure storage infrastructure is critical to prevent spills and over-topping of an open structure. The documented overload situation seems to lay the basis for an ongoing environmental contamination by enteric organisms and opportunistic pathogens circuit faecal-oral route. Moreover, the type of wastes analysed during this study, namely a mixture of fresh cattle manure, bedding and rumen content, needs a longer storage period or, alternatively, of specific chemical, biological or thermal treatments for stabilization.

AB  - The coordinated interactions between individuals are fundamental for the success of the activities in some professional categories. We reported on brain-to-brain cooperative interactions between civil pilots during a simulated flight. We demonstrated for the first time how the combination of neuroelectrical hyperscanning and intersubject connectivity could provide indicators sensitive to the humans' degree of synchronization under a highly demanding task performed in an ecological environment. Our results showed how intersubject connectivity was able to i) characterize the degree of cooperation between pilots in different phases of the flight, and ii) to highlight the role of specific brain macro areas in cooperative behavior. During the most cooperative flight phases pilots showed, in fact, dense patterns of interbrain connectivity, mainly linking frontal and parietal brain areas. On the contrary, the amount of interbrain connections went close to zero in the non-cooperative phase. The reliability of the interbrain connectivity patterns was verified by means of a baseline condition represented by formal couples, i. e. pilots paired offline for the connectivity analysis but not simultaneously recorded during the flight. Interbrain density was, in fact, significantly higher in real couples with respect to formal couples in the cooperative flight phases. All the achieved results demonstrated how the description of brain networks at the basis of cooperation could effectively benefit from a hyperscanning approach. Interbrain connectivity was, in fact, more informative in the investigation of cooperative behavior with respect to established EEG signal processing methodologies applied at a single subject level.

AB  - Under conditions of limited time, resources, and attention, appraisal of responses to threats of industrial pollution presents formidable challenges for governance and disaster preparedness. A community's social dynamics could very well explain how the responses to such perturbations are made and what inherent traits of the household/community make them adaptive to disasters. Using both qualitative and quantitative approaches in research, this study looked at the collective action and adaptive capacity of communities affected by an oil spill. Questionnaire was fielded out to elicit data on communities' quantitative level of adaptive capacity and focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, observations, and narrative analysis were employed for qualitative data.
   The oil spill experience reveals three forms of collectivity: actions through formal organizations, informal organizations and spontaneous actions all anchored on residents 'varying motives, and intentions. Collective action when harnessed by personal agency results into desired trajectories thus strengthening communities 'adaptive capacity.
   A household adaptive capacity index (HACI) consisting of demographic structure, economic well-being, interconnectivity to higher level processes, and dependence on a resource as indicator of measuring adaptive capacity was devised and employed in selected communities affected by oil spill in Guimaras, Philippines. Ten percent or 88 households were randomly selected as survey respondents. In the outcome, the communities were fairly adaptable (with HACI of 55.43) to the perturbations. It was concluded that a strong social capital, high economic well-being, and less dependence on a single resource for livelihood made the household highly adaptable to environmental stresses.

AB  - The amount of land consumption required for housing and transport severely conflicts with both the necessity and the legal obligation to maintain the ecological potential afforded by open spaces to meet the needs of current and future generations with regards to the protection of resources and climate change. Owing to an increasing intensity of soil use, soil conditions appear to have deteriorated in most city regions around the world, namely their filter and runoff regulating functions are impaired by land surfacing. As such soil functions depend oil the soil's biophysical properties and the degree of imperviousness. the impact on the water balance Caused by urban growth varies considerably. In response to the demand for sustainably secure urban water resources, it needs to be assessed exactly how land surfacing affects the functions concerned. Analysing and evaluating urban land use change on the long-term water balance should improve our understanding of the impact of Urbanisation on the water household. Therefore, this paper analyses the impact of urban land Use change and land surfacing oil the long-term urban water balance over a 130-year trajectory by using Simple model approaches that are based oil data available to the public. The test site is the city of Leipzig. In particular, attention is to be paid to estimating changes of evapotranspiration, direct runoff and groundwater recharge. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Conservation medicine is a discipline in which researchers and conservationists study and respond to the dynamic interplay between animals, humans, and the environment. From a wildlife perspective, animal species are encountering stressors from numerous sources. With the rapidly increasing human population, a corresponding increased demand for food, fuel, and shelter; habitat destruction; and increased competition for natural resources, the health and well-being of wild animal populations is increasingly at risk of disease and endangerment. Scientific data are needed to measure the impact that human encroachment is having on wildlife. Nonbiased biometric data provide a means to measure the amount of stress being imposed on animals from humans, the environment, and other animals. The stress response in animals functions via glucocorticoid metabolism and is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Fecal glucocorticoids, in particular, may be an extremely useful biometric test, since sample collection is noninvasive to subjects and, therefore, does not introduce other variables that may alter assay results. For this reason, many researchers and conservationists have begun to use fecal glucocorticoids as a means to measure stress in various animal species. This review article summarizes the literature on many studies in which fecal glucocorticoids and their metabolites have been used to assess stress levels in various mammalian species. Variations between studies are the main focus of this review. Collection methods, storage conditions, shipping procedures, and laboratory techniques utilized by different researchers are discussed.

AB  - In 2000, a standardized sampling protocol was developed by a group of European researchers to provide a repeatable and objective strategy for mapping lichen diversity as an indicator of environmental changes; this protocol is nowadays adopted in the guidelines to air quality bioindication in Italy.
   The present paper shows the results of a study of epiphytic lichen diversity performed according to both the new protocol and the standard methodology previously used in Italy; diversity values are based on frequency counts of all lichen species within particular sampling grids positioned on the trunks and divided in subunits. The survey was carried out in 61 sampling sites of two areas of the Friuli Venezia Giulia region (Italy) and Slovenia, characterized by similar climatic conditions and a wide range of anthropic pressure. Biodiversity values obtained following the two sampling methods are highly statistically correlated; this suggests an interpretative continuity of lichen diversity data for biomonitoring purposes. Lichen communities and diversity values occurring in natural areas, far from heavy human influences, are investigated by means of multivariate analysis of floristic releves of 11sites. Diversity values scored in natural areas are rather variable, and are mainly influenced by the different vegetation types, Parmelion communities having lower diversity values than communities with Xanthorion elements. Evaluation scales of environmental alteration based on lichen diversity in the North Adriatic submediterranean bioclimatic area are provided. Some critical aspects of the sampling strategies are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to understand the impact of lands in rocky desertification region abandoned in different years on soil mite community structure and to clarify the change trends of mite community structure and diversity during ecological restoration of the abandoned lands, an investigation of soil mites was conducted in 5 abandoned land pieces with different abandonment years in Salaxi Town, Qixingguan District, Bijie City, Guizhou Province, China in May 2019. The results we got showed that: among a total of 5,012 soil mites that were captured in this region, they belong to 3 orders, 38 families and 61 genera, respectively, with Platynothrus as the dominant genus. In the lands with different abandonment years, there shows differences in the numbers of soil mite genera, individuals, community diversity and ecological groups. With the extensions of abandonment years, the numbers of genera and individuals and diversity of mites on the lands show an increasing trend. However, as affected by rocky desertification conditions, the trend is not shown that obvious. The predatory gamasid mites (Mesostigmata: Gamasina) in this area are mainly of r-selective type, and the oribatid mites are mainly of M type. So it can be seen that after different years of abandonment, the structures of soil mite communities are different, and the diversity of soil mite communities has not been restored; the soil environment is unstable, and the restoration of the rocky desert ecological environment is still underway.

AB  - Waste recycling is an essential part of waste management. The concrete industry allows the use of large quantities of waste as a substitute for a conventional raw material without sacrificing the technical properties of the product. From a circular economy point of view, this is an excellent opportunity for waste recycling. Nevertheless, in some cases, the recycling process can be undesirable because it does not involve a net saving in resource consumption or other environmental impacts when compared to the conventional production process. In this study, the environmental performance of conventional absorption porous barriers, composed of 86 wt % of natural aggregates and 14 wt % cement, was compared with barriers composed of 80 wt % seashell waste and 20 wt % cement through an attributional cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment. The results show that, for the 11 environmental impact categories considered, the substitution of the natural aggregates with seashell waste involves higher environmental impacts, between 32% and 267%. These results are justified by the high contribution to these impacts of the seashell waste pre-treatment and the higher cement consumption. Therefore, the recycling of seashells in noise barrier manufacturing is not justified from an environmental standpoint with the current conditions. In this sense, it could be concluded that life cycle assessments should be carried out simultaneously with the technical development of the recycling process to ensure a sustainable solution.

AB  - Karst estuaries are unique systems governed by freshwater inputs that flow directly to the sea through karst conduits and/or matrices. Because they are found at the interface between terrestrial and marine environments, they can act as sentinels to climate change and as indicators of aquifer health. The physical and geochemical gradients formed in karst estuaries are a direct result of the interactions between inland hydrological conditions and sea level. To examine the influence these gradients have on microbial communities in the water column and sediment of a karst estuary, we studied the spring-fed Double Keyhole Karst Estuary in west central Florida for a 2-year period. Four sites were monitored within this system starting at the Double Keyhole Spring Conduit extending 2 km west through the estuary toward the Gulf of Mexico. Water column and sediment samples were collected quarterly at all sites from September 2011 through September 2013. Archaeal, bacterial, and microbial eukaryote communities were analyzed using quantitative PCR and length-heterogeneity PCR. The biological communities were analyzed in the context of hydrological, physical, and geochemical parameters in order to determine which factor(s) governed the observed changes of microbial abundance and richness. The major finding of this study was that microbial community change in this karst estuary was primarily driven by the volume of aquifer discharge and associated physical gradients, and less by the geochemical fluctuations within the system.

AB  - Warming at nearly twice the global rate, higher than average air temperatures are the new 'normal' for Arctic ecosystems. This rise in temperature has triggered hydrological and geochemical changes that increasingly release carbon-rich water into the coastal ocean via increased riverine discharge, coastal erosion, and the thawing of the semipermanent permafrost ubiquitous in the region. To determine the biogeochemical impacts of terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter (tDOM) on marine ecosystems we compared the nutrient stocks and bacterial communities present under ice-covered and ice-free conditions, assessed the lability of Arctic tDOM to coastal microbial communities from the Chukchi Sea, and identified bacterial taxa that respond to rapid increases in tDOM. Once thought to be predominantly refractory, we found that similar to 7% of dissolved organic carbon and similar to 38% of dissolved organic nitrogen from tDOM was bioavailable to receiving marine microbial communities on short 4 - 6 day time scales. The addition of tDOM shifted bacterial community structure toward more copiotrophic taxa and away from more oligotrophic taxa. Although no single order was found to respond universally (positively or negatively) to the tDOM addition, this study identified 20 indicator species as possible sentinels for increased tDOM. These data suggest the true ecological impact of tDOM will be widespread across many bacterial taxa and that shifts in coastal microbial community composition should be anticipated.

AB  - This article outlines the results of the analysis of cultural layers and natural soil horizons at the Neolithic and Chalcolithic settlement Kochegarovo-1, and of the modern soil in its vicinity. The distribution of chemical elements and the associated geochemical ratios in the archaeological profile were compared to the background values. Six chemical elements (phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, manganese, and strontium) form distinct concentration-zones within the Neolithic and Chalcolithic cultural layers, especially within the latter. The most informative geochemical ratios are CIA (Chemical Index of Alteration), Rb/Sr, Ba/Sr, MnO/Al2O3, (CaO+MgO)/Al2O3, and Zr/TiO2. They allow us to reconstruct environmental conditions and subsistence activities at the site, which evidently emerged in the Neolithic when the hydrological situation of the region had changed. After the channel of the Miass River had migrated, new areas of land with semi-hydromorphic landscapes were exposed. The seasonal Neolithic camp was located on the river bank. In the Chalcolithic, the Miass River had continued to recede, and new areas of land appeared near the settlement. The environment remained semi-hydromorphic. The peak of subsistence activities, evidenced by maximal settlement area and largest estimated population size, coincided with the Chalcolithic, when occupation became permanent. Indicators of anthropogenic impact are present at all stages of occupation, especially at the Chalcolithic stage. The analysis confirmed that Neolithic and Chalcolithic populations of the region subsisted by hunting, gathering, and fishing.

AB  - ObjectivesPrenatal development has a long-lasting influence on biological condition and health. Second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D) is suggested as an indicator of sex hormone exposure during fetal development, and it is likely that women with a more feminine digit ratio were exposed to higher prenatal estrogen levels. Therefore, we tested if 2D:4D was related to a woman's reproductive characteristics.
   MethodsWe studied 319 women aged 46-92, who went through a natural menopause and whose husbands were alive at least until their menopause were studied. Women were recruited at the Mogielica Human Ecology Study Site located in rural Poland.
   ResultsWomen with more feminine 2D:4D had a higher number of children (P=0.002), gave birth to their last child at a later age (P=0.02), and had a longer reproductive lifespan (P=0.04) than women with more masculine 2D:4D. Age and number of years of education were included as potential confounders in the analyses.
   ConclusionsThe results indicated that women with more feminine 2D:4D had higher reproductive success. While the exact mechanisms were not known, and the relationship between 2D:4D and adult sex hormone levels was questioned by previous studies, there might be other biological pathways explaining the observed results, that is, via behaviors that were indirectly related to fertility.

AB  - Cage fish farming in natural and artificial lakes has become increasingly popular in recent years in tropical countries. The most commonly farmed tropical fish species is the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.). The aim of this study was to characterize the concentration of phosphorus, total ammonia nitrogen and chlorophyll a from existing fish farms (FF) in Lake Palminhas, located in Linhares/ES, Brazil. Three transects were drawn from 0 to 500m from each of the four FF (FF1 to FF4) in the lake during six trials (three in the rainy season and three in the dry season). The lake presented a monomictic-hot pattern, with stratification during the rainy season. Dilution of the monitored parameters did not occur sufficient over a distance of up to 500m from the FF. The location of the FF in the lake and the input of N and P were critical to ensure optimal mixing conditions because the worst results was observed for the fish farm (FF1) located on a finger of the lake, where the highest concentrations of total phosphorus and chlorophyll a occurred. It was also noted that there was possible total phosphorus interference between FF3 and FF4. The results of this study demonstrate that Lake Palminhas had a low dilution power, and these findings may inform environmental assessments of cage fish farming in this region, providing instruments that may support environmental control of cage fish farming.

AB  - Changes in frequency, duration and/or intensity of extreme precipitation events, such as heavy precipitation or drought, profoundly impact both society and the natural environment. Regional climate models are valuable tools to assess any future progress of such events, and to complement the development of regional and local adaptation and mitigation strategies-here for the model region Dresden within the REGKLAM project. Multi-model approaches may alleviate some of the problems related to uncertainties of projected changes. The bandwidth of future climate conditions in Central Eastern Germany has been estimated, using 12 regional climate projections in daily resolution as simulated within the EU-project ENSEMBLES (emission scenario A1B). Validation of the model runs against an observation data set displayed significant difficulties of the models to describe the regional precipitation characteristics. Shortcomings are particularly obvious in realistically simulating dry period characteristics, likely due to an overestimation of precipitation totals. Most models agree in the projection of more frequent and longer-lasting drought events during summer, while wet phase frequency and persistence is projected to increase in winter. Extreme precipitation events (99th percentile) are likely to increase by the end of the 21st century in most seasons-even in summer, despite projected decreasing average precipitation. The suggested display of all individual model results allows comparing the characteristics and the trend behaviour of the individual regional climate projections. This supports selecting the suitable model(s) for specific impact modelling demands.

AB  - Three holes at Site 317 on the High Manihiki Plateau were drilled in 1973 as part of the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP). This plateau is of special interest because of its organic-rich shale formation during its early history, potentially linking paleo-depositional conditions and water depth or land exposure. A multi-tracer approach was used to analyze target organic-rich layers of Hole 317A core 16, Sections 2 and 3 from the early Cretaceous. This included bulk elemental and stable carbon isotope compositions of specific chemical classes (lipids, humic acids, kerogen), as well as individual biomarkers separated by thin layer chromatography and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The major natural product contributions found in the core sediments were derived from three primary sources: algal (low molecular weight (<C-20) n-alkanoic acids, n-alkanols and n-alkanes), bacterial (2-hydroxyalkanoic acids and hopanoids), and terrestrial (high molecular weight (>C-22) aliphatic lipids, phytosterols, diterpenoids). Algal- and bacterial-derived compounds were observed at the shallowest layers of the core sample (680.30 m below sea floor), and decreased with increasing core depth. Terrestrial inputs increased down core and peaked between 68033 and 680.70 m below sea floor. This trend coincides with a thick sapropel layer and agrees with the Oceanic Anoxic Event (OAE) in the early Cretaceous, indicating deposition in a shallow water environment in proximity to land (e.g., atoll).

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of integrating a traditional sediment quality triad approach with selected sublethal chronic indicators in resident species in assessing sediment quality in four salt marshes in northern California, USA. These included the highly contaminated (Stege Marsh) and relatively clean (China Camp) marshes in San Francisco Bay and two reference marshes in Tomales Bay. Toxicity potential of contaminants and benthic macroinvertebrate survey showed significant differences between contaminated and reference marshes. Sublethal responses (e.g., apoptotic DNA fragmentation, lipid accumulation, and glycogen depletion) in livers of longjaw mudsucker (Gillichthys mirabilis) and embryo abnormality in lined shore crab (Pachygrapsus crassipes) also clearly distinguished contaminated and reference marshes, while other responses (e.g., cytochrome P450, metallothionein) did not. This study demonstrates that additional chronic sublethal responses in resident species under field exposure conditions can be readily combined with sediment quality triads for an expanded multiple lines of evidence approach. This confirmatory step may be warranted in environments like salt marshes in which natural variables may affect interpretation of toxicity test data. Qualitative and quantitative integration of the portfolio of responses in resident species and traditional approach can support a more comprehensive and informative sediment quality assessment in salt marshes and possibly other habitat types as well.

AB  - It is currently unclear whether the amino acid substitutions that occur during protein evolution are primarily driven by adaptation, or reflect the random accumulation of neutral changes. When estimated from genomic data, the proportion of adaptive amino acid substitutions, called alpha, was found to vary greatly across species, from nearly zero in humans to above 0.5 in Drosophila. These variations have been interpreted as reflecting differences in effective population size, adaptation being supposedly more efficient in large populations. Here, we investigate the influence of effective population size and other biological parameters on the rate of adaptive evolution by simulating the evolution of a coding sequence under Fisher's geometric formalism. We explicitly model recurrent environmental changes and the subsequent adaptive walks, followed by periods of stasis during which purifying selection dominates. We show that, under a variety of conditions, the effective population size has only a moderate influence on alpha, and an even weaker influence on the per generation rate of selective sweeps, modifying the prevalent view in current literature. The rate of environmental change and, interestingly, the dimensionality of the phenotypic space (organismal complexity) affect the adaptive rate more deeply than does the effective population size. We discuss the reasons why verbal arguments have been misleading on that subject and revisit the empirical evidence. Our results question the relevance of the "alpha" parameter as an indicator of the efficiency of molecular adaptation.

AB  - Nonspoiled food that nevertheless contains bacterial pathogens constitutes a much more serious health problem than spoiled food, as the consumer is not warned beforehand. However, data on the diversity of bacterial species in meat juice are rare. To study the bacterial load of fresh pork from ten different distributors, we applied a combination of the conventional culture-based and molecular methods for detecting and quantifying the microbial spectrum of fresh pork meat juice samples. Altogether, we identified 23 bacterial species of ten different families analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The majority of isolates were belonging to the typical spoilage bacterial population of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Enterococcaceae, and Pseudomonadaceae. Several additional isolates were identified as Staphylococcus spp. and Bacillus spp. originating from human and animal skin and other environmental niches including plants, soil, and water. Carnobacterium divergens, a LAB contributing to the spoilage of raw meat even at refrigeration temperature, was the most frequently isolated species in our study (5/10) with a bacterial load of 103107CFUmL-1. In several of the analyzed pork meat juice samples, two bacterial faecal indicators, Serratia grimesii and Serratia proteamaculans, were identified together with another opportunistic food-borne pathogen, Staphylococcus equorum. Our data reveal a high bacterial load of fresh pork meat supporting the potential health risk of meat juice for the end consumer even under refrigerated conditions.

AB  - The majority of the limnological research in Sudbury, Ontario, has focused on the anthropogenic impacts of industrial emissions (SO2 and metals), with the potential effects of cultural eutrophication largely being overlooked. However, the population of the City of Sudbury has grown with the prosperity of the mining sector, which poses a risk to the quality of freshwater resources. As with many environmental issues, there is often a lack of predisturbance data that can assist in gauging the full extent of environmental change. Therefore, paleolimnological approaches were used to track long-term biological changes in sedimentary diatom assemblages related to cultural eutrophication in 4 lakes from Sudbury. Diatom assemblages were primarily dominated by oligotrophic taxa prior to watershed development; however, with the onset of urban environmental stressors (e.g., septic systems, the application of lawn fertilizers and watershed development), there was a shift toward taxa that thrive in more productive systems. Diatom assemblages also seem to track an increase in lakewater pH through time, which is likely related to increased acid neutralizing capacity as a result of watershed disturbances, algal assimilation and bacterial reduction of NO-3, and increased base cation export from the watershed due to acidic deposition. Insight into predisturbance conditions of the lakes should help lake managers set realistic biological targets for restoration and may be used to help gauge the response of these systems to future mitigation efforts.

AB  - Periphyton communities dominate primary production in much of the Florida Everglades wetland and therefore contribute to soil production, ecosystem metabolism and secondary production as well as the composition of dependent communities. Decades of research in the Everglades have supported research findings from other wetland types that cumulatively show that periphyton communities respond very rapidly to alterations in the two dominant drivers of wetland structure and function-hydrology and water quality. Hydrology controls periphyton productivity and composition by regulating moisture availability, substrate types available for colonization and supply of nutrients. Nutrients, particularly the limiting nutrient in this system, phosphor-us (P), control levels of production and community composition. Because periphyton communities arc well-established to be related to hydrology and water quality, an indicator was developed based on three periphyton attributes: abundance, quality (i.e., nutrient content) and community composition. This assessment tool offers a qualitative assessment of ecosystem response to potential changes in management activities at a time scale appropriate for active management. An example is provided of how the indicator can be used to assess the current water quality and hydrological conditions from high-density spatial surveys. Detected patterns of deterioration align with expectations derived from model predictions and known sources of nutrients and unnatural hydrologic regimes. If employed adaptively, in ecosystem management, this tool can be used to both detect and react to change before the system has been irreparably altered. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Environmental magnetic measurements were carried out on the samples of street dust and topsoil, which were collected along the roadway in the urban and suburb of Beijing, including magnetic susceptibility (chi), anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM), isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) of all samples and temperature-dependence of magnetic susceptibilities and magnetic hysteresis parameters of representative samples. Obvious differences exist between the samples of street dust and those of topsoil. Compared with topsoil samples, the concentration of magnetic particles and high-coercivity components in street dust samples are higher, and the magnetic grains are coarser. Both dust and topsoil samples are dominated by ferrimagnetic minerals, and iron particles are only detected in some dust samples. These results suggest that street dust samples reflect the characteristic of particles produced by industrial and traffic activities, and the magnetic property of topsoil samples represents the characteristic of particles from both anthropogenic and natural sources. The distribution of magnetic parameters is influenced by the environment where the samples are collected, like industry, traffic density and other road conditions. Hard isothermal remanent magnetization (HIRM) may be used as an indicator of particles produced by traffic activity. Dust storm samples collected on 17 and 18 April, 2006 have different magnetic properties from street dust and natural particles, like loess and paleosol, which indicate that the dust storm might be mixed with anthropogenic particulates during transport and falling.

AB  - Objective: This study was conducted to confirm the definition of multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) in actual life: that multiple symptoms are provoked in multiple organs by exposure to, and ameliorated by avoidance of, multiple chemicals at low levels. We used the Ecological Momentary Assessment to monitor everyday symptoms and the active sampling and passive sampling methods to measure environmental chemical exposure. Methods: Eighteen patients with MCS, diagnosed according to the 1999 consensus criteria, and 12 healthy controls participated in this study. Fourteen patients and 12 controls underwent 1-week measurement of physical and psychologic symptoms and of the levels of exposure to various chemicals. Linear mixed models were used to test the hypotheses regarding the symptom profile of MCS patients. Results: Some causative chemicals were detected in 11 of 14 MCS patients. Two other patients did not report any hypersensitivity episodes, whereas passive sampling showed far less exposure to chemicals than control subjects. Another subject reported episodic symptoms but was excluded from the following analyses because no possible chemical was detected. Eleven of the 17 physical symptoms and all four mood subscales examined were significantly aggravated in the interview based on "patient-initiated symptom prompts." On the other hand, there were no differences in physical symptoms or mood subscales between MCS patients and control subjects in the interview based on "random prompts." Conclusions: MCS patients do not have either somatic or psychologic symptoms under chemical-free conditions, and symptoms may be provoked only when exposed to chemicals.

AB  - Traditional risk assessments (as delineated by regulatory agencies) use health outcome endpoints of interest to society as a whole, and are based on broad assumptions about the demographics of the potentially exposed populations and the routes of exposure. Immediacy of impact is not normally a major consideration. In tactical situations, the commander must balance considerations of short-term health effects against mission accomplishment. Often the commander will decide to accept a risk that would not be considered under other circumstances. The traditional tools of human-health and environmental risk assessment may be used, but the risk levels and projected consequences must be adapted to the tactical scenario (i.e. the performance decrement associated with a short-term exposure tactical operation vs. the long-term health out-come for an exposed population under 'normal conditions'). Risk assessors and health Professionals must learn to articulate risk in terms that the tactical commander can place in his operational risk management (ORM) process. The process may require that the commander weigh non-health related mission critical considerations against health outcome issues. This presentation is intended to begin a dialogue that will lead to a harmonization of the use of risk assessment tools and their application in ORM as seen by tactical commanders, and a clarification of the strengths and limits of their utility in such applications.

AB  - Studies conducted over the last 10 years have revealed that the disease caused by the apple scar skin viroid (ASSVd) is extremely rare in Europe. ASSVd was detected by molecular hybridization and indexing in field plots on the apple indicators Starkrimson and Indo, which showed symptoms of dapple apple disease within 2 years, and rough scarred skin within 3 years, respectively, Results from both approaches were in agreement. In an attempt to improve the biological detection of ASSVd the Japanese PK13 isolate was inoculated to 4 Prunus, 13 Malus, 17 Pyrus, and 17 other pomaceous species. All the species tested of the Malus, Pyrus, Sorbus, Chaenomeles, Cydonia, and Pyronia genera were susceptible to ASSVd based upon back indexing and hybridization, but none developed leaf or bark symptoms during a 2-year period. The viroid was not detected in the tested members of genera Amelanchier; Aronia, Cotoneaster, Crataegus, Prunus, and Pyracantha. Symptoms on fruit of 42 commercial apple cultivars experimentally inoculated with ASSVd fell into five groups ranging from inconspicuous spots to severely scarred skin and cracking. ASSVd was eliminated from most of the infected apple plants when they were subjected to a dormant stage followed by thermotherapy and shoot tip grafting. Analysis of more than 400 apple seedlings, originated from Starkrimson and Indo fruits with typical ASSVd symptoms, showed that there is little or no seed transmission of this viroid. However, ASSVd was transmitted at a low rate under field conditions to adjacent trees.

AB  - The limestone bluffs of the central Mississippi River Valley represent a significant portion of the remaining intermingled xeric hill prairie-savanna-woodland systems of the Midwest where different cover types may co-occur at very fine scales. Efforts to restore these landscapes would benefit from a data-driven tool to delineate existing vegetation cover characteristics and reconcile these with desired management outcomes on a spatially explicit basis. This study employed hierarchical cluster analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling in combination with indicator species analysis and dendrochronological methods to examine the structure, composition, and temporal community patterns of the forest-prairie gradient in the Mississippi River Bluffs of Jersey County, Illinois. Four distinct community types were identified on the gradient: (1) a woodland community dominated by Juniperus virginiana, Carya glabra, Quercus stellata, and Lonicera maackh; (2) open oak woodland with high exposed soil and overstory of Acer saccharum, Q. velutina, and Q. muehlenbergii; (3) a hill prairie community with grass coverage as the sole indicator; and (4) a transitioning community with 14 significant indicators and a trajectory advancing toward mesophytic forest composition. These data, within context with stem age, historical documents, and drought data, reveal the role of historical disturbances in temporal patterns of forest-prairie dynamics and provide a resolution in greater detail than previous studies of forest and nonnative invasive shrub encroachment. Pairing management activities to stand conditions, as informed by understanding drivers of ecosystem change, provides continuity with historical disturbance regimes and an objective basis for restoration activities and targets.

AB  - The analysis of nutrient concentrations in surface sediments is a reliable tool for assessing the trophic status of a water body. Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations are strongly related to the sediment characteristics but are mainly driven by anthropogenic impacts. The results of the determination of total nitrogen and total inorganic and organic phosphorus in surface sediments of the lagoons and ponds of the northwestern Adriatic Sea (Marano-Grado, Venice, Po Delta, Comacchio Valleys, Pialassa della Baiona) show the merit of this approach. Indeed, when previous data are available, the ratio between the actual and background values can provide useful information on the trophic changes that have occurred in the most recent times, and the results can also explain the conditions present in less studied environments. In this context, numerous studies performed in the Venice lagoon since the second half of the 20th century during different environmental scenarios provide mean concentration ranges and propose the main causes of changes. The results of single datasets available for the other lagoons fall into scenarios that occurred in the Venice lagoon. At present, the most eutrophic basins are Pialassa della Baiona, the Po Delta lagoons and ponds and the Comacchio valleys due to industrial effluents, fish farming and clam harvesting, respectively, whereas the Venice lagoon is now experiencing environmental recovery.</p>

AB  - Given population declines of many shark species, coupled with increasing conservation efforts and recoveries, there is a need for baseline assessments and continued monitoring of shark populations to support management. The waters of South Florida, USA, are used by a diverse array of sharks that occur among a mosaic of habitats and management zones. Here we conducted standardized drumline surveys from Miami through the middle Florida Keys to examine spatial, seasonal and environmental patterns in shark occurrence, catch per unit effort, composition, and demographic structure. Between 2009 and 2021, a total of 21,755 drumlines were deployed, capturing 3398 sharks, comprising fifteen species. Ginglymostoma cirratum, (n = 1335), Carcharhinus limbatus, (n = 650), Negaprion brevirostris, (n = 314), C. leucas, (n = 253), and Sphyrna mokarran, (n = 238) were the most common species encountered. Overall, the largest shark surveyed was a 450 cm S. mokarran and the smallest shark was a 50 cm Rhizoprionodon terraenovae. At the assemblage level, relative abundance among regions and seasons were generally similar; however clear species-specific patterns of abundance, size structure, and sexcomposition were detected by season, region, habitat, and management zones. Of the physical conditions evaluated, habitat type and depth emerged as the most influential parameters affecting abundances and sizes of species captured. While few species exhibited significant differences in catches by management zone, areas with the most restrictive fisheries regulations generally supported higher abundances for which differences were detected. These data serve as a baseline for future monitoring of shark populations in South Florida and assessing their response to environmental change.

AB  - The appearance of large amounts of antibiotics in drinking water and wastewater treatment plants has attracted extensive interest because of the potential resultant environmental and biological risks. Although the Fe(II)/peroxymonosulfate (PMS) system provides a feasible method for antibiotic degradation, the narrow pH range in which it operates and the resultant iron precipitation limit its use. In this study, protocatechuic acid (PCA) was introduced into the Fe(II)/PMS system to improve the system performance. Ciprofloxacin (CIP) was used as the probe reagent. Compared with the Fe(II)/PMS system, the Fe(II)/PCA/PMS system performed better for CIP degradation. This enhanced degradation was attributed mainly to the reduction and chelating ability of the PCA, which enhanced radical generation by accelerating the transformation from Fe(III) to Fe(II) and by forming the PCA-Fe chelate. The Fe(II)/PCA/PMS system also showed a superior degradation ability, even under alkaline conditions, because the PCA-Fe chelate protected iron from precipitation and released hydrogen ions continuously in the process. The electron paramagnetic resonance and alcohol-quenching tests indicated that sulfate and hydroxyl radicals existed in this system and two main CIP degradation pathways were proposed from the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry results. This work aims to provide new ideas for refractory organics treatment.

AB  - Grasses have a considerable potential for the adaptation to various, often extreme, habitat conditions. The aim of the work was to present the vegetation diversity of the coal-mine spoil heaps with the dominant share of grasses and to identify the main factors responsible for this diversity in the aspect of post-industrial land reclamation. The communities differ in reference to the species preferences to light, moisture, soil fertility and reaction, which is reflected in the wide variety of microhabitats in the area. It was shown that the increase in the abundance of certain grass species, including Calamagrostis epigejos, Festuca rubra, Festuca arundinacea, Phragmites australis, has a significant negative impact on the species richness, species diversity and the uniformity of distribution of species of the plant community. Preliminary analyses revealed that on post-mining waste, the biomass production of the dominant species is negatively correlated with biodiversity. The knowledge about the biology and ecology of grass species, as well as on the assembly rules may be used in the reclamation of degraded areas. Gaining the knowledge about the vegetation diversity of the coal-mine spoil heaps with the dominant share of grasses can be useful in planning the reclamation works, taking into account natural processes, which leads to the creation of a permanent vegetation cover at a given site, protecting it against water or wind erosion. In the future these areas may provide a number of important ecosystem services.

KW  - PERSPECTIVE
AB  - Shifts in the timing of phenological events in plants and animals are cited as one of the most robust bioindicators of climate change. Much effort has thus been placed on the collection of phenological datasets, the quantification of the rates of phenological shifts and the association of these shifts with recorded meteorological data. These outputs are of value both in tracking the severity of climate change and in facilitating more robust management approaches in forestry and agriculture to changing climatic conditions. However, such an approach requires meteorological and phenological records spanning multiple decades. For communities in the Delta State of Nigeria, small-scale farming communities do not have access to meteorological records, and the dissemination of government issued daily to seasonal forecasts has only taken place in recent years. Their ability to survive inter-annual to inter-decadal climatic variability and longer-term climatic change has thus relied on well-entrenched indigenous knowledge systems (IKS). An analysis of the environmental cues that are used to infer the timing and amount of rainfall by farmers from three communities in the Delta State reveals a reliance on phenological events, including the croaking of frogs, the appearance of red millipedes and the emergence of fresh rubber tree and cassava leaves. These represent the first recorded awareness of phenology within the Delta State of Nigeria, and a potentially valuable source of phenological data. However, the reliance of these indicators is of concern given the rapid phenological shifts occurring in response to climate change.

AB  - Introduction: Modern sensor technology makes it possible to collect vast amounts of environmental, behavioural and health data. These data are often linked to contextual information on for example exposure sourceswhich is separately collected with considerable lag time, leading to complications in assessing transient and/or highly spatially variable environmental exposures. Context-Sensitive Ecological Momentary Assessments1 (CS-EMAs) could be used to address this. We present a case study using radio frequency-electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) exposure as an example for implementing CS-EMA in environmental research.
   Methods: Participants were asked to install a custom application on their own smartphone and to wear an RF-EMF exposimeter for 48 h. Questionnaires were triggered by the application based on a continuous data stream from the exposimeter. Triggers were divided into four categories: relative and absolute exposure levels, phone calls, and control condition. After the two days of use participants filled in an evaluation questionnaire.
   Results: 74% of all CS-EMAs were completed, with an average time of 31 s to complete a questionnaire once it was opened. Participants reported minimal influence on daily activities. There were no significant differences found between well-being and type of RF-EMF exposure.
   Conclusions: We show that a CS-EMA based method could be used in environmental research. Using several examples involving environmental stressors, we discuss both current and future applications of this methodology in studying potential health effects of environmental factors.

AB  - Introduction: Land use/land cover change can affect the ecological processes of an area such as hydrological cycle. The change in the condition of water resources of an area could be a good indicator of changes in ecosystem function as a result of altered land use/land cover. Eucalyptus expansion in central Ethiopia is one of the recent land use/land cover changes causing controversy on its potential ecological effect. This study was designed to evaluate effects of three adjacent land uses/land covers, i.e. cultivated land, grassland and Eucalyptus woodlot on surface runoff in Meja River watershed, central Ethiopia.
   Methods: The rainfall amount at each study catchment was collected using the rain gauge installed to record daily rainfall amount. The three land use/land cover types in each study catchment were selected for comparison as treatments. Four replications of each land use/land cover were used forming a total of 12 runoff plots. The rainfall and runoff data were collected twice a day for 91 days.
   Results: The study found that land use/land cover significantly affects surface runoff generated from the plots. Higher runoff was recorded from cultivated land. There was no significant difference on runoff volume between grassland and Eucalyptus woodlot.
   Conclusions: This shows that expansion of Eucalyptus on grassland could not have significant impact on surface runoff generation but if planted on previously farmland could reduce surface runoff.

AB  - The attributes of soil microbiota are important indicators of the changes caused by agricultural practices. An experiment was carried out under field conditions in a randomized block design with four replications, with the aim of evaluating the effects of the type of management (a system no tillage - SSD and of conventional tillage - SPC) and the growth stage of upland rice (pre-plant - PP, flowering - FA and postharvest - PC) on attributes of the soil microbial biomass (C-mic, N-mic, BSR, qCO(2)), enzyme activity (TEA, A beta-G and APA) and population of microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, actinobacteria and diazotrophs) in soil samples collected at a depth of 0-20 cm. An area of forest near the experiment was taken as reference. The management systems caused changes in the microbiological attributes of the soil when compared to the reference forest. A difference was found between the management systems for C-mic, BSR and qCO(2); under SSD, the values for C-mic and qCO(2) were close to those observed for the forest. No difference was detected between SSD and SPD in the enzyme activity of the soil; however, greater values were found for APA at the PP stage. Overall, the number of microorganisms was higher under SSD and SPC compared to the forest, except for fungi. The greatest counts of microorganisms were found at the PP stage, except for actinobacteria, for which the highest value was found at the PC stage.

AB  - Bulk concentrations of PTEs (potentially toxic elements) were assessed and compared with foraminiferal assemblages from core sediments from TL (Torrecillas Lagoon), on the north coast of Puerto Rico. Temporal distributions of mud, Fe, Al (proxy for terrigenous sedimentation), and rhenium (proxy for anoxia) reflected changes in land use within the drainage basin associated with human activities over the past century. The mud-dominated sediments provided a major "sink" for PTEs, while Fe oxides and sulfides served as a secondary "sinks". Temporal variability of Re revealed intervals of aerobic vs anaerobic conditions in the lagoon. The dominant foraminiferal taxa, Ammonia beccarii, Quinqueloculina rhodiensis, Quinqueloculina seminula, and Ammobaculites agglutinans, coupled with low foraminiferal densities and species diversities, as well as barren samples, are characteristic of stressed estuarine environments. Overall bulk concentrations of Cu and Zn negatively correlated with foraminiferal absolute/relative abundances, diversity indices and incidences of test deformities. However, there are no correlations with the assumed bioavailable counterparts (F2(Tess)-Cu and F2(Tess)-Zn) were observed. These results indicate that fractionation of PTEs need to be considered in relation to their biological significance to foraminiferal ecology, which may differ substantially from bioavailability to metazoans that ingest sediments. The application of the acid-soluble F2(Tess), is not recommended in environmental studies using foraminifers as bioindicators, as PTEs in this fraction are likely not bioavailable to these protists.

AB  - Bluetongue, Schmallenberg and African horse sickness viruses are transmitted by vectors belonging to the genus Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae). Among this genus, species of the Obsoletus complex play a crucial role in Europe. In Italy the complex includes three species: Culicoides obsoletus sensu strictu, Culicoides scoticus and Culicoides montanus. These three sibling species were identified in 80 collection sites across Italy through a multiplex PCR test. Sixty-four sites were classified with a predominant species through a Bayesian approach. Environmental, topographic and climatic factors together with landscape metrics were investigated in each species group using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. Culicoides obsoletus s.s. resulted the most widely distributed species across the peninsula (51 sites). This species was collected in many eco-climatic conditions, at a wide range of temperature and altitudes, mainly in anthropogenic landscape. Conversely C. scoticus collection sites were dominated by natural vegetated areas or forest, at medium higher altitudes, preferably in a wilder and more pristine environment (predominant species in 8 sites). Culicoides montanus was a rarer species, statistically predominant in only 3 sites located in Southern Italy, characterized by temperatures higher than the other species. These results, together with other on-going researches on the vector competence of the species belonging to the Obsoletus complex, and with investigation of larval and breeding habitats, could greatly improve epidemiological knowledge of possible spreading Culicoides-borne viruses.

AB  - Among the soil management practices used to promote sustainable agriculture, reduced tillage and retention of residues from the previous crop are reported to enhance significantly both soil fertility and crop productivity. Here, high-throughput sequencing (454 technology) was used to see how the tillage regime (conventional vs. reduced tillage) and the fate of crop residues (retention or removal) affect microbial communities at two sampling depths (top soil: 0-5 cm and deeper soil: 15-20 cm) in a fertile silty loam soil in Belgium. All combinations of these three factors were studied. After 6 years of conversion from conventional to reduced tillage, depth emerged as the main factor responsible for variation in microbial diversity, tillage regime ranked second, and finally, crop residue fate had no influence on microbial diversity. For both bacteria and fungi, the diversity appeared higher in the top soil than in the deeper soil, and surprisingly, higher under conventional than under reduced tillage. These differences are explained by changes in community composition due to taxon loss rather than taxon replacement. The specific local set of environmental conditions (a loess-derived soil and an oceanic temperate climate) may explain these results. These observations raise the question: does impoverishment in indicator taxa influence soil processes, and thus crop:production? To answer this question, we discuss how the presence of certain indicator taxa liable to play an ecological role might relate to crop productivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although biomarkers are frequently used to assess sublethal effects of contaminants, a lack of mechanistic linkages to higher-level effects limits the predictive power of biomarkers. Bioenergetics has been proposed as a framework for linking cellular effects to whole-animal effects. We investigated sublethal effects of exposure to wastewater treatment facility effluent in freshwater mussels in situ, thereby capturing ecologically relevant exposure conditions. Our study focused on the energetic biomarker AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), while also considering more traditional biomarkers like heat shock proteins (HSP70), and antioxidant enzymes (i.e., superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione-S-transferase (GST)). We examined biomarkers at mRNA and protein levels. Effluent exposure caused a reduction in total-AMPK protein abundance (p = 0.05) and AMPK mRNA expression (p = 0.02). Conversely, AMPK activity increased at downstream sites by 2.2-fold (p = 0.05), indicating increased cellular energy consumption. HSP70 protein abundance was lower at downstream sites (p < 0.05), while SOD and GST activity levels significantly increased. By using various biomarkers, we demonstrate that exposure to municipal effluent creates an energetically taxing situation. This is the first study to use AMPK to evaluate the effects of contamination in situ, and our results suggest that energetic biomarkers, like AMPK, complement traditional biomarkers and may help establish functional links between cellular and whole-animal effects.

AB  - The extensive network of waters in the lower part of the Dutch delta is loaded with nutrients and accordingly a uniform ecological classification 'moderate' has been derived. The present study sets out to typify the diatom communities in this apparently homogenous environment via self-organizing maps of diatom species composition. Clusters of diatom communities were characterized through the representation of ecological guilds (high and low profile, motile and planktonic) and via a RDA analysis based on either species, genus or ecological guilds together with environmental drivers. Five clusters of diatom communities were identified despite the prominence of omnipresent species. The clusters had different profiles of ecological guilds and were associated with water transparency and sediment type (peat/clay) in addition to the well-established environmental drivers related to eutrophication, but with distinct roles for nitrogen and phosphate concentration. The clusters were interpreted as functional types of community, e.g. communities with a substantial share of planktonic diatom species were found in peat ditches with turbid water. The high consistency found between diatom community classification using species, genus or guilds may allow for a simplified water quality assessment while retaining valuable ecological information. The typology, based on species, genus and ecological guilds underpins the robust use of diatoms as water quality indicators in nutrient rich lentic waters and supports steps to improve ecological conditions.

AB  - Ensuring the sustainability of fish resources necessitates understanding their interaction with coastal habitats, which is becoming ever more challenging in the context of ever increasing anthropogenic pressures. The ability of coastal lagoons, exposed to major sources of disturbance, to provide resources and suitable habitats for growth and survival of juvenile fish is especially important. We analysed three lagoons with different ecological statuses and habitat quality on the basis of their eutrophication and ecotoxicity (Trix test) levels. Fish abundances were sampled using fishing and horizontal beaming acoustic surveys with the same protocols in the same year. The relative abundance of Anguilla anguilla, Dicentrarchus labrax or the Mugilidae group was not an indicator of habitat quality, whereas Atherina boyeri and Sparus aurata appeared to be more sensitive to habitat quality. Fish abundance was higher in the two lagoons with high eutrophication and ecotoxicity levels than in the less impacted lagoon, while fish sizes were significantly higher in the two most severely impacted lagoons. This leads us to suggest low habitat quality may increase fish growth rate (by the mean of a cascading effect), but may reduce lagoon juvenile abundance by increasing larval mortality. Such a hypothesis needs to be further validated using greater investigations which take into account more influences on fish growth and recruitment in such variable environments under complex multi-stressor conditions.

AB  - Background: Multiple infections of the same host by different strains of the same microparasite species are believed to play a crucial role during the evolution of parasite virulence. We investigated the role of specificity, relative virulence and relative dose in determining the competitive outcome of multiple infections in the Daphnia magna-Pasteuria ramosa host-parasite system.
   Results: We found that infections by P. ramosa clones (single genotype) were less virulent and produced more spores than infections by P. ramosa isolates (possibly containing multiple genotypes). We also found that two similarly virulent isolates of P. ramosa differed considerably in their within-host competitiveness and their effects on host offspring production when faced with coinfecting P. ramosa isolates and clones. Although the relative virulence of a P. ramosa isolate/clone appears to be a good indicator of its competitiveness during multiple infections, the relative dose may alter the competitive outcome. Moreover, spore counts on day 20 post-infection indicate that the competitive outcome is largely decided early in the parasite's growth phase, possibly mediated by direct interference or apparent competition.
   Conclusions: Our results emphasize the importance of epidemiology as well as of various parasite traits in determining the outcome of within-host competition. Incorporating realistic epidemiological and ecological conditions when testing theoretical models of multiple infections, as well as using a wider range of host and parasite genotypes, will enable us to better understand the course of virulence evolution.

AB  - Macroinvertebrate species composition data are often expressed as proportional abundances when assessing water-quality conditions or responses to disturbance. Proportional abundances represent the probability of belonging to one of many mutually exclusive and exhaustive groups (taxa). Proportional abundances have some unique properties that must be considered when analyzing these data: 1) the probabilities of group membership must sum to 1 and 2) a change in any 1 group affects all other groups. We used multinomial regressions to analyze changes in proportional abundances along gradients of urbanization in 9 metropolitan areas across the USA. Multinomial regression can be used to address multiple nonlinear responses simultaneously, whereas simple linear regressions must be used to analyze linear or polynomial responses of each group independently. We established that: 1) abundance ratios of tolerant and moderately tolerant groups responded consistently (3-5% increase in the ratios for every 1% increase in developed land cover in the watershed) across the urban gradient, 2) functional groups did not change significantly, and 3) ratios based on assemblage metrics were better indicators of environmental disturbance than ratios based on individual taxa. Multinomial regression, with its flexible model form, can capture patterns of species succession along a resource or stressor gradient. Our results also demonstrate that users of multinomial regression may encounter numerical problems with rare taxa, especially when these taxa have a complete separation along the gradient. Consequently, multinomial regressions are more suitable for analyzing aggregations of taxa or taxon traits.

AB  - Since the main problem of continuous energy supply from photovoltaic (PV) power plant is intermittence and inability to provide continuous energy supply, this paper proposes its hybridization with hydro energy, or with pump storage hydroelectric (PSH) as a possible solution. This creates a new type of sustainable hybrid power plant which can work continuously, using solar energy as primary energy source and water for energy storage. The characteristics of the solution as an open thermodynamic system are presented, as well as the basic theoretical settings for its application, i.e. key relationships between power and collector field area of PV power plant and working volume of upper storage. The paper introduces hydrological and hydro-energetic indicators for the hybrid plant description, "artificial rainfall", as the relationship between the water pumped into the upper water storage of the PSH (artificial water inflow) and collector field area of the PV power plant, as well as hydroenergy potential. The proposed hybrid electric power plant does not emit greenhouse gases, produce waste or significantly exploit water resources while the risks to humans and the environment are far smaller than when using conventional technology. This solution is flexible for implementation and can be applied in various climates, hydrological and physical conditions. It is especially productive in cases of joint use of solar and hydro energy where they naturally complement each other as natural energy sources in the annual working cycle. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - As one of the most active regions of land-ocean interaction among the large river deltas in the world, the Yellow River Delta (YRD) gains increasing concern on its ecological and environmental conditions. However, few studies on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been reported for this area. In this study, the distribution characteristics, probabilistic risk and possible sources of PAHs were investigated in the water column of the YRD. The PAH concentrations were found to be at relatively low or medium levels (121.3 ng L-1 in water and 209.1 ngg(-1) in suspended particulate matter (SPM) on average), and the result of probability risk assessment additionally elucidated low PAH ecological risk in the YRD. The PAH composition showed that low and moderate molecular PAHs were the major species in water phase, whearas the SPM showed a different proportion of each PAH composition. An interesting result was found that low-ring PAHs and salinity in this land-ocean interaction area had a positive relationship (R = 0.609). For PAH source identification, both diagnostic ratios of selected PAHs and principal component analysis (PCA) with multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis were studied, suggesting mixed sources of pyrogenic and petrogenic deriving PAHs in the YRD.

AB  - Sustainable management of coastal and coral reef environments requires regular collection of accurate information on recognized ecosystem health indicators. Satellite image data and derived maps of water column and substrate biophysical properties provide an opportunity to develop baseline mapping and monitoring programs for coastal and coral reef ecosystem health indicators. A significant challenge for satellite image data in coastal and coral reef water bodies is the mixture of both clear and turbid waters. A new approach is presented in this paper to enable production of water quality and substrate cover type maps, linked to a field based coastal ecosystem health indicator monitoring program, for use in turbid to clear coastal and coral reef waters. An optimized optical domain method was applied to map selected water quality (Secchi depth, Kd PAR, tripton, CDOM) and substrate cover type (seagrass, algae, sand) parameters. The approach is demonstrated using commercially available Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper image data over a coastal embayment exhibiting the range of substrate cover types and water quality conditions commonly found in sub-tropical and tropical coastal environments. Spatially extensive and quantitative maps of selected water quality and substrate cover parameters were produced for the study site. These map products were refined by interactions with management agencies to suit the information requirements of their monitoring and management programs. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Insects are an important and abundant component of the aquatic habitat. They are used as indicators of water quality and provide food for fish and birds. The composition and abundance of insect assemblages are known to change with pH. The physiological mechanisms used by insects to cope with extreme environmental pH and regulate extracellular pH are virtually unknown. Evolutionarily, the movement into water from land has consequences with respect to gas transfer, as air has 20-40 times more oxygen per unit volume than water. Two functional respiratory systems have developed within the aquatic insects to extract oxygen from water: water breathers, which use morphological gills; and air breathers, which obtain air from a bubble attached to the body or directly from the atmosphere. This article summarizes research to date pertaining to acid-base regulation in these two functional groups of aquatic insects and compares them with other aquatic ectotherms. Excretion appears capable of handling base removal in the few alkaline-water-inhabiting species studied, and ion exchange mechanisms across the integument may be involved in pH regulation of insects exposed to acid conditions. Future work should examine the use of respiratory processes in extracellular pH regulation to clarify the role different tracheal systems play in insect acid-base balance. An understanding of the mechanisms involved in acid or alkali tolerance may help in the selection of species as bioindicators of water quality.

AB  - Elevational gradients in mountains show rapid changes in environmental conditions across a small geographic extent. This results in habitat specialization in animal communities which results in changes in species composition across space. We explore changes in species and functional group composition of ants using the first ever data on the distribution of ants across an elevational gradient in the Eastern Himalaya. Ants were sampled from 600 to 2400 m elevations at 200 m intervals using Winklers and pitfall traps. The sampling yielded 166 species of ants from 10,560 individuals, which were then classified into functional groups. We used redundancy analysis to test the effects of environmental factors (temperature, leaflitter volume, understory vegetation) and spatial predictors on species as well as functional group composition of communities at different elevations. Our results show that species diversity within all functional groups decreases towards higher elevations. The functional group composition of ant communities shows a gradient from high evenness at low elevations to being dominated by opportunist species at higher elevations. Redundancy analyses shows that most of the variation in species as well as functional group composition is driven by spatially structured environmental variation. This is most likely due to the high correlation between temperature and elevation. In summary, the changes in species as well as functional group composition are likely driven by a gradient in climate across the elevation gradient.

AB  - Small-scale fishers are always expected to adapt to fishing activities that cannot be conducted all year round due to weather and fishing season. This condition, especially when it is not the fish season, makes fishers face a problem. Notwithstanding, fishermen households need to develop an adequate adaptation strategy to solve the problem of fulfilling their needs, known as coping strategies. This study aims to analyze fishermen households' coping strategies in facing the fishing season and non-fish season by using fishermen's family resources and two types of internal and external family coping strategies. The data were gathered from approximately 150 smallscale fishing households using simple random sampling. The results indicate the fishers do fishing activities in three batch: peak season (68%), mild season (20%), and off-season (12%). The use of resources for fishermen households' coping strategy is carried out by diversifying the sources of household income. Some economic activities include cultivating forest land belonging to the forest department, marine tour guides, livestock, and his wife. This study also confirm that all households use internal family coping strategies with humor indicator as the highest percentage. Accordingly, the households also adopt the external family coping strategy to deal with the existing situation. This strategy follows the local community's characteristics and culture who are friendly and open and based on religion. The household coping strategy strengthening model is generated through the synergy of formal institutional roles in society and government institutions as policymakers.

AB  - Rapid urbanization has brought about a series of resource and environmental problems in China, especially in the western areas with fragile ecological environment conditions and weak economic basis. Therefore, the sustainable development of the western regions is of great importance, and how to choose a more reasonable development path has become an urgent problem. From the theory of systems ecology, this study analyzed the metabolic structure, efficiency and evolution of development mode of a typical western city-Xining based on the ecological emergy analysis. In addition, the paper puts forward effective policy suggestions to promote sustainable development in accordance with local characteristics. The study found that the sustainability level of Xining had been declining during the study period overall from 330.85 to 15.46, but the its decline rate had been decreasing, and finally the sustainability level remained stable in the last several years. It is closely related to the ecological civilization construction and green development strategy adopted by Xining city. With the development of economy, the metabolic efficiency of Xining has been improved and the metabolic structure has gradually become more reasonable due to the decline in emergy use per GDP and escalation in emergy exchange rate. The development of Xining can provide a role model and reference for the western regions, and the study could provide scientific basis and theoretical guidance for the sustainable development of western cities.

AB  - The current study focuses on the distribution of heavy metals in 17 superficial sediments of Sfax solar saltern ponds (Tunisia) and their impacts in prokaryotic flora. The results showed significant accumulation of Pb, Zn, Cu, Ni, and Cd in sediments. Maxima of Cd, Pb, and Ni concentrations were respectively more than 500, 70 and 3 times higher than those recorded in the most worldwide heavy metals contaminated solars. Complementary statistical approaches based on correlation matrix, principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and multiple linear regression models highlight the relationship between the Bacteria and extremely halophilic Archaea and the other studied parameters (salinity, heavy metals and TOC). It was demonstrated that Bacteria and Archaea have different behaviors toward these parameters. Only, Archaea seemed to be sensitive to selected heavy metal concentrations. Their inter-pond variability rates were mainly conditioned by 'Pb, Ni and TOC' variability rates. The increase rate of Archaea was associated with an increase of Pb, Ni and TOC rates (and vice versa). However, Bacteria's variability rate dosent shows any dependence to all studied parameters. One could presume a good resistance of Archaea to Pb and Ni, probably reinforced by organic matter. Archaeal strains isolated from the most contaminated ponds were shown tolerant to high concentrations of Pb, Ni and Cd up to 2.5-4.5 mM. For Cu and Zn, the Archaea resistance levels were not, however, exceeded 1 mM.

AB  - Metals in river sediments from a semi-arid Mediterranean basin were investigated from upstream to downstream during contrasting hydrological conditions in 2014 and 2015. The level and origin of the contamination were evaluated using several geochemical and isotopic indicators. Elements were grouped by their level of contamination: high (Pb > Cd > Zn > Cu) and low (Al, Fe, Cr, Co, Ni). Multiple local sources of contamination were identified (industrial, agricultural and domestic waste), as well as very specific ones (gasoline station) and diffuse pollution from atmospheric deposition (gasoline, ores, aerosols). During storm events, the upstream dams can either be secondary sources of contamination or dilutors through particles derived from natural erosion. The contamination was slowed downstream due to the river geomorphology, but eventuallywashed into the Mediterranean Sea by intense storm events. Naturally derived elements (Co, Ni, Cr, As) were associated with Al, Fe and Mn oxides or clays, and anthropogenic originated metals with phosphorus (Cd and Zn), sulphur (Cu) and POC (Pb enrichment). Cadmium and Pb were the most available metals upstream and at the outlet, but their availability was not strictly related to their degree of contamination. These conclusions could be drawn thanks to an approach by multiple indicators. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Plant trait expression is shaped by filters, which can alter trait means and variances, theoretically driving species toward an "optimum" trait value for a set of environmental conditions. Recent research has highlighted the ubiquity of intraspecific variation in functional traits, which can cause plants to diverge from a hypothesized "optimum". We examined whether species occurring in "core" habitats (where they occur frequently, abundantly, and consistently) express traits that are nearer to "optimum", as captured by the community-weighted mean (CWM). We also asked whether trait variance showed signs of environmental filtering. We used cluster analysis to group plots based on environmental factors along a wet-to-dry ecotone. We used indicator species analysis to identify species with strong associations within each cluster. Trait means and variances were compared, and evidence of variance filtering was tested using a null-model approach. Trait means and trait variances respond to local-scale environmental filtering and species in core habitats were not necessarily nearer to the CWM than in other habitats. Intraspecific trait variability shows a strong signal of filtering, as variability was reduced for nearly all species and all traits compared to estimates of variability generated in the absence of environmental filtering. Our results provide strong evidence that species traits are not necessarily near "optimum" trait values in core habitats, and that trait distributions within species are strongly shaped by the environment. Future analyses should account for this divergence when calculating metrics of functional diversity, and extrapolating to ecosystem function.

AB  - For several decades, conventional pollen analyses have been supplemented with information provided by Non-Pollen Palynomorphs (NPP). Generally, the taxa included in this group are microalgae, fungi, insects and arachnid's chitinous remains, as well as plant debris and other organic palynomorphs of undetermined origin, that are valuable tools with which to characterise the original strata as well as the local environmental features that influence deposit formation processes. In this work, we present the results of the NPP analysis of the archaeological and palaeontological deposits of Sima del Elefante, Gran Dolina and Galeria, all of which are located in the Trinchera area (Sierra de Atapuerca, Burgos), spanning a period from 200 ka to almost 1.5 million years ago. The NPP analysis of the three deposits has provided information about the presence of decayed organic matter accumulations, erosion processes and moisture conditions. Knowledge of palynomorphs contributes to the understanding of the biological, physical and chemical dynamics that resulted in different sedimentary sequences. In almost all cases, there is a clear connection between the major stratigraphic trends established for the three deposits and the NPP assemblages identified. However, the eminently local character of the dispersion of most of the palynomorphs identified has prevented the interrelation between the three sequences analysed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

AB  - The aim of this work is to examine trends in the development of agriculture and its industries, land and primary production on the territory of the steppe zone of Stavropol region during the natural history period (1850-2016). The analysis allows us to identify the main periods of evolution of land use and environmental and economic problems, as well as measures to overcome them. Methods. The following structure "nature - society - economy" describes the analytical and mathematical models. The structure of land use is described as the system "nature - society - economy" and is reflected in the analytical and mathematical models. They provide insight into the dynamics of change in quantitative indicators (area of agricultural areas and wetlands, crop yields, basic agri-environmental data, etc.) and qualitative transformation of the latter (the presence of erosive and deflationary processes and other phenomena). In addition, careful attention is paid to the managerial decisions and activities, as well as opportunistic and market factors that influence the dynamics of the above changes during the period under review. To adjust for land development it is very important to pay attention on climatic conditions, which recently have a tendency to significant changes. Results. Analysis of economic development of the steppe areas allows to determine the structural-functional model of land use, to identify the main environmental and economic factors influencing its development. Main conclusion. This approach allows us to correct managerial decisions, stabilizing land use in the industrial sector.

AB  - Although Iran is of founders of the Ramsar Convention, there is no comprehensive information available in the country on the status of wetlands in the past or at present. There is also no specific guideline for assessing the status of wetlands in the basin of the Caspian Sea as an ecosystem with unique ecological features. The main aim of this study was to develop a new procedure called BCaspian Rapid Assessment Method" (CRAM) for assessment of wetlands at southern fringe of the Caspian Sea. To this end, 16 rapid assessment methods analyzed by US EPA in 2003 were reviewed to provide an inventory of rapid assessment indices. Excluding less important indices, the inventory was short-listed based on Delphi panelists' consensus. The CRAM was developed with 6 main criteria and 12 sub-criteria. The modified method was used to assess three important wetlands of Anzali, Boojagh and Miyankaleh at the southern border of the Caspian Sea. According to the obtained results, the highest score of 60 was assigned to the Anzali Wetland. Obtaining the scores of 56 and 47, Miyankaleh and Boojagh wetlands were ranked in the next priorities, respectively. At final stage, the accuracy of CRAM prioritization values was confirmed using the Friedman test. All of the wetlands were classified into category II, which indicates destroyed wetlands with rehabilitation potentials. In recent years, serious threats have deteriorated the wetlands from class III (normal condition) to the class II.

AB  - The accumulation behaviors and solid phase partitioning patterns of stable cesium, which have been recognized as an indicator of the long-term movement of radioactive cesium (Cs-137 or Cs-134) in ecosystems, were studied in typical and natural soils of Japanese origin, namely, red clay, leaf-mold and andosol soils. The retention and migration of soil-phase cesium have been explained relative to various factors, such as soil organic matter contents, competitive cation concentrations and the adsorption ratio of Cs to the solid phase. Cesium was adsorbed nearly quantitatively in the leaf-mold type soil, and the rate of Cs absorption increased as the particle size decreased in the red clay and andosol soils. The distributions of Cs within the soil solid phases were defined using the selective sequential extraction scheme and were used to explain its relative incorporation in the soil fractions. Solid phase fractionation indicated that nearly half of the total cesium concentrations in the soils were in the 'residual' fraction (representing the metal that was incorporated within the crystalline lattice of the soil and was difficult to extract). These findings are expected to provide information regarding suitable conditions for remediation, immobilization or the recovery of cesium from contaminated soils with excess cesium concentrations.

AB  - Tipping points are crossed when small changes in external conditions cause abrupt unexpected responses in the current state of a system. In the case of ecological communities under stress, the risk of approaching a tipping point is unknown, but its stakes are high. Here, we test recently developed critical slowing-down indicators as early-warning signals for detecting the proximity to a potential tipping point in structurally complex ecological communities. We use the structure of 79 empirical mutualistic networks to simulate a scenario of gradual environmental change that leads to an abrupt first extinction event followed by a sequence of species losses until the point of complete community collapse. We find that critical slowing-down indicators derived from time series of bio-masses measured at the species and community level signal the proximity to the onset of community collapse. In particular, we identify specialist species as likely the best-indicator species for monitoring the proximity of a community to collapse. In addition, trends in slowing-down indicators are strongly correlated to the timing of species extinctions. This correlation offers a promising way for mapping species resilience and ranking species risk to extinction in a given community. Our findings pave the road for combining theory on tipping points with patterns of network structure that might prove useful for the management of a broad class of ecological networks under global environmental change.

AB  - The recent environmental history of Bosten Lake in Xinjiang, in the arid region of continental NW China, was studied using short core sediment samples extracted from the river mouth and the deep centre of the lake. Based on chironomid stratigraphy and sediment properties, it was possible to distinguish two stages during the past century. The concentration of midge head capsules sharply decreased and the entire chironomid community was overwhelmed around the 1950s due to the rapid accumulation of sediment and the sudden increased proportion of fine grains caused by enhanced human activities (mainly population increase and the subsequent reclamation of alkaline land and agriculture intensification). Chironomus plumosus-type and Microchironomus dominated the chironomid fauna starting in the 1950s. Human activities in the catchment together with climate change exerted significant influence on the chironomid fauna, causing the near disappearance of Procladius and an increase in fine sediment. Environmental changes in the Bosten Lake catchment affected the chironomid fauna in the profundal zone much earlier than in the river mouth zone. We present a case study in order to gain a further insight into the ecological effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities on the chironomid fauna in the arid continental region of NW China. This will assist the definition of 'pre-disturbance' conditions of the lakes in this region and provide baseline information for establishing targets for the management and restoration of the lakes in this vast region.

AB  - Lake Champlain continues to experience mercury contamination resulting in public advisories to limit human consumption of top trophic level fish such as walleye. Prior research suggested that mercury levels in biota could be modified by differences in ecosystem productivity as well as mercury loadings. We investigated relationships between mercury in different trophic levels in Lake Champlain. We measured inorganic and methyl mercury in water, seston, and two size fractions of zooplankton from 13 sites representing a range of nutrient loading conditions and productivity. Biomass varied significantly across lake segments in all measured ecosystem compartments in response to significant differences in nutrient levels. Local environmental factors such as alkalinity influenced the partitioning of mercury between water and seston. Mercury incorporation into biota was influenced by the biomass and mercury content of different ecosystem strata. Pelagic fish tissue mercury was a function of fish length and the size of the mercury pool associated with large zooplankton. We used these observations to parameterize a model of mercury transfers in the Lake Champlain food web that accounts for ecosystem productivity effects. Simulations using the mercury trophic transfer model suggest that reductions of 25-75% in summertime dissolved eplimnetic total mercury will likely allow fish tissue mercury concentrations to drop to the target level of 0.3 mu g g(-1) in a 40-cm fish in all lake segments. Changes in nutrient loading and ecosystem productivity in eutrophic segments may delay any response to reduced dissolved mercury and may result in increases in fish tissue mercury.

AB  - Ocean acidification is likely to impact calcification rates in many pelagic organisms, which may in turn cause significant changes in marine ecosystem structure. We examine effects of changes in marine CaCO3 production on total alkalinity (TA) in the ocean using the global biogeochemical ocean model HAMOCC. We test a variety of future calcification scenarios because experimental studies with different organisms have revealed a wide range of calcification sensitivities to CaCO3 saturation state. The model integrations start at a preindustrial steady state in the year 1800 and run until the year 2300 forced with anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Calculated trends in TA are evaluated taking into account the natural variability in ocean carbonate chemistry, as derived from repeat hydrographic transects. We conclude that the data currently available does not allow discerning significant trends in TA due to changes in pelagic calcification caused by ocean acidification. Given different calcification scenarios, our model calculations indicate that the TA increase over time will start being detectable by the year 2040, increasing by 5-30 mu mol kg(-1) compared to the present-day values. In a scenario of extreme reductions in calcification, large TA changes relative to preindustrial conditions would have occurred at present, which we consider very unlikely. However, the time interval of reliable TA observations is too short to disregard this scenario. The largest increase in surface ocean TA is predicted for the tropical and subtropical regions. In order to monitor and quantify possible early signs of acidification effects, we suggest to specifically target those regions during future ocean chemistry surveys.

AB  - Addressing the multiple relationships among bio-physical, socio-economic, cultural, and institutional aspects is a necessary step to design policies to avoid environmental degradation at various scales. Taken as emblematic example of complex, global processes, Land Degradation (LD) needs permanent monitoring and a coherent policy strategy on integrating actions from the environmental and socio-economic side. In the Mediterranean basin, relatively few studies were devoted to assess (especially at national and sovra-national level) possible changes in the level of land Vulnerability over a long term, and even fewer tried to identify drivers that supposedly caused this process. This study evaluates vulnerability to LD in coastal Italy over twenty years (early-1980 - early-2000) by analyzing changes in fourteen variables (grouped into three partial indicators of climate, soil quality, and land use/human pressure) through a GIS-based Decision Support System. The analysis covers a coastal region falling into a buffer 10 km-wide from the sea. A multivariate analysis was applied in order to explore the relationship among variables over the investigated period. The importance of ecological and socio-economic indicators involved in LD was estimated by attributing a weight to each indicator. Results suggest that climate aridity, soil quality, and land use changes contribute differently to the spatial pattern of land vulnerability in coastal Italy. A composite index of land vulnerability was finally obtained as the variables weighted average and indicated that environmental conditions leading to LD worsen during the study period.

AB  - We used the burrowing crayfish Procambarus alleni as a model organism to compare spatial and temporal patterns of density, standing crop biomass, and size-structured productivity in the seasonal wetlands of the Florida Everglades where environmental stress has been exacerbated by hydropattern disturbance. Crayfish density was not linked to fluctuations in water temperature or dissolved oxygen and was only artifactually associated with water depth. Density and biomass within sites were similar over time but increased significantly in habitats with longer hydroperiods (duration of flooding). The effect of hydroperiod-associated habitat quality on annual crayfish production, in terms of size-structured growth and recruit production, was even more pronounced. Crayfish production in the long-hydroperiod sites was approximately two times greater than in medium-hydroperiod sites and five times greater than in short-hydroperiod sites. Turnover ratios (productivity:biomass) showed that the spatial trend in productivity consistently lagged density and biomass trends in the shorter hydroperiod habitat, indicative of population sink conditions. The long-hydroperiod sites were characterized by high productivity and appeared to function as population sources from which crayfish dispersed to nearby, often marginal, habitats. Therefore, the spatial extent and distribution of short-hydroperiod sink habitats significantly impacted crayfish density, population size structure, and productivity. Simple estimates of density or biomass that do not account for the influence of hydropattern on habitat quality may be misleading indicators of productivity because survival, growth, and reproductive output may vary substantially across disturbed landscapes.

AB  - Registration schemes for plant-protection products require applicants to assess the potential ecological risk of their products using a tiered approach. Standard aquatic ecotoxicity tests are used at lower tiers and clearly defined methodologies are available for assessing the potential environmental risks. Safety factors are incorporated into the assessment process to account for the uncertainties associated with the use of lower-tier single-species ecotoxicity studies. If lower-tier assessments indicate that a substance may pose a risk to the environment, impacts can be assessed using more environmentally realistic conditions through the use of either pond mesocosms, artificial streams or field monitoring studies. Whilst these approaches provide more realistic assessments, the results are difficult to interpret and extrapolation to other systems is problematic. Recently it has been recognised that laboratory approaches that are intermediate between standard aquatic toxicity tests and field/mesocosm studies may provide useful data and help reduce the uncertainties associated with standard single-species tests. However, limited guidance is available on what tests are available and how they can be incorporated into the risk-assessment process. This paper reviews a number of these higher-tier laboratory techniques, including modified exposure studies, species sensitivity studies, population studies and tests with sensitive life stages. Recommendations are provided on how the approaches can be incorporated into the risk-assessment process. (C) 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - In general, ectoparasitoids attack concealed hosts in protected situations whereas endoparasitoids use both concealed and exposed hosts. The difference is assumed to be the consequence of ecological constraints; ectoparasitic larvae are vulnerable both to predation and to climatic factors such as rainfall, and, hence. require some structures to protect themselves. I hypothesized that such ecological constraints should act as a within-species selection pressure to female ectoparasitoids, and hence that females should recognize the degree of concealment of the host and prefer concealed over exposed hosts for oviposition. To test this hypothesis, I examined 1) whether host concealment could influence host acceptance by the ectoparasitoid wasp Agrothereutes lanceolatus and 2) whether host concealment could influence the fitness of the offspring. Female wasps recognized and attacked (probed) both cocooned and exposed host prepupae in equal proportions, but discriminated between them after ovipositor insertion, and preferred the former For oviposition and the latter for host-feeding. They also selected to oviposit on hosts concealed in paper tubes. Thus host concealment was important for host selection in A. lanceolatus. Offspring fitness (measured as survival and size) was much lower on exposed hosts than on cocooned and paper-concealed hosts, even under laboratory conditions. Thus, host concealment influenced the fitness of wasp offspring, and, hence, is a good indicator of host quality for female wasps. Adaptiveness of host selection and host-feeding in A. lanceolatus in relation to host concealment is discussed.

AB  - Aquatic Hemiptera are barely used as "indicators" because they are considered ubiquitous organisms of great dispersal capacity and a wide range of occupied habitats. Here, we address this topic analyzing the environmental factors determining the distribution of the species found in a northeastern Moroccan basin with a strong altitudinal gradient, as well as their capability of establishing assemblages and the niche breadth for each species. Between 2014 and 2017, we sampled 55 contrasted sites representing the heterogeneity of aquatic ecosystems in the study area, where we collected a total of 27 species. The relationships between the species and environmental variables were evaluated using the STATICO methods, showing a distribution mainly influenced by the changes in flow velocity and conductivity. The Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index identified four assemblages: (a) a running species group in upper freshwater streams; (b) a middle stream group preferring less flow velocity and moderate mineralization; (c) a third group, near to the mouth, occupying moderate running or lentic brackish waters; and (d) a fourth group linked with hypersaline standing environments. The use of Indicator Species Analysis (IndVal) found few but representative species for each assemblage. The OMI applied showed that the majority of species had a high niche breadth and, consequently, a low specialization. Our results highlighted the overall poor habitat requirement and very ubiquitous character of most species found. Only some of them, mainly the endemism Aphelocheirus pemae, can be considered key for biodiversity conservation purposes because of their low niche breadth and high indicator value.

AB  - Integrated crop, livestock, and forestry systems (iCLF) have been widely heralded as a sustainable farming method in comparison to conventional pastures. However, intensive soil use and management modify ecosystem function, particularly biogeochemical cycling. The aim of this study was to determine whether there are changes in soil chemistry or biochemistry after the conversion of pasture into iCLF in the Brazilian Cerrado. Additionally, we compared three iCLF areas initiated 3, 5, and 8 years before this study to test the effect of time since conversion to iCLF (age) on soil chemistry and biochemistry and on microbial carbon (C). Conventional pasture and native Cerrado soils were used as controls. Microbial C and biochemical activity were dependent on the plant cover and age of the iCLF, but soil physicochemical properties were sensitive only to the agroecosystem type. Enzyme activity and microbial C were higher in native Cerrado soils, followed by iCLF and pasture soils, respectively. There was an inverse relationship between iCLF age and microbial C and beta-Glucosidase and phenol oxidase activities. The results suggest that the response of the microbial community depends on the soil composition and the iCLF age. Nutrient cycling in iCLF increases with age of the system and varies by management subtype within the iCLF (i.e., forestry or grazing areas). The implementation of iCLF changes soil conditions, which generates a positive response in the microbial community. The adoption of iCLF increases microbial activity and enhances soil quality over short-medium timescales (5 years).

AB  - A rare super-large fractured karst aquifer located in Zibo city, Shandong Province of Northern China was polluted by petroleum hydrocarbons from a petrochemical company. Over the last 30 years, it has been the focus of several remediation efforts. In this study, the contamination and natural attenuation characteristics of the petroleum hydrocarbons were elucidated using hydrogeochemical indicators (DO, DOC, Cl-, HCO3-, pH, NO3-, and SO42-), petroleum hydrocarbons elements and environmental isotopes (delta N-15(NO3), delta O-18(NO3), delta C-13(DIC), and delta C-13(DOC)). With the aid of GIS, statistical analyses, as well as first-order decay model and electron-acceptor-limited kinetic model, the spatio-temporal evolution characteristics of the petroleum hydrocarbons were modeled. Results showed a positive natural attenuation trend over the last 3 decades where intrinsic biodegradation mechanism was found to be the most important factor driving the degradation of hydrocarbons in the aquifer system. The hydrogeochemical association between the indicators and petroleum hydrocarbons provided the evidences of biodegradation and also served as markers, highlighting the occurrence of anaerobic respiration without methanogenic activities within the heterogenous karst media. Furthermore, the mean natural attenuation rate of petroleum hydrocarbons was calculated to be 3.76 x 10(-3)/day whereby the current highest petroleum hydrocarbons concentration (361.13 mu g/L) is estimated to be degraded completely in 6 years under the present hydrogeological and environmental conditions.

AB  - During the past years, there has been a growing interest in the bioproduction of propionic acid by Propionibacteriurn. One of the major limitations of the existing models lies in their low productivity yield. Hence, many strategies have been proposed in order to circumvent this obstacle. This article provides a comprehensive synthesis and review of important biotechnological aspects of propionic acid production as a common ingredient in food and biotechnology industries.
   We first discuss some of the most important production processes, mainly focusing on biological production. Then, we provide a summary of important propionic acid producers, including Propionibacterium freudenreichii and Propionibacterium acidipropionici, as well as a wide range of reported growth/production media. Furthermore, we describe bioprocess variables that can have impact on the production yield. Finally, we propose methods for the extraction and analysis of propionic acid and put forward strategies for overcoming the limitations of competitive microbial production from the economical point of view.
   Several factors influence the propionic acid concentration and productivity such as culture conditions, type and bioreactor scale; however, the pH value and temperature are the most important ones. Given that there are many reports about propionic acid production from glucose, whey permeate, glycerol, lactic acid, hemicelluloses, hydrolyzed corn meal, lactose, sugarcane molasses and enzymatically hydrolyzed whole wheat flour, only few review articles evaluate biotechnological aspects, i.e. bioprocess variables.

AB  - Sanitary landfills are a well-planned engineering work for final disposal of municipal solid waste in order to minimize the environmental impacts in soil and groundwater. Therefore, several control systems are installed such as liners and leachate and biogas collectors. However, the establishment of landfill in vulnerable areas, the inadequate operations, and failures in collectors and liner systems can cause subsurface contamination. The discovery of eventual leachate leakage usually is based on chemical analyses of groundwater using monitoring wells; which may not be representative in spatial terms. This work involves a geophysical monitoring of the leachate percolation in a landfill waste cell closed in 2014, in which geomembrane boreholes and aquifer contamination have been proved. The DC resistivity method was applied by means of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) in order to detect eventual contrasts in electrical properties. Twelve ERT lines have been carried out in a steady mesh during three years of study (2016, 2017, and 2018). The results of 2016 allowed a clear contrast between zones of leachate percolation into the aquifer and the natural environment. The comparative analyses of the three-year monitoring results reveal a gradual increase in resistivity values in the areas of leachate percolation. The absence of replacement of biodegradable organic matter after 2014 conditions the gradual decrease of leachate salinity. In this sense, the increase in resistivity is an indicator of the tendency for chemical stabilization of the organic waste and existence of natural attenuation processes.

AB  - Coral reefs are some of the most threatened ecosystems due to the anthropogenic activity and climate change, from which the Caribbean Sea reefs have not escaped. The objective of this paper was to assess the quality of the waters adjacent to the reefs of the Gulf of Cazones, southern Cuba, using certain microbiological and chemical indicators. Two samplings were conducted in contrasting seasons, November 2015 (winter) and April 2017 (summer), where 13 water samples were taken (five on the ridges and eight on the front reefs). The most vulnerable reefs to environmental deterioration in both seasons, taking into consideration the microbiological and chemical indicators, were Southeast of Cayo Diego Perez 2 (SE-Cy.DP2), Southeast of Cayo Diego Perez 1 (SE-Cy.DP1), and South of Cazones Cove (S-EC) (Nirvana), since they had high concentrations of heterotrophic and sulphate-reducing bacteria, vibrio, and organic matter (COD). Based on the heterotrophic bacteria concentration, the trophic state of the waters ranged from mesotrophic to meso-eutrophic and the most deteriorated site resides at the West of the Cazones cove (O-EC), followed by the East of the Cazones cove (E- EC) and South of the Cazones cove (S-EC). This indicates that the waters surrounding these reefs are enriched with organic matter, both on the ridges and on the frontal reefs. The results obtained should serve as a warning because conditions exist for the gradual deterioration of these coral reefs.

AB  - The present study focuses on Systematic Social Observation (SSO) as a method to investigate physical and social disorder at different units of analysis. The study contributes to the aggregation bias debate and to the 'social science of ecological assessment' in two ways: first, by presenting a new model that directly controls for observer bias in ecological constructs and second, by attempting to identify systematic sources of bias in SSO that affect the valid and reliable measurement of physical and social disorder at both street segments and neighborhoods.
   Data on physical disorder (e.g., litter, cigarette butts) and social disorder (e.g., loitering adults) from 1422 street segments in 253 different neighborhoods in a conurbation of the greater The Hague area (the Netherlands) are analyzed using cross-classified multilevel models.
   Neighborhood differences in disorder are overestimated when scholars fail to recognize the cross-classified data structure of an SSO study that is due to allocation of street segments to observers and neighborhoods. Not correcting for observer bias and observational conditions underestimates the disorder-crime association at street segment/grid cell level, but overestimates this association at the neighborhood level.
   Findings indicate that SSO can be used for measuring disorder at both street segment level and neighborhood level. Future studies should pay attention to observer bias prior to their data collection by selecting a minimum number of observers, offering extensive training, and collecting information on the urban background of the observers.

AB  - Bellanger S, Guillemin J-P, Bretagnolle V & Darmency H (2012). Centaurea cyanus as a biological indicator of segetal species richness in arable fields. Weed Research52, 551563. Summary Agricultural intensification has resulted in a loss of biological diversity within European agroecosystems. Biological indicator species are important tools for monitoring species diversity. The aim of this study was to determine whether cornflower, Centaurea cyanus, an arable land specialist segetal species that is easily identified in the countryside, is an appropriate indicator of weed species diversity in the Poitou-Charentes region of western France. The study zones selected were those in which C.similar to cyanus was present in agricultural fields when monitoring was conducted in both 2006 and 2007. All plant species in sample fields sown with winter crops (cereals and oilseed rape) within the study zones were then inventoried in two consecutive years: 2008 and 2009. For these winter crops, C.similar to cyanus presence was not a good indicator of overall species richness within the fields. However, C.similar to cyanus presence did correlate with the presence of other arable land specialists, herein called segetal species. Reciprocally, the presence of most other segetal species found at low frequencies in the study zones also correlated with higher segetal richness. We discuss the conditions for using C.similar to cyanus as an indicator of segetal diversity with regards to conservation and ecosystem services.

AB  - Viable ova of Ascaris lumbricoides, an indicator organism for pathogens, are frequently found in feces-derived compost produced from ecological toilets, demonstrating that threshold levels of time, temperature, pH, and moisture content for pathogen inactivation are not routinely met. Previous studies have determined that NH3 has ovicidal properties for pathogens, including Ascaris ova. This research attempted to achieve Ascaris inactivation via NH3 under environmental conditions commonly found in ecological toilets and using materials universally available in an ecological sanitation setting, including compost (feces and sawdust), urine, and ash. Compost mixed with stored urine and ash produced the most rapid inactivation, with significant inactivation observed after 2 weeks and with a time to 99% ovum inactivation (T-99) of 8 weeks. Compost mixed with fresh urine and ash achieved a T-99 of 15 weeks, after a 4-week lag phase. Both matrices had relatively high total-ammonia concentrations and pH values of >9.24 (pK(a) of ammonia). In compost mixed with ash only, and in compost mixed with fresh urine only, inactivation was observed after an 11-week lag phase. These matrices contained NH3 concentrations of 164 to 173 and 102 to 277 mg/liter, respectively, when inactivation occurred, which was below the previously hypothesized threshold for inactivation (280 mg/liter), suggesting that a lower threshold NH3 concentration may be possible with a longer contact time. Other significant results include the hydrolysis of urea to ammonia between pH values of 10.4 and 11.6, above the literature threshold pH of 10.

AB  - There is a need for sensitive bio-monitoring tools in toxicant impact assessment to indicate the effect of toxicants on fish health in polluted aquatic ecosystems. Histopathological assessment of fish tissue allows for early warning signs of disease and detection of long-term injury in cells, tissues, or organs. The aim of this study was to assess the degree of histopathological alterations in the liver of C, gariepinus from two dams in an urban nature reserve, (Gauteng, South Africa). Two dams (Dam 1 and Dam 2) were chosen for their suspected levels of toxicants. Water and sediments were sampled for metal and potential endocrine disrupting chemical analysis. A quantitative and qualitative histology-based health assessment protocol was employed to determine the adverse health effects in fish. The analysis of blood constituents, fish necropsy, calculation of condition factors, and hepatosomatic indices were employed to support the findings of the qualitative and quantitative histological assessment of liver tissue. Assessment of the liver tissue revealed marked histopathological alterations including: structural alterations (hepatic cord disarray) affecting 27% of field specimens; plasma alterations (granular degeneration 98% and fatty degeneration 25%) of hepatocytes; an increase in melanomacrophage centers (32%); hepatocyte nuclear alterations (90%); and necrosis of liver tissue (14%). The quantitative histological assessment indicated that livers of fish collected from Dam 1 were more affected than the fish livers collected from Dam 2. (C) 2008 Wiley, Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The objective of this study was to develop and apply a landscape ecology study method to a coastal promontory, aiming to understand the processes that involve its formation and its maintenance. This research related the spatial structure of the landscape and the dynamics of tree species (model-species) considered climax indicators of the Atlantic Rainforest and its potentials dispersors (key-species). The study was focused of the Morraria da Praia Vermelha, municipality of Penha, Santa Catarina). The model-species observed were: Ocotea catharinensis, Firola bicuhyba, Copaifera trapeziflia, Cabralea canjerana and Euterpe edulis. Key-species were: Ortalis squamata, Ramphastos dicolorus, Melanerpes flavifrons, Myiodynastes maculatus, Pitangus sulphuratus, Turdus rufiventris, Platycichla_flavipes and Thraupis sayaca. The situation of the area, considered a coastal fragment for its natural geomorphology, is intensified by the anthropic pressure, resembling it as a vegetation island. On one side it is limited by the Atlantic Ocean and on the other by the quaternary plain. It was observed that model-species are rare, resulting from a selective removal of trees, bird fauna reduction and adverse soil and topographical conditions, together with the distance observed among patches. The situation is further adverse because of the inexistence of connectivity of this area with other habitat fragments. If the adoption of environmental policies does not come soon to consider the restoration, fiscalization and environment education to stop hunting and further fragmentation, the expected trend is a loss of the biodiversity still existing on the studied environment.

AB  - Anticholinesterases constitute a major portion of modern synthetic insecticides and the assessment of cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition is widely used as a specific biomarker for evaluating the exposure of non-target organisms to these pollutants. To evaluate the possible exposure of the North Adriatic sea coastal environment to residues of agriculture practices, we ascertained whether the oyster, Ostrea edulis and the clam, Tapes philippinarum, highly valuable resources commercially harvested in the area, could be selected as sentinel species. We characterized the ChE biochemical properties in their gills, and for comparison the analysis was carried out also in gills of the mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis, extensively used as a biological indicator of water quality. In the oysters and mussels, the ChE activity was a function of increasing concentrations of substrate in the range 0.01-0.5 mM. K-m values were 93 +/- 15 and 77 +/- 8 muM for O. edulis and M. galloprovincialis, respectively No detectable ChE activity was found in gills of T philippinarum, at any tested condition. Significant inhibition of ChE activity by eserine, carbaryl, and ethyl-paraoxon was observed in gills of O. edulis and M. galloprovincialis. Although field validation is needed, the present study suggests that O. edulis may be employed as a biological indicator for assessing pesticide contamination, whilst T philippinarum does not seem useful for this purpose.

AB  - Microtox(R) assay was used to assess the natural toxicity of two sponges, Dysidea avara and Ircinia variabilis. The activity of crude extracts and major metabolites were compared. Methanol extract of D. avara was more toxic than that of acetone and was as toxic as pure avarol, thus suggesting that the toxicity of the sponge was mainly due to this metabolite. We also quantified palinurin, the major metabolite of I. variabilis, in specimens from several habitats. With the same methanol extracts used for palinurin quantification, we ran the Microtox(R) assay and found a positive significant regression between toxicity and concentration of this metabolite. Pure palinurin was tested at the same concentration present in the extract, and the toxicity recorded was higher than that of the methanol extract. As with avarol from D. avara, palinurin is the main secondary metabolite that confers toxicity to I. variabilis. The results confirm that the standardized Microtox(R) assay is an accurate and reproducible tool for assessing the toxicity of crude extracts and pure metabolites of marine organisms. These results also suggest that methanol is more suitable than acetone for the detection of species toxicity by Microtox(R). The method is faster and easier to perform than chemical quantification even when the sponge chemistry is known, and is appropriate for studies on variation in natural toxicity over a range of environmental conditions.

AB  - Soil erosion is a major environmental issue in Australia. It reduces land productivity and has off-site effects of decreased water quality. Broad-scale spatially distributed soil erosion estimation is essential for prioritising erosion control programs and as a component of broader assessments of natural resource condition. This paper describes spatial modelling methods and results that predict sheetwash and rill erosion over the Australian continent using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) and spatial data layers for each of the contributing environmental factors. The RUSLE has been used before in this way but here we advance the quality of estimation. We use time series of remote sensing imagery and daily rainfall to incorporate the effects of seasonally varying cover and rainfall intensity, and use new digital maps of soil and terrain properties. The results are compared with a compilation of Australian erosion plot data, revealing an acceptable consistency between predictions and observations. The modelling results show that: (1) the northern part of Australia has greater erosion potential than the south; (2) erosion potential differs significantly between summer and winter; (3) the average erosion rate is 4.1 t/ha. year over the continent and about 2.9 x 10(9) tonnes of soil is moved annually which represents 3.9% of global soil erosion from 5% of world land area; and (4) the erosion rate has increased from 4 to 33 times on average for agricultural lands compared with most natural vegetated lands.

AB  - Comprehensive, integrative assessments of coastal sediment quality are best effected by using large, diverse data sets that include measures of biological dysfunction observed in association with chronic exposure to sediment contaminants. Under the auspices of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Status and Trends Program, the National Benthic Surveillance Project accumulated a database of synoptic sediment contaminant concentrations and indices of biological effects that were measured in indigenous animals collected during field surveys conducted from 1984 to 1994. This compilation of data provided the opportunity to develop a new approach for determining sediment quality criteria to add to the current repertoire of environmental assessment tools. Using a two-segment hockey stick regression, statistically significant chemical thresholds of biological effects were estimated for hepatic lesion prevalences in English sole (Pleuronectes vetulus, formerly Parophrys vetulus) in relation to sediment concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. These threshold estimates are notably lower than many of those reported for other techniques. Application of this relatively simple dose-response model to subacute, chronic effects that are involved in hepatocarcinogenesis and associated with sediment toxicant content (1) reflects the link between toxicopathic disease progression and conditions observed in benthic fish exposed to contaminants and (2) provides endpoints for assessing sediment quality contaminant concentrations that are not necessarily acutely fatal but may have long-term health implications for populations that are chronically exposed.

AB  - Coliphages have been reported as promising indicators of viral inactivation in waste-water treatment.  Their use in different aquatic environments, however, needs characterization prior to their application.  The study of the behavior of coliphages in chilean stabilization ponds is reported.  The experimental system was a discontinuous reactor, subjected to the natural different climate conditions.  Chile is a temperate country and this study concentrated on the significantly different behavior of ponds during summer and fall seasons.  Coliphages counts using Escherichia coli C (ATCC 13706) as host were compared to most probable number fecal coliforms, Salmonella, and fecal streptococci.  The results indicate that coliphages were more resistant to pond treatment than fecal coliforms and Salmonella.  Furthermore, coliphages did not reflect climate changes as much as enteric bacteria did, as coliphage die-off rates during warm and cold seasons were 0.5 and 0.3 (K(b), day-1).  Summer die-off rates of fecal coliforms (2.0, K(b), day-1) and Salmonella (1.7, K(b), day-1) drastically fell (0.6, K(b), day-1) in the fall.  Coliphages and fecal streptococci removal tended to be similar, especially in cold season.  It was observed that environmental factors, pH, dissolved oxygen, and algae biomass equally affected removal of all indicators, to different extents.  These results suggest that to assess the microbiological efficiency of stabilization ponds, coliphages and fecal coliforms should be considered, as the first represents viral removal while the second represents pathogenic bacterial removal.  Both parameters complement each other, particularly when important weather changes are expected.

AB  - Soil microbial communities perform vital ecosystem functions, such as the decomposition of organic matter to provide plant nutrition. However, despite the functional importance of soil microorganisms, attribution of ecosystem function to particular constituents of the microbial community has been impeded by a lack of information linking microbial function to community composition and structure. Here, we propose a function-first framework to predict how microbial communities influence ecosystem functions. We first view the microbial community associated with a specific function as a whole and describe the dependence of microbial functions on environmental factors (e.g., the intrinsic temperature dependence of bacterial growth rates). This step defines the aggregate functional response curve of the community. Second, the contribution of the whole community to ecosystem function can be predicted, by combining the functional response curve with current environmental conditions. Functional response curves can then be linked with taxonomic data in order to identify sets of "biomarker" taxa that signal how microbial communities regulate ecosystem functions. Ultimately, such indicator taxa may be used as a diagnostic tool, enabling predictions of ecosystem function from community composition. In this paper, we provide three examples to illustrate the proposed framework, whereby the dependence of bacterial growth on environmental factors, including temperature, pH, and salinity, is defined as the functional response curve used to interlink soil bacterial community structure and function. Applying this framework will make it possible to predict ecosystem functions directly from microbial community composition.

AB  - Microbial-mediated iron (Fe) oxidation and reduction greatly contribute to the biogeochemistry and mineralogy of ecosystems. However, knowledge regarding the composition and distribution patterns of iron redox cycling bacteria in peatlands remains limited. Here, using high-throughput sequencing, we compared biogeographic patterns and assemblies of the iron redox cycling bacterial community between soil and water samples obtained from different types of peatland across four regions in Northeast China. A total of 48 phylotypes were identified as potential iron redox bacteria, which had greater than 97% similarity with Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) and Fe(III)-reducing bacteria (FeRB). Among them, Rhodoferax, Clostridium, Geothrix, Sideroxydans, Geobacter, Desulfovibrio, and Leptothrix could be used as bioindicators in peatlands for characterizing different hydrological conditions and nutrient demands. Across all samples, bacterial communities associated with iron redox cycling were mainly affected by pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and Fe2+. Distance-decay relationship (DDR) analysis indicated that iron redox cycling bacterial communities in soil, but not in water, were highly correlated with geographic distance. Additionally, null model analysis revealed that stochastic processes substituted deterministic processes from minerotrophic fens to ombrotrophic bogs in soils, whereas deterministic processes were dominant in water. Overall, these observations suggest that bacteria involved in iron redox cycling are widespread in diverse habitats and exhibit distinct patterns of distribution and community assembly mechanisms between soil and water in peatlands.

KW  - Ecosystem services assessment
KW  - NATURES CONTRIBUTIONS
AB  - There have been several pleas for more inclusive ecosystem services assessments in recent years. This is partially due to a growing consensus about the importance of incorporating value pluralism into ecosystem services assessments. While there is increasingly attention for such value pluralism in academia and at the IPBES science policy interface, this concern barely reached many conservation practitioners, as indicated in studies reviewing decision support tools for ecosystem services. We examined six review studies of such tools and this revealed there is indeed little attention for value pluralism and only a part of the tools provides the conceptual space to incorporate value pluralism. The growing scientific and science-policy consensus that recognizing value pluralism is key for inclusive assessments can only be translated in actions if there is a connection to the field. Users of ecosystem services assessment tools should have the opportunity to select value-inclusive tools, as this can lead to a stronger support base for conservation actions, prevent conflict, and lead to more comprehensive ecosystem services assessments. This does not imply that all tools need to focus on values; the actual goal of a specific ecosystem services assessment tool is context-specific. If scientists want the plural valuation debate to have an impact on conservation practices, three conditions need to be fulfilled: (i) developing value-inclusive decision-support tools; (ii) clarifying when to use value inclusive tools; and (iii) learning from and sharing of value-inclusive tools.

AB  - To transition to a sustainable society, every local government needs to properly recognize, measure, and publish the current situation in their administrative division. This study conducted eco-efficiency assessment of activities carried out at the local level around the world based on the economic value and environmental load indicators in one year (2015). The assessment's target areas were the administrative divisions of 42 countries that were mainly OECD members. The economic value was the Gross Regional Product (GRP), and the environmental load was calculated based on LIME3, an endpoint-type and global-scale Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) method that can calculate the assessment results in monetary units (the "eco-index USD"). The indicator for eco-efficiency (dimensionless) was quantitatively defined by dividing the monetary units of the eco-index USD by the GRP in each area. The assessment results show that the average eco-efficiency value in all areas of the 42 countries was 30.2. Of these countries, the major cities (administrative division unit) with the top-three values include Paris (213.1), London (154.3), and Dublin (141.8). The results for each division were visualized on graphs and maps in order to understand their positions from environmental and economic perspectives. No such assessment has ever been conducted at the local level and under the same conditions globally. This study provides insights that contributes to the establishment of a standard methodology for local governments' environmental accounting.

AB  - Biological stability is an essential parameter for assessing the environmental impact from the land application of digestate as organic amendment. In this paper, a newindicator, biological denitrification potential (BDP), was developed for evaluating the biological stability of digestate. Digestate samples collected along the digestion process from a mesophilic anaerobic batch digester fed with food waste were investigated under different solid retention time. The value of BDP based on nitrate removal ranged from176.3 to 48.3mg-N/g-VSdigestate, corresponding well to the digestion time, and strongly correlated with total organic carbon content. Evolution trends similar to respiration index (RI) and biochemical methane potential (BMP) can be also observed for BDP, indicating that values presented of these stability indices decreased with the degree of digestate stabilization. The mass balance of the BDP process indicated that nitrate was mainly converted into N-2 gas with mineralizing organic carbon from digestate, implying that biostability evaluated by BDP depends on carbon source and denitrification activity in digestate. The denitrifying bacteria Thiopseudomonas and Pseudomonas accounted for the majority of microorganisms. These findings of this study concluded that BDP can be an efficient indicator to assess the bio-stability of digestate planned for agricultural or land use. Compared with the existing biostability index, BDP has the additional advantage of no exogenous inoculum addition, homogenous test condition and possibility of shortening incubation time.

AB  - Instability of slope soils under varying nature is one of the serious concerns in geotechnical engineering. Microbial induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) is a recently emerged, biological ground improvement technique, and that has the potential to enhance the shear strength, modify the surface conditions and promote the stability of deposits. This paper presents the experimental works conducted to investigate the durability and shear responses of MICP treated slope soil, demonstrating the feasibility of technique as potential alternative for slope soil stabilization. The first objective is to investigate the freeze-thaw (FT) response of MICP specimens, because FT cycles can affect the aggregate stability in regions with seasonal frost, which in turn impacts runoff and erosion in slopes. FT tests were performed as a credible indicator of durability, and the subjected specimens were monitored nondestructively (mass loss, S-wave, P-wave velocities). Secondly, shear tests were performed, and effective strength properties were analyzed at peak and residual states. FT test results suggest that contact cementation provides additional resistive forces in slope soil against progressive expansion of pore water during FT; however, aggregate stability is attributed to adequate cementation level which facilitates effective particle contacts. Shear test results indicate that MICP has influence on friction and cohesion parameters. However, the residual strength is mainly contributed by friction angle, only a minor effect from cohesion.

AB  - Desertification often occurs in fragile steppe ecosystems, which may lead to severe soil degradation. Understanding how soil microbial communities respond to desertification is critical for ecological restoration of degraded desert steppes. We used an Ion S5 (TM) XL sequencing platform to explore the soil bacterial community succession across four desertification stages in a desert steppe in Ningxia, China. The results showed that soils from potential to light desertification stage had similar physicochemical properties, whereas significantly lower macronutrients, silt, and clay contents and higher pH, moisture, and sand contents were observed in the severe and very severe stages . Due to change in soil conditions, bacterial communities shifted drastically across the four stages. Variation in bacterial community composition was driven mainly by the deterministic processes (i.e., habitat filtering based on resource availability and space limitations), but their effects decreased toward the very severe desertification stage. More potential indicator species including members of the genera Nitrosomonas, Pirellula, and Methylobacterium were selected to predict very severe desertification relative to the other three stages. These potential indicators could survive in a wide range of habitats with low availability of carbon and nitrogen sources. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that most of soil microorganisms might form symbiotic relationships in response to the habitat heterogeneity caused by desertification. In conclusion, as desertification intensified, distinct shifts in soil bacterial communities were driven primarily by the deterministic processes, which provide new insights for the restoration of degraded habitats and sustainable development of land resources.

AB  - Adverse social conditions have been linked to a conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA) in circulating leukocytes that may contribute to social gradients in disease. However, the CNS mechanisms involved remain obscure, in part because CTRA gene-expression profiles often track external social-environmental variables more closely than they do self-reported internal affective states such as stress, depression, or anxiety. This study examined the possibility that variations in patterns of natural language use might provide more sensitive indicators of the automatic threat- detection and -response systems that proximally regulate autonomic induction of the CTRA. In 22,627 audio samples of natural speech sampled from the daily interactions of 143 healthy adults, both total language output and patterns of function-word use covaried with CTRA gene expression. These language features predicted CTRA gene expression substantially better than did conventional self-report measures of stress, depression, and anxiety and did so independently of demographic and behavioral factors (age, sex, race, smoking, body mass index) and leukocyte subset distributions. This predictive relationship held when language and gene expression were sampled more than a week apart, suggesting that associations reflect stable individual differences or chronic life circumstances. Given the observed relationship between personal expression and gene expression, patterns of natural language use may provide a useful behavioral indicator of nonconsciously evaluated well-being (implicit safety vs. threat) that is distinct from conscious affective experience and more closely tracks the neurobiological processes involved in peripheral gene regulation.

AB  - The aging of metals added to soil is significant in ecological risk assessment and the derivation of soil environmental quality criteria. Semimechanistic aging models have been developed for some metals, but not for zinc (Zn). In the present study, a published dataset detailing the changes in isotopic exchangeability with time, after water-soluble Zn was added to 23 soils and incubated for 813 d, was used to analyze the effect of soil properties on aging and develop empirical and mechanistic models. Aging was mainly controlled by soil pH, probably because of precipitation, and was linearly correlated with the square root of incubation time, probably as a result of diffusion. Based on precipitation, diffusion, and/or occlusion, semimechanistic aging models were developed using a Zn hydrolysis constant of 6.52 to 6.61, apparent diffusion rate coefficient (D/r(2)) of 1.41x10(-5)/d, and a root mean square error of less than 15%. The optimized models were accurately validated by 4 independent field-incubated soils, with different doses of Zn under different conditions (the differences between measured and predicted isotopically exchangeable Zn were less than 10%). This enabled an understanding of the long-term behavior of Zn added to soils, and the results can be used for environmental risk assessments and the normalization of ecotoxicity datasets in the derivation of soil environmental quality criteria.

AB  - This paper deals with the impact of mining on the environment. Coal mining is still among the most widespread and most intense mining activity, which disturbs the landscape around us bringing regional environmental, economic and aesthetic problems. However, for many countries in the world, including the Czech Republic, deposits of raw materials play an important role, especially for purposes of producing electricity and thermal energy. At the same time, growing emphasis laid on the environmental protection can be observed worldwide. To meet the increasing ecological demands, it is reasonable to consider the most significant aspects of mining activities from the environmental point of view, as well as to consider the possibilities of the abandoned mines utilization as possible waste dumps. Parts of this problem consist in: the monitoring, environmental impacts assessment of exploration and mining activities and waste disposal mining, which may significantly contribute to the environmental protection in the future. Several parameters that can significantly affect the usability of the waste disposal mining, such as geological structure, hydro-geological conditions, material composition and physical and mechanical properties of rocks are discussed in detail in this work.
   The article also includes a practical example of Environmental Impact Assessment process for the particular activity of OKD stock company, which is the only producer of hard coal (bituminous coal) in the Czech Republic. Its coal is mined in the southern part of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin - in the Ostrava-Karvina coal district.

AB  - The implementation of adaptation actions in local conservation management is a new and complex task with multiple facets, influenced by factors differing from site to site. A transdisciplinary perspective is therefore required to identify and implement effective solutions. To address this, the International Conference on Managing Protected Areas under Climate Change brought together international scientists, conservation managers, and decision-makers to discuss current experiences with local adaptation of conservation management. This paper summarizes the main issues for implementing adaptation that emerged from the conference. These include a series of conclusions and recommendations on monitoring, sensitivity assessment, current and future management practices, and legal and policy aspects. A range of spatial and temporal scales must be considered in the implementation of climate-adapted management. The adaptation process must be area-specific and consider the ecosystem and the social and economic conditions within and beyond protected area boundaries. However, a strategic overview is also needed: management at each site should be informed by conservation priorities and likely impacts of climate change at regional or even wider scales. Acting across these levels will be a long and continuous process, requiring coordination with actors outside the "traditional" conservation sector. To achieve this, a range of research, communication, and policy/legal actions is required. We identify a series of important actions that need to be taken at different scales to enable managers of protected sites to adapt successfully to a changing climate.

AB  - Background: Alcohol consumption of college students has a fluctuating nature, which might impact the measurement of intervention effects. By using 25 follow-up time-points, this study tested whether intervention effects are robust or might vary over time.
   Methods: Data were used from a two-arm parallel group randomized controlled trial applying ecological momentary assessment (EMA) with 30 data time-points in total. Students between 18 and 24 years old who reported heavy drinking in the past six months and who were ready to change their alcohol consumption were randomly assigned to the experimental (n = 456: web-based brief alcohol intervention) and control condition (n = 451: no intervention). Outcome measures were weekly alcohol consumption, frequency of binge drinking, and heavy drinking status.
   Results: According to the intention-to-treat principle, regression analyses revealed that intervention effects on alcohol consumption varied when exploring multiple follow-up time-points. Intervention effects were found for a) weekly alcohol consumption at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 weeks follow-up, b) frequency of binge drinking at 1, 2, 7, and 12 weeks follow-up, and c) heavy drinking status at 1, 2, 7, and 16 weeks follow-up.
   Conclusions: This research showed that the commonly used one and six month follow-up time-points are relatively arbitrary and not using EMA might bring forth erroneous conclusions on the effectiveness of interventions. Therefore, future trials in alcohol prevention research and beyond are encouraged to apply EMA when assessing outcome measures and intervention effectiveness.

AB  - Water availability and salt excess are limiting factors in Mexican mixed pine-oak forest. In order to characterise the acclimatation of native species to these stresses, leaf water (Psi(w)) and osmotic potentials (Psi(s)) of Juniperus flaccida, Pinus pseudostrobus and Quercus canbyi were measured under natural drought and non-drought conditions under two different aspects in the Sierra Madre Oriental. Factorial ANOVA revealed significant differences in Psi(w) and Psi(s) between two aspects, species and sampling dates. In general, all species showed high predawn and low midday values that declined progressively with increasing drought and soil-water loss. Seasonal and diurnal fluctuation of Psi(w) and Psi(s) were higher for J. flaccida and Q. canbyi than for P. pseudostrobus. Leaf Psi(w) and Psi(s) were mainly correlated with soil water content, while Psi(s) of P. pseudostrobus were hardly correlated with environmental variables. Thus, species have different strategies to withstand drought. P. pseudostrobus was identified as a species with isohydric water status regulation, while J. flaccida and Q. canbyi presented water potential patterns typical for anisohydric species. The type of water status regulation may be a critical factor for plant survival and mortality in the context of climate change. Nevertheless, for precise conclusions about the advantages and disadvantages of each type, further long-term investigations are required.

AB  - Fecal bacteria have traditionally been used as indicator organisms to monitor the quality of recreational waters. Recent work has questioned the robustness of traditional indicators, particularly at seawater bathing beaches. For example, a study of Florida beaches found unexpectedly high abundances of Escherichia coli, fecal coliforms, and enterococci in beach sand. The aim of the present study was to explain these abundances by assessing the survival of E coli and enterococci in beach sand relative to seawater. We used a combination of quantitative laboratory mesocosm experiments and field observations. Results suggested that E coli and enteroccocci exhibited increased survivability and growth in sand relative to seawater. Because fecal bacteria are capable of replicating in sand, at least under controlled laboratory conditions, the results suggest that sand may be an important reservoir of metabolically active fecal organisms. Experiments with "natural" mesocosms (i.e., unsterilized sand or water rich in micropredators and native bacteria) failed to show the same increases in fecal indicators as was found in sterile sand. It is postulated that this was due to predation and competition with indigenous bacteria in these "natural" systems. Nonetheless, high populations of indicators were maintained and recovered from sand over the duration of the experiment as opposed to the die-off noted in water. Indicator bacteria may wash out of sand into shoreline waters during weather and tidal events, thereby decreasing the effectiveness of these indicators as predictors of health risk and complicating the interpretations for water quality managers.

AB  - Humans are frequently exposed to mixtures of environmental pollutants at low levels over prolonged periods of time yet most toxicity studies deal with acute exposure to high concentrations of single chemicals. Investigation of the biological effects and possible toxic interactions during long-term exposure to such mixtures is warranted. Here Jurkat T-cells were exposed to toluene, n-hexane and methyl ethyl ketone in binary combination. Concentration ranges were centered on thresholds at which the individual agents caused cell toxicity under otherwise similar conditions, and concentrations were confirmed by headspace gas chromatography. After 5 days cells were harvested and toxicity measured in terms of membrane damage (lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] leakage), perturbations in [Ca2+](i) and changes in glutathione redox status. Data for all three endpoints were subjected to isobolographic analysis to test for interaction between components of the solvent mixture. Almost all combinations of toluene and n-hexane elicited greater than additive toxicity in terms of each of the three endpoints, as did methyl ethyl ketone (MEK)/n-hexane and MEK/toluene combinations for the LDH and glutathione endpoints. The main exceptions were the two combinations involving MEK, which caused less than additive effects on perturbations of [Ca2+](i). It is concluded that toxicity in immune-derived T cells may exhibit greater than additive effects when there is coexposure to organic solvents. This may have implications for risk assessment of environmental exposure to these agents.

AB  - High levels of ambient air pollution are associated in humans with aggravation of asthma and of respiratory and cardiopulmonary morbidity; long-term exposures to particulate matter (PM) have been linked to possible increases in lung cancer risk, chronic respiratory disease, and increased death rates. The Biodiagnostics Group of the DLR Institute of Aerospace Medicine develops cellular test systems capable of monitoring the biological consequences of environmental conditions on humans already on cellular and molecular level. Such bioassays rely on the receptor-reporter principle, where cell lines are transfected with plasmids carrying a reporter gene under control of environment-dependent promoters (receptor), which play a key role in regulating gene expressions in response to extracellular signals. We developed the recombinant human lung epithelial cell line A549-NF-kappa B-EGFP/Neo carrying a genetically encoded fluorescent indicator for monitoring activation of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway in living cells in response to genotoxic and cytotoxic environmental influences. With this cell line we screened several candidate human radiation-responsive genes (GADD45 beta, CDKN1A) and NF-kappa B-.dependent genes (IL-6, NF kappa BIA, and pNF-kappa B-EGFP) for gene expression changes by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay, using cDNA obtained from total RNA isolated at various time points after exposure to combustion generated nano-sized particle samples.

AB  - The 5.5 m thick Dynow Marlstone in well Oberschauersberg 1 in the Upper Austrian Molasse Basin was studied using mineral and maceral petrography, SEM, organic geochemistry, and C- and N-isotopy of the organic material. The well is located on the former upper slope of the northern basin margin. The depositional period of the Dynow Marlstone covers parts of the Early Oligocene nannoplankton Zone NP23, which corresponds to the culmination of the first Paratethys isolation. The Dynow Marlstone represents a carbonate-rich, organic-poor interval (0.5-2 % TOC) intercalated between organic-rich formations. The onset of the deposition of the Dynow Marlstone was characterized by an abrupt increase in primary carbonate productivity, but persisting photic zone anoxia. Both high organic carbon productivity and photic zone anoxia prevailed during deposition of the Dynow Marlstone. These constant conditions were overprinted by cyclic increases in the trophic level favouring blooms of calcareous nannoplankton. Limestones with low TOC contents were deposited during algal blooms, whereas organic-rich marls accumulated during periods with low production of calcareous nannoplankton. Sulphate reduction extended into the water column. The intensive consumption of labile organic material decreased the hydrogen index. Intensified photic zone anoxia and an increase in salinity worsened the ecological environment for calcareous nannoplankton and led to deposition of the organic-rich marls of the Eggerding Formation within a constantly eutrophic and normal-marine environment.

AB  - Ovarian inactivity has been identified in captive African (Loxodonta africana) and Asian (Elephas maximus) elephants and is thought to be mediated in part by social influences. Thus, a survey was conducted to determine how behavior and dominance status relate to each other and to ovarian cyclicity. For both Asian and African elephants, dominance status was positively correlated with relative size, age, temperament, disciplinary nature, and willingness to share novel objects. Relative size and temperament were also related to disciplinary nature toward herdmates. Behavior toward keepers was a good indicator of the willingness of elephants to follow commands, whereas sharing novel objects was positively correlated with object curiosity. Finally, dominance status, temperament, and disciplinary nature were all correlated with willingness to share. Comparisons of ovarian cyclicity status with behavior rankings were conducted only for African elephants because of the low number of noncycling Asian elephants surveyed. Overall, social status appeared to be the best predictor of ovarian activity in African elephants. Noncycling African elephant females ranked higher in the dominance hierarchy and gave more discipline to herdmates than cycling cohorts. It remains to be determined whether these are cause or effect relationships, but clearly it is important to understand how physical and social attributes impact physiological processes, such as reproduction. Captive management now needs to focus on optimizing social and environmental conditions to maximize reproductive potential in elephants. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The uses of many of the soils of Central Spain have changed and these changes have led frequently to the decline of natural plant cover. In this paper we report on the organic matter fractions and the microbial activity of soils developed from different substrates (limestone and granites) in relation to plant cover decline, Specific indicators of microbial activity (microbial biomass carbon (MBC), basal respiration, and some oxidoreductase and hydrolase activities) were measured. These indicators decreased in value in both limestone and acid soils where plant cover had declined (from climax, tree forest, to low bush); a similar effect was observed in the labile organic matter fractions (water soluble carbon (WSC), water soluble carbohydrates and polyphenolic compounds). For some measures of microbiological activity (e.g. MBC and soil respiration) the differences in acid soils were lower than in limestone soils. For example, MBC values in limestone soils ranged from 1426 ngC g(-1) in tree forest to 498 ngC g(-1) in low bush; while in acid soils, these values ranged from 428 ngC g(-1) in tree forest to 265 ngC g(-1) in low bush. Acid soils, unlike the limestone soils, showed no relationship between plant cover decline and hydrolase activities related to the N cycle (urease and protease). In general, soil microbial activity was negatively affected by plant cover degradation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - While the relationship between aggregate renewables and economic growth has been extensively studied, the literature lacks examinations assessing the responses of economic and environmental indicators to geothermal energies. This caveat turns critical when the second largest geothermal energy producer worldwide remains also overlooked. This paper seeks to fill these above-mentioned gaps and proposes the first assessment of the dynamic interactions between coal energy consumption, geothermal energy consumption, industry value added and carbon emissions in the Philippines. Having provided a state-of-the-art review of the subject, our econometric procedure applies the F-Bounds test, the Autoregressive Distributed Lags and the Pairwise Granger causality test. Results support the existence of a bidirectional link among geothermal energy and aggregate income, congruent with the feedback hypothesis. Also, industry value added is found to drive coal consumption, and vice versa. Finally, geothermal energy and coal reveal a counter-intuitive positive and negative impact on carbon pollution on the short- and long-run, respectively. These results relate to the structure of the electricity supply largely dominated by fossil fuels in the Philippines and emphasize the need to further deploy geothermal energies. To meet the booming power demand from manufacturers, it is thus crucial to set up the conditions for scale effects and efficiency gains in the geothermal industry.

AB  - Urban areas are major consumers of environmental resources and thus often place unsustainable demands on natural resources. As half of the world's population (55%) lives in urban areas, the environmental degradation produced by cities threatens the health and quality of life of a fair share of the world's population. For these reasons, progress towards sustainable urban development must be monitored and measured through suitable indicators. With reference to the assessment of air quality as a specific dimension of environmental quality in urban areas, existing studies have introduced various methodologies that mostly focus on objective measures (typically, exposure to outdoor air pollutants) while neglecting measures based on individual perceptions. Our goal is to contribute to filling this gap. To this end, we explore the relationship between objective and subjective measures of urban air quality in European countries. While the objective indicator is based on concentrations of PM2.5, our subjective indicator is reconstructed from individual perceptions collected through the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) sample survey. Finally, through a cluster analysis, we classify the countries into homogeneous groups based on the values of these indicators. Our analysis reveals several differences in the country rankings according to the two indicators. For one group of countries, both approaches converge, thus leading to more definitive conclusions. For other countries, the mismatch between the two indicators suggests that either approach alone is not able to capture the full picture on air quality in urban environments.

AB  - Ecology is often governed by nonlinear dynamics. Nonlinear ecological relationships can include thresholds-incremental changes in drivers that provoke disproportionately large ecological responses. Among the species that experience nonlinear and threshold dynamics are Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.). These culturally, ecologically, and economically significant fishes are in many places declining and management focal points. Often, managers can influence or react to ecological conditions that salmon experience, suggesting that nonlinearities, especially thresholds, may provide opportunities to inform decisions. However, nonlinear dynamics are not always invoked in management decisions involving salmon. Here, we review reported nonlinearities and thresholds in salmon ecology, describe potential applications that scientists and managers could develop to leverage nonlinear dynamics, and offer a path toward decisions that account for ecological nonlinearities and thresholds to improve salmon outcomes. It appears that nonlinear dynamics are not uncommon in salmon ecology and that many management arenas may potentially leverage them to enable more effective or efficient decisions. Indeed, decisions guided by nonlinearities and thresholds may be particularly desirable considering salmon management arenas are often characterized by limited resources and mounting ecological stressors, practical constraints, and conservation challenges. More broadly, many salmon systems are data-rich and there are an extensive range of ecological contexts in which salmon are sensitive to anthropogenic decisions. Approaches developed to leverage nonlinearities in salmon ecology may serve as examples that may inform analogous approaches in other systems and taxa.

AB  - Coccolithophores are a key functional phytoplankton group and produce minute calcite plates (coccoliths) in the sunlit layer of the pelagic ocean. Coccoliths significantly contribute to the sediment record since the Triassic and their geometry have been subject to palaeoceanographic and biological studies to retrieve information on past environmental conditions. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of coccolith, coccosphere and cell volume data of the Southern OceanEmiliania huxleyiecotype A, subject to gradients of temperature, irradiance, carbonate chemistry and macronutrient limitation. All tested environmental drivers significantly affect coccosphere, coccolith and cell volume with driver-specific sensitivities. However, a highly significant correlation emerged between cell and coccolith volume withV(coccolith) = 0.012 +/- 0.001 * V-cell + 0.234 +/- 0.066 (n = 23,r(2) = .85,p < .0001,sigma(est) = 0.127), indicating a primary control of coccolith volume by physiological modulated changes in cell volume. We discuss the possible application of fossil coccolith volume as an indicator for cell volume/size and growth rate and, additionally, illustrate that macronutrient limitation of phosphorus and nitrogen has the predominant influence on coccolith volume in respect to other environmental drivers. Our results provide a solid basis for the application of coccolith volume and geometry as a palaeo-proxy and shed light on the underlying physiological reasons, offering a valuable tool to investigate the fossil record of the coccolithophoreE. huxleyi.

AB  - Changes in bottom-up forcing are fundamental drivers of fish population dynamics. Recent literature has highlighted the need to incorporate the role of dynamic environmental conditions in stock assessments as a key step towards adaptive fishery management. Combining a bioclimate envelope model and a population dynamic model, we propose a model-based approach that can incorporate ecosystem products into single-species stock assessments. The framework was applied to a commercially important American lobster (Homarus americanus) stock in the Northwest Atlantic. The bioclimate envelope model was used to hindcast temporal variability in a lobster recruitment habitat suitability index (HSI) using bottom temperature and salinity. The climate-driven HSI was used to inform the lobster recruitment dynamics within the size-structured population dynamics model. The performance of the assessment model with an environment-explicit recruitment function is evaluated by comparing relevant assessment outputs such as recruitment, annual fishing mortality, and magnitude of retrospective biases. The environmentally-informed assessment model estimated (i) higher recruitment and lower fishing mortality and (ii) reduced retrospective patterns. This analysis indicates that climate-driven changes in lobster habitat suitability contributed to increased lobster recruitment and present potential improvement to population assessment. Our approach is extendable to other stocks that are impacted by similar environmental variability.

AB  - Globally 10% of all dragonfly species are threatened by extinction that can be primarily attributed to a loss of natural habitat. Urban expansion and the associated urban stream syndrome has established that the extent and intensity of urban development is directly linked to a range of adverse physical, chemical and ecological changes. Urban waterways typically experience degraded water quality and are occupied by impaired communities of aquatic invertebrates which are mostly dominated by rapid colonizing insects. Odonata are a diverse insect group and their tolerance or sensitivity to urban waterway degradation is unclear. This research examined the response of aquatic macroinvertebrate communities and specifically the Odonata nymph community to impaired water quality and degraded riparian vegetation condition in streams of the Georges River catchment, Sydney, across an urban development gradient. Unlike the overall macroinvertebrate community, Odonata nymph species assemblages were not strongly linked to the urban development gradient nor the degree of degradation in water quality. This result diverges from many aquatic macroinvertebrate studies that have reported a correlation between the response of Odonata taxa to degraded water quality. Our findings conclude that Odonata nymph community alone are not a suitable indictor of urban stream degradation as measured by water quality or catchment imperviousness and that the conservation of urban dragonflies should place a greater focus on the conservation and creation of suitable habitats.

AB  - Nutrient loadings are an important component of aquaculture impacts as they can lead to cascade effects at the ecosystem level. An evaluation of these effects on foodweb functioning is presented and discussed for the case study of Lake Burullus in the Nile Delta, Egypt, where semi-intensive aquaculture in earthen ponds has grown remarkably in recent decades. Estimations of nutrient loads into the lake's brackish water, from agriculture and fish ponds, were assessed. A biogeochemical model was set up and calibrated to simulate the loads from nitrogen, phosphorus and phytoplankton, with and without fish ponds. The biogeochemical model was coupled offline to a foodweb model to test the effects of additional nutrient loads from aquaculture on the lake's foodweb functioning. The results obtained by comparing the present conditions of aquaculture development with a no-aquaculture scenario allowed us to identify a set of indicators of foodweb functioning which are sensitive to changes in nutrient loads from aquaculture. The limited changes in phytoplankton concentration with respect to changes in nutrient loads suggested that primary production in Lake Burullus is presently controlled largely by factors other than nutrient influxes from aquaculture. This study emphasises the potential benefits of using a combination of biogeochemical and foodweb models to assess the cumulative effects of nutrient loading from aquaculture on a receiving water body.

AB  - Fat dormouse is a squirrel-like rodent which is closely tied to deciduous forest ecosystem in southwestern Eurasia. As such it is a valuable indicator of forest survival in refugia during glacial-interglacial periods. Previous phylogeographic analyses uncovered divergent fat dormouse lineages in southern refugia in Italy and the Balkans, but retrieved a surprisingly low overall genetic diversity across the majority of the species' range. We explored 812 bp long fragment of a cytochrome b (cyt b) gene in ten fat dormice from refugial Hyrcanian forests in northern Iran. We identified 10 new cyt b haplotypes, which generated a total dataset of 28 fat dormouse haplotypes. The phylogenetic reconstruction clustered the new haplotypes into the Iranian lineage which hold a sister position against all other fat dormouse haplotypes from Europe and Asia Minor. The divergence between these lineages suggests a fragmentation event of an ancestral population at 5.76 mya (95% HPD = 3.21-8.92). This early evolutionary divergence was possibly triggered in the Middle East by dramatically divergent environmental conditions at the Messinian Salinity Crisis. The divergence clearly exceeds the intraspecific divergence, and is well within the range between congeneric rodent species. We suggest a long-term persistence of the Iranian lineage in the Hyrcanian refugium which is consitent with a high number of endemics along the southern Caspian coastal areas.

AB  - This paper presents the analysis of the advantages of applying ISO 14001 system in an environmental protection management system. The environmental protection management system which is not licensed, i.e., compatible with the principles and standard pre-conditions considerably increases the plausibility for ecological risk. There are some issues that remain to be solved in the areas which are not expressed by financial values only but also have a non-financial character with the aim of expanding markets, company image improvement and improvement of the environmental performance indicators. By improving a company's environmental management system efficiency we expect to achieve the minimization and elimination of damaging influences on the environment which are the consequence of company's activities.
   A case study in the Oil Refinery Belgrade (RNB) analyses the implementation of the standard ISO 14001:2004 into its environment protection management system, particularly emphasizing the company's own way of evaluating the environment aspects with the aim of establishing results of ecological performances indicators improvement. The average values of the first ecological indicator of the plant, the total amount of the waste waters in m(3) per a ton of product, clearly show the downturn trend, which is confirmed by the proportional reduction of the second ecological plant indicator, that is by the flocculants consumption (Al-2(SO4)(3), Na2CO3) in kg per m(3) of the waste water of the Oil Refinery of Belgrade for the given period 2008-2010.
   Case study RNB confirms the improvement of environmental performances using the ISO 14001 standard.

AB  - The Littorina transgression is one of the most pronounced environmental events in the Holocene history of the Baltic Sea. It changed the hydrographic system from the freshwater Ancylus Lake into the brackish-marine Littorina Sea. Here, 18 cores from two western Baltic basins, Mecklenburg Bay and the Arkona Basin, were analysed. We show that, besides biological indicators, sedimentary organic carbon, C/N ratio, bulk delta 13C isotope values and carbonate content display clearly the transition from Ancylus Lake to the Littorina Sea. The first appearances of benthic foraminifers, marine molluscs and ostracods represent the onset of brackish-marine conditions in the bottom waters. Central Arkona Basin sediments display more abrupt shifts in geochemical parameters and microfossil records at the transition from Ancylus Lake to the Littorina Sea than those from Mecklenburg Bay. Mixing of reworked Ancylus material with Littorina Sea stage material was stronger in Mecklenburg Bay, resulting in less pronounced proxy parameter changes and older bulk material dates. Radiocarbon dating of both calcareous material (benthic foraminifers, mollusc shells) and bulk fractions at the transgression horizon shows large age discrepancies. Based on calcareous fossil dates it appears that marine waters began to enter Mecklenburg Bay c. 8000 cal. a BP. In the Arkona Basin the first marine signals are recorded approximately 800 years later, c. 7200 cal. a BP. This indicates a transgression pathway via the Great Belt into Mecklenburg Bay and then into the Arkona Basin.

AB  - The modifications to soil properties that resulted from changes in water availability along a pluviometric gradient from 240 to 1100 mm mean annual rainfall were investigated. The study was carried out at eight experimental sites in southern Spain and assessed the influence of a reduction in annual average rainfall along the pluviometric gradient on various physical, chemical and hydrological properties of the topsoil, and on the biotic characteristics of the environment. The aims were to assess the soil degradation status, and to determine if any of the soil variables studied could be used as soil degradation indicators. For each experimental site the relationships among a series of edaphic, hydrological and biological properties were investigated, and the principal factors affecting soil degradation were determined using principal component analysis. The properties included the clay, silt and sand content; organic matter; retained organic carbon; salinity: cation exchange capacity; structural stability; USLE K factor; bulk density; saturated hydraulic conductivity; soil moisture; the number of vegetal species; and vegetation cover. The results show that relationships among biotic and abiotic factors control soil degradation processes from wet to semiarid/arid conditions along the Mediterranean pluviometric gradient. A precipitation-based soil degradation threshold of approximately 500 mm year I was established, as below this level the vegetation is no longer associated with the presence of greater soil moisture content, but adapts to degradation, as evidenced by the appearance of xerophytic species.

AB  - Paleoecological analysis using complementary indicators of vegetation and soil can provide spatially explicit information on ecological processes influencing trajectories of long-term ecosystem change. Here we document the structure and dynamics of an old-growth woodland before and after its inception 1000 years ago. We infer vegetation and soil characteristics from size and age distributions of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.), soil properties, plant fossils, and paleosols. Radiocarbon ages of charcoal On the ground and in the soil indicate that the fire return interval was similar to 300 years between 2750 and 1000 cal. yr BP. No fire evidence was found before and after this period despite the presence of spruce since 4200 cal. yr BP. The size structures of living and dead spruce suggest that the woodland is in equilibrium with present climate in absence of fire. Tree establishment and mortality occurred regularly since the last fire event around 950 cal. yr BP. Both layering and occasional seeding have contributed to stabilize the spatial distribution of spruce over the past 1000 years. Since initial afforestation, soil development has been homogenized by the changing spatial distribution of spruce following each fire. We conclude that the history of the woodland is characterized by vegetation shifts associated with fire and soil disturbances and by millennial-scale maintenance of the woodland's structure despite changing climatic conditions.

AB  - The present state of the landscapes and territories in the Sahel is the result of interactions between climatic, economic, social and political factors which have been taking place for more than four decades. In the north of Senegal, the Ferlo geographical space is representative of cohabitation between sylvopastoral and agricultural production systems, within which the pastoral activity is maintained under conflictual conditions as traditional complementarities between agricultural and pastoral production systems, or between pastors and communities, tend to deteriorate under land pressure. Such pressure operates for a variety of often divergent goals displaying tangible transformation indicators with social economic and environmental conversion such as illegal land access plurality, disputes and trouble in land allocation, landscape fragmentation and agricultural territory and pastoral restructuring. It is also within this framework that territory decentralisation and development policies have transferred to stakeholders the power to administer, exploit and manage natural resources and lands under their jurisdiction so as to strengthen local governance and respond to sustainable development needs of production systems. The experiment shown in this case study deals with the process of co-building and setting up tools and simulation models in order to accompany and instruct decision making by local communities responsible for applying the law 64-46 of 06 June 1964. The different steps of this participative approach leading to the "AIDA" agent model design and scenarios have been put forward, tested and evaluated by the users.

AB  - Large-scale public infrastructure projects have featured in China's modernization course since the early 1980s. During the early stages of China's rapid economic development, public attention focused on the economic and social impact of high-profile construction projects. In recent years, however, we have seen a shift in public concern toward the environmental and ecological effects of such projects, and today governments are required to provide valid environmental impact assessments prior to allowing large-scale construction. The official requirement for the monitoring of environmental conditions has led to an increased number of debates in recent years regarding the effectiveness of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) and Governmental Environmental Audits (GEAs) as environmental safeguards in instances of large-scale construction. Although EIA and GEA are conducted by different institutions and have different goals and enforcement potential, these two practices can be closely related in terms of methodology. This article cites the construction of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway as an instance in which EIA and GEA offer complementary approaches to environmental impact management. This study concludes that the GEA approach can serve as an effective follow-up to the EIA and establishes that the EIA lays a base for conducting future GEAs. The relationship that emerges through a study of the Railway's construction calls for more deliberate institutional arrangements and cooperation if the two practices are to be used in concert to optimal effect.

AB  - Desertification is a serious threat to the ecological environment and social economy in our world and there is a pressing need to develop a reasonable and reproducible method to assess it at different scales. In this paper, the Ordos Plateau in China was selected as the research region and a quantitative method for desertification assessment was developed by using Landsat MSS and TM/ETM+ data on a regional scale. In this method, NDVI, MSDI and land surface albedo were selected as assessment indicators of desertification to represent land surface conditions from vegetation biomass, landscape pattern and micrometeorology. Based on considering the effects of vegetation type and time of images acquired on assessment indictors, assessing rule sets were built and a decision tree approach was used to assess desertification of Ordos Plateau in 1980, 1990 and 2000. The average overall accuracy of three periods was higher than 90%. The results showed that although some local places of Ordos Plateau experienced an expanding trend of desertification, the trend of desertification of Ordos Plateau was an overall decrease in from 1980 to 2000. By analyzing the causes of desertification processes, it was found that climate change could benefit for the reversion of desertification from 1980 to 1990 at a regional scale and human activities might explain the expansion of desertification in this period; however human conservation activities were the main driving factor that induced the reversion of desertification from 1990 to 2000.

AB  - Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a systematically constructed procedure whereby environmental impacts caused by proposed projects are examined. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are crucially efficient tools for impact assessment and their use is likely to dramatically increase in the near future. GIS have been applied to a wide range of different impact assessment projects and dams among them have been taken as the case work in this article. EIA Regulation in force in Turkey requires the analysis of steering natural processes that can be adversely affected by the proposed project, particularly in the section of the analysis of the areas with higher landscape value. At this point, the true potential value of GIS lies in its ability to analyze spatial data with accuracy. This study is an attempt to analyze by GIS the areas with higher landscape value in the impact assessment of dam constructions in the case of Seyhan-Kopru! Hydroelectric Dam project proposal. A method needs to be defined before the overlapping step by GIS to analyze the areas with higher landscape value. In the case of Seyhan-Kopru Hydroelectric Dam project proposal of the present work, considering the geological conditions and the steep slopes of the area and the type of the project, the most important natural process is erosion. Therefore, the areas of higher erosion risk were considered as the Areas with Higher Landscape Value from the conservation demands points of view. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - This short review is aimed at establishing general principles of biological monitoring for chemical mixtures. When interactions occur, they appear to be toxicokinetic in nature, often resulting from competition between two or more substances for the same biotransformation enzymes. A threshold is frequently observed for such an interaction, so that it might not influence the relationship between the absorbed dose and the value of the relevant biomarker. The extent of the interaction between pairs of chemicals also depends on the extent of biotransformation of each compound. As a result, the measurement of the parent compound or its metabolite will be differentially influenced by the presence of an interfering chemical. Biological limit values (BLV) are often established from the correlation between the bioindicator concentration in a given biological medium and the airborne concentration of the parent compound. When this relationship is derived from exposure to pure chemicals, it might not always yield an appropriate BLV for monitoring exposure to a mixture that includes this particular chemical. Under certain conditions such as the stability of mixture composition, a single biomarker such as 1-hydroxypyrene in PAH exposure can be used to reflect the overall exposure to a mixture. Finally, there is clearly a need for a greater research effort on the toxicology of mixtures to make biological monitoring a useful tool in occupational health. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB  - The paper investigates the properties of geochemical systems components (GCS) within the thermodynamic framework. In a departure from previous approaches, the maximum possible number of interconnected media in holistic GCS is analyzed using hierarchical classification procedures.
   The studied sample covers the maximum possible selection of media, which are interconnected in natural systems in real conditions.
   The paper reports that complex organic compounds, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are highly informative indicators of the properties of substances migration in media. Being geochemical markers, these compounds demonstrate the ability to accumulate on geochemical barriers and selectively move in interacting media, which makes them key objects of study. In addition, the marker role of these compounds draws on their "confinement" to several geochemical processes (natural or industrial) and ability to ultimately identify the source of the pollution. The existing accounts fail to describe these mechanisms of mass transfer. The proposed phenomenological models of migration, transformation, and accumulation of PAHs are based on quantitative estimates, which provide more consistent results compared with the descriptive representations of the behavior of substances. This allowed us to identify the role of studied physicochemical characteristics of PAHs in their accumulation in the environmental media. The paper demonstrates that the most active evolution of GCS occurs in case plant media and, in general, living matter is included in their composition.

AB  - A systematic approach to environmental monitoring of small water systems and its optimization is proposed. For simplify the storage of large amounts of information, accelerate the obtaining of preliminary conclusions of water resources condition, predict the dynamics of both individual indicators and their system attributes, and develop a user-friendly interface, which is tied to the area. To carry out the research, samples of water were taken near the corresponding sections of industrial enterprises of Korosten region, as well as discharges of a storm water system. Based on the standard approach, with the help of physicochemical methods of analysis practically all the hydrochemical parameters in the studied water body were determined. The obtained results were compared with the regulatory guidelines. For systematization and maintenance of environmental monitoring, a software package has been developed, which has been tested on the results of the instrumental laboratory analysis of surface water quality of the river Uzh. The software package is developed to establish local sources of pollution, monitor potentially dangerous man-made objects, and better manage of water resources. A user-friendly interface has been developed, which is tied to the area and is easily adapted to other monitoring objects. Thanks to the developed software package, the implementation of an integrated approach to the collection and analysis of monitoring data is carried out quickly, efficiently and conveniently. The developed approach allows easy adaptation to the objects of the research and does not require significant capital investment.

AB  - To ensure that the environment is adequately protected and abstractors are fairly regulated, hydroecological assessment tools are needed that give local interpretation, indicate where ecological communities might not be resilient to current or future abstraction pressures, and take account of the effect of other stressors. These tools should ideally be transferrable across different river catchments. This study presents a hydroecological model indicating that macro-invertebrates were not resilient to long-term, steady-state levels of groundwater abstraction when flows at Q75 were reduced by more than 50% in unpolluted streams in the West Midlands of England. The proportion of silt and clay covering the substratum and distance from source were also significant predictors of ecological condition, but did not interact with the abstraction effect. Combinations of different biotic indices and supplementary field observations of catchment land use gave additional evidence of the impacts of excessive inputs of fine sediment overriding the effects of abstraction at some locations. This study has shown that regional hydroecological models can be used with existing environmental flow indicators and other local environmental information as a weight of evidence to identify where abstraction and excessive inputs of fine sediment need to be mitigated separately or together to achieve the full ecological benefits. Such regional hydroecological models can increase the certainty of regulatory decisions made at the local scale for licencing abstraction at current use and predicted future levels.

AB  - To study the effects of long-term mining activities on the agricultural soil quality of Mengnuo town in Yunnan province, China, the heavy metal and soil enzyme activities of soil samples from 47 sites were examined. The results showed that long-term mining processes led to point source heavy metal pollution and Pb, Cd, Zn and As were the primary metal pollutants. Polyphenoloxidase was found the most sensitive soil enzyme activity and significantly correlated with almost all the metals (P < 0.05). Amylase (for C cycling), acid phosphatase (for P cycling) and catalase (for redox reaction) activities showed significantly positive correlations (P < 0.05) with Pb, Cd, Zn and As contents. The correlations between soil enzymes activities and Cd, Pb and Zn contents were verified in microcosm experiments, it was found that catalase activity had significant correlations (P < 0.05) with these three metals in short-term experiments using different soils under different conditions. Based on both field investigation and microcosm simulation analysis, oxidoreductases activities (rather than a specific enzyme activity) were suggested to be used as "core enzyme", which could simply and universally indicate the heavy metal pollution degrees of different environments. And hydrolases (for C, N, P and S recycling) could be used as a supplement to improve correlation accuracy for heavy metal indication in various polluted environments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - As a key component of ecological risk assessments, nontarget effects of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) rice have been tested under laboratory and field conditions for various organisms. A 2-yr field experiment was conducted to observe the nontarget effects of six transgenic rice lines (expressing the Cry1Ab or fused protein of Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac) on four nontarget thrips species including Frankliniella intonsa (Trybom), F. tenuicornis (Uzel), Haplothrips aculeatus (F.), and H. tritici (Kurd), as compared with their rice parental control lines. Two sampling methods including the beat plate and plastic bag method were used to monitor the population densities of the four thrips species for 2 yr. The results showed that the seasonal average densities of four tested thrips species in Bt rice plots were significantly lower than or very similar to those in the non-Bt rice plots depending on rice genotypes, sampling methods, and years. Among all six tested Bt rice lines, transgenic B1 and KMD2 lines suppressed the population of these tested thrips species the most. Our results indicate that the tested Bt rice lines are unlikely to result in high population pressure of thrips species in comparison with non-Bt rice. In some cases, Bt rice lines could significantly suppress thrips populations in the rice ecosystem. In addition, compatibility of Bt rice, with rice host plant resistance to nontarget sucking pests is also discussed within an overall integrated pest management program for rice.

AB  - The management of coastal systems where overlapping economic interests compete for the same resources make the use of integrated approaches indispensable. The Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) focuses mainly on three major goals: (1) overcoming the conflicts associated with the sectorial management, (2) preserving the productivity and biological diversity of coastal systems, and (3) promoting and equitable and sustainable allocation of coastal resources. The DPSIR (Drivers-Pressures-State-Impact-Responses) framework is a common tool that allows the description of environmental problems by defining the relationships between anthropogenic activities and the environment. In this context, the use of numerical models as integrative tools in ICZM has grown significantly over the years.
   This work focused on three estuarine systems in South America: Santos estuary (Brazil, 24 S) and Bahia Blanca estuary (Argentina, 39 S) in the Atlantic coast and Aysen fiord (Chile, 45 S) in the Pacific coast. These estuaries differ significantly in their physical, chemical and biological conditions, as well as on their socio-economic settings and human-related problems. Numerical models have been used to study the relation between the pressures derived from human activities and their impact on the state of each system.
   The results presents a contribute to increase the scientific knowledge needed to support the implementation of local legislations and policies, to assess different scenarios of coastal activities and sources use, to support management decisions and, ultimately, to promote sustainable of coastal resources.

AB  - It is widely recognized that healthy ecosystems can provide considerable benefits to people, including food, timber, freshwater, protection from floods and much of what we call quality of life. A global review of these ecosystem services carried out as part of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) provided a framework for national and local studies. Using the MEA approach, this paper reviews the ecosystem services provided by the Somerset Levels and Moors wetland system in southwest England. This wetland provides a series of important services that are beneficial locally, regionally and globally, including grazing for cattle, carbon sequestration, flood water storage, recreation and archaeology. Some services are synergistic and reinforcing; for example, maintaining wet conditions supports wetland bird life that maintains biological diversity, attracts tourists, protects archaeological artefacts and reduces CO2 emissions; raising water levels to or above the ground leads to net greenhouse gas uptake by the wetland. Other services are potentially conflicting, for example raising water levels may reduce potential flood water storage and increase methane emissions. Comparison of the services of the wetland with those of drier habitats reveals for example that carbon sequestration, bird habitat provision and hay production is greater in wetlands, whilst grazing quality may decline and plant diversity may be reduced in the short term and distributions of disease vectors may be altered by wetland restoration through raising water levels. Management decisions affecting wetlands may necessitate a trade-off of ecosystem services.

AB  - Deteriorating soil quality in arid areas is related primarily to inappropriate farming techniques. The use of environmentally friendly agriculture practices has proven to be effective in restoring or improving soil quality and health in these areas. in this study, four long-term approaches to olive-orchard management, categorized by the presence/absence of two main factors - cover crops and chemical weed control - were evaluated using biological indicators of soil quality. Soil bacteria[ Population size and community structure were estimated by real-time PCR assays targeting 16S rRNA genes and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA fragments (PCR-DGGE), respectively, and the activity of six enzymes (dehydrogenase, o-diphenoloxidase, beta-glucosidase, phosphatase, urease and arylsulphatase) representative of the C, P, N, and S cycles were determined. Covered soils exhibited greater bacterial biomass and diversity, as well as higher microbial functional diversity than non-covered soils. The elimination of weeds with herbicides reduced the microbial functional diversity in covered soil but did not affect the other microbiological parameters, revealing that the effect of the cover crop predominated. When non-covered soil was considered, the lowest values of microbial activity and diversity were found when weeds were controlled with chemical methods. The results Of this Study reveal that covered soils are the best option when olive Orchards are managed under rainfed conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Estrogenicity of river water is highly variable and it is difficult to obtain an average measure of the estrogenicity. Consequently it is difficult to tie the estrogenic effects observed in fish to their level of exposure to estrogens. To get a better handle on average estrogenic exposure we tested a recently developed passive sampling system (polar organic chemical integrative sampler, POCIS). In addition, we investigated the bioaccumulation of estrogens in caged brown trout and measured plasma vitellogenin in males as a bioindicator of estrogenic effects.We developed a mini-caging method to suit the hydrological conditions in small rivers and to improve upon the often poor survival of salmonids in caging trials. POCISs were positioned upstream and downstream of 5 sewage treatment works' discharges and left on site for 3 weeks (as were the caged fish), during which period 3 water grab samples were taken at each site. Concentrations of estrogens were determined using a yeast-based reporter gene assay and chemical analysis. Results from grab sampling, passive sampling, and bioaccumulation were correlated; however, plasma vitellogenin concentrations were elevated at only I of 5 sites. POCISs provide an integrated and biologically meaningful measure of estrogenicity in that they accumulate estrogens in a pattern similar to that of brown trout. Minicaging appears a significant methodological advance; no fish were lost, moreover, all fish survived in excellent health.

AB  - Phosphomonoesterase (PMEase) activity plays a key role in nutrient cycling and is a potential indicator of soil condition and ecosystem stress. We compared para-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) and 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (MUP) as substrate analogues for PMEase in 7 natural ecosystem soils and 8 agricultural top soils with contrasting C contents (8.0-414 g kg(-1) C) and pH (3.0-7.5). PMEase activities obtained with pNPP (0.05-5 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) were significantly less than activities obtained with MUP (0.9-13 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)), especially in soils with a high organic matter content (> 130 g kg(-)1). Only PMEase activities assayed with MUP correlated significantly with total C and total N (r=0.7, P < 0.01 all), and pH (r = -0.71, P < 0.01). PMEase activities obtained with the two substrate analogues were correlated when expressed on a C-content basis (r=0.8, P < 0.001), but not when expressed on an oven-dry soil weight basis. This indicated that interference by organic matter is related to the quantity rather than to the quality of organic matter. Overall, assaying with MUP was more sensitive compared to assaying with pNPP, particularly in the case of high organic and acid soils. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Retene (7-isopropyl-1-methylphenanthrene) is a naturally formed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) that causes teratogenicity in fish larvae and induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP1A) enzymes. Retene occurs at high concentrations (less than or equal to3,300 mug/g dry wt) in surface sediments contaminated by resin acids from pulp mill effluents. To assess the environmental risks of retene, it is important to evaluate conditions affecting its bioavailability and accumulation by fish. Fingerling rainbow trout were exposed to retene-spiked or naturally contaminated sediments and sampled after 4 d to determine liver CYP1A activity and concentrations of retene metabolites in bile as indicators of retene accumulation. Industrially contaminated sediments collected near a bleached kraft pulp and paper mill discharging to Lake Saimaa, Finland, significantly induced trout liver CYP1A activity, indicating accumulation of arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-active ligands. Bile of these fish contained retene metabolites, providing direct evidence that retene is bioavailable, presumably via desorption from sediments. Induction of CYP1A in fish exposed to sediments spiked with retene or benzo[k]fluoranthene supported this conclusion. While the extent of CYP1A induction by spiked sediments declined after storage (i.e., aging), a portion of the spiked PAHs remained bioavailable. However, retene was not the sole CYP1A inducer in industrially contaminated sediments, as shown by induction in fish injected with sediment extracts oxidized to remove labile PAHs but not persistent organochlorine compounds such as chlorinated dioxins and furans.

AB  - Echinoids Paracentrotus lividus (Lamarck, 1816) were contaminated with Cd (as CdCl2) in field or laboratory conditions through 3 modes of exposure: (1) exposure via the sea water, (2) exposure via the food chain (Posidonia oceanica leaves), and (3) 'mixed-source' exposure via both sea water and food. Results indicate that Cd accumulation by P. Lividus varies with both the body compartment of the echinoid and the exposure mode to the metal. The digestive wall shows the highest Cd uptake rates regardless of exposure mode. Bioaccumulation from sea water is prevalent in all compartments. Cd accumulation in the digestive wall and body wall of echinoids directly exposed to Cd in sea water is probably a dose-dependent process. Echinoids take up Cd with a lower efficiency (up to a 65% decrease) when they are contaminated via both sea water and food than when they are contaminated via sea water only. We suggest that this phenomenon is due to an increase in both excretion and mucus production (impeding Cd absorption from sea water) triggered by high Cd levels in the food. Cd loss rates are low in comparison with uptake rates and are dependent upon the body compartment and exposure mode. The data indicate that Cd has a relatively long biological half-life (greater than or equal to 15 d) once incorporated in echinoid tissues. It is concluded that P. lividus - particularly its digestive wall - could serve as a good bioindicator of Cd contamination in the environment.

AB  - Postdepositional diagenetic processes and behavior of biogenic and other elements in Holocene peatlands have been studied in Ubinskoe and Sherstobitovo bogs of the Baraba forest-steppe zone. Peat contains relatively high concentrations of Fe, Mn, Pb, Hg, Sb, Cd, Cu, and Zn in the upper part of the two sections and S, N, Ca, and Sr in the middle. Microbially mediated processes in peat affect the behavior of pH and Eh and cycles of biogenic elements. Depth-dependent distribution patterns of microorganisms in the two bogs record active cycles of carbon and nitrogen but limited sulfur exchange. Bog waters have Ca-group bicarbonate major-ion chemistry and high concentrations of Al, Fe, Cu, and Zn, due to low pH. High contents of NH4(+), NO3-, and C-org and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the bog waters are implicit indicators of rapid biochemical decomposition and oxidation of organic matter. The low pH of the water and an oxic environment in peat were favorable for the formation of goethite and hydrogoethite in upper peat layers. The formation of hematite and andhydride may be related with past wild fires. Early diagenetic processes lead to precipitation of authigenic minerals, especially, pyrite or less often siderite, calcite, and kaolinite. Reduced conditions maintained the formation of metallic Ni and intermetallic Ni-Cr nanometer particles, as well as precipitation of amorphous silica upon dissolution of aluminosilicate minerals in upper peat intervals.Y

AB  - Biodiversity is declining across Europe. Modern agricultural practices, habitat fragmentation, land abandonment and climate change are key factors causing current trends in environmental change. Mobile organisms such as raptors, positioned high in the food chain, are good indicators of negative or positive landscape dynamics, since their response is fast. This assumption was tested by investigating the Scops Owl (Otus scops) population in a traditional Central European cultural landscape (Goriko Nature Park [GNP]) in Slovenia. The negative trend in male calling Scops Owls was correlated with static and dynamic environmental change variables derived from remotely sensed or field-based, multi-temporal data sources. Key geospatial predictors were identified and used for bird calling and breeding (C&B) suitability modelling. All geospatial models developed predicted a decline in C&B suitability (even by 33%) in almost all areas where the bird is currently active. However, the NE part of the GNP could achieve better C&B conditions for theScops Owl in the coming years (a potential 36% increase in suitability). Predictions indicate that more effort and action, to conserve the Scops Owl in the study area should be implemented in the N, NE and E part of the hilly GNP. Our results are thus highly applicable not just for decision makers in this protected area but rather in all areas across the Scops Owl's continental population, since the methodology is easily replicable and transferable.

AB  - Exotic organisms have traits that allow them to effectively disperse and propagate into novel environments. The ability to adapt to new environments has enabled the cane toad (Rhinella marina) to successfully invade novel ecosystems. Their leg length correlates with dispersal success and is selected for in invading populations. Given their successful invasion of multiple continents, R. marina represent a unique opportunity to understand the generality of invasion strategies within a species. Here we test for spatial and temporal shifts in leg length (length of tibio-fibula relative to snout-vent length) of invasive R. marina in Florida populations to assess their adaptation to novel environments. Individuals experiencing new conditions are susceptible to physiological stress, which may negatively affect their development and inhibit their dispersal potential. To this end, we tested for spatial and temporal trends in fluctuating asymmetry, an indicator of physiological stress during development. We compared patterns between two regions of Florida (central vs southern Florida) with different invasion histories. We found that relative leg length of R. marina decreased over time in both regions, and experienced shifts in fluctuating asymmetry over time from initial colonization to population establishment. Our results suggest that successful invasive species rapidly adjust to novel environments. In addition, our results support predictions that morphological change plays a role in aiding dispersal for rapidly dispersing species.

AB  - Many landfills built a few decades ago do not meet modern requirements. In this regard, leaks in landfills occur, that have a negative impact on the environment and especially on water objects. The aim of the work is to determine the infiltration rate of landfill filtrate taking into account the natural and climatic conditions on the example of the landfill "Novyye Cherkassy" (Ufa, Russia). The HELP program is used to simulate the leachate infiltration through existing landfill layers. To simulate the movement of a toxic liquid seeping through the waste layer into the soil profile, the HYDRUS program is used. Results of 10 years hydrologic evaluation by HELP program showed that the volume of filtrate formed is 341 m(3)/day. Comparison of the result obtained with the works of other authors showed that the increased filtrate value is due to the landfill age (the landfill is as old as 56 years) and the lack of protective measures for prevention infiltration into the soil. The seasonality in the leachate formation at the landfill is revealed. There is no leachate in the winter (negative temperature) but in the spring volley receipt caused by snowmelt (positive temperature) occurs. In the summer months, evapotranspiration was about 77% of the total precipitation, while infiltration did not exceed 7%. In the autumn month's evapotranspiration was only 30-40%, while infiltration increased up to 16%. The calculations showed that during landfill operation toxic mass has spread over 7 km. To prevent further environmental impact, it is necessary to close the landfill or remediate it.

AB  - Anticancer drugs used in cancer treatment are excreted unchanged or as metabolites by feces and urine in hospitals and households. These drugs enter the municipal sewage system but wastewater treatment plants are not capable of removing all of these micro pollutants. In many countries such as Brazil, sanitation departments do not provide service, nor have access to all of the population, therefore most sewage is still released into untreated receiving bodies. This study analyzes the consumption of anticancer drugs in a Brazilian hospital located in one of the 10 municipalities with the best sanitation index in the country. It estimates its environmental risk in aquatic matrixes by the European Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use. Among the 20 drugs analyzed, the three most consumed (cyclophosphamide, 5-fluoruracil, and cytarabine) show a predicted environmental concentration value greater than the action limit of 0.01 mu g/L recommended by the guideline. The risk assessment was performed on all pharmaceuticals consumed to get a greater awareness of risk. Results do not indicate local environmental risk but, considering that the study was performed under the best sanitation scenario, it cannot be extrapolated in the other municipalities. The study highlights that development of suitable methodologies should be considered to perform environmental risk assessment of pharmaceuticals in developing countries sanitation conditions.

AB  - Diatoms are widely used as bio-indicators in water quality monitoring and ecological status assessment. Compare to chemical variables, the effects of hydrological variables on diatom dynamics have been rarely reported. In this study, we aimed to examine dynamics of diatoms based on the classification of a morphological trait (cell size) and to investigate the relationship between the diatom community and selected chemical and hydrological variables. We collected 339 daily-mixed samples by using an auto-sampler, from which we recorded 113 diatom taxa from 45 genera. Analysis of morphological trait showed variations among cell size classes throughout the year with big cells in winter and spring while small cells dominated in summer and autumn. Redundancy analysis (RDA) and partial RDA indicated that chemical and hydrological variables could jointly explain 50.2% of the diatom community variation, in which chemical variables explain 36.5% and hydrological variables explain 12.9%. The most important chemical variables were Orthophosphate-phosphorus (PO4-P) and Silicon (Si2+) concentrations, while the most significant hydrological variables were antecedent precipitation index (API) and base flow. We conclude that besides chemical variables (nutrients and metal ions) hydrological variables showed also remarkable effects on the diatom community variation, especially during wet conditions. A key implication of our findings for freshwater management is that future bio-monitoring protocols should take hydrological variables into consideration.

AB  - Chironomids have been widely used as indicators of trophic conditions of lakes due to their species-specific environmental requirements. In order to understand resilience and deterioration of aquatic ecosystems due to increases and/or decreases in external loading, recent chironomid community and water chemistry data of seven southern Finnish lakes with varying anthropogenic pressures and bathymetric properties were compared with similar data from the 1960s. Altogether 64 taxa were found. At present, the most numerous taxa are Procladius spp., Chironomus f.l. plumosus, Chironomus f.l. salinarius, Stictochironomus f.l. psammophilus, Benthalia spp., Tanytarsus spp. and Cladotanytarsus. In four lakes, current abundances of chironomid larvae are clearly lower, and in two lakes abundances are higher than during the 1960s. In two shallow, previously highly eutrophic lakes, the chironomid community composition revealed an improvement in the trophic status, while in three deep, previously moderately oligotrophic lakes, a slight deterioration was found. The most dramatic increase in chironomid density and diversity was found in a lake which was most heavily polluted in 1960s. In deep lakes, a slow gradual eutrophication seemed to be responsible for the observed replacement of the previous oligotrophic communities, dominated by Monodiamesa bathyphila, Stictochironomus spp., Polypedilum f.l. breviantennatum and Heterotanytarsus apicalis by eutrophic taxa such as Chironomus f.l. salinarius, Chironomus f.l. plumosus, Einfeldia spp., Sergentia coracina and Microtendipes spp. Among the key factors responsible for changes were dissolved oxygen concentration, food availability, sediment quality, and in one lake, toxic effluents from industry.

TI  - The economic analysis of commodity systems: Extending the policy analysis matrix to account for environmental effects and transactions costs
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
LA  - English
CP  - Workshop on Socio-Economic Methods in Renewable Natural Resources Research
AB  - In a context in which the framework of economic policy is changing radically, the objective of agricultural research programmes should be to support the development of systems which look likely to be 'winners' in the future. The Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM) framework permits sensitivity analysis in which an inventory of possible 'feasible' technological developments may be examined for their impact on the underlying comparative advantage (implicitly, the longer-run competitive advantage) of the system. This is a fruitful procedure for the integration of technological and economic analysis, and can make a substantial contribution to the identification of 'best-bet' lines of technological development. This paper begins with a brief account of the role and usefulness of the PAM, a relatively straightforward logical framework for policy analysis, fr om which a range of 'policy indicators' may be estimated. The most important of these indicators is the Domestic Resource Cost (DRC) ratio, an approximate indicator of the 'underlying comparative advantage' of a commodity system, a characteristic which may be obscured by an overlay of policy interventions and 'market failures'. The paper then explores two areas in which the use of the PAM can be extended. First, it examines the possibilities offered by the application of 'new institutional economics' (NIE) in a PAM context to changing rural market conditions precipitated by withdrawal of the state. Second, the paper reviews how PAM may be modified to incorporate environmental costs and benefits, and so address more adequately the sustainability of commodity systems.

AB  - Monitoring seabirds and their responses to ecosystem change provides essential information for understanding the reasons behind any changes in productivity or populations. However, many species nest in remote locations, which poses logistical challenges for long-term studies. Remote cameras offer an opportunity to confront this issue. The Black-legged Kittiwake Rissa tridactyla (kittiwake) has been used as an indicator of changes in its environment and is a prime candidate for monitoring via remote cameras. To investigate the potential for camera application, we used a remote camera system to collect six years (2010-2015) of reproductive data from a sub-colony of kittiwakes in Resurrection Bay near Seward, Alaska, USA. Our objective was to identify factors influencing the reproductive success of kittiwakes at our study location by 1) establishing the reproductive phenology and estimates of productivity, 2) determining the effect of physical nest-site characteristics and locations on individual nest success, and 3) identifying the effect of seasonal weather patterns on nest, egg, and chick loss events. We found a significant positive correlation between nest success and both nest height from mean high tide level and nest location on island vs. mainland habitat. Nest loss was positively correlated with wind speed; egg loss was negatively correlated with wind speed; and chick loss was uncorrelated with measured weather conditions, including rainfall and air temperature. Remote camera technology proved to be a useful tool in monitoring and identifying factors influencing nesting parameters in this cliff-nesting seabird.

AB  - In recent years, haze has occurred in many parts of China. This phenomenon has a very negative impact on people's health and production and life. For a long time, the main research direction of environmental science research experts in China is to study and analyze the generation, causes, and changes of large particles in haze. This paper points out the variance parameter model of PM2.5 change and the improvement and optimization of College Students' health indicators. One of the assumptions of multiple regression analysis is the false homogeneity of variance. Often, the differences found in psychological or behavioral data can lead to network cations in the absence of missing nonlinear predictive conditions, including predictions not observed in the causal model. Although homogeneities exist in test methods, they require parametric models to identify inhomogeneous structures. The purpose of this article is to propose a simple measurement that can detect leaks described in nonlinear terms without the need for parametric model differences. This measure uses the variance of the squared residuals. Simulation studies have shown that the sample size and magnitude of effect are large enough to satisfy the type I error rate and power supply countermeasures. This is superior to the nonlinear heteroscedastic parameter model by omitting the nonlinear term in the analytical model. We also demonstrated the performance of using the measures from an industrial psychology dataset.

AB  - Species and habitats are the subjects of legislation that mandates reporting of information on ecosystem conditions. Improvements in sensors, sampling platforms, information systems, and collaborations among experts and information users now enables more effective and up-to-date information to meet regional and national needs. Specifically, advances in environmental DNA (eDNA)-based assessments of biodiversity, community science data, various underwater imaging devices, and environmental, behavioral, and physiology observations from animal telemetry provide new opportunities to address multiple requirements for reporting status and trends, including insights into life in the deep ocean. Passive and active acoustic sensors help monitor marine life, boat traffic, and noise pollution. Satellites provide repeated, frequent, and long-term records of many relevant variables from global to local scales and, when combined with numerical computer simulations, allow planning for future scenarios. Metadata standards facilitate the transfer of data from machine to machine, thus streamlining assessments and forecasting and providing knowledge directly to the public. The Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) facilitates this exchange of information on life in the sea. The collaborative efforts of the Central and Northern California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS) of the US Integrated Ocean Observing System and its partners provide an example of a regional MBON process for information delivery. This includes linking policy and management needs, prioritizing observing data from various platforms and methods, streamlining data handling practices, and delivering information for management such as for the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem, with iterative process adaptation.

AB  - In comparison with coastal zones, islands are even more vulnerable to anthropogenic disturbance, especially to tourism and tourism-induced activities. Despite a great number of studies on either island tourism or island vulnerability reviewed in this paper, knowledge and practice of the impact from tourism upon island ecological vulnerability (IEV) still needs to be expanded. In this contribution, the IEV of four administrative regions in Zhoushan, China is assessed between 2012 and 2017 based on an "exposure (E)-sensitivity (S)-adaptive capacity (A)" framework and by means of coupling coordination degree modeling (CCDM) for determination of the overall development level of E-S-A subsystems in each region. The assessment results show that: (1) An index system consisting of 1 objective, 3 sub-objectives, 7 elements, and 20 indicators can be established and tested to reflect the IEV to tourism; (2) As the most attractive tourist destinations, Shengsi and Putuo inevitably have the highest IEV values; (3) Dinghai's moderate low level of IEV comes as a surprise, due to its direct connectivity to its neighboring coastal city of Ningbo; (4) The more balanced the coupling coordination degree (CCD) values among E-S-A subsystems are, the higher the IEV values in the four tourist destinations of Zhoushan. In conclusion, tourism can be a double-edged sword for islands, the overall benefits of which outweigh the negative impacts upon island ecological conditions.

AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O), a major greenhouse gas and ozone depleter, is emitted from drained organic soils typically developed in floodplains. We investigated the effect of the water table depth and soil oxygen (O-2) content on N2O fluxes and their nitrogen isotope composition in a drained floodplain fen in Estonia. Measurements were done at natural water table depth, and we created a temporary anoxic environment by experimental flooding. From the suboxic peat (0.5-6 mg O-2/L) N2O emissions peaked at 6 mg O-2/L and afterwards decreased with decreasing O-2. From the anoxic and oxic peat (0 and >6 mg O-2/L, respectively) N2O emissions were low. Under anoxic conditions the delta N-15/delta N-14 ratio of the top 10 cm peat layer was low, gradually decreasing to 30 cm. In the suboxic peat, delta N-15/delta N-14 ratios increased with depth. In samples of peat fluctuating between suboxic and anoxic, the elevated N-15/N-14 ratios (delta N-15 = 7-9 parts per thousand. ambient N-2) indicated intensive microbial processing of nitrogen. Low values of site preference (SP; difference between the central and peripheral N-15 atoms) and delta O-18-N2O in the captured gas samples indicate nitrifier denitrification in the floodplain fen.

AB  - The mountainous ecosystems (in which the paramos are found) occupy a fifth of the earth's surface, hold 25% of the planet's biodiversity and supply water to almost half of the world's population. They are considered strategic for climate change due to their relationship with carbon dioxide capture and storage. With the objective of estimating the organic carbon content in the first 30 cm of depth in the soils (COS) of Colombia paramos, and its relationship with the environmental factors affecting its spatial patterns, by means of digital soil mapping; 390 profiles were taken from the semi-detailed studies of soils in an area of 1 469 980.1 ha (approximately 1.3% of the national area). The missing information of bulk density was estimated by means of pedotransference functions adjusted with the available data. The predictive modeling technique was Random Forest (RF), using 44 environmental covariables as possible predictors that included information on climate, vegetation, relief and soil orders. The quality of the model was evaluated by cross validation (R-2 = 0.48 - 0.52). The estimated COS content oscillated between 22 and 338 t.ha-1, this is related to the coverage and use of the soil and the climatic conditions (temperature and precipitation). The map of COS of paramos of Colombia establishes a baseline of this indicator for the ecosystem, provides an overview of the susceptibility to soil degradation and serves as support for the planning of the territory.

AB  - Strategies aimed at achieving food safety in crops of high nutritional value should be carried out through sustainable agricultural practices aimed at soil conservation, high yield and food safety. This latter characteristic implies food production without detectable traces of agrochemicals that threaten health. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of the herbicide glyphosate on the chemical and biological fertility of the soil and to determine its residual activity on biofortified bean seeds in Codazzi, Department of Cesar, Colombia. The method included a correlational analysis of soil quality, crop yield and residuality in bean grains. The treatments included glyphosate application and synthetic and natural mulches, compared to manual control. The results showed differences in the response of chemical, microbiological and yield indicators between treatments and the initial conditions of the bean rhizosphere. The use of the herbicide glyphosate in mulch-free soil generates yield losses of 29% associated with a higher incidence of pests and fungal diseases; in all treatments, no glyphosate residuality was detected in seeds; however, residuality was detected in other molecules derived from insecticides associated with the local production system. In conclusion, in plots with high weed pressure by Cyperus rotundus, the use of mulch is recommended as an alternative to maintain bean productivity over time; by offering protection against the effect of the herbicide on both the root system of the plant and the soil microbiota of the biofortified bean crop.

AB  - To conduct a comprehensive ecological analysis on the solid residues derived from the thermal disposal of hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata, this study focused on the behaviors of As and Pb and the characteristics of environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) in the solid residues under different thermal treatment conditions. The analysis results revealed that the concentrations of As in the biochars and bio-slag were approximately 350 and 1100 mg/kg, respectively. Moreover, the concentrations of Pb in the solid residues varied from 34 to 1050 mg/kg. According to the results of the modified BCR sequential extractions, As is more stable in the biochar while Pb is more stable in the combustion slags. In addition, As showed a higher volatilization temperature compared with Pb. The ecological risk assessment indicated that the correlation index between the contamination factor (C-f) of As and the risk index (R-2 = 0.995) is considerably larger than the correlation index between the contamination factor of Pb and the risk index (R-2 = 0.117), which implies that the pyrolysis method should be selected at priority. Moreover, the EPFR concentrations of the biochar declined by approximately 75 times when the pyrolysis temperature increased from 500 to 600 degrees C. This behavior indicated that high-temperature pyrolysis (>600 degrees C) could simultaneously control both the heavy metal behavior and EPFR concentrations.

AB  - Electric current stimulation has been shown to have a positive influence on heterotrophic denitrifying microbial viability and has the potential to improve wastewater denitrification performance. This study investigated the effects of varying current densities on microbial activity and NO3- removal efficiency under heterotrophic conditions.NDi removal rate was highest at an applied current density of 400 mA/m(2). However, the optimum removal efficiency of total inorganic nitrogen (TIN; 99%) was achieved when the current density was fixed at 200 mA/m(2). Accumulation of NH4+-N and NO2--N byproducts were also minimized at this current density. The activity of heterotrophic denitrifying microorganisms was much higher at both 200 and 400 mA/m(2). Moreover, the average adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) content (an indicator of cell metabolism) at a current density of 1600 mA/m(2) was lower than that under no current, indicating heterotrophic denitrifying microbial activity can be inhibited at high current densities. Hence, direct electrical stimulation on the activity of heterotrophic denitrifying microorganisms in the developed system should be lower than 1600 mA/m(2). This study improves the understanding of electric current influence on heterotrophic denitrifying microorganisms and promotes the intelligent application of direct electrical stimulation on wastewater treatment processes.

AB  - The markets globalization is one of the factors creating conditions for the development of entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship does not have one generally accepted definition. Most often, entrepreneurship is perceived as the ability to increase the number of enterprises. Entrepreneurship can be understood as the potential to identify and use development opportunities regardless of the own resources. Entrepreneurship is therefore associated with such areas as new organizational forms, stimulation of innovation and cooperation with the entrepreneurial environment. Unfortunately, enterprises face many difficulties which can have the supply and demand nature. These difficulties hinder the enterprise functioning on the market and its development. Logistics performance perceived as the implementation of the highest quality of logistics standards allows overcoming the difficulties of entrepreneurship, especially for the transport and storage sector. For this reason, the article aims to determine the relationship between logistics performance and the entrepreneurship rate for selected European Union countries. Logistics performance was determined by a synthetic measure of development estimated using numerical taxonomy methods for variables forming the Logistics Performance Index. The same method was used to build the entrepreneurship rate, accepting as variables selected entrepreneurship indicators for the transport and storage sector. The correlation analysis was performed with the use of the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. The years 2014-2016 were analyzed. The availability and completeness of data dictated the choice of years, countries and indicators for analysis. (C) 2019 GJESM. All rights reserved.

AB  - The pollution of the aquatic ecosystem is an issue with great concern all over the world and due to this fact a national and international call of urgency has been made for a better management and better policies of water resources. In assessing the water quality, classical methods are no longer sufficient to express the complexity of the effects that pollutants have over the environment. Therefore, advanced researches have been made to acquire better methods and instruments for a cleaner environment. Utilizing microorganism and their metabolic activity for evaluating the water condition is not totally new but the research over these methods is improved by every study that is made bringing fresh perspectives in this area. In order to evaluate the quality of water and sediment, samples have been taken from three main areas of Castailor Creek (upstream of the city, industrial area and downstream of Bistrita city). Some groups of microorganisms, used as pollution indicators, have been assessed, and also the effect of pollutants on creek micro biota. The physical-chemical parameters of water from different sampling points were also determined. The quantitative enzyme activity has been assessed: actual and potential dehydrogenase activity, catalase and phosphatase activities. Based on the results, the bacterial and enzymatic indicators of water and sediment quality from Castailor Creek were also calculated. The main purpose of this research is to assess microbiological and enzymological indicators of pollution in the water and sediment of Castailor Creek, Bistrita.

AB  - Peatlands support vital ecosystem services such as water regulation, specific habitat provisions and carbon storage. In Canada, anthropogenic disturbance from energy exploration has undermined the capacity of peatlands to support these vital ecosystem services, and thus presents the need for their reclamation to a functional ecosystem. As attempts are now being made to implement reclamation plans on post-mining oil sands landscapes, a major challenge remains in the absence of a standard framework for evaluating the functional state of a constructed peatland. To address this challenge, we present a functional-based approach that can guide the evaluation of constructed peatlands in the Alberta oil sands region. We achieved this by conducting a brief review, which synthesized the dominant processes of peatland functional development in natural analogues. Through the synthesis, we identified the interaction and feedback processes that underline various peatland ecosystem functions and their quantifiable variables. By exploring the mechanism of key ecosystem interactions, we highlighted the sensitivity of microbially mediated biogeochemical processes to a range of variability in other ecosystem functions, and thus the appropriateness of using them as functional indicators of ecosystem condition. Following the verification of this concept through current pilot fen reclamation projects, we advocate the need for further research towards modification to a more cost-efficient approach that can be applicable to large-scale fen reclamation projects in this region.

TI  - Waste-solvent management as an element of green chemistry: A comprehensive study on the swiss chemical industry
T2  - INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH
LA  - English
KW  - LIFE-CYCLE INVENTORY
AB  - The treatment of organic waste solvents is an important issue in the chemical industry as large amounts accrue annually. As all treatment options are associated with specific environmental impacts, a sound management of waste solvents can therefore lead to large ecological benefits. The goal of this work was therefore to identify opportunities and requirements for an environmentally sound waste-solvent management. To this end, a survey was carried out together with the Swiss chemical industry. The results show that only a few technologies are used on a grand scale, such as incineration and distillation for solvent recovery. But waste-solvent management is strongly influenced by boundary conditions such as costs, logistics, legislation and guidelines, storage capacity, safety considerations, and the existing technologies on the production site. Thus, we identified that the best opportunity to optimize waste-solvent management would be in an early stage of process design, for instance, before scale-up for the launching of the production or when production campaigns change. Two actual case studies from the chemical industry show how environmentally sound waste-solvent management can be integrated in the planning of a chemical company and lead to ecological benefits. In the first case study a company investigates different routes of waste-solvent treatment for waste streams which are treated outside the plant by third parties. In the second case study different options for the treatment of a dimethoxy ethane mixture are assessed, taking into account environmental impacts by a lifecycle perspective.

AB  - The capacity to learn enables animals to match their phenotypic response to a changing environment on the basis of experience but learning is likely to incur costs such as the cost of making mistakes or the energetic cost of processing information. Little is known about how animals optimize the use of learned behaviour within their natural environments such that potential costs are minimized. We investigated whether the use of local landmarks in learning orientation routes by the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, varied in response to the visual stability of their natural habitats. Sticklebacks collected from five fast-flowing rivers and five ponds were trained to locate a hidden reward in a T-maze. Locating the reward required the fish to learn a body-centred algorithmic behaviour (turn left or right) or to follow plant landmarks. Probe trials, in which these cues conflicted, revealed which spatial cue the fish was using. Pond fish appeared to rely more than river fish on visual landmarks, which is consistent with the suggestion that even within a species, learned behaviour is fine-tuned in response to local environmental conditions. Landmarks may be reliable indicators of location only in stable pond habitats. In rivers, turbulence and flow may continually disrupt the visual landscape such that river fish may benefit from learning orientation routes only if learning is constrained so that unreliable visual cues are ignored.

T2  - ECOSYSTEM HEALTH
LA  - English
AB  - A growing body of literature explores the links between the social and ecological dimensions of sustainability. However, much remains to be researched, especially concerning managed ecosystems. Costa Rica has approximately 25% of its area under some conservation regime; many of these protected areas, especially in and near urban areas, are under private ownership and management. Among these is the regime of the protected zones (PZ) that seeks to protect watershed resources. The achievement of conservation objectives in these areas will not only depend on ecological conditions but also on social and economic ones. This framework provides a good field in which to explore the interrelations between sustainability and ecosystem health. This study summarizes the work I participated in the last three years at the Center for Sustainable Development Studies in Costa Rica. We developed a holistic ecosystem health indicator (HEHI) for managed ecosystems. This indicator was tested several times in seven PZs in the east, south, and west sections of the central valley of Costa Rica. The evaluation tool includes measurements of productivity, organization, and resilience of the ecosystems. These were combined with social indicators and resource use patterns from the communities surrounding the PZs studied. The use of this indicator and the conclusions of this project could justify the use of an integral approach to address conservation problems in developing nations. The creation and management of these protected areas should be the result of a combined effort between community organizations and government agencies dealing with land distribution, zoning, and public health, among others.

EMA is increasingly used to study both within-person and between-person processes. We will review EMA studies investigating key health behaviours and synthesise: (1) study characteristics (eg, frequency of assessments, adherence, incentives), (2) associations between psychological predictors and behaviours and (3) moderators of adherence to EMA protocols. Methods and analysis This review will focus on EMA studies conducted across five public health behaviours in adult, non-clinical populations: movement behaviour (including physical activity and sedentary behaviour), dietary behaviour, alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking and preventive sexual health behaviours. Studies need to have assessed at least one psychological or contextual predictor of these behaviours. Studies reporting exclusively on physiological outcomes (eg, cortisol) or those not conducted under free-living conditions will be excluded. We will search OVID MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and Web of Science using terms relevant to EMA and the selected health behaviours. Reference lists of existing systematic reviews of EMA studies will be hand searched. Identified articles will be screened by two reviewers. This review is expected to provide a comprehensive summary of EMA studies assessing psychological or contextual predictors of five public health behaviours. Ethics and dissemination The results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations. Data from included studies will be made available to other researchers. No ethics are required. PROSPERO registration number CRD42020168314.

AB  - Aquatic bryophytes are widely used as indicators of water pollution with various substances, including metals. We present a first study concerning the feasibility of Monosoleum tenerum to remove potentially toxic metals Zn, Cu, Ni, Mn and Fe from water. The novel approach to study the bioaccumulation under controlled conditions and in vitro grown aquarium liverworts was applied. The plants were exposed to 1, 10 and 100 ppm multi-metal solution for 7 days and subsequently the metal content was determined in plant material and media to calculate the bioaccumulation factor (BAF). The study revealed various accumulation behavior (metal and dose dependent), which followed the order of Cu > Zn > Mn > Ni > Fe for 1 ppm; Zn > Cu > Mn > Fe > Ni for 10 ppm and Cu > Fe > Zn > Ni > Mn for 100 ppm solution. However, with increasing Cu, Mn and Ni concentration in the solution, BAF decreased. For Zn the highest BAF value (136) was obtained for the 10 ppm solution. Fe bioaccumulation increased with the increasing solution concentration. After 7 week exposure, the results indicated highest accumulation of Cu (3,25 mg) followed by Fe (1,8 mg) in the plant tissue for the 100 ppm solution. Overall, the bryophyte M. tenerum demonstrate high potential for the removal of toxic metals from the multi-metal solution via accumulation in plant tissue. The BAF values were proper to indicate the use of M. tenerum for phytofiltration of waste waters affected by Zn, Cu, Ni, Mn and Fe.

AB  - The reduced natural water sources on the one hand and the large amount of wastewater produced by the textile industry on the other hand lead to the requirement of an effective reuse of textile wastewater. In this study, the treatment of textile wastewater by the reverse osmosis membrane system and membrane capacitive deionization (MCDI) system has been investigated to improve the quality and the recovery rate of the effluent for reclamation. The maximum chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency obtained at 10bar was 96.3% for BW30 reverse osmosis membrane. Diversified operating conditions, including working voltage and flow rate, were investigated systematically in the MCDI system which is an effective water purification technology. According to the obtained experimental results, the COD removal efficiency was thoroughly increased by rising the working voltage (from 0.2 to 1.2V) and the flow rate (from 5 to 17.5ml/min). The flow rate and the working voltage at which the COD from textile wastewater removal ratio was the highest were 10ml/min and 1.2V, respectively. A life cycle approach has also been implemented for the comparison of environmental impact assessment of the two desalination systems. In this study, a life cycle approach has been implemented for the comparison of environmental friendly impact assessment of the two desalination systems. It is concluded that MCDI system is much more environmental friendlier with 5641 times less values for damage assessment categories, on average.

AB  - This study aimed to detect triazine pesticides and their metabolites in the drip water of the Amaterska cave system (Moravian karst, Czech Republic). Ecotoxicological tests were used to assess the risk of selected herbicides (i.e. atrazine and terbuthylazine) and their metabolites (atrazinedesethyl, atrazine-desisopropyl, terbuthylazinedesethyl) in the drip water by means of bioassays with selected bioindicators. Tests were conducted on organisms representing all trophic levels of the aquatic ecosystem: producer algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and macrophyte duckweed Lemna minor, a consumer water flea Daphnia magna, and decomposer bacterium Vibrio fischeri. Effects of herbicides on edaphon representatives were measured by testing the reproductive inhibition of enchytraeids Enchytraeus crypticus.
   Triazines and their metabolites were analysed in the drip water of the Amaterska cave system sampled at a site under agricultural cropland. Standard methods were used for testing procedures: OECD 201 (Freshwater algal growth inhibition test), OECD 221 (Lemna sp. Growth Inhibition Test), OECD 202 (Inhibition of the mobility of Daphnia magna), ISO 11348-2 (Inhibitory effect of water samples on the light emission of Vibrio fischeri) and OECD 220 (Enchytraeid Reproduction Test).
   Drip water samples were examined for 350 substances. Six pesticides above the limit of quantification were identified; all of these substances belong to the triazine pesticide group. The performed experiments showed no evidence of acute toxicity of the drip water. However, accumulation in the environment and chronic toxicity could not be ruled out. The ecotoxicity of selected herbicides and their metabolites differed significantly depending on the test organism and testing conditions.

AB  - Of all terrestrial ecosystems in North America, grasslands are the most threatened. With continued threats and increased fragmentation of North American prairies, there is a need for proper identification of the remaining functional prairie remnant patches. In this study, we propose the Southern Dogface butterfly, Zerene cesonia, may serve as an indicator for identifying functional prairie remnant patches. To formally test for indicator status we focus on the critically imperiled Black Belt prairie. We investigated the relationship between Pierid, sulphur, butterflies, prairie host plant distributions, and environmental conditions (soil pH and area) across several grassland sites in the Black Belt region of Mississippi. The Black Belt is a grassland association that is understudied and poorly known outside of its local region. The Black Belt system hosts many species of flora and fauna either native or disjunct from the Great Plains. One such species is Z. cesonia, which is observed to be limited in its distribution to prairie grasslands. The results from field observations showed that Z. cesonia is clear indicator of prairie remnant patches. The results from laboratory oviposition experiments show Z. cesonia has a strong preference for prairie clover, (Dalea purpurea). Collectively, these results suggest Z. cesonia has an association with prairie remnants that may be driven by its preference of prairie clover as its larval host. Broadly, this study provides an example of how butterfly communities and their environmental interactions can be used to assess grassland function and conservation efforts.

AB  - The main aim of the work was to show the degree of renewable energy use in the European Union countries. All European Union member states were selected for research purposefully. The research period concerned the years 2004-2016. The sources of materials were EUROSTAT data, domestic and foreign literature. For the analysis and presentation of materials, descriptive, tabular, graphical methods, dynamics indicators with a fixed base, Gini concentration coefficient, concentration analysis using the Lorenzo curve, grapf of kernel density estimation, Pearson's linear correlation coefficients were used. Energy obtained from renewable sources enables solving problems related to the depletion of conventional energy sources and is very important to protect the natural environment. The share of renewable energy in total energy consumption in EU countries has been systematically growing and was not dependent on economic factors. There was a high concentration of renewable energy consumption in couple of EU countries. The market was very stable. Biofuels were the dominant source of renewable energy in almost all countries. The use from other sources was not dependent on the level of economic development, but on natural topographical and climatic conditions. There was a strong positive relationship between the share of forests in the country's area and the share of renewable energy in total energy consumption. This was due to the fact that biomass from forests was the main source of renewable energy in most countries. In this way, countries tried to meet the limits imposed by the EU.

AB  - This paper presents results of two monitoring programs carried out in two decades during April 1993-May 1994, and April 2015 May 2016 in the East Wadi of El-Kebiri, a protected area (PNEK) of eastern Numidia (northeastern Algeria). Monitoring was located in areas with different degrees of anthropogenic impacts. Selected environmental variables were recorded during the monitoring periods.. The Odonata fauna and biological indices were used to characterize development of the study area, after two decades and to assess the quality of the environment. The alteration of this river has resulted in a marked simplification of the original (1993-1994) odonatological fauna. Over the past two decades, odonatological species richness has decreased from 14 to 7 species inventoried during the 1993 and 2015 seasons. The phenology of adult was extended until early December 2015, possibly as a result of global warming. Odonata are identified as useful as indicators of environmental change in the monitored river systems. The majority of species such as the Gomphidae are not tolerant of increased contamination and changes in structure of the river. Only some species such as Lestes vridis, Platycnemis subdilatata, Ischnura graellsii and Ceriagrion tenellum, appear to be adapted to changed conditions and became dominant in heavily disturbed sites. The species disappeared from these sites are clearly associated with good water quality and less disturbance, which highlights the importance of the conservation of the habitats of freshwater and regular monitoring

AB  - The restoration of endangered relict populations is challenging in conservation biology because they require specific environmental conditions within an inhospitable regional climate. Urothemis edwardsii Selys is the most endangered dragonfly in the Mediterranean with only one known relict small population (Lac Bleu) left in Northeast Algeria. With the absence of successful (re-)colonization over the last two decades, the restoration of the species became a top priority. To improve the status of the species in Northeast Algeria, we carried out a reintroduction and translocation scheme during 2011-2015 and assessed the changes in distribution and population size. Our restoration plan led to the emergence of three populations of which one was restored (Lac Noir), one resulted from successful translocation (Lac Tonga Northeast), and one established after successful colonization (Lac Tonga Southwest). In three localities (Lac Noir, Lac Tonga Northeast, and Lac Tonga Southwest), signs of population growth were observed, whereas no significant trend in the source population (Lac Bleu) was detected. A new population (El Graeate) was also recorded in 2015, but its origin is uncertain. Capture-mark-recapture on adults conducted in 2015 in two sites (Lac Bleu and Lac Noir) showed low recapture rates and no sign of dispersal between the two sites. Dispersal capacity of the species and conservation implications of adult distribution are discussed. This study highlights the importance of using biological indicators in selecting host habitats for the restoration of critically threatened populations.

AB  - Recent works have indicated that climate change in the northeastern United States is already being observed in the form of shorter winters, higher annual average air temperature, and more frequent extreme heat and precipitation events. These changes could have profound effects on aquatic ecosystems, and the implications of such changes are less understood. The objective of this study was to examine how future changes in precipitation and temperature translate into changes in streamflow using a physically based semidistributed model, and subsequently how changes in streamflow could potentially impact stream ecology. Stream-flow parameters were examined in a New York City water supply watershed for changes from model-simulated baseline conditions to future climate scenarios (2081-2100) for ecologically relevant factors of streamflow using the Indicators of Hydrologic Alterations tool. Results indicate that earlier snowmelt and reduced snowpack advance the timing and increase the magnitude of discharge in the winter and early spring (November-March) and greatly decrease monthly streamflow later in the spring in April. Both the rise and fall rates of the hydrograph will increase resulting in increased flashiness and flow reversals primarily due to increased pulses during winter seasons. These shifts in timing of peak flows, changes in seasonal flow regimes, and changes in the magnitudes of low flow can all influence aquatic organisms and have the potential to impact stream ecology.

AB  - Question
   Can discriminant analysis be used to quantify ecological change? Can fossil pollen data be used as a proxy to quantify moisture availability change through discriminant analysis?
   Location
   Lake Sauce, Amazonian piedmont of Peru.
   Methods
   A linear discriminant function was used to classify taxa found through pollen analysis into wet and dry indicators. The data set was filtered to exclude rare taxa from the analysis. Given that after application of the filter there were more variables (samples) than observations (taxa), the model was "de-saturated" through simulation of samples based on the existing data set.
   Results
   The inclusion of taxa that have a relative abundance of 1% or more in at least 5% of the samples reduces noise in the data set. Application of discriminant analysis to pollen data gave an error of 18% when classifying taxa by affinity with dry or wet conditions. The inferred moisture availability curve shows consistency with independent proxies from the same core and with identified local and sub-continental moisture patterns.
   Conclusions
   The method provides a reliable means to reduce a complex paleoecological data set to proportional change in a single pre-defined variable. The output is a relative scale of change of a defined environmental gradient through time, without reliance on an extensive array of modern analogues. The results appear to provide a comparable quality of information to that of isotopic analysis derived from speleothem or sedimentary records.

AB  - An understanding of the complex effects of the environment on biomarkers of bivalve health is essential for aquaculturists to successfully select field culture sites and monitor bivalve health in these sites and in hatcheries. We tested several whole-organism (functional) and cellular-level biomarkers as indicators of health of the cultured, stress-tolerant northern quahog (hard clam) Mercenaria mercenaria. We performed single- and dual-stressor experiments that were consistent with available water quality data from a clam culture area on the Gulf coast of Florida. Clams from the culture area were exposed over a 14-d period to low 02 (hypoxia), elevated temperature, hyposalinity, and a combination of elevated temperature and hyposalinity. There was no clear relationship between the functional and cellular-level biomarkers, with most of the treatment effects being detected at the whole-organism level but not the cellular level. Survival and burial ability were significantly affected by elevated temperature and by the combination of elevated temperature and hyposalinity. Glycogen content decreased over the experiment duration and did not differ significantly among treatments. There were no significant changes in expression patterns of eight stress proteins or in the levels of oxidatively damaged RNA. The results highlight the importance of investigating the effects of multiple stressors in short-term, controlled laboratory conditions and suggest that such cellular-level biomarker assays should be paired with functional biomarkers to better understand the responses of highly stress-tolerant species.

AB  - Ozone biomonitoring is a detection and monitoring technique that involves documenting ozone-induced visible injury to known ozone-sensitive species under conditions of ambient exposure. The USDA Forest Service administers a long-term, nationwide ozone biomonitoring program to address public and scientific concerns about ozone impacts on forest health. A systematic grid is used as the basis for biomonitoring site locations. At each site, trained field crews evaluate a maximum of thirty plants of up to six species and record the amount and severity of leaf-injury on individual plants. Injury from ozone was found more often on biomonitoring sites in the eastern Unites States than in the interior or west-coast areas. Further results from the northeast reveal that in any year, there is a higher percentage of ozone-injured plants with more severe symptoms in areas with relatively high ozone concentrations than in areas with relatively low ozone. In very dry years ( e. g., 1999) the percentage of injured plants and injury severity estimates are both sharply reduced even though ambient ozone exposures are high. These findings demonstrate that biomonitoring data provide meaningful evidence of when high ozone concentrations during the growing season have biological significance. Any assessment of ozone stress in the forest environment must include both biomonitoring (i. e., plant response) and air quality data to be complete.

AB  - Millar Western Forest Products Ltd. manages a forest in west-central Alberta under a Forest Management Agreement (FMA) with the Government of Alberta. Part of Millar Western's planning process brought researchers together to develop a decision support system (DSS) for forest management planning and monitoring programs. Four modules - timber supply, biodiversity, FIRE, and WATER - were built to evaluate, with the help of indicators of sustainable forest management, current and future forest conditions predicted from computer simulations of alternative management scenarios. In the first round of assessment four management scenarios, distinct by their level of silviculture intensification and by the spatial clearcut layout pattern, were compared. Such comparison has demonstrated that (1) the current forest management scenario improved moose habitat at the expense of timber supply, (2) all scenarios had similar fire risk, (3) generated increases in peak flow and water yield of selected watersheds, and (4) slightly impoverished forest biodiversity. All scenarios were examined in light of a computer-simulated natural disturbance benchmark. This led to landscape design scenarios to reduce fire risk and balance biodiversity indicators with timber supply objectives, one of which was eventually selected for implementation. The company's monitoring and research program is also highly focused on improving DSS modules and the underlying data, hence its association with the Forest Watershed and Riparian Disturbance (FORWARD) project, which considers the effects of forest management on aquatic ecosystem indicators.

AB  - In this study we used the diversity of soil and litter arthropods as a metric for evaluating the ecological effects of silvicultural practices of various intensities in a loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) forest ecosystem. The treatments included low and high intensity harvesting, soil bedding, chemical herbicide application, and nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization. Soil and litter cores were used to sample arthropods after harvesting. In the first year following removal of trees, species diversity was higher in hand-fell, hole-only harvested plots than in mechanical, whole-tree harvested plots and higher in non-bedded plots than in bedded plots. However, these differences did not persist into the second year following harvesting. The recovery of undergrowth vegetation in the second year and the development of a rudimentary litter layer may have increased diversity in the more intensively treated plots. Arthropod species richness increased following nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization, but Shannon diversity did not. This indicates that the arthropod community had responded to fertilization with a shift in community composition. The rapid recovery of arthropod diversity in the second year following tree removal suggests that the silvicultural treatments used at this site did not put long-term productivity at risk. Comparisons with other similar studies suggest that when aiming for sustainable forest management, the particular silvicultural practices that allow for ecosystem recovery may depend on local and regional conditions.

AB  - We hypothesize that several characteristics of a country's institutional environment encourage firms to agglomerate. To test our hypotheses, we examine the collocation pattern of 931 plant investments made by 266 firms across 29 countries in the global semiconductor industry from 1975 to 2004. The results show that the decision to agglomerate is strongly dependent on a country's institutional context. Specifically, firms prefer to agglomerate when investing within countries with collectivist cultures, and those characterized by political and economic uncertainty. We assess the robustness of the results across multiple indicators of these institutional conditions.

AB  - Spectral gamma ray measurements on two sections of the SW-German Posidonia Shale (Lower Toarcian, Dotternhausen and Holzmaden) are compared to geochemical, palaeoecological and sedimentological data. All investigated parameters are related to the temporal evolution of the sea-level during the early Toarcian. During maximum flooding, condensation phenomena occurred, coinciding with maximum uranium accumulation rates. In contrast, highest concentrations of potassium and thorium are connected with lower sea-levels. The Th/U ratio can be used as an indicator of redox-conditions within the depositional environment. Spectral gamma-ray measurements offer a powerful tool for sequence stratigraphic and palaeoenvironmental interpretations of marine black shales.

AB  - In this study, we focused on integrating remote sensing techniques and MaxEnt modeling to develop a restoration approach to determine and rank hotspots for revegetation and restoration planning of native desert plant communities. The results showed that the distribution of suitable habitats for native desert communities varied according to climatic, bioclimatic, soil, and topographic factors. Cyperus species occur in deep loose soil, while Rhanterium species predominate on gypsums or calcareous soils growing in areas that contain a thin layer of gravel. Communities such as Cyperus and Haloxylon were not influenced by the wet seasons, making them suitable for restoration because of their resiliency to grow under harsh and drought seasons. Based on the results, a vegetation restoration approach was designed, which classifies the locations into three categories: community management sites (appropriate sites for one community), restoration sites (appropriate sites for two communities), and prioritized restoration sites (appropriate sites for more than three communities). Limited sites were ranked as prioritized restoration sites, making it essential to consider these locations as optimum hotspot sites for future restoration and revegetation. We concluded that the integrated approach helped develop a detailed vegetation community map that ranked suitability habitats based on several environmental factors, which could be used as biological indicators for restoration planning. The vegetation restoration approach is also functional for regional-scale studies to identify and rank hotspot locations for revegetation and restoration planning.

AB  - In recent years, the phenomenon of abandonment of arable fields has increased in Saudi Arabia due to low soil fertility, drought, low rainfall, high levels of evapotranspiration, soil salinization, and low level of groundwater. We evaluated the effect of agricultural land abandonment on soil properties, perennial vegetation composition, and population structure in the Al-Kharj region, Saudi Arabia. A total of 11 perennial plant species belonging to 9 families and 11 genera were detected in the different abandoned fields of the study area. Four plant communities were identified after the application of the detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) ordination. The indicator species were (1) Seidlitzia rosmarinus-Zygophyllum hamiense, (2) Traganum nudatum-Seidlitzia rosmarinus, (3) Traganum nudatum-Prosopis farcta, and (4) Calligonum comosum-Pulicaria undulata. Results of the soil analysis showed significant differences in soil texture, pH, salinity, and nutrient content among the four recognized plant communities. Demographic analysis indicated that populations of Zygophyllum hamiense and Calligonum comosum tended to be either inverse J-shaped or positively skewed which may have indicated rapidly-growing populations with high reproductive capacity. Conversely, the size-frequency distribution of Traganum nudatum, S. Rosmarinus, and Prosopis farcta was approximately symmetrical (i.e., bell-shaped). The present study sheds light on the necessity of managing abandoned agricultural fields for restoring and improving rangelands with native species that are adapted to the local conditions such as low water demand.

AB  - This simulation study is aimed to model a contemporary Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) CHP system having a 'heat and power' autonomy as well as a provision of demand-driven electrical supply to the grid. A novel nanowire-electrode PEMFC stack is adopted within this PEMFC CHP system so to effectively replace the existing natural gas fuelled durable solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) CHP system installed at David Wilson Millennium Eco-house at University of Nottingham. The energy savings, environmental, and economic performances of the proposed PEMFC system are determined and compared to the base case (SOFC) which is operated continuously to maintain a 1.5 kWe. While to meetup the highly fluctuating and seasonal demands of heating and power like in the UK, a PEMFC is more productive and advantageous over a SOFC. The proposed PEMFC unlike to the SOFC will be able to operate and adjust its output and turn down instantly as per changing conditions of ambient temperatures and loads in terms of electricity and heat. The results of the modelling predicted that as compared to the base case scenario, this PEMFC CHP system will efficiently reduce an annual CO2 emission by 65.99% and fiscal costs by 66.74% with a viable internal rate of return as 8.93% and benefit to cost ratio as 1.02.

AB  - Reproductive management of livestock is the foremost requirement for increasing production from any dairy animal. High reproductive efficiency can be achieved by implementation of one of the crucial management practices which involves early differentiation of pregnant and non-pregnant animals. The early and precise pregnancy diagnosis is the major problem in Bubalus bubalis (buffalo) due to absence of estrous signs instead of normal cyclicity of reproductive organs. Therefore, in the present study, one of the conceptus derived protein interferon stimulated protein (15 kDa) released during 18 to 21 days after insemination in response to implantation of embryo was in silico characterized. The protein expressed by interferon-stimulated gene-15 (ISG15) was analyzed by isolation and sequencing of coding region of mRNA. The primary and secondary structures were predicted from the protein sequence to decipher the interaction of ISG15 protein with other molecules. The functional characterization identifies various motifs present in ISG15 protein which are responsible for its interaction with other proteins. Physiochemical properties predicted the ISG15 protein nature during in vitro conditions which are required for any of the assays development. In addition, immunogenic studies revealed ISG15 protein is strongly antigenic in nature and can be used for antibody production. In conclusion, ISG15 protein expression from buffalo is a good indicator of conceptus implantation and has suitable properties for being used as target to develop early pregnancy diagnostic kits.

AB  - The impact of anthropogenic activities on breeding bird populations are typically assessed using nest success despite the importance of the postfledging period and juvenile survival for the population dynamics of many birds. Using a combination of radio telemetry data collected between 2012 and 2014, and long-term monitoring data collected between 2005 and 2016, we evaluated whether postfledging survival of Yellow Warblers (Setophagapetechia) is affected when their riparian nesting habitat becomes inundated by the Upper Arrow Lakes Reservoir in the Columbia River Valley near Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada. Thirty-eight percent of radio-tagged fledglings (n = 26) survived for at least 21 days after leaving the nest. Radio-tagged birds that fledged from nests in territories that were inundated by water tended to be have lower survival than those that fledged from nests in territories that were not inundated by water. Local recruitment was low (6.4%, n = 438). Local recruitment was nevertheless positively affected by nestling condition prior to fledging. Fledglings from territories that were not inundated by water also tended to be more likely to recruit locally than those that fledged from territories that were inundated by water. In both cases, we estimated that reservoir operations that flooded habitat reduced postfledging survival or local recruitment by approximately 50%. Our study emphasizes the importance of considering the postfledging period when developing mitigation measures or management plans aimed at minimizing the impact of anthropogenic activities on bird populations.

AB  - In indoor air, terpene-ozone reactions can form secondary organic aerosols (SOA) in a transient process. 'Real world' measurements conducted in a furnished room without air conditioning were modelled involving the indoor background of airborne particulate matter, outdoor ozone infiltrated by natural ventilation, repeated transient limonene evaporations, and different subsequent ventilation regimes. For the given setup, we disentangled the development of nucleated, coagulated, and condensed SOA fractions in the indoor air and calculated the time dependence of the aerosol mass fraction (AMF) by means of a process model. The AMF varied significantly between 0.3 and 5.0 and was influenced by the ozone limonene ratio and the background particles which existed prior to SOA formation. Both influencing factors determine whether nucleation or adsorption processes are preferred; condensation is strongly intensified by particulate background. The results provide evidence that SOA levels in natural indoor environments can surpass those known from chamber measurements. An indicator for the SOA forming potential of limonene was found to be limona ketone. Multiplying its concentration (in mu g/m(3)) by 450(100) provides an estimate of the concentration of the reacted limonene. This can be used to detect a high particle formation potential due to limonene pollution, e.g. in epidemiological studies considering adverse health effects of indoor air pollutants.

AB  - Hippuric acid (HA) and 4-methylhippuric acid (4-MHA) are metabolites as well as biological indicators for toluene and xylenes, respectively, and their determination in urine samples is very important, in order to monitor the occupational exposition to these solvents, ensuring a safe working environment. Thus, this paper describes the synthesis and characterization of a probe impregnated with molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) for the solid-phase extraction of HA and 4-MHA directly from untreated urine samples followed by micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) analyses. The MIP probe selectivity was compared to the non-imprinted polymer probe. The MEKC separations were carried out in 50 mmol/L sodium tetraborate pH 10.0/0.5 mmol/L cetyltrimethylammonium bromide aqueous solution, with a constant voltage of -15 kV. The system variables were optimized to provide ideal conditions for the extraction and desorption of the analytes, as well as for the MEKC analyses. The method was linear from 0.5 to 5.0 g/L for both analytes, with correlation coefficients >0.994. Precisions and accuracies, expressed as relative standard deviation and relative error, were < 20.0 and within -15.4 to 16.6%, respectively, in accordance with the United States Food and Drug Administration recommendation. The MIP probe has proven to be simple, cheap, resistant, and synthetically reproducible, being successfully used to analyze both HA and 4-MHA from real samples.

AB  - We collected field and remotely sensed data spanning 10 years after three 2003 Montana wildfires to monitor ecological change across multiple temporal and spatial scales. Multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis was used to create post-fire maps of: char, soil, green (GV) and non-photosynthetic (NPV) vegetation from high-resolution 2003 hyperspectral (HS) and 2007 QuickBird (QB) imagery, and from Landsat 5 and 8 imagery collected on anniversary dates in 2002, 2003 (post fire), 2004, 2007 and 2013. Initial estimates of char and NPV from the HS images were significantly correlated with their ground-measured counterparts (rho = 0.60 (P = 0.03) and 0.68 (P = 0.01) respectively), whereas HS GV and Landsat GV were correlated with canopy GV (rho = 0.75 and 0.70 (P = 0.003) respectively). HS imagery had stronger direct correlations with all classes of fine-scale ground data than Landsat and also had stronger predictive correlations with 10-year canopy data (rho = 0.65 (P = 0.02) to 0.84 (P = 0.0003)). There was less than 5% understorey GV cover on the sites initially, but by 2013, it had increased to nearly 60% regardless of initial condition. The data suggest it took twice as long for understorey GV and NPV to replace char and soil as primary ground cover components on the high-burn-severity sites compared with other sites.

AB  - The high-throughput acquisition of metabolome data is greatly anticipated for the complete understanding of cellular metabolism in living organisms. A variety of analytical technologies have been developed to acquire large-scale metabolic profiles under different biological or environmental conditions. Time series data are useful for predicting the most likely metabolic pathways because they provide important information regarding the accumulation of metabolites, which implies causal relationships in the metabolic reaction network. Considerable effort has been undertaken to utilize these data for constructing a mathematical model merging system properties and quantitatively characterizing a whole metabolic system in toto. However, there are technical difficulties between benchmarking the provision and utilization of data. Although, hundreds of metabolites can be measured, which provide information on the metabolic reaction system, simultaneous measurement of thousands of metabolites is still challenging. In addition, it is nontrivial to logically predict the dynamic behaviors of unmeasurable metabolite concentrations without sufficient information on the metabolic reaction network. Yet, consolidating the advantages of advancements in both metabolomics and mathematical modeling remain to be accomplished. This review outlines the conceptual basis of and recent advances in technologies in both the research fields. It also highlights the potential for constructing a large-scale mathematical model by estimating model parameters from time series metabolome data in order to comprehensively understand metabolism at the systems level.

AB  - There is a need to assess the impact of different farming methods on soil quality and fertility in specific ecoregions. Soil biochemical parameters and soil enzymatic activity appear very useful in monitoring soil pollution and management practices and can be used as indicators of sustainability. Soil chemical properties, biological properties and soil enzymatic activity (urease, acid and alkaline phosphatase) were investigated at six sites under ecological farming (no pesticides, organic fertilizers and crop rotation) and six sites under a conventional farming (pesticides and mineral fertilizers) system. A comparative study was performed during years 2008-2011 under production conditions in the investigated areas, situated in the marginal region of north-eastern Slovakia. Research showed that high doses of organic fertilizers had positive effect on soil productivity, and thus indirectly on maintaining soil pH and accumulation of humus in soil. The values of soil enzyme activities changed minimally during the research period. Statistically significant effect of experimental year and locality on all observed soil parameters was confirmed by analysis of variance. Large differences between the two sites were found in terms of microbiological properties, which are sensitive soil indicators of changes occurred under different farming systems. The study confirmed the positive influence and higher microbial activity indices of ecological farming (36% higher enzymatic activity, 65% higher soil respiration content, 60% higher soil microbial biomass carbon content) compared with conventional farming system.

AB  - This study investigated whether filamentous algal species commonly found in nearshore public beach water systems provide protection from natural UV to bacteria present in the same environmental settings. To test this hypothesis, Cladophora spp., a filamentous nuisance algae group causing undesired water quality in the Great Lakes region was selected and its interactions with a non-pathogenic indicator organism Escherichia coli and a pathogenic strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium were tested. In laboratory microcosms where the lake environment and natural sunlight conditions were simulated, a 7-log removal of E. coli was observed in only six hours of exposure to UV with an initial seed concentration of 10(3) CFU mL(-1). With the presence of algae, the same log removal was achieved in 16 hours. At higher seed concentrations of 10(5) CFU mL(-1), E. coli survived for two days with an extended survival up to 11 days in the presence of Cladophora spp. S. typhimurium has shown more resilient survival profiles, with the same log removals achieved in 14 and 20 days for low and high seed concentrations respectively, in the absence of algae. Cladophora spp. caused extended protection for S. typhimurium with much less log reductions reported. Algae-mediated protection from UV irradiation was attributed to certain organic carbon exuded from Cladophora spp. In addition, confocal microscopy images confirmed close interaction between bacteria and algae, more prominent with thin filamentous Cladophora spp.

AB  - Approximately 70,000 m(3) of salvinia (Salvinia molesta) was removed from the Hawkesbury-Nepean River, New South Wales (NSW), Australia, during 2004. This Study assessed the risks associated with applying compost prepared from aquatic weeds (AWC) to land, namely, Survival and spread of aquatic and terrestrial weeds, eutrophication of waterways, accumulation of heavy metals and phytotoxicity. The results demonstrate composting is an effective method of reducing the viability of aquatic and terrestrial weeds. However, mortality of alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides), which was used as an indicator plant, was significantly (P < 0.001) correlated with the temperature within the windrows and the length of time the material was subjected to composting. Conditions within the central core of the windrow were sufficient to kill the alligator weed, although not all of the aquatic weed material was exposed to the windrows' central core. This resulted in alligator weed continuing to grow at the base of the windrow. To reduce the risk of weeds surviving and spreading in aquatic and terrestrial environments it is suggested compost windrows should be located on an appropriate hard pad to enable complete mixing of the material and ensure all material is exposed to temperatures >55 degrees C for greater than three consecutive days. The likelihood of other risks associated with the AWC was low. If composting is selected as the preferred method for managing organic material harvested from waterways, then ongoing monitoring and evaluation is required to validate the composting process and ensure consumer confidence in the final product.

AB  - Green methanol could play a major role in decarbonising both the chemical and energy sectors. While techno-economic and environmental studies on green methanol following a life-cycle perspective are available, its social implications from a supply-chain standpoint remain largely unexplored. In order to fill this gap, this work presents the first social life cycle assessment of green methanol produced with CO2 directly captured from the air and hydrogen from wind power electrolysis. When compared to conventional methanol from natural gas, the results suggest an unfavourable performance of green methanol under negative social indicators (forced labour, women in the sectoral labour force, health expenditure, social responsibility promotion, and fair salary) due to the increased supply-chain complexity of the green system. In contrast, green methanol would outperform its conventional counterpart in terms of sectoral contribution to economic development, a positive social indicator which would benefit from the increase in working hours. Besides future consideration of a higher number of positive indicators and potential improvements in country- and sector-specific risk levels towards high-quality social and working conditions, an enhanced social life-cycle performance of green methanol requires technical improvements to reduce the high demand for energy inputs and equipment across its supply chain. Acknowledging decarbonisation as the actual driver of green methanol deployment, future social studies are suggested to focus on the comparison of renewable alternatives for its production and the effect of social regulations.

AB  - Forests are critically important for the provision of ecosystem services. The Sacramento Mountains of New Mexico, USA, are a hotspot for conservation management and the Mescalero Apache Tribe's homeland. The multiple ecosystem services and functions and its high vulnerability to changes in climate conditions make their forests of ecological, cultural, and social importance. We used data from the Mescalero Apache Tribal Lands (MATL) Continuous Forest Inventory over 30 yr to analyze changes in the structure and composition of ecosystems as well as trends in ecosystem services. Many provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services were shared among the MATL ecosystems and were tied to foundational species dominance, which could serve as a reliable indicator of ecosystem functioning. Our analysis indicates that the MATL are in an ongoing transition from conifer forests to woodlands with declines in two foundation species, quaking aspen and ponderosa pine, linked to past forest management and changing climate. In addition, we detected a decrease in species richness and tree size variability, amplifying the risk of forest loss in a rapid climatic change. Continuous permanent plots located on a dense grid (1 x 1 km) such as the ones monitored by the Bureau of Indian Affairs are the most detailed data available to estimate forests multiresource transitions over time. Native lands across the USA could serve as the leading edge of detecting decadal-scale forest changes and tracking climate impacts.

AB  - Aggregated mining development has direct and indirect impacts on vegetation changes. This impact shows spatial differences due to the complex influence of multiple mines, which is a common issue in resource regions. To estimate the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation response to mining activities, we coupled vegetation changes and mining development through a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model for three cumulative periods between 1999 and 2018 in integrated resource regions of northwestern China. Vegetation changes were monitored by Sen's slope and the Mann-Kendall test according to a total of 72 Landsat images. Spatial distribution of mining development was quantified, due to four land-use maps in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2017. The results showed that 80% of vegetation in the study area experienced different degrees of degradation, more serious in the overlapping areas of multiple mines and mining areas. The scope of influence for single mines on vegetation shrunk by about 48%, and the mean coefficients increased by 20%, closer to mining areas. The scope of influence for multiple mines on vegetation gradually expanded to 86% from the outer edge to the inner overlapping areas of mining areas, where the mean coefficients increased by 92%. The correlation between elevation and vegetation changes varied according to the average elevation of the total mining areas. Ultimately, the available ecological remediation should be systematically considered for local conditions and mining consequences.

AB  - In this work, simple raw materials and reaction conditions were used to synthesize a versatile nanoprobe using a one-step method. Graphene quantum dot (GQD) and gold chloride were mixed and irradiated with ultra-violet (UV) radiation for 1 min. Then, the gold nanosphere cluster with the diameter of 50 nm and coated using GQD was formed using a facile one-step approach. GQD played the roles of reducing agent, stabilizer and drug carrier instead of a harmful reducing agent or stabilizer. The nanoprobe had good dispersion, stability, excellent photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and computed tomography (CT) imaging performance, low cytotoxicity and photothermal conversion efficiency of up to 51.31%. The results for cell and animal experiments showed that targeted PAI/CT imaging of tumor after modification of folic acid (FA) could be obtained using the probe. Meanwhile, after the adsorption of doxorubicin, the chemo-photothermal combined therapy for tumor could be carried out through controlled drug release from GQD under heated and acidic environment of tumor. Additionally, the treatment effect was significantly superior to single modes. The body weight, Hematoxylin and Eeosin (H&E) staining of main organs and blood biochemical indicators showed that the probe had good biological safety after injection. The current work proposes a new dual-mode bio-imaging and chemo-photothermal combined therapy nanoprobe, which presents good application prospect for tumor theragnostic.

AB  - Pollen in the surface sediment collected in a transect from sea to land in the Coringa mangrove wetland was analysed to determine the spatial and quantitative composition of the pollen record for palaeoecological interpretation. Autochthonous pollen preservation of the existing mangrove species was predominant in the sediments and serves as a potential indicator of coastal wetlands. The low quantity of allochthonous and parautochthonous pollen in the sediment reflects the regional plant community. Statistical analysis of the palynological data shows a high association between pollen from Avicennia marina and Clerodendrum inerme and their vegetation. Aegiceras corniculatum, Sonneratia, Ceriops decandra, Xylocarpus mekongenesis, Cocos nucifera, Azadirachta indica, Syzygium, Chenopodiaceae, Poaceae and Cyperaceae show overrepresentation. Ordination techniques for individual species using fidelity and dispersibility indices and regression analyses suggest four different floristic groups, of (i) high dispersibility-moderate fidelity taxa; (ii) high dispersibility-low fidelity taxa; (iii) moderate dispersibility-low fidelity taxa; and (iv) low dispersibility-high fidelity taxa. Species with high fidelity and moderate-low dispersibility indices could be used to identify the vegetation types in sedimentary sequences. The presence of discriminatory taxa (Avicennia marina, Sonneratia sp.), even in small quantities, helps in accurate identification of the local vegetation. Results indicate that while mangrove pollen is transported over short distances, non-mangrove pollen and spores are transported from longer distances. Thus, the status of mangrove and non-mangrove pollen in the sediments provides a clue to the (palaeo)coastal ecology and the (palaeo)climatic conditions.

AB  - Knowledge on trade-offs and synergies among ecosystem services is crucial for the design of land use strategies that optimize ecosystem service delivery. Correlation coefficients, obtained through pairwise comparison of ecosystem service provision maps, have been put forward as suitable indicators to quantify these interactions. However, for more in depth analyses of trade-offs and synergies where driving forces of interactions need to be determined, more sophisticated methods are needed. Although Bayesian belief networks have been frequently mentioned as promising tools to investigate interactions among ecosystem services, up till now, no structured approaches to do so have been suggested. This paper presents a way to analyse trade-offs and synergies among ecosystem services together with their driving forces. Joint probability distributions of ecosystem service pairs, which can be calculated by using Bayesian belief network models, are used to quantify interactions. The paper demonstrates the approach by quantifying trade-offs and synergies among several ecosystem services in Flanders, Belgium. Our analysis identifies two bundles of ecosystem services which react synergistically. Wood production and several regulating services on the one hand and food production and soil formation on the other hand. Trade-offs are identified among food production and most of the other services that were included into the analysis. In addition to these general findings, the analysis shows that the identified interactions may change depending on the considered environmental conditions, specified through soil type, land cover and land use.

AB  - Hypoxia and ocean acidification are two consequences of anthropogenic activities. These global trends occur on top of natural variability. In environments such as estuarine areas, short-term acute pH and 02 fluctuations are occurring simultaneously. The present study tested the combined effects of short-term seawater acidification and hypoxia on the physiology and energy budget of the thick shell mussel Mytilus coruscus. Mussels were exposed for 72 h to six combined treatments with three pH levels (8.1, 7.7 and 7.3) and two dissolved oxygen (DO) levels (2 mg L-1, 6 mg L-1). Clearance rate (CR), food absorption efficiency (AE), respiration rate (RR), ammonium excretion rate (ER), O:N ratio and scope for growth (SFG) were significantly reduced, and faecal organic dry weight ratio (E) was significantly increased at low DO. Low pH did not lead to a reduced SFG. Interactive effects of pH and DO were observed for CR, E and RR. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed positive relationships among most physiological indicators, especially between SFG and CR under normal DO conditions. These results demonstrate that Mytilus coruscus was sensitive to short-term (72 h) exposure to decreased O-2 especially if combined with decreased pH levels. In conclusion, the short-term oxygen and pH variation significantly induced physiological changes of mussels with some interactive effects . (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Overgrazing is considered one of the key disturbance factors that results in alpine grassland degradation in Tibet. Grazing exclusion by fencing has been widely used as an approach to restore degraded grasslands in Tibet since 2004. Is the grazing exclusion management strategy effective for the vegetation restoration of degraded alpine grasslands? Three alpine grassland types were selected in Tibet to investigate the effect of grazing exclusion on plant community structure and biomass. Our results showed that species biodiversity indicators, including the Pielou evenness index, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, and the Simpson dominance index, did not significantly change under grazing exclusion conditions. In contrast, the total vegetation cover, the mean vegetation height of the community, and the aboveground biomass were significantly higher in the grazing exclusion grasslands than in the free grazed grasslands. These results indicated that grazing exclusion is an effective measure for maintaining community stability and improving aboveground vegetation growth in alpine grasslands. However, the statistical analysis showed that the growing season precipitation (GSP) plays a more important role than grazing exclusion in which influence on vegetation in alpine grasslands. In addition, because the results of the present study come from short term(6-8 years) grazing exclusion, it is still uncertain whether these improvements will be continuable if grazing exclusion is continuously implemented. Therefore, the assessments of the ecological effects of the grazing exclusion management strategy on degraded alpine grasslands in Tibet still need long term continued research.
